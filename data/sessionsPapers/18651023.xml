I am in the employment of the Citizen Steam Boat Company, as assistant money-taker at the Old Shades Pier—I was there on Tuesday, 22d August—it was my duty to keep the gangway clear—about 1 o'clock on that day, the prisoner came there with a basket of walnuts—I did not know him before he—put his basket down underneath the window where the people pay—it was a basket with a pile of walnuts on the top of it—I asked him to move the basket, and he would not, and told me to mind my own business—I said if he did not move it I should have to move it myself, because it caused an obstruction—he did not move it, and I put my foot against the bottom of it, and pushed it on one side, and some of the nuts fell off—the prisoner directly flew at me and said, "Pay me for my nuts"—I said I had nothing to do with them, and told him to take them away, and not cause an obstruction—he then struck me in the mouth, caught me by the collar, threw me, and fell on me—I fell on the ground on my left side—we had a little bit of a struggle, and I got away from him and got up—he then attacked me again a second time, and threw me again, and when I was on the ground, he laid hold of me by the collar and knocked my head on the ground five times, I think—he dashed my head on the flag-stones—I got up, and went to try and find a policeman, but could not find one, and living close by in Miles-lane, I ran home—my mouth was bleeding from the effects of the blow—I went to bed, and the next morning Mr. Humphreys, the doctor, saw me—I have been confined to the house a very long time—two or three days afterwards, the Lord Mayor came and took my deposition—on the Thursday the prisoner came to see me—I was then very ill—a constable was sent for, and he was given into custody—he said he was very sorry about it, and he was going to give his name and address.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at 9, Trinity-square, Tower-hill—on Wednesday, 23rd August, I went to see Pearce—I found him in bed—he was seriously ill with apoplexy, almost insensible, in fact it was with great difficulty I could make him comprehend anything at all—it was very difficult to rouse him—the left arm and side of the face and the left foot and leg were quite paralysed—this state of things went on for several days—there was no external injury of any importance on his mouth—the paralysis that I saw could have been produced by violence or struggling—the injury was to the brain—I thought he was in great danger at the time—I had no idea of his recovery—it was two or three weeks before he could go out—he is paralysed, and permanently, I am afraid—I don't sup<lb/>pose he will ever use that arm or leg again—he was so ill that I got the Lord Mayor to come down and take his deposition—that was some three or four days after this—I knew Pearce before—he has had epileptic fits for many years past—I have been in the habit of seeing him—he used to come up to my surgery frequently—this was not the result of any epileptic fit—he had not had one for eight months.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Would the epilepsy predispose him to anything of this sort? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It marks a weak brain, of course—I think it would have more effect than on a perfectly sound constitution—it is a matter of conjec<lb/>ture—this was not from any injury to the spine—that would not affect the muscles of the face, and they were paralysed as well as the extremities—the brain is the part injured; the injury originated in the brain—if a man's spine is crushed it would not paralyse his face—I think it was from the knock on the head and not from the doubling of the spine.</p>

I sell newspapers at this pier—I saw the prisoner on this day opposite me selling walnuts, and Mr. Pearce went up to him and said, "Come, I cannot have this," and the prisoner then stooped and collected his walnuts together, and Mr. Pearce said, "If you don't move I will very soon move, them for you," and he then kicked his walnuts over—Isaacs said, "What did you do that for?" and Pearce said, "I will serve you the same if you don't look out"—I then saw them both struggling together—Mr. Pearce then caught hold of Isaacs and put his legs round Isaacs' legs—they struggled some time, and then I saw them fall both together—I ran up to Isaacs and said, "Oh, pray, young man, let the poor man go, he suffers with fits"—Isaacs said, "I will let him go, I have not got hold of him"—I pushed Isaacs' head on one side, and then saw Pearce's hand plunged into Isaacs' neck—I said to Pearce, "Oh, you foolish man, get up, you are a great sufferer, get up"—they then both got up together—Pearce followed Isaacs up the Shades—I saw Isaacs' hand on Pearce's neck, and he knocked Isaacs' head on the ground—I think Pearce was uppermost—Isaacs' coat was torn—one appeared to me to be as bad as the other.</p>

               <p>every night—amongst other duties he had to take cash from the cash box for the purpose of purchasing stamps, and to enter the amount so taken in the cash-book—there is a book called the cashier's postage-book—this is it—it is kept by the cashier—he should debit himself in this book with the amount expended on postage stamps, and credit himself with the amount of stamps given out to the different clerks—each person receiving stamps would initial the entry representing the value of the stamps given out to him—this book is in Utton's writing—he was a clerk in my department—he has written this to assist the cashier—it was Utton's duty to keep the private ledger, which is made up principally from the cash-book—the entries there representing cash entries should generally represent the cash-book—on 16th January, there is an entry in the cash-book of "Foreign postage stamps, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>"—that is Spooner's writing—in the cashier's postage book of the same date the entry is, "Stamps, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." in Utton's writing—from the fact of only 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. being found in that book Spooner would not be called upon to account for the difference between the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he would only have to account for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in the private ledger of the same date the entry is, "Postage stamps, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—the private ledger contains an account of the expenditure of the establishment—it represents the whole trade dealings, and amongst other things the postage account—there has been an erasure in the pounds' column in that entry—the private ledger ought to correspond with the cash-book; there should have been an entry there of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that book is called over about once a week against the cash-book—I call over the cash-book, and Utton would take the private ledger—I do not look to see that the entries correspond, I only call out the amount—there is a tick at the side of the entry—I have no doubt—that is Utton's tick—my tick is in the cash-book—on 26th January I find an entry made by Spooner of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for stamps—there is no item entered in the cashier's postage-book—in the absence of any entry Spooner would not be called upon to account for that 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is not entered in his book; it is not entered at all in the private ledger—I called over that entry from the cash-book to Utton; there is my tick against it—in the cash-book, folio 486, I find a reference in the hand-writing of Utton to folio 490—that would indicate that this item of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been posted and ticked—I am referring to the cash-book now; it stands 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the cash-book—Utton does not write in the cash-book—the entry is posted by Utton, but the cash is credited by the cashier—the folio 490 is in Utton's handwriting—that would indicate that the item had been posted into the private ledger; that is where it ought to have been—on February 15th, folio 591, the entry is, "Postage stamps, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—there is no entry whatever in the cashier's postage-book—in the private ledger there, is, "Stamps, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—there is no erasure—that must have been an absolutely incorrect entry from the commencement.</p>

Was Utton in your department? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was—he was in the service eighteen months or two years—my duty was to superintend the business of the house generally, and to see that the books were properly kept—Utton kept the private ledger; several other persons wrote in it, not so many as five or six; a clerk named Hawkins wrote in it—I think Sell in wrote in it sometimes—I do not think Rowton did—Hodges and Hyde wrote in it—I have not said it was Utton'8 duty to keep the cashier's postage-book—the cashier was supposed to have kept that himself—Utton alone assisted him—no other person assisted him—there is no writing of any other person besides Utton on the debit side of the book—every person that takes stamps has to give his initials—Spooner kept the book locked up in his own desk—I could not tell how many books Utton kept; he had a great many to keep—he had other duties to perform besides—he used sometimes to act as secretary to Mr. Holloway, to go up to write letters for him—the column in which the erasure occurs is added up—the addition has been subsequent to the erasure—we make out a half-yearly balance sheet—the half-yearly balance sheet for June is not completed; it is in course of preparation—I believe the firm has em<lb/>ployed a professional accountant for the purpose of going through the books—I generally manage to get the checking of the cash-book done, so that it was all completed once a week—it did not frequently happen that the cash<lb/>book was not checked for five or six weeks—there might be an odd entry or two unchecked, but I made it a rule to get it all checked up—one of the Mr. Holloways is generally superintending the business—he used to have the cash-book up every day to look at.</p>

                  </hi>. I assist my brother in managing the establishment in the Strand—from some information that was given to me, I sent for the prisoners Spooner and Utton into my private room; at that time another of my clerks, Sellin, was in the room—he had been there previously, and made some communication to me—I requested Spooner to come up stairs with the cash-book and other books—he came into the room, and I said, "Spooner, you have been robbing the house to some very great extent"—after some hesitation he said, "I have been robbing the house, but I am not the only one"—before he said that I had said nothing more than I have stated—he then turned on his heel and said, "Sellin, you have been robbing the house as well as I have"—I then said to Sellin, "To what amount have you been robbing the house"—he said, "Oh; about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Spooner further said, "But there are more below in it yet"—I said, "Who else?"—he said, "Utton"—Utton was not present at that time—I went below and called Utton up stairs, and said to him, "The cashier accuses you of having robbed the house"—he said, "I have done so, but not to a greater extent than from 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I then locked the door, went for an officer, and gave them in custody.</p>

               <p>two prisoners and Sellin on the day they were given in custody; they were all together at the time—I think it was about 11 o'clock in the day—I said to Utton, "Utton, how is it that you have been robbing the house? I am very much surprised to hear this; how is it possible that you could have got hold of cash?"—he said, "Yes, I have robbed the firm"—I said, "How could you get hold of the cash?"—he said, "Well, it was not in cash"—I said, "How was it then?"—he said, "Well, it was by cheque"—I said to Spooner, "I am surprised to hear that you have been committing robberies"—he said unfortunately that was the case, but he was not the only one.</p>

Holloway of this conversation, or else I should have been called, I presume—I don't know why I did not tell them;—I did not wish to mix myself up with it at all—I believe Marshall is not here.</p>

               <p>while doing so the prisoner came and pressed against me as close as he could, on the right hand side, and I felt a jerk against my waistcoat pocket—I had my watch suspended by a chain—I looked down the moment I felt the jerk, and found my watch gone, and looked across the road and saw the prisoner running as hard as he could—I followed him, and called "Stop thief!" several times—I followed him out of Aldersgate-street into Carthusian-street, as fast as I could; I am not a very great runner—an officer saw him running and pursued—he was stopped in Charterhouse-lane—a boy picked up my watch and gave it to the officer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were there other people looking on at this fight besides you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—no one came near me but the prisoner—there was no pushing at all; some of the people might have passed me, but the watch was gone then—the moment I felt it gone I looked across the road, and saw the prisoner running.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stationer, at Britannia-place, Islington—on Saturday afternoon, about twenty minutes to 4 o'clock I was in Long-lane, and saw the prisoner come round the corner of Charterhouse-square, coming up Charterhouse-street, as I was going down from the corner—as he was running I saw something go out of his hand—it was a watch—I stopped the prisoner—a lad picked up the watch, and put it into my hands—an officer came up in a moment or so, and the prosecutor afterwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see the watch fall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it was thrown not three-quarters of a yard or a yard from the prisoner's hand—he had just stepped on the kerb as he threw it against the wall—there were no other people running at the same time; not for half a dozen yards behind him; he had got ahead of them all; they had not turned the corner—when I stopped the prisoner he said, "It is all right; let me go, it is nothing."</p>

Charles Batt to take charge of, and gave Mr. Batt 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for its maintenance—my brother had bequeathed that sum to me by will for the maintenance of his children—the child's parents were Roman Catholics—I saw the child twice after it had been sent to the prisoners in Lower George-street, Chelsea—it was then just the same as when I fetched it from the workhouse—I saw it once in Hanover-street, it was then in just the same condition—I remember the prisoners removing into Sutherland-street—I saw the child twice there, the last time was nearly two months ago—I did not notice anything extraordinary about it then; nothing to complain of—it was never subject to fits to my knowledge—it was not an idiot, it had the usual intelligence, I should think, for a child of its age.</p>

               <p>account strictly—the earliest recollection I have is November, 1863—I knew the prisoners at that time, living in Lower George-street, Chelsea, and in the beginning of November I spoke to Mrs. Roach with regard to taking care of this child, and arranged to pay her 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a month for doing so—my first payment to her was 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 3d November, 1863, and I have paid her 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at the beginning of every mouth up to the time she was taken in cus<lb/>tody—I once or twice paid her two months at a time in advance, as she gave me some reason which I now forget—I saw the child at George-street from time to time—it seemed to be properly treated as far as I could judge—I do not remember their removing to Hanover-street—I understood from her that she removed from George-street, to Battersea—my visits then ceased, as it was very inconvenient, and I felt confident she would take care of the child—I did not see it in Sutherland-street, but from time to time it was brought to see me—it was brought to me in the spring of this year—I never saw Mr. Roach about the matter, but I met him once or twice at the house in Lower George-street; he has been in the room when I have con<lb/>versed with his wife about the child, and may have heard the conversation—I believe the prisoners to be man and wife—in December, 1863, I gave Mrs. Roach 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. extra for flannel for the child—I suppose she represented it to be in delicate health—on 28th September, after it was taken to the work-house, I saw her and told her I was grieved to hear that the child had been neglected—she denied it, and showed me some ointment which she said she used for its sores—it was very delicate when it was placed with her; it seemed to be quite an ungrown child when it came out of the workhouse, and there were sores on its head—it appeared to get better under her care at first.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the male prisoner's sister—this little child, Riley, is his wife's nephew—I have frequently been to Sutherland-street—I also saw the child when it was at Chelsea—it was then very delicate, and it was about the same at Sutherland-street—I do not think its health altered at all afterwards—my brother used to come home to dinner at Sutherland-street, but only for twenty minutes or half-an-hour—the children were generally in bed when he came home in the evening, and when he went out in the morning—little Riley had his meals with the other children when I was there, and had the same food as they did—his health was always very delicate—I resided there two months previous to this charge, being out of a situation—I went out to work in the day for about three weeks before the child was taken away; before that, I was always in the house—the kitchen was cleaned once or twice a week, in which I assisted—I gave the child a bath on the Saturday week before the charge was made against my brother—I came home one evening, Mrs. Roach was very ill, and the child had had his hair cut—she told me that she had cut its hair and put ointment on it, and I saw the ointment on the table—the family had bread and butter for breakfast, and meat and vegetables for dinner—the child had shoes and stockings, I put them on myself—my sister was ill with erysipelas in her face about the latter end of August, and again at the beginning of Sep<lb/>tember—she went to the hospital about it—she is humane—I never saw her ill-use the child, and my brother has always been very kind to it—he bean a good character for humanity.</p>

I live at 11, George-street—I have known the defendants about twelve years—they bear a very good character for humanity and kind-heartedness—Mrs. Roach was ill in May; I visited her then, and this child was treated as one of her own—I saw it previous to its mother's death, and it was in a very sickly condition; it was much the same in May—Mrs. Roach had erysipelas again in August—I visited her, and the child was in bed—she had a third relapse in September, but I did not visit her, as I resided come distance from them.</p>

On Saturday morning, 7th October, about 1 o'clock, my attention was called to 9, Victoria-road, by a cry of "Fire"—I went there, and saw the last witness standing at the door in her night-dress—I sprang my rattle, and another policeman came—I sent for the fire engines, then knocked at the house door, which was closed, and the prisoner opened it—I went up-stairs to the second floor, and saw fire on the landing ascending to the ceiling—it was close to Mr. Morris's bed-room door—I looked into the kitchen, and could see fire ascending from the floor to the cupboard—I should say that one fire was ten feet from the other-a man was there calling for water—he was there before I came—by means of water the fire in the kitchen cupboard was put out—it required about 100 pails to do it—I did not see the fire on the landing put out—I saw the door of the master's bed-room tried, it would not open till we kicked it open—the fire against the door was put out at that time.</p>

               <p>the prisoner said, "On the landing"—I found it was on the landing, from I the bottom of the door to the ceiling—I ran down for some water, and the prisoner drew me part of a pail of water from the tap, and somebody else handed me another—after I had put one fire out, I found the cupboard in the kitchen in full flame, and the flames issuing out so sharp that they broke three or four squares, and rushed out at the window—I tried the door of Mr. Morris's bedroom, it was locked, and I burst it open—that is the door that leads on to the landing—I cannot say whether it was burnt on both sides—I had a very bad light when the fire went out, and I was very fatigued, and obliged to lie down—I saw the police pick up a match and some papers.</p>

On 7th October, about 2 o'clock in the morning, I went to 9, Victoria-road, to the top floor, and on the lauding, in a corner, between the bedroom-door and the front sitting-room I found a quantity of paper-ashes—the landing was wet, and a corner of it was charred from burning—Mr. Morris's door was very much burnt—I had a lantern with me, and saw on the landing a heap of light paper-ashes, which! I brushed away with my hand, and underneath I found a quantity of burnt paper journals, All the Year Round, and other journals, partly burnt; part of a <hi rend="italic">Domestic Magazine</hi>, and part of the <hi rend="italic">Illustrated London News</hi>—I was in company with a fireman, and there were several people in the house—I handed the pieces of paper to Inspector Barber—one panel of Mr. Morris's door was burnt through, and the door was very much burnt, principally on the outside—I went from there into the kitchen, and there I found a cup board which had been very much burned, more inside than out—I also found a few pieces of paper there, of the same description—they smelt very strong of paraffin oil in both places—I went into the servant's bedroom, put my hand under the clothes, and found that the bed was warm—her petticoats were on a chair at the foot of the bed—I saw the prisoner in the passage, and said, "Are you the landlord of the house?"—he said, "No, I rent the house"—I said, "Where do you sleep?"—he said, "I sleep here," showing me into a front room, down-stairs—I found an impression on the bed, and turned the things back, but it felt quite cold—the. prisoner was present, and I said, "The servant's bed is quite warm, and yours is quite cold; how do you account for that?"—he said, "I suppose it is because the fire was nearer to it"—I did not feel quite satisfied, left the house, and went to the station—at 9 o'clock I went back, and made a thorough examination with Inspector Barber—I again examined the cupboard in the kitchen, and under it I found a quantity more of the same journal, All the Year Round, the thickness of five or six numbers, saturated with what I believe was paraffin—the cupboard was about an inch from the boards—these burnt papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were found on the landing and under the cupboard in the kitchen—I also found some pieces of what looked like a</p>

               <p>curtain, and also some of the same on the landing—they all smelt alike—we fully searched the upper part of the house, but found nothing—we went down stairs, and the inspector called my attention to some paper which he found—I found a can in the back-kitchen, down-stairs, which smelt a little of paraffin, but not very strongly—the inspector called my attention to two bottles, which he found in the coal-cellar—I put my nose to them, and they smelt of paraffin—there was a tablespoon full in each bottle—the prisoner was not taken in custody—he said, "Well, you do me a great wrong, I have not been up-stairs for these six weeks."</p>

I manage the business of my brother, Thomas Holloway, a medicine vendor, in the Strand—I used to give Utton cheques to send to the parties whose names were on them—it was his duty to send them off—these three cheques (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were signed by me, and handed to Utton—two are made payable to the Messrs. Brooks, and one to John Swainson—two are crossed "London and Westminster," and one "and co"—In consequence of information given to me, I called on the prisoner Locke—he is a licensed victualler, and keeps the Holyrood Palace, within ten or a dozen doors of our place—I told him I had been given to under stand he had been receiving from Utton a quantity of our cheques, which he had stolen—he said that he had received from Utton a quantity of cheques, that he did not know whether they were stolen or not, and that that was no business of his—I asked him if he had made any inquiry as to where Utton had got them from—he said no, that did not concern him, and he produced a memorandum-book, from which he tore this leaf (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he gave me this, and I put it in my pocket—it is a list of goods he had supplied to Utton the same afternoon Locke came into my place and asked to see the cheques, and a quantity were produced—I asked him who his banker was—he said, "The London and West-minster Bank, Temple Bar branch"—I requested him to go to that bank with me, which he did—I saw the manager, and asked him if these cheques had been handed to him by Locke—foe said that was a question be could not answer then, but he would refer to his books and see—I left the cheques with him—when Locke came to me in the afternoon I handed fourteen cheques to him, and after examining them, he said he had received twelve of them from Utton, but the other two he had doubts about—before handing him the cheques, he said he could not tell exactly how many he had taken, but he presumed from twelve to twenty, and that they amounted to from 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the cheques were all made payable to persons to whom the firm was indebted—each cheque was brought to me in the ordinary course of business by Utton to be signed, and they were then handed back to him—Mr. Hutchings was present during the conversation with Locke, and he accompanied us to the bank—I told Locke, Utton was a clerk, receiving five shillings a day, and was paid daily, and I said, "I pre<lb/>sume you know that"—he said it was no business of his, he did not know how the cheques came into Utton's possession, as they were presented, so he took them.</p>

               <p>I did not know to whom he was alluding, because there were several persons playing—Locke never charged me with cheating him, and ordered me out of his house and not to come in it again—I sold him some champagne, and I bad to apply to Bow-street to get it back again—I think I got the wine back two or three months after the transaction took place—this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in my handwriting—it is dated the 29th of March—I was in his house four of five days after that—I have been there three or four times since—as far as I recollect the wine came back two or three months after that date—I will not swear it did not come back within a month, but I will within a fortnight—I was kicked at, and turned out of his house—it was after I had been to Bow-street Police-court about this wine—I applied to Mr. Flowers, who sent an officer with me, and Locke then said that he had paid me for the wine, and produced a man that said he saw the money paid—that was one of the reasons no doubt that I went and gave evidence against him—I am a dealer in wine and brandy warrants—I was bankrupt, I think, in May, 1864—I have been a traveller, and have kept livery stables at Kingston.</p>

Lay, and I want the money to pay him"—he said, "Well, my boy, I have not got it; I will show you my bank-book; I have not got a pound in the bank"—I told him I had not got sufficient to pay the cabman—he said, "Well, I will let you have a sovereign if that is any good to you," which I took—I left a receipt with him—that is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but I only had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I applied at Bow-street Police-court a day or two after the date of this receipt—I had in the meantime applied to him for the money—ultimately I got the wine back, less a dozen bottles—Locke, never preferred any criminal charge against me.</p>

I am servant to Mr. Cocke, of Tredegar-square—on the evening of the 14th of September, about half-past 9 o'clock, I heard our little dog bark, and I went out in to the area to see who was there—I saw Cooper standing on the steps—I asked him what be wanted—he called out, "Jack, Phil, Jack, they are coming"—a bundle was dropped from one of the windows, and Cooper picked it up and ran away—I went into the kitchen and got a light, and when I came back I saw Grant coming down the pillar of the portico—my master and mistress were in the dining-room, and I called out to them that thieves were in the house—I opened the door and ran after Grant—my mistress followed—I called out, "Thieves!" and "Police!" as loud as I could—my mistress never lost sight of him—he was stopped by a policeman—I saw Cooper again at my master's door the same evening, when Grant was brought back, and I said, "That is the man".</p>

I live at Tredegar-square, and am a brass founder—on the evening of the 14th of September, my house was broken into at 9 o'clock, and I lost a considerable amount of property—my servant told me tore were thieves in the house—my wife and servant ran out—I went to the door, and saw a man running round the square—I could not leave the house then as it was empty—a neighbour came and watched my door—the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon practising in London—I knew the deceased Mrs. Price—she came to the hospital on 16th November last year—I examined her on the 25th, and found she was suffering from cancer and fistula—she remained in the hospital for about a week, and eventually became an out patient for about three months—I described her disease to her as a disease of the rectum—on 22d March I visited her at the prisoner's request—he called on me—I prescribed for her then—about 16th July he called on me and I saw her again—she was then suffering very severely from seven different sinuses—she had become very much worse—through those sinuses feculent matter escaped; the cancer entirely prevented any escape through the natural passage, so that everything came through the sinuses, and also through the front part—she was very weak and suffering intensely—a nurse was attending her at the time—I prescribed for her tonics and sedatives, and from what passed between as (not in the prisoner's presence) I gave her money to buy medicine and wine—I said that she required rest and proper nourishing food—I did not give those directions to the prisoner—I never saw him after he called at my house till I saw him at his own house in the afternoon, and then he went down stairs directly, and I never saw him afterwards—he seemed to be half tipsy then—I continued to attend her till 5th August, when I went to the North—that was my last visit—she was then sinking, suffering intense pain—I suggested a surgical operation to her, and she said she did not wish to live another day—she gave no reason for that—she did not connect that wish with any cause that I remember—she was suffering intensely—I never saw a worse case of fistula and cancer combined—rest was most essential in her case—it could not have restored her; it was very necessary for her; it would be one of the means of prolonging life—nourishing food was highly necessary, and stimulants—the fact of her rest being frequently interrupted would have a tendency to cause her to die sooner than she otherwise might have done—I speak positively to that, in her condition—I say the same with regard to her being deprived of nourishing food and stimulants.</p>

               <p>not expect she would live—she was very low—she was not dying then, she was sinking—I could not, on 5th August, form a notion as to the length of time she would live—she had no symptoms of immediate dissolution; she was sinking; I mean getting weaker and weaker—there were no symptom of sinking rapidly—as far as I can remember, I should have expected she would live about a fortnight or three weeks from 5th August—she died on the 22d—that would be between a fortnight and three weeks—I think she would have died in a fortnight or three weeks if she bad been treated as well as she could have been—if I had heard nothing of any treatment I should not have been surprised to hear of her death on 20th August—the disease was quite sufficient to account for death at that time—if she had had proper treatment, rest, and nourishment after 5th August, she would have lived longer; I have no doubt about that; I mean a proper amount of nourishment—she ought to have had, possibly, six or eight glasses of wine a day—if she had been in the hospital I should have ordered that—she ought to have had nourishing food of every kind, anything she could have taken—I should have given her brandy also—I think then she would certainly have lived longer; I am not repaired to say how much longer; longer than a couple of days, I should think—I believe her life might have been prolonged for a week if she had bad nourishing food after 5th August, but if she had had it for some time before, it might have been prolonged for some months—she complained of very great pain—she described it as if a burning coal was under her flesh, that she could get no rest, she was in perfect agony—it must have been so, and there was no escape from it, except by a very severe operation, which I suggested—the cancer alone would not have caused that amount of pain; it was its combination with the other—the prisoner came to my house once in March and once in July—he appeared anxious about his wife, and requested me to come and see her—the second time he said she was much worse—he seemed to be very anxious about her—she might have remained in the hospital when I examined her in November, but she wished to go back to her children—if the prisoner had brought her back in July, she might have been taken in, and provided for there.</p>

I attended the prisoner's wife as nurse for six weeks, up to three weeks before her death—she was in a very sickly state during that time—she had not enough to eat at all times—Dr. Gowland called there once, and Mr. and Mrs. Turner—wine was left with her—she did not always get it; the prisoner would take it from her—I have seen him come in and drink it out of the bottle—I have spoken to him about it, and told him he ought not to drink it, as it was brought for his wife—I do not know that he made me any answer—I think he did that more than once—he was generally sober when he did so—there had been mutton chops left for Mrs. Price, and a little ham had been brought occasionally by Mrs. Turner, her brother's wife, and I think a little salmon was brought once—she ate the chops and ham—she always got the food that was left—there was not very much for her, but what was left for her she generally had—I have often asked the prisoner for money to get oysters, as Mrs. Price was obliged to take them, and very often when he has had it he has refused it to her—he used to say 'he wanted it for something else—he sometimes gave it me—she was ordered bitter ale, and I have repeatedly asked him for money for that, and he has not given it to me—he has often had beer and ale himself in her room—he has sent to the public-house for it, and drank it all himself—i have asked him for something for dinner, and he has said he had not got it—she had her dinner, if I provided it for her—it was provided by somebody, and he would pay me again—she has repeatedly been obliged to go without dinner;—there was none in the house, and no money to get it—I have asked him for money at these times—sometimes he might be in drink—she was very often obliged to go to bed without supper, and had nothing to eat—I have spoken to him about that, and I have many times told him she was sinking for want of something, and he has said she was always in want; it was more than he thought was necessary for her to take—one week he gave his wife 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to support us both for a week—I cannot say when that was—it was during the six weeks I was there—she was very often without dinner—that made her still more exhausted and sinking—in her weak state she wanted something every half-hour, and could not get it—on one occasion he took out a five shilling-piece, and asked her if she would like to have it—she said she would, and he said he would see her—first—that was during the six weeks, I could not say to the day—I believe she wanted the money to get some dinner—she was in bed at the time—she went without dinner that time—she did not sleep well at nights—sometimes she would go to sleep a little in the day—she was very much disturbed in her sleep—the prisoner would often come in and wake her up when she was taking a little rest, and I used to beg him to let her be quiet, and he would not—he would come in and talk to her and make a noise in the room that would disturb any one that was ill—he would talk about some</p>

I live at 12, Blundell-street, Islington—I went to nurse Mrs. Price when Mrs. Jacques left, about three weeks before her death—during that time she was in a very weak state; very low—the prisoner's conduct to her was very bad—he used to ask her how long she was going to live; that he should like to see her soul in hell flames—he was not always sober at those times, bat he was not always intoxicated—he was not the worse for drink when he used that language; not always—he used to pull her eyes open several times, when she was going off to sleep, and he used to take away the food provided for her—I have seen him take away fish, broth, and nourishment, and wine and brandy, that used to be sent, and that I used to get for her—he used to pour the brandy out into a tumbler and drink it, and tell me to go to hell and get more where I could—About a week before her death the doctor ordered her some boiled milk—I told him of it, and he told me to go to hell and get the money there—I believe he had got money at that time—the doctor ordered milk and wine and hot baths—I asked for the money for the milk and wine, and then he told me that—I know he had got money, for he sent for beer at the time, which he drank to excess—I have heard Mrs. Price complain to him several times about the food—she used to ask him for money to get food for the children and me—he said he should not give it to her; she might get up and dress herself, and go out and get it where she could—on those occasions I have heard the sound of money, so to be able to tell that he had it—when he has come to her bed and opened her eyes, she has told him to go away out of her sight, that she did not want to see him any more—they did not quarrel, she was not able; she was too weak to quarrel, but he used to call her some filthy names—about three days before her death he turned the clothes off her feet, and said, "Your feet are dead, and you are dying upwards, that is the reason you are so long dying"—that was said unkindly—he was sober then; he might have had a little to drink, but he knew what he was saying—he once stood by her bedside and said he had measured her grave, and asked her how many minutes she was going to live—I think that was three or four days before her death—he used to stand at the foot of the bedstead, and knock it as hard as he could, to shake her—that happened more than once—he used to do it when she was awake, and when she was asleep he used to do it to wake her up.</p>

I was called in on the 21st August—the deceased died about 24 hours afterwards—I found her in a dying state—I was made acquainted with the disease from what she was suffering—I pre<lb/>scribed some remedies for her—I made a post mortem examination on the morning of the 22d—in my judgment the cause of death was exhaustion caused by disease—I have heard the evidence that has been given—in my opinion she died from exhaustion arising from natural causes; but I believe from the evidence that her death was accelerated by the inhuman treatment she was subject to, the disturbing of her rest, and keeping away food and stimulants—I think if she had had rest and sufficient food, she would not have died so soon—I think the disturbance of her rest that she was subject to, would alone accelerate her death; even supposing she had sufficient food, the disturbance of her peace of mind from want of rest was calculated to accelerate death—whether it did so is a matter of theory.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to George Maddock, of 162, Fleet-street, the proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">Illustrated Builders' Journal</hi>—the prisoner had been in his employ about six months, as canvasser for advertisements for that journal and for the <hi rend="italic">English Mechanic</hi>—since 8th July I have paid him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent on the amount of orders he brought in—he was supplied with printed forms to solicit orders—the form, No. 1, is part of one of our forms—I had paid him every Saturday, but previous to 8th July he received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent commission, and 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week salary—he received his 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent, on this order—on 21st June, he brought me this order for 13 insertions in the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>—it is signed, "George Mitchell, 166, Brompton-road"—at the end of the week I paid him his per centage upon that, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and his salary, amounting altogether to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I believed that it was a true bond fide order from Mr. Mitchell, and inserted the advertisements in the paper—the pri<lb/>soner brought me on 14th September another request for 13 advertise<lb/>ments, at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a head, signed, "James Maybank"—I paid the prisoner 20 per cent. on that on the new arrangement of 8th July—I parted with the money on the belief that the order was genuine, and inserted part of the advertisements.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know anything of the custom of the canvassing trade? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have received a quantity of similar orders from the prisoner since these, but do not know about any before—there was nothing that struck me as peculiar about this order—I have never known canvassers" fill up the orders themselves—I have canvassed for advertisements occasionally—if I find the master of the shop engaged I call again—I should take a form—if I found him busily engaged with a customer, and he raid, "You may insert my advertisement 13 times," I might fill in the number, but I should not sign the name and address—this purports to be the autograph of the man ordering the advertisement—it is not allowable for that to be filled up by the canvasser himself—I should never have called this in question if the advertisements had been paid for—advertise<lb/>ments have been paid for when a man has given a verbal order, but it is not usual—canvassers are very assiduous, but I do not think they would take half an answer for a whole one—I believe this "George Mitchell" to be in the prisoner's writing—I have seen him write.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I am a carman in the employ of the Sooth Eastern Railway, at the Bricklayers' Arms Station—on 15th September, about 7 in the evening, I was loading a van in Miles-lane with butter and bacon, and I saw one of the firkins of butter roll into the place of another which was being pulled off—it was just inside the van—I looked over the rail of the van, and saw the prisoner with a firkin on his head, holding it with both hands—I asked him what he wanted, and jumped out at the tail of the van, and caught hold of him, and then he put the firkin back again, and said, "All right, mate; I was only moving a guide-chain"—there was no guide-chain there—when he put the firkin back, the one I saw move went back into its place again—I told the prisoner I should lock him up, and he slipped his coat off, and got into Thames-street—I ran and got hold of him again, and whilst we were struggling, two men came up and struck me on the side of the head—I held the prisoner till a policeman came, and then gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a master builder, in Shoe-lane, Fleet-street—in the latter end of August and the beginning of September, I was preparing to build some houses in a field at Forest-hill—a Mr. Brassington was also carrying on some work there—the prisoner was in his employ—he was burning ballast—on my premises I had two carts, a tumbril and a spring cart—the tumbril was a old cart, and I empowered Mr. Brassington to sell it for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the other was a good spring cart, worth about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had a conversation with Mr. Brassington about the sale of the tumbril cart, early in August—the prisoner and another man were present—not a word was said about the sale of the spring cart—I passed there shortly afterwards, and the prisoner accosted me, and said, "Is it true the old cart is for sale?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I will soon find you a customer for it"—I said, "Oh, very well, but the matter is in Mr. Brassington's hands, and I will have nothing to do with you"—I had never seen him before—that was all that took place—I went there on 5th September, the tumbril was then gone, and the spring cart had been drawn out from its place—the prisoner was not</p>

               <p>there then—on 8th September, I heard something, and on the 11th I went to the premises, and found that ray spring cart was gone—I had authorised no one to dispose of it—on 19th September, the prisoner came to my place in Shoe-lane, and said, "I have come to see if I can make up the matter about the cart"—I said I could not say anything about the cart, but I had never given him or any other man authority to sell the cart, and I must have it back, and if not, I should give him into custody—he said he supposed be had made a mistake; if I would overlook the affair, he would endeavour to pay so much a week to get it back—I declined, and sent for a policeman—he never told me he had received a cheque—I saw my cart on the 11th, the day I missed it, at Mr. Clayton's at Forest-hill, near the station.</p>

I know the Nine Elms station and the West India Docks—in the ordinary course of things the prisoner would go through the Mackworth gate to get there—if he were to avoid that gate he would have to go from Tower-hill along Upper East Smithfield, St. George-street, High-street Shadwell, Broad-street, Queen-street, Narrow-street, Hemmit-street and Bridge-street—that would be about two miles extra—one mile each way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bell-hanger, and live at Breadth-court, Borough—between seven and eight o'clock last Saturday evening I was in Lant-street—the prisoner French spoke to me, and said, "Well, old boy"—I said, "I don't know that I have any knowledge of you"—he afterwards seized hold of my hand—I had 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my hand, and he tried to get the money out of my hand—while he was doing so the prisoner Hill came and put his hand round my neck—he was at the back of me—I called out "Thieves 1" as loud as I could, and two officers, who were just on the spot, seized them as I was sinking—I dropped 28., whether it was taken out of my hand or whether it dropped in the scuffle I cannot say—I lost a hat, a cap, and a. handkerchief and a piece of paper, a specification of a job that I was work<lb/>ing for—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I think it was in my waistcoat pocket.</p>
