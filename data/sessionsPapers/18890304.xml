I carry on business as Fred Watts and Co., merchant tailors, at Ludgate Hill, Edgware Road, and Tottenham Court Road—the prisoner has been in my service at Ludgate Hill for fifteen months—a considerable portion of my trade is in ready-made clothing, and a large stock is kept at Ludgate Hill—the prisoner was manager there, he had the sale of goods—if a customer came to purchase a ready-made suit the prisoner would show him the things, and after he had bought them it was his duty to make out a bill with a duplicate—it would be passed into the cash desk and filed—if a customer did not find a ready-made suit and ordered some to be made, the prisoner would make an entry of the order in the bespoke orders book of the class of cloth wanted and the price—this is the book—he would show patterns, and when a selection was made it would be his duty to purchase the length of material required from a wholesale house; he would receive the goods with an invoice, and would bring the cloth back to my establishment, to be made up and delivered to the customer—if a customer wanted a ready made article in a hurry and we had not got it, we should send to another house for it—the goods so obtained would be accompanied by an invoice—these five invoices (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi> were received by our house from the respective firms mentioned—these initials "D.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was represented by Mr. Rowney, a solicitor, at the Mansion House; and all through the proceedings—I don't think I had a consultation with him before giving the prisoner into custody, possibly I had—I have a relation of Mr. Rowney's in my service—there were three remands before the Alderman—during that time I went over my books—the prisoner was sent for trial on three charges of larceny—there was no accusation then of falsifying the accounts; not till after the Grand Jury had found true bills for the larcenies—the prisoner had seven or eight assistants at Ludgate Hill—there are five departments—he had to manage them all, and had the entire responsibility—there was a cutter there, but not since November last year—with the exception of a few weeks, there was a cutter there during the whole of 1888—I can't say whether it was during those few weeks that the prisoner is accused of stealing these goods—if there was no cutter, he would send to the Edgware Road or Tottenham Court Road to have the garment cut out—if it required to be altered it would be done at Tottenham Court Road; it would not necessarily be taken there by the prisoner; if he did take it in his bag I should not complain—any of the assistants at Ludgate Hill would serve ready-made garments; everything is marked in plain figures—the customer would pay the cashier—it would be the prisoner's duty to take the money from the customer after having initialed the sale ticket—a clerk would make up the book from the ticket on the file—if the amount of the money did not tally with the ticket, either the clerk or the prisoner possibly would report it at Tottenham Court Road—Bartram and Harvey would not send their statements to Ludgate Hill, but to the central office; the prisoner would have no opportunity of tampering with them there—I go to the various branches to check their statements by the invoices, which should have been filed—Bartram and Harvey never send their invoices to any other branch but Ludgate Hill—there are wholesale clothiers with whom we deal; they pursue the same system—the whole sale statements would be sent to Tottenham Court Road—to check them we should have the invoices sent there—we are charged by Bartram and Harvey with certain goods, of which there are no entries in the books—Cannon keeps the books at Ludgate Hill—he has been with us since November, 1887—it would not be the assistants' duty to make the entry in the book—the prisoner would have to depend on the information by the assistant—two or three out of the five assistants would take orders; they might all serve ready-made clothes—the first invoice is dated August 10th—the statement sent included August 10th—we could find no invoice of that date; we wrote for a copy, and they sent one about September 10th—I did not see the prisoner about it, or ask him for any explanation—since he has been in custody he has had access to all the books he wished to see.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the employ of the prosecutor at Ludgate Hill—on 19th December I saw a bag in the shop, which I knew to be the prisoner's—in his absence I opened the bag—I found in it a youth's top overcoat of the value of about 27s. 6d. and a juvenile suit value 28s. 6d.—I don't think there were any tickets on the articles—our goods are ticketed with the prices—the things in the bag were part of our stock—on 21st I found the bag was gone—the prisoner brought it back two and a half hours afterwards, and placed it in the shop beside me; I lifted it, and found it was empty—on 24th June the bag was still there; I opened it and found in it a blue melton overcoat of the value of 38s. 6d., the property of Mr. Watts, and part of the stock—on that even<lb/>ing</p>

               <p>I went out with the prisoner—he had the bag with him—I left him about a quarter to ten—on 1st January, 1889, I again watched the same bag, I opened it in his absence and found in it another overcoat, a new one, out of our stock—all these articles were ready-made, and kept on the premises—if they had been sold the prisoner ought to have made out a sale ticket, and that ought to have been passed to the cashier in charge—if the goods are sent out they would be entered in a parcel instruction ticket, which is entered in the day-book—I have searched, and can find no entry in the day-book or any parcel instruction ticket—the goods in the bag were placed loosely, not wrapped up—on 28th December I find no record in the books of an overcoat being required at Ludgate Hill—these are invoices of Bartram and Harvey and George Smith and Co.—there is no entry of the goods referred to in those invoices having been delivered; there is no legitimate order for them, nor did I find any entry in any of the books referring to the articles charged in these invoices.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). About 7.30 a.m., on 1st February, I was in company with Detective Chew in an office on the second floor of 28, Love Lane, the prosecutor's office—I heard somebody come up the stairs, go on the roof and move the skylight, and I saw Spill then drop down into the warehouse—I saw him pick up four parcels of tea, which he placed in a sack, stood it on the counter, and then went up with it through the roof—he then came through the trap-door to the landing outside the office, where we were secreted—I then opened the door and said, "We are two police officers, and shall take you into custody, and you will be charged with breaking and entering this warehouse, and stealing the tea you have in the sack; where were you going to take it?"—he said, "I shall not tell you, I shall not get anybody else into trouble"—I took him into Mr. Chumley's office—he then said, "If you go to No. 7, Crickside, Orchard House, Blackwall, you will see a young man there of the name of Chisholm"—in consequence of that I and Chew went there; it is a small four-roomed house—I knocked at the door, the female prisoner opened it—I said, "Does Chisholm live here?"—she said, "Yes, he has just gone out"—I said, "How long ago?"—she said, "Which one do you mean?"—I said, "Are there two?"—she said, "Yes"—she then turned round, ran back into the passage and up stairs; I followed her, and saw Alexander lying in bed—I said, "I am a police-officer, you had better get up; you have some tea in the house, and I want it"—I then lifted the lid of a box alongside the bed, and saw that it contained about 60 or 70 lbs. of tea done up in packages—I said, "How do you account for this being here"?—he said "I bought it from a man over the water"—I said, "Do you know the man?"—he said "No"—I told him I should take him into custody, and he would be charged with being concerned with Spill in breaking and entering, and stealing the said tea, and receiving it, well knowing it to have been stolen—I then said to Mrs. Chisholm, "I am going to search your house; have you any more tea?"—they both replied, "No, there is no more in the house"—I looked under the bed and found a japanned tinned bonnet-box, containing about 20 lbs. of loose tea—I said to them, "How do you account for this being here?"—they replied that they did not know it was there—I then asked the female prisoner what the box at the foot of the bed contained—she said, "Nothing but clothing"—Chew opened it, and it contained about 60 lbs. of tea packed up similar to the other—she declared that she knew nothing about it—I then said, "I shall take you into custody, and you will be charged with the other two"—we then conveyed them to the City—on the way she said, "I had 30 lbs. of tea yesterday from Spill; he brought it to me as I was waiting in Eastcheap."</p>

                  </hi> I am a clerk in holy orders, living at 69, Dover-road, Folkestone, and doing duty there now—I was the honorary secretary of the proposed Home Hospital for Patients Suffering from Consumption in the Advanced Stages—I have had some experience in hospital matters—it occurred to me that this would be a good kind of hospital to start, and in consequence a committee was formed, and I had letters addressed with regard to it to Savoy House, in the Strand—after the matter had been considered I employed the prisoner to canvass for subscriptions and the names of patrons—he was to be paid £1 a week salary, and commission on the subscriptions he collected—I supplied him with receipt-books signed by myself, which he would also sign, and ask those who gave subscriptions to initial the counterfoil—after he had been collecting for some time, on April 5th, 1888, a question arose between us with reference to a missing receipt-book, and I told him I could not sanction on behalf of the committee his collecting any more money what ever, for I thought he ought to be dismissed—he begged very hard that he should have another trial, and I consented he should have a book in which he should ask people who would support the institution to write their names and the sum they were willing to subscribe; and I said I would apply for it in due time, but he was to receive no money at all, and he signed a note to that effect, which was put at the end of the book—the book was produced at the Police-court—I and another witness saw him sign that—from that time he had no authority whatever to receive money under any circumstances—about 10th or 12th May I had a letter with regard to his receiving money, and after that I saw him and said it would be impossible for us to continue to employ him in any capacity whatever, and the only thing I could do, and I should be bound in honour to the public to do, would be to advertise the fact of his dis charge in the daily papers, and it was advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Morning Post</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi> of 19th May—I also wrote him this letter (<hi rend="italic">This letter stated that as he had received subscriptions and given a receipt on a plain slip of paper after being instructed that he was to receive no money, it was impossible that he should be employed in connection with the Institution, and that advertisements would be sent to the daily papers to that effect.</hi>—After that I sent the advertisements, and after that he had no authority to receive money—I never received the money given by Mrs. Blake and Mr. Mort, nor did I authorise these receipts—at the end of the year I received a letter from the Charity Organisation Society, and they put me into communication with Mr. Thornton—the hospital has never been in existence; we had the offer of Clarence House, Roehampton, during the time the prisoner was in our employment—it was not taken; there was no contract for hire binding on either party; there were never any beds there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier to William Franklyn Jackson, a tailor, of 33, Fenchurch Street—the prisoner was his foreman cutter—it was part of his duty to go out for articles which were ordered and which were not in stock—on 17th January he procured twelve pairs of "pants" and a mackintosh, and on 19th January he handed to me this paper, which has on it in blue pencil in his writing, "One mackintosh for Witcher £1 8s., and twelve drawers £1 7s.; £2 15s."—I cannot say that he said anything—I paid him the £2 15s., believing he had obtained the articles for his master.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi> I have been four years in this employment—I believe the defendant went into the employment in 1884, and left a year after wards or a little more, after which Mr. Jackson's son re-engaged him, and he came back during the father's absence from illness for about eighteen months—the son was then managing the business—I think Mr. Jackson came back early in 1886—I do not know of the son saying that it was his business—this ordering of goods was not often required—I remember Piggott being asked to go into the fitting-room to explain, but I was not present, nor did he speak to me about what had occurred—Mr. Jackson paid him two weeks' wages after that—I saw him at the shop afterwards, but did not tell him if it had not been for his applying for the situation of a first-class cutter proceedings would not have been taken; I did not know anything about it then—Mr. Piggott came in and said, "I think it is owing to this letter"—he has been there since the proceedings at the Mansion House; it was after the summons, and that was returnable on the 13th—he came in and said he believed the summons had been taken out through his answering an advertisement—I do not think Mr. Jackson was in then—I did not speak to him or his son, or he to me—the summons was heard at the Police-court, and the Alderman admitted the prisoner to bail in his own recognisances in £25—after that I saw perhaps fifty copies of this bill in the shop—(<hi rend="italic">This was a report of the proceedings at the Police-court</hi>—I do not know why they were there—I do not know that Mr. Jackson has had them circulated through the trade; they have not been posted or given to people to my knowledge—they were in Mr. Jackson's youngest son's possession—I do not know that the prisoner has said from the first that Mr. Jackson's son had this money—I never heard it either from Mr. Jackson or his son—they did not tell me who had these bills printed, or what they were printed for—Mr. Fisher is Mr. Jackson's brother-in-law—the son has not been attending regularly to the business for the last few months—I cannot say how often he has been drunk in that time.</p>

I am a bricklayer, of 84, Hampton Road, Upper Holloway—I knew the deceased man, Williams—on Friday, 18th January, in consequence of a message from him, I went to the Nag's Head and met him, and went with him to 3, Clifton Terrace about mid day—I went up to the front room, top floor, and had dinner with him and Barnett—I went downstairs, and saw two men—after dinner I went out with Williams—the doors were locked—I put a little piece of match in one in order to ascertain whether the door would be opened—we came back about half-past four—I found that the back-room door had been opened—on that Williams went downstairs; I followed him—I heard him speaking to some men and women in the kitchen; they were quarrelling—I did not go in—the noise ceased, and they shut the door—I remained there till half-past five, and then left.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said at the Police-court that the quarrel was this. Williams accused someone of opening the door, and they said they did not.</p>

About twenty minutes past twelve on 19th January I saw Williams standing on the pavement, holding his side with both hands—in consequence of what he said to me I took him back to 3, Clifton Terrace—we went up to the top floor, and saw the prisoner there, standing on the landing—he was dressed, all but his coat and hat—I said to Williams, "Where is the man that shot you?"—he said, "The man that actually shot me has gone, but this man (pointing to Turner) threatened to shoot me also, and pointed a revolver at me"—I said, "Are you sure this man pointed a revolver at you?"—he said, "Yes, I am positive of it"—I then placed my hand on Turner's shoulder, and said, "I will take you into custody for being concerned with another man in shooting this man"—he replied, "I did not shoot him; I did not have any revolver"—I then handed the prisoner over to Thomas, another constable, and took Williams to the hospital.</p>

In consequence of what Lawes said to me on this night, I went to 3, Clifton Terrace—I saw the prisoners and Mrs. Turner standing at the gate—I asked what was the matter—Mrs. Turner said, "If you think there is anything the matter here you had better have a look at the house"—the prisoner said nothing—we went in and went upstairs; the prisoner went in front of me—Steele arrived and came up also with Williams—Barnett was standing at the front room door—Steele asked Williams, "Where is the man who shot you?"—he said, "The man that shot me is gone"—he then pointed to the prisoner and said, "This man also threatened to shoot me—he said, 'He has shot you and I will shoot you too,' and he pointed the revolver at me"—Steele asked him if he was sure that Turner had a revolver in his hand—he said, "Yes, I am positive"—Steele then placed his right hand on Turner's shoulder and said, "I shall take you into custody for being concerned with the other man in shooting this man"—he replied, "I did not shoot him, I had no revolver"—I then took the prisoner to the station—on the way he said that the girl Barnett was in the habit of having seven or eight men there in the evening, and he supposed there was some jealousy among them.</p>

I am principal in the wool warehouse of the London Docks—Taylor was in the service of Mr. Duffield, a large carman who was employed by the company to take wool samples to the different brokers after the sales—Timms and O'Brien were labourers very generally employed in the wool department of the docks—after the periodical wool sales, buyers are in the habit of sending orders to the docks to sample what they purchase, to verify and identify their pur chases from the bulk—a sample of <hi rend="italic">greasy</hi> wool weighs about 8 lb., and <hi rend="italic">scoured</hi> wool about 6 lb.—each sample is done up in brown paper, and tied with string sideways and towards the ends and at the ends—certain marks and the initials of the persons are put on to identify them, and show where they are to be delivered—Timms and O'Brien assist in placing and place those samples in Taylor's van—when the van has received all the samples that have to be sent, they are entered in a receipt-book, of which this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a specimen, and Taylor drives the van away, accompanied by Timms and O'Brien, to assist with the delivery—it is the duty of Timms and O'Brien to take a receipt in this book from the person to whom the delivery is made, and when they have finished the delivery to bring the book at once to the docks, and for Taylor to come back as well—Taylor, Timms, and O'Brien had no right to touch these samples, except to deliver them—we have no such persons</p>

'—he said, "Yes, with my brother"—I said, "We are two police officers, and you will be charged with receiving this wool, knowing it to be stolen," and to Taylor, "And you will be charged with stealing it"—they made no reply—I went into a back room where Alfred was standing—I said to him, "Are you proprietor here?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You will also be charged with being concerned with your brother in receiving this wool, and you will also be charged with receiving three bags of wool yesterday"—he said, "It did not come here, I never had it; I don't see where my brother is responsible, as he is employed by me"—I went back to Albert and told him he would also be charged with receiving three bags the day previous—he said, "It did not come here; I don't know what it is to do with me, as I am in my brother's employ"—Timms at that time had been brought into the shop—I told him he would be charged with Taylor for stealing the wool, and he made no reply—we conveyed them</p>

At 6.15 a.m. on 1st February I was standing at the corner of Goldsmith's Row with Cullen, and I saw the prisoners coming up Goldsmith's Row together; Hope carried a bundle tied up in a table-cover—I stopped Hope, and asked what he had in the bundle—he said, "I don't know"—Williams was about four yards ahead then—I cannot say if he could hear what was said—he said, "The other man asked me to carry it to Shoreditch," meaning the other prisoner—by that time Williams was brought back to me by Cullen—I asked Williams what was in the bundle—he said, "I don't know; I don't know this man"—I told him I should take him to the station, as I did not feel satisfied—at the station I found in the bundle three pairs of boots, two table-covers, two tablecloths, twenty knives, three forks, a silver teaspoon, salt-spoon, tea-scoop, antimacassar, piece of wool-work, plated teapot, reading glass, pair of scissors, and wool tassel—it was a large bundle, as much as I could carry—in Hope's pocket I found, at the station, a reading-glass and half a dozen knives—Williams, when charged, said he should refuse his address; he afterwards gave a false address—Hope gave a false address—I could not hear anything of them—I was present when Williams was searched—half a dozen glass cruet bottles belonging to the cruet-stand found in the bundle, a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> and a knife were found in his pocket—the blade of the knife fitted marks I saw on the window—Rhoda Bailey, the servant, identified the property at the station.</p>

               <p>a number of purses, two coats, a gold-gilt rupee piece made into a brooch, another brooch, and a pair of earrings.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He parted from me at 12 o'clock at the Foresters' Arms, Southampton Street, about five minutes' walk from Weston Street—we were in the public-house from nine to twelve with a lot of <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi>, drinking—I never left the house, nor did he—I was having a smoke for three hours, and the landlord and I were having a chat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Wood's Defence.</hi> The witness says Melson was holding the man, and the constable says that I was holding him. I could not stand at the corner of the street and hold the man at the same time. The prosecutor could not recognise anybody on the Monday.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Melson's Defence.</hi> It was impossible for me to throw the man, and drop him again; I was in such a drunken state.</p>

                  </hi> I am a stock-jobber, and live at Norton Lees—on the night of 8th January I was in a workshop at the side of the house—about eight o'clock I heard three shots—I heard my father call out—I was inside the shed when I heard the first and second shots—I then went outside, and heard my father call me—I went across the fowl yard into the house-yard—on my way there I heard another shot; that would be the fourth—I opened the side gate, leading into the front garden, and I heard somebody behind a bush on my left—I made a feint of entering on one side, and ran round the other to catch whoever might come out on that side—I had to go round the bush at the back, and while I was at the back of the bush I heard a report of firearms again, and a bullet entered my abdomen—a man ran from behind the bush, about two or three feet from me—I followed him across the front of the house—he broke down a little wire-gate, fastened by a rope, and ran across the lawn, in a direction towards a cistern—the gate leads on to the tennis lawn—half way across the lawn he turned sharp round, aimed a pistol at me and fired; that bullet entered my chest—he continued running, I followed, and at the edge of the lawn he turned sharp round again and aimed at my head, but did not hit me—he then ran across the path into some bushes, where I lost sight of him—when the two first shots were fired at me he was behind a moderate-sized bush, and could not have been more than two or three feet from me—when he fired at me crossing the lawn I should say he was from five to ten feet from me; when the pistol was fired at my head the flash was so near me that I could not see for half a second afterwards, and he ran into the bushes, and I did not see any thing more of him—I then walked back to the house—the bush we were behind was a large laurel tree, about six feet high and six feet wide—the bushes close to the yard gate were mixed, laurels and various sorts—there is a holly-tree close to the window of the breakfast-room underneath the bedroom, and there may be two or three others there—a person jumping from the window would go into a bush there.</p>

               <p>I kept, the tips I threw away in the ashes—I put what I removed to the dust heap in a piece of newspaper—I did not notice what newspaper it was—I afterwards gave the purse frame to the police—I did not notice any coral beads—I found some clothes in the room; there was an overcoat, I did not notice its condition, it was folded up; I gave it as I found it to Police-Sergeant Gould, also two pairs of trousers, a coat besides the overcoat, a waistcoat and two round hats, one brown and the other black—on the 9th Clark did not sleep at home, Lyster did, with his wife—I saw Lyster on the 10th, Thursday, after ten in the morning—I saw him on the door steps; the door was open, he came in; his wife had just told me they were going away—I went upstairs, and when I came down again their luggage was all in the passage waiting, a large box, two portmanteaus, a tin box, some umbrellas, and a handbag—Lyster seemed a little excited—I said, "Is <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi> coming back?"—he said, "No, his brother got hold of him last night and I don't think he will loose him; most likely there will be a little chap call," and I was to give the clothes to him, but not to give them unless he asked for them in the name of Clark; he said if anyone called to inquire for him (Lyster) I was to say he had left a month—he did not give any explanation of his leaving suddenly; I had had no notice; the rent was paid-Lyster paid the rent of Clark's room—I found three frames altogether in the grate; I gave them to the police, these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them; they look like the frames of handbags.</p>

I am booking-clerk at Ascot Station—I remember Lyster arriving there by train with a woman about two o'clock on 10th January—he left some luggage in the cloak-room and asked his way to Sunninghill; I directed him—he returned with the woman about 5.25 p.m.—he said he wanted to go to Southampton—I told him the best way of getting there was to take the train to Frimley, and drive from there to Farnborough, and there catch the London train—at his request I telegraphed to Farnborough for a fly to meet him at Frimley—I saw him and the woman leave by the 5.52 train for Frimley.</p>

               <p>shoulder—on the front of the right forearm I found a scratch of about one-sixteenth of an inch long on the little finger side—another scratch three-quarters of an inch long across the lower end of the front lower arm, half an inch above the second scratch—there was an abrasion covering altogether half an inch of surface on the left little finger, a slight wound big enough to receive the head of a small pin—there was a scratch two-thirds of an inch long, running in an oblique direction across the back of the left hand, and on the face a scratch about an inch and a quarter long, on the outside of the right eye—the scratches were all apparently of the same date, consistent with having been caused two days before, they could have been caused by pushing through bushes—I have seen the fence in the Muswell Hill Road, it was such a hedge as might have caused the wounds—at ten minutes to 10 a.m. on 14th January I saw Lyster—I found several scratches on the little finger side of his right wrist—one of those was half an inch long, the others were pricks, eleven in number, dotted around; one scratch an inch long on the little finger side of the right palm—there were in all ten scratches across the knuckles and first joints of all the fingers of the right hand—there were two scratches deeper and broader than any of the others, on the back of the right index finger, one measured half an inch, the other two-thirds of an inch, several pricks on the palm of the right hand, and one scratch half an inch long in front of the wrist—on the left wrist I found a scratch an inch long, another half an inch long over the ball of the thumb, nine pricks on the backs of the left fingers, a fragment of skin had been broken away from the palm, that was probably of older date than the scratches, which were recent—on the left leg there was a scab on the front of the shin, midway between the knee and the ankle, that looked as if it were a graze, healing—on the right leg there were two scabs, both on the front of the shin, that looked like a graze, healing—those injuries were apparently of about the same age as those on Clark—they might reasonably have been caused on the 8th—the scratches could be caused by pushing through bushes—the grazing on the legs might have been done in the scramble.</p>

               <p>a person had fallen into it, and the knees had sunk into the soil, which was very wet and adhesive—I have seen the clothes produced by Sergeant Gould; the clay on them is exactly similar to the clay at the house—the outside of the trousers had apparently been brushed; the clay was on the inside, behind the heel; there was a rent in the same trousers—I was with Gould when the ashes were searched, and the empty cartridge cases and other things found—I have applied the bullets to those cases, and they fit exactly; they are from exactly similar cartridges—when we found the two tips of the boots there were some nails in them, they have since fallen out—I took Mrs. Ryssop's statement; I have the original here, I took it first in pencil on the Saturday previous to her examination on Monday, the 14th—she said that Lyster was very much agitated when he went away on the 10th—on the 19th, in consequence of a communication which the police had received, I went to Holloway Prison with Inspector Peel, and there saw Clark; he made a statement, which I took down in writing, read over to him, and which he signed—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—while waiting for an officer to take him away he made an additional statement, which was not taken—in consequence of his statements, on Monday, 22nd January, I went to a gully-hole on Highgate Hill, near the entrance to the stables of Sir Sidney Waterlow, and there found this revolver; it was full cocked, there were five chamber cartridge cases in it, one empty—it is a five millimetre, Belgian make, pin-fire; it has four grooves—I have compared it with the bullet found in the tree; that must have been fired from a revolver identical with this, as regards the grooving and size of the barrel—the cartridge cases in that revolver are similar to two of those found in Huntingdon Street; two are Eley's make, and the four empty cases in the revolver are also Eley's make—the bullet extracted from Mr. George Atkin fits the grooved muzzle, it is exactly the same size as the others, except that it has no grooving—on 26th January, in consequence of Clark's statement, I went to 4, Jacob Street, Shoreditch, the address given by Burdett—I there found two bullet-holes in the boarding of the first floor back room, which had been occupied by Burdett—I took up the boards, and between the joists and the ceiling of the floor beneath I found this bullet; it is knocked out of shape on one side, it bears a grooving exactly similar to the bullet extracted from the tree at Norton Lees; on the other side it is undamaged; it is similar in weight to the other two—on 2nd February I went again to Holloway Prison with Inspector Peel; Clark had written, asking me to come and see him—he made another statement, which I took down in writing—it was read over to him, and he signed it—in the room which had been occupied by Clark at Huntingdon Street I found two pieces of cord, which I produce—I was present on each occasion when the different witnesses identified the prisoners—there were from twelve to twenty persons present.</p>

               <p>the City Road—as we came down to the back entrance of the Agricultural Hall and the World's Fair we told the cabman to pull up there—I asked him his fare; he said, "Two shillings," and I gave him two shillings, and twopence to get some drink with—we then went in at the back entrance of the Agricultural Hall, went right through, and out at the front entrance, and went on our way to Hoxton—on the way I had a small tin cash-box, and I broke it open and found two copper coins and a silver coin about the size of a sixpence—I broke the cash-box up in several pieces, and threw them away as we passed on—we then went on to Huntingdon Street, and got there about half-past ten—Lyster opened the door to us—he had been home before us some time, he said—Burdett went in with me, and we went into my room; Lyster followed us—he closed the door, and said, "I thought you was catched"—I said, "No; why did not you come when Charlie and I called you while we stood at the gate waiting for you?"—he said, "I saw two men at the gate, but I thought it was somebody else waiting for me"—I said, "What did you want to do that for?"—he said, "I could not get away otherwise; I came to get away, and as I did a man fronted me, and I shot him; I came away, and when I saw a man following me I found it was impossible to get over without his catching me, so I shot him; he put up his arms and said, 'Oh!' so I know that he is dead"—our boots were very muddy; and our trousers, and also our hats—just behind the bushes it was very soft, and, in addition to that, I and Burdett in crossing the fields fell down several times and got muddy—I doubted what Lyster told me—I said, "I hope it is not true what you said about shooting"—he said, "It is quite true"—I said, "I will burn my boots if that is true"—he said, "I will burn mine too"—mine were a pair with elastic sides—I pulled off the heels; he took his lace-ups off, and we put them all in the fire—I changed my hat and coat—Lyster left his hat and overcoat in my room—he had changed his things before we came home and washed—I lent Burdett a pair of trousers and a hat—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is Burdett's hat, which he left—these are his trousers, and this is his coat—the trousers and vest belong to me—this is his overcoat—he has my trousers on now, and he had my hat at the time—I burnt my boots—I pulled the purse out—I did not know the contents of it at the time; there were some bits of paper, and there might have been some address cards—a 4s. Jubilee piece I took out—I threw the papers in the fire—I gave Burdett the purse, and said, "Put it in the fire"—there were some ornaments outside the purse—Burdett thought they were silver—he said, "I will take these off first," and he put the purse in the fire—there was a little wooden box, which had contained a brooch or watch; I gave him that, and that was put in the fire also—the purse that was burnt was not similar to this—I think it had got some more ornaments on out side; it was about the same size, but I thought it had ornaments somewhere about here; I am not sure—there was a coral bead necklace—I gave that to Lyster to look at—he said the catch of the necklace was gold—he got a knife, and tried to get it off; in doing so it broke, and a number of the beads went on the floor—we thought we picked them all up, but it appears we did not; some were left behind—I gave the puree to Lyster—I had a 4s. Jubilee piece mounted as a brooch in my possession about this time—I had received it on the Monday from the jeweller—Lyster wanted to purchase it for his wife—I said, "No, I promised to give it</p>

               <p>away"—but when I saw this 4s. piece in the purse, I said, "You can have this for your share out of the money"—so he took it, and looked at it, and said, "I have decided not to have one made now, I am going to get my wife a Jubilee sovereign mounted"—eventually I did give it to Lyster—after this we all three went out together, and went into a public-house in the Kingsland Road, about two minutes' walk from our lodging, called the Mail Coach—we had two pennyworth of whisky each—Lyster tendered the 4s. Jubilee piece—the landlord fetched, a 2s. piece and half a crown back in change—I said, "I thought it was a 4s. piece"—Burdett said, "Yes, I thought it was"—the master looked at Lyster and said, "It is 5, is it not?" Lyster said, "I think I know the difference between a 4s. and 5s."—the master put it behind the counter when he had given 1s. too much change—Burdett and I had a cigar each—we did not stay there many minutes; we simply drank up and lighted our cigars, and went out and went to Brooks' room; his wife was there—when she went out he went to a cupboard, took out a large six-chambered revolver, and gave it to me to take home—I took it home—Lyster left at a quarter to twelve, and had gone home three-quarters of an hour before us—after that I went home—I made an appointment with Burdett—he said he would come up next morning to our place about ten o'clock—next morning, while I was in bed, about eleven o'clock, Lyster came into the room—we spoke about the affair that happened on the previous night—I told him I did not believe what he had told me last night was true—he assured me it was true—I told him I should not have gone out with him if I had known he was going to do that—he said, "Look here, there is no frightening me off carrying six shots in my revolver; when I expend five I reserve the sixth for myself, I never mean to be hung"—I asked Lyster if he had seen a paper—he said, "No"—I said, "Will you get one?"—he went and got a paper, and he said there was nothing in it at all—I said then I would not believe what he said—he said, "You will find it in the special to-night"—I had the revolver that Burdett had given me, and I showed it to Lyster—he said it was a very good one, and he asked me to go in the City and buy some cartridges for it—I said I would not do it—I waited at home for Burdett till about half past two, and I then went to his place, and we went to Leadenhall Market that evening—I and Burdett walked through the market, and then went into a public-house close to the market, and stayed there till after dark, and then we went back to Brooks's house—I was arrested there—I gave the revolver that Burdett had given me to Lyster before I came out—he said, "What are you going to do with it?"—I said, "I am going to leave it here; have you got yours?"—he said, "Yes, I have reloaded it, I emptied the cartridges in the Kingsland Road"—I said, "Take this and put it in your box, and if you take my advice you will not take it out with you to-day"—he said, "What are you going to do?"—I said, "It is Charlie Burdett's; I will give you this revolver"—he took it, and said he would put both away—so he did, in his box—the revolver that I had put down in the gully I had got the last Sunday in December—it was the proceeds of a robbery, I don't know it now—Burdett and Lyster were with me—Lyster was inside with me; Burdett was outside—there were two revolvers taken from that place—the revolver that Lyster had on the night of the 8th he had bought on 24th December from Charles Penfold</p>

               <p>—I was present when he bought it—he came for me to go with him to purchase it—he said a man named Barrett had threatened to shoot him, the same Barrett that is wanted now for the Finsbury Park murder—I had the same sort of cartridges for mine—Lyster loaded mine—they were pin-fire cartridges; both revolvers had the same kind, mine and Lyster's—when I was in Burdett's room I fired two shots into the floor—Burdett was there at the time—Lyster told me the Monday after his arrest, coming down from the railway in a van, that young Charlie Burdett and another man, Harry Dearing, had come up to his place the night that I and Burdett were arrested, and told him of our arrest, and he took the pistols and cartridges and tied them together and threw them into the <hi rend="italic">cut</hi>—he also told me that when he was coming away from the house he passed the new building where we had got the ladder, and he saw the old watchman standing at the corner as he passed, and he asked him what was the matter: "Are there burglars down there?" and he said, "No, I think it is a riot, and I am going to fetch the police"—I had a piece of rope in one of my pockets when I left Burdett's place; I lost it—I believe my revolver was loaded on the last day of December, the day after it came into my possession, Lyster loaded it in my room—it might have been on 4th or 5th January perhaps that I fired the two shots into the floor in Burdett's room—I cannot tell to a day—that was the night when it was done—the shots have been found in the floor that I fired there—I had not more than four cartridges.</p>

When I went to Muswell Hill I was dressed as I am now, except that I had not the same trousers—I had no beard then—I had some rope in my pocket; I don't know whether it was in an outside pocket—when we started from Burdett's house, he had it first and gave it to me—I first became acquainted with Lyster about the 19th November—I went to Huntingdon Street, I should think, within three or four days afterwards; that would be between the 19th and 24th—Mrs. Lyster was not there when I went; I think she was at the hospital—I don't know when she went there; she came back on 4th January, I think—it was either on the 19th or on the following Monday, the 26th, that I first saw Lyster—I did not write down the statement I made to Tunbridge and Peel; they wrote it down; I dictated it; I had not written it out before—I was with them in a private room in the prison—I and Lyster went into the room at Muswell Hill—I did not fire while I was in the room; I had a revolver—I believe two shots were fired from the top of the ladder—I am not positive; I believe it was two shots—both those shots were fired by Lyster; I did not fire at all—I did not jump from the ladder to the bushes; I went down the ladder—I saw Lyster fire; I did not see him fire from the gate; he fired two from the window—when I came down to the gate I heard a shot, and then Lyster passed in front of the bushes—I did not see him fire, I only heard the shot—I saw him stand for a moment with a revolver in his hand—I could see him do all this; it was not a very dark night or very bright; an ordinary light—there was a full light in the window behind; I could see all that occurred—I don't know how far up the road it was when Burdett turned round and said, "There is another one following us"—it must have been further than 15 or 20 yards—I kept the furthest up the road—I was the first to run away—when Burdett said, "Jim, come back and</p>

               <p>shoot him,"I was perhaps eight yards in front—I daresay young Mr. Atkin was eight or ten yards away—I could hear what Burdett said—Mr. Atkin might have heard him, I can't say—if a man turns round to speak to a man behind him, the man in front could hear more plainly than the man behind—Lyster told me the following night that he had killed two men, I did not believe him; I had my reasons; I did not approve of shooting people, if you could get away without it—I said I would not have gone out with him if I had known what he was going to do, or I had known that he was going to shoot anybody—my revolver was not loaded, there were cartridges in it, but they were empty; they would not go off—I did not intend to use the revolver at all—I could not use it because there was nothing in it—I never went out with Lyster after, only to have a drink in the public-house in Kingsland Road—I mean I never kept his company afterwards—he was with me in Kings land Road—he did not have a cigar, he does not smoke—I did not call for three cigars, only two were called for—Lyster did not have one, Burdett and I had one—I did not put down the 4s. piece; of course I admit the stealing it, it is a matter of indifference who put it down; it was neither I nor Burdett that paid it, it was Lyster who paid it—if Mr. Ball says I paid it, it is untrue—I remember it distinctly—the revolver was bought from Penfold, we went to his house on the morning, a friend of Penfold's was present, a young man—I had no conversation with Penfold about the purchase of the revolver—Lyster spoke to him—I did not go inside, I stayed outside; but he came out and went to a coffee shop—I saw the purchase made—in the coffee-shop, Lyster said, "Are you going to let me have that revolver?"—Penfold said, "It is in pledge for 3s. 6d."—Lyster gave him the money, and when he brought it back he said, "Have you got some cartridges?"—Lyster took the revolver, I had nothing to do with the purchase, Lyster had plenty of money of his own to purchase it—I had money also—I did not say I wanted one—I wrote to the Home Office while I was in Holloway Gaol, saying that I wanted to give evidence, asking for the Queen's pardon if I gave evidence—it was not exactly the reason why I made the statement, that I thought I would get one—there was another man at the time I wrote my petition, who made a statement, a fourth man under custody, who was quite innocent, he knew nothing more about it than you did; he was one accused; I believe he had
been in penal servitude—it was not exactly because I thought him innocent and wanted to get him off, but I knew very well there were four men in, and we should all four have to suffer for what one man did, and I think I have done a great justice by getting an innocent man acquitted—I don't think I am guilty of the shooting, I have pleaded guilty concerning it—I did not say I thought if one man suffered for it, mat would be sufficient, and I should be pardoned; I said that if the man that shot George Atkin was guilty it would give more satisfaction to the Atkin family than if all were brought to justice—I have been convicted—my last sentence was five years for stealing two gold Albert chains—before that I had ten years for breaking into a shop—I don't know what I got before that—I have been in prison two months for being drunk—before the ten years I had nine months for stealing a watch-chain, and two months besides—I think that is plenty, I can't grumble if I get punished for what I have done, but I have no wish to be punished for what I have not done.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 28, St. George's Place, Hyde Park Corner, and am a gentleman of independent means—on 18th July I was en deavouring to recover some money for a young lady who alleged that she had been defrauded by a postman—I met her and the postman that day about 6.30 or 7 p.m.—I had some conversation with them; the postman went away for a few minutes—the prisoner and Knott, who was convicted here (<hi rend="italic">See Vol.</hi> 108, <hi rend="italic">page</hi> 798), crossed the road and claimed money from her—Knott said, "Pay me that 26s. you owe me"—she said, "I don't owe you anything"—Knott said, "Yes, you do, you owe me money"—he turned to me in a threatening manner and said, "The young woman says you are her brother; why don't you pav?"—I said, "Whether she is my sister or not, I decline to pay; I don't pay anyone's debts"—I then to pacify them invited the prisoner, Knott, the postman, and the lady to have a glass of beer—we went into the Bag of Nails, in the Buckingham Palace Road, and drank at my expense—we stayed there twenty minutes or half an hour; then I left first, and the lady, the postman, and the two men followed—I went along the Buckingham Palace Road towards the Victoria Hotel, the prisoner walking on my left and Knott on my right—I was talking to them—they were more conciliatory at that time—the postman brought up the rear—I asked them to have another glass, and we all five went into another house, and had a glass—I said to the postman, "I think it is time for you to go and deliver your letters"; he left, and the other three stayed with me—when we left the public-house the prisoner and Knott said to the young lady, You be off, the gentleman does not require your company; he says you are not his sister"—she went away a short distance, but loitered about—I left the men, and walked rapidly towards Lower Belgrave-street, Pimlico; I looked round to see if they were following me, and they were; I sharply entered a public-house to avoid them—they entered almost directly afterwards as I was calling for a glass of beer—Knott said, "Halloa, here you are again"—I said, "What has that to do with you? it appears very strange to me that you appear to be following me"—they said, "Have a drink with us; have some spirits"—they called for spirits—I said, "Are you going to pay for it?"—the prisoner said, "I have only got notes in my pocket"—I said, "You had better change your notes; you called for these drinks; pay for it out of one of your notes"—he pulled out a roll of supposed Bank notes, but left me to pay for the drink they barred my exit from the public-house by placing their backs against the small door leading out of the bar—I had a scuffle with them, pushed them on one side, and got out—I walked and partly ran about one hundred yards</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188903040059"/>
               <p>away—Knott came suddenly round to the front from the middle of the road, and seized me by the neck, and drove me back against the prisoner—they then hustled me forcibly down some circular stone steps with great force—I struck against some ironwork, and rebounded, and they followed me down; my hat was smashed—when I reached the bottom of the steps Knott was on my left and the prisoner on the right; Knott seized my left hand and twisted it, and the prisoner seized my right arm—Knott tugged at my watch chain; I saw my watch in his hands—the prisoner wrenched off my locket—I dropped my umbrella—Knott ran up the steps; the prisoner picked up my umbrella, and ran after Knott up the steps—I was very much shaken; I received injury to my back: I could scarcely walk for three weeks—my umbrella was of very fine alpaca or silk, with two thick silver bands round it; one was almost invisible; anyone could see the other; it had my initials on it, "J. H."—it was not an ordinary umbrella—the prisoner had no umbrella with him when he first came up—after remaining about ten minutes to recover myself I walked up the steps into the street—I spoke to a policeman, and went to the station-house and gave information—I did not see the prisoner again till a few weeks ago, when I saw him at the station—I have no doubt he is one of the men who robbed me.</p>

I can see there is fire there through the fanlight at the top," and with that the police came up—the door was closed then—the door was burst open, and the police went in and caught hold of the mattress and threw it into the road—I believe the prisoner's father and mother lived on the premises, but moved out the same night—the engines came, and the fire was put out.</p>

I stamped on it, and heard a knocking at the door, and went there and saw the first witness. It would be no benefit to me to set fire to the place, nor was there any bad feeling existing between me and the landlord, but because I was the first to discover the fire I was charged with the offence.

                  </hi> I live at 66, Josephine Avenue, Brixton—I have retired from business—in 1885 I was co-trustee with Mr. Leighton in a trust fund which then amounted to £1,000, and was invested in Consols—Mr. Leighton died in the autumn of 1885, and it became necessary for me, as surviving trustee, to appoint a second trustee of the fund—in 1886 I consulted the prisoner, who was acting as my solicitor, professionally, with regard to the appointment of a fresh trustee—he then carried on practice at 11, Clement's Inn, Strand—the relations between us were also of a friendly character—I told him one of the trustees along with me was dead, and he said, "I have no objection to be trustee with you"—he said he should want to see the original deeds creating the trust—I took them and left them with him; these are they—he drew up a deed of appointment for me to sign—on 30th July, 1886, I received this letter from him (<hi rend="italic">this enclosed the engrossment of appointment of trustee for the witness's execution</hi>)—a little while afterwards I took the deed back and executed it at Clement's Inn—I and the prisoner signed it there—I do not remember any one attesting the signatures—I left it with the prisoner—I have never seen it since—on 3rd December I called at his office, and he said, "Mr. Buckle, I must have that money; I have orders to complete the trust fund to-morrow"—he was to invest it in a house at Sutton—he said it was a very good investment, value £1,400 or £1,500—I believed those</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188903040068"/>
               <p>statements—he said it was freehold property; and acting on those statements, I gave him an open cheque for £905 6s. 4d., drawn on my private bank, Glyn, Mills, and Co., to Peacock or bearer—he said, "Don't cross it, Mr. Buckle"—I did not—he said, "I want to complete the mortgage to-morrow, and I must do it, and then you shall have the deeds—the trust fund was £945 6s. 4d.—he owed me £40 at the time; he was to put the £40 to the £905 6s. 4d. I gave him—I had lent him as a personal loan £50, and he had repaid me £10—I used to go to him pretty often about this time to consult him about my affairs—the next time I went I asked him for the deeds—I forget whether the mortgage deeds or what deeds; they were the trust deeds—he said, "They are in my bank; I have not had time to get them yet"—that satisfied me for the moment—I called again in a few days, and he said, "They are in the bank; I have not had time to get them out"—when I asked him the last time he said, "They are in the bank, I have as much right to the deeds as you have; I am as much trustee as you are; I would not be trustee with you another day if it were not that I should have to go before the Court"—I don't know the date of that—the dividends had been payable half yearly—I held the fund in trust for Mrs. Kendrew and Mrs. Water house, who had been paid half-yearly—the April dividend became due on April 13th—I received from the prisoner two cheques (£6 3s. 8d. and £7 8s. 6d.) drawn by himself as representing the interest on the trust fund—I paid them over to the persons for whose benefit I held the trust—in October, 1887, he borrowed £50 of me, and in making the loan I deducted from it the interest which would be payable to these two people—in April, 1888, he sent me a cheque for £13 12s. 2d. for the interest, and I paid it to the people entitled to it—up to that time I had no doubt at all but that the money was on the Sutton property, and I had implicit confidence in the prisoner, but in April information came to my knowledge, and I refused to have anything more to do with him as a client and placed my affairs in the hands of Messrs. Carritt and Son, who have acted for me since in endeavouring to get some explanation as to what had become of my money—this cash account is vouched by the prisoner himself; I know his writing—it was the first definite information given at all with regard to the £905 (<hi rend="italic">This account contained the items "advanced on mortgage of the Sale and Exchange' to Mrs. Buckle</hi>,)£500," <hi rend="italic">and "ditto on mortgage to Mr. Loines on property at Sutton, Surrey</hi>, £300.") I never authorised £500 to be advanced out of the trust fund to Mrs. Buckle or anybody—I had no knowledge that the trust fund had been so applied, I knew nothing at all about it—I knew nothing of the mortgage to Mr. Loines; I never lent or authorised to be lent £300 to Loines—I don't think I have seen these answers before—from December, 1886, down to early in this year I was under the impression that the money was on the Sutton property.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My wife was present at two of my interviews with Peacock—I am sure she was present when he got the money on December 3rd, after the execution of the trust deed—that was the first time—the second occasion was when I asked him for the deeds, and when he said that if it was not for the nuisance he should go to the Court and get released—I cannot tell you the year—I knew my wife had bought the Sale and Exchange newspaper—she did not represent it to me as a good paying business—she did not consult me when she bought it—I</p>

               <p>don't know whose money she bought it with—I didn't trouble about the paper; she holds one view and I another about it—we don't dis agree about it—I am disgusted with it; I don't know if it is a good paying paper—I cannot say if she invests money without my knowledge now and then—I allow her to do what she likes with my money; play ducks and drakes with it—I did not consult her in every step—I told her I was going to ask Peacock to be trustee; she was quite willing—I told her I was going to invest the money in a mortgage at Sutton—I don't know what interest we were to get; we were to get better interest if we could—I did not tell her, nor did she ask me, what interest to were going to get—it was not 6 per cent.—the beneficiaries of the trust had the same amount of interest as before—I sent them what Peacock gave me—I did not put any interest in my pocket—I have not been threatened with any civil or criminal proceedings with reference to this trust fund—I am sure no proceedings have been taken against me—I can't say when it was first brought to my knowledge that Peacock alleged £500 was advanced on the <hi rend="italic">Sale and Exchange</hi> to my wife—I cannot remember whether the deed appointing him trustee was written on paper or parchment—I showed it to my wife when it was sent to me—I did not sign it at home because I wanted a witness—I have lent money to my son Charles—Peacock backed a bill for £100 drawn by Peacock and Charles Buckle; the money was lent to Peacock—I do not know that it went to my son—I swear I have not required Peacock as security for other loans made to my son—I will swear £40 was not lent to Charles with Peacock as security—I had one deed shown me at Bow Street—it was not this indenture of mortgage between my wife and me—I was asked whether a certain signature was my wife's, and I said it was not—I have not seen this signature before; I don't believe it is hers—no one suggested to me that criminal proceedings should be taken in this case—my wife might have talked about it, I don't know that she did—I did not say anything—Inspector Conquest did not ask me or suggest to me to prosecute—I don't know that I have made any statements about the matter—I did not know Mr. Loines till this year—I met him at Peacock's office two or three times; I don't know when—I did not know his name—I did not see him on business—he has not been in the room when I and Peacock have discussed business matters—I never spoke to him—I don't know that Peacock told me he was building at Sutton; I won't swear he did not—I have not invested in other land at Sutton without consulting Peacock, nor has my wife, to my knowledge—I do not know that she has invested £700 in land there—I do not know that she has invested in copper mines, or that she has dropped £3,000 in them—I leave all business details to her—she took an active part in the investments in the property at Sutton; I don't know if inquiries were made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I recognise these cheques as representing loans I made to Peacock from time to time, and which he has never repaid; July 23rd, 1886, £50—£10 of that was repaid, and I put the other £40 to the trust money—June 15th, 1887, £100—I cannot say if that has been repaid—10th October, 1887, a loan to him—this mortgage is not signed by Mrs. Buckle to the best of my belief—I never authorised any trust money to be advanced to her on mortgage—I never heard of such a thing; I could not do it; and if it had been suggested to me I should have said I could not do it—these are Peacock's cheques for the interest; that is the whole</p>

                  </hi> I am one of the firm of Aird and Hood, of 4, Brabant Court, Philpot Lane—early in 1887 Mr. Wilshire, a surveyor, applied to us to advance money on mortgage on a house at Sutton—I ascertained that the house was known as Huntingfield Lodge, and that Mr. Loines, the builder of it, was the person who wanted the money—he saw me plenty of times on the subject, and he was the man to whom I afterwards handed the money—we had a survey made; I had a report as to the value of the house—I agreed to lend the money subject to the surveyor's report being satisfactory and the house being let—this agreement for the letting of the house was afterwards produced to me—on the subject of lending the money I entered into a correspondence with Peacock as solicitor for the borrower—on 15th March, 1887, I received this letter from him, making an appointment for me to attend at his office to inspect the deeds (<hi rend="italic">This letter also said that he would then produce the original and hand over a copy of the tenant's agreement</hi>)—I did not attend that appointment on the 16th; my clerk did—he brought back certain documents; I don't know if he brought this copy of the tenant's agreement or if he sent it; I received it about that date—I think by the notes on it that my clerk brought it—I can swear I received it from Peacock by my clerk's hand or by my own—it is an agreement of 16th March, 1887, between the Rev Coghlan, the tenant, and Loines—my clerk having attended the appointment made, brought back this copy on the same day—there is a letter of 17th March enclosing it—on the faith of its being let, and on the report of the surveyor, I agreed to lend £925, but I only advanced £775, taking security for £925; the balance was to be advanced on the certificate of our surveyor as to the completion of the building—I did not attend the completion myself; my clerk did it; I believe it took place at Peacock's, because I sent a cheque for £925 to be cashed; "to order" was knocked off; it was cashed—I received the mortgage of 12th April, 1887; that was the original mortgage by Loines to me; he was adjudicated bankrupt about a fortnight after it was</p>

               <p>executed—the tenant was said to be in possession, and he was nominally, because he kept the key, and kept the place locked up—we made inquiries, and it was let to Peacock—I never got any rent, and I had to pay Coghlan £10 to get him out in September or October, 1888; he wanted more—I received from Peacock two notices on or about June 6th, 1887, one that the equity of redemption belonging to Loines had been assigned to Peacock on April 12th, and the other a notice of a second charge on the property in favour of Mr. Buckle for an advance of £350, indenture dated April 24th, 1887—he did not pay it off; I had a number of excuses, and on October 20th the interest became due, and Peacock enclosed me his own cheque for £22 for interest—I wrote to him for the amount on October 21st, and I believe I got it—I received this letter on 24th October (<hi rend="italic">Acknowledging a cheque for insurance</hi>)—the property was then up for sale at the Mart—I had given him full notice of the sale on December 16th, and it was put up, but unfortunately there was not a single bid—beyond the cheque for interest in October I have not had a penny, and I should be very glad to sell it now—after Louces became bankrupt I began to think it was a conspiracy between the three—I told Peacock I should lay it before the Treasury, and another time I said I should lay it before the Law Society.</p>

               <p>purpose was to get information from him as to certain sums of money and documents obtained from them—from April, 1888, down to December I was endeavouring from him, and then from Smith and Rydon, to get information with regard to the position of things as between the Buckles and himself—in my letter of 30th July, 1888, I ask the prisoner for particulars of the investment of £940 in respect of which I was informed he and Mr. Buckle were trustees—in this letter of 1st August, 1888, from Smith and Rydon, the prisoner says that a large amount is due to him for costs, and without the payment of that sum he takes the position of affording no information; he says he stands on his strict legal rights—there is no reference in that letter to £945 in his possession as trustee—I pressed for particulars in regard to how that sum had been disposed of; and I obtained a cash account vouched by him, and under his hand, as being his account of how the sum was disposed of—I was not satisfied with that account—I put certain questions on 10th November, desiring there should be answers in writing, and suggesting my clerk should attend and take them down—this is a copy of the questions I sent him—he gave these answers, which were taken by the clerk and brought to me—I was present at the time the answer was dictated. (<hi rend="italic">The answers to the second and fourth questions were read as follows</hi>): "The amount received was £905 6s. 4d.; the date is correct. On several occasions Charles Buckle borrowed money from his father, who would never lend unless I agreed to be security for him; I daresay there was this sum of £40, and Charles had it, but it was to him and not to me I formally guaranteed to pay those loans to Charles, but it was understood I should not be looked to for anything; this £905 was trust money It was proposed that I should be trustee, but it was not carried out. There is no document appointing me or creating the trust that I know of; £500 of this £905 was lent on the <hi rend="italic">Sale and Exchange</hi> against my express wish There was a mortgage executed by Mrs. Buckle and Mr. Buckle on the newspaper Mr. Buckle, junior, persuaded Mrs. Buckle to prevail on Mr. Buckle to lend this money I held the mortgage; this mortgage was probably executed the last week in December, 1886; the witness is E. J. Lindley I produce cheques against the <hi rend="italic">Sale and Exchange</hi> for wages, and will give a list. I used to draw cheques and give cash up to £500; the £500 was left in my hands to advance the <hi rend="italic">Sale and Exchange.</hi> I had no written authority to do this. Referring to the £50 above that Charles Buckle had, I paid £10 back on 11th November, 1886 The contract to purchase the printing business connected with the <hi rend="italic">Sale and Exchange</hi> is in Mr. James Buckle's name, his name being signed by Charles Buckle under a Power of Attorney Mr. Buckle owned the printing business, Mrs. Buckle the paper, and she had it years before I knew her"—"This sum (£350) was advanced to Mr. Loines, of Champion Park, Sydenham, for building purposes, and was a second charge. I have no written authority to make the advance; it was made against my advice I gave notice to the first mortgagee, and took an assignment of the equity, having lent him £200 myself The house was not sold when put up for auction, and the only mortgage on it is £735 Vaughan was a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> tenant of this house. I did not know what Vaughan was, and had been taken in by him just as much as Mrs. Buckle. J. W. Buckle was entitled to £300 under Ambrose Buckle's will, which I got out of Court for him when he came Of age"—those are the only answers I received with regard to the £905</p>

               <p>and £350—the questions were submitted on 10th September, and his answers are dated 11th December—the answers were not satisfactory—eventually the Solicitor to the Treasury communicated with me, and I gave him the information he required.</p>

                  </hi> I am a labourer, living in Watergate Street, Dept ford—on 9th February I went with Ryan to a political meeting at a museum at Sayes' Court, Deptford—shortly after I got in I saw the prosecutor standing by the side of the stage—the steward Ryan came up and called my attention to three men, of whom the prisoners were two, standing near me; Norris was the centre man and Moss was on the left—the prosecutor turned round to get hold of his boy to fetch him to the side of the platform, and Norris pressed up close against his breast and I heard a faint click as if from the snapping of a ring or chain—the gentleman turned round and Norris began to move away—he got about four feet from the gentleman when he discovered his loss—he called out, "My watch is stolen, I have lost it"—I seized hold of Norris by the collar and said, "You have the watch"—he said, "I have not"—I said, "You have passed it"—when I seized him Moss the other man pressed up close against Norris; and then Norris offered to be searched—I pulled him away from the crowd—we searched him and found nothing—on looking round we found Moss and the other man had gone—we searched the hall, and found Moss in the small hall adjoining where an overflow meeting was being held—I said to him, "You were along with Norris just now; you have the watch"—he at once offered to be searched—we did not do it, but held him till the constables came and arrested the two of them—we could not find the third man—a gold swivel was picked up near our feet and a few feet from where Norris was standing—I was a foot or two from Norris when this happened.</p>

               <p>all over the hall—the overflow meeting was agreed on beforehand—I was immediately behind Norris; I had my eye on him the whole time—I did not see him take the watch—he promptly denied it when I told him he had it—another man called at the Police-station that night and said he had lost his watch; for anything I know to the contrary this might be the swivel of that watch; it is not very likely—I cannot say there was a great deal of crowding and hustling—I was standing—I don't think any persons were sitting, except those on the platform—we were on the out skirts—it was not unduly crowded where we were.</p>

The meeting was under the auspices of an English Liberal club—I did not observe any waving of hats—there was no unusual pushing about where I was—when I heard the click Moss was about three feet from me and about the same distance from the prosecutor and from Norris—I saw nothing pass from Norris to Moss—I was touching Norris—after the click Moss remained stationary—when I seized Norris, Moss was about seven feet from him—Moss might have been moved involuntarily by the rush up to Norris—when I caught hold of Norris by the collar there was a rush made round, the people closed up—I should not think there were a lot of people standing in front of the prosecutor—I said before the Magistrate of one of the prisoners, "I saw him as good as take the watch; that is my opinion"—I did not know Norris's name—Moss has been out on bail.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When the rush took place Moss and the third man were the first to come up; I think it was involuntary—Norris could have taken the watch without my seeing it, because he was covering the gentleman; when he turned round, Norris covered his breast; he was in front of me, and I could not see over his shoulder to see what he was doing.</p>

I am a boiler maker, and live at Douglas Street, Dept ford; I was present at this meeting; I was a steward—my attention was attracted to the prisoners and another man by their unnecessarily hustling the crowd—I spoke to Maroney—about three-quarters of an hour after the meeting began, between 5.30 and 6, I saw the prosecutor come in—I went into another room—shortly afterwards I saw a rush, and Norris in custody.</p>

There was very little pushing about at the meeting; it was a very quiet and orderly meeting—there was a very little shouting at some parts—there was a lot of enthusiasm which was expressed merely by clapping—it was impossible for the people to get nearer the speakers because the crush where the prisoners were was so great—they were at the right-hand corner of the platform.</p>

I am the prisoner's father—I live at 70, Cramp ton Street, Newington Butts—on the day before he was taken in custody he came to me, and I gave him the ticket of a watch (which has been taken from him and not mentioned) and a half-sovereign and two half crowns to get the watch out of pawn for ten shillings, and a half-crown to buy himself a new shirt—he was to bring me the rest of the change on Saturday, but a constable came and said that he was in custody—I have paid him from 35s. to £2 a week as a labourer; £2 4s. 9d. was the last I paid him—he has saved £7 in the bank—he has lived at home, and has been a very steady boy.</p>
