When I had got about 10 Doors past the Corner, at the Bottom of the Minories, he snatched hold of the Bundle; I screamed out - Murder! - Stop Thief, I am ruined ! I held fast, and he pulled, and I pulled. In the Struggle I fell down; and the violence of the Fall stopped my Breath, and broke my Elbow, in such a Manner, that I could not use my Arm for a Fortnight. When I got up, the Prisoner was got away with the Bundle, but I still cry'd out, stop Thief! and the Prisoner was taken by the Merchant Taylors Alms-Houses, about twenty or thirty Yards from the Place where he robbed me, and then some People came to me, and bid me not cry out, for the Man (they said) was taken. There was four Holland Shifts, three Callico Shirts, five Linnen Aprons, and a Dimitty Petticoat in the Bundle, and they were the Property of Mary Chaplin. He took the Goods from me just by a Lamp, by which I saw the Side of his Face, and I observed him as he followed me down the Minories, and imagining he had some ill design, I held my Bundle as fast as I could. I took Notice of the Prisoner's Cloaths the next Morning, and they were the same that he has on now.</p>

            , junior. About a Quarter after Nine at Night, my Father and I were standing at my Door, and we heard this young Woman cry out Murder ! Stop Thief! I saw the Prisoner tugging the Bundle from her, and I thought they were Man and Wife, and might be quarrelling. But when he took to his Heels with the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173909060003"/> Bundle, I pursued him, and overtook him about thirty Yards from the Place where he took it, upon which he flung it down, and it struck me upon my Thigh. I picked it up with my left Left Hand, and with my Right I seiz'd the the Prisoner. This is the same Bundle the Prisoner then dropped.</p>
               <p>Grindall. This is the Bundle he took from me; 'tis just as it was, when it was taken, and these are the same Things which were then in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask Mr. Nott, if I attempted to stir; for I was so much in Liquor, that I could not stand.</p>
               <p>Nott. I never saw the Prisoner before that Night, in my Life. When I laid hold of him with my Right Hand, my Father seized him on the other Side, and told him, if he offered to make any Resistance he would knock him down with an Oaken Stick, which he had in his Hand. Upon which the Prisoner said, - Mr. Nott, I will not resist.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask Grindall whether she is not persuaded to prosecute me, by Mr. Nott; and whether the Prosecution is not carry'd on it his Expence?</p>
               <p>Grindall. No body persuaded me to prosecute; But as the Prisoner and the Goods were taken, we were all obliged to prosecute: We went before the Lord-Mayor, and he bound us all over.</p>
               <p>Mr. Nott, senior. I was standing that Night at the Door, talking with my Son, and Hearing a Cry of Murder ! Stop Thief! I turned my Head, and saw the Prisoner run with the Bundle under his Arm. I cross'd the Way and caught him by the right Shoulder. He had dropped the Bundle and was got a little Way from it, but we dragg'd him to it, and my Son took it up. The Prisoner seemed to be at that time as sober as I am now.</p>

               <p>Ann Price. On the 21st of May last, Mrs. Prior and I were coming from Kilburn towards London, between Three and Four o'Clock in the Afternoon, and the Prisoner met us about two or three Fields from <placeName id="t17390906-4-crimeloc19">Mary-bone</placeName>

The Minute I saw him, I had a Dread upon me that he would rob us; for he came on with a sauntering Pace, and had a Stick in his Hand:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173909060004"/> I said to Mrs. Prior, - we shall certainly be robb'd! No, said she, I hope not, - pray take Courage. When the Prisoner came up to us, I call'd out, - Tom Prior, Tom Prior (which is Mrs. Prior's Husband's Name) - you sha'n't go abroad with us any more, if you must stay behind to look Birds-nests. Mr Prior was not with us, but I said this, that the Prisoner might imagine he was not far off; and upon this he pass'd by us, and went about twenty or thirty Yards beyond us; then he turn'd about and follow'd us, and when he overtook us, he said, - Aye, God damn you, Madam, I'll give you something besides Birds-nests, and immediately he put his right Hand into his left Side-pocket, and pulled out a Pistol of a very uncommon Size, and clapp'd it to my left Breast, crying damn you, Madam, your Money and Rings. I had none but my Wedding ring, which I pull'd off, and told him, I had no other, except that, which was my Wedding-ring, and he should have it; when he had got it, he still kept his Pistol to my Breast, and stamping with his Foot on the Ground, he cry'd, - d-mn you, your Money; then I put my Hand into my Pocket, and pull'd out about seven Shillings, some Half-pence, and a Cork-screw, which he threw at me again. After this, he stamp'd again, and said to Mrs. Prior, - And D-mn you, Madam, your Money: I saw her give him some Money, but how much I cannot tell. All the while he was demanding Mrs. Prior's Money, and taking it from her, he kept the Pistol to my Breast; and when he had got what he could, he said, - Now, damn you, go on, and you'll meet two more presently; this struck such a Terror into us, than we ran out of the Path way, a-cross the Fields, and over two or three Ditches, to a Farm-house, kept by one Mr. Francis, and when we got there, we were ready to die. I never saw the Prisoner before that Time, but I am positive he is the Man. He was taken up for another Robbery, and I went to see him in Newgate, and knew him immediately: He has got a Wig on now, but he had none when he robb'd us; his Hat was flapp'd, and he had a Bough which he play'd about in his Mouth. When I saw him in Newgate, he abus'd me, and call'd me several Bitches, when he found I knew him.</p>

            , a Constable of Pancras. I had a Warrant brought me from Mr. Deveil, against the Prisoner, by Mr. Griffin, on Suspicion of breaking open his Shop, and stealing a Parcel of Books. I took him (I think) on the 9th of August, in his Father's Hay-loft, at Tottenham-Court, pretty near the Turnpike, where I found him hid behind the Hay. I did not know any thing of this Robbery then, nor have I had any Discourse with him concerning it since. He made no Confession of any Kind to me; but he seem'd to be under a great Surprize when I took him, and made but little Resistance.</p>
               <p>This Witness inform'd the Court, that Hannah Prior was taken with an Apoplectick Fit the Day before this Trial came on; and that he call'd at her House, as he came to the Court, and found her but just alive.</p>

On the 15th of July, between Ten and Eleven in the Morning, I was going by his Door, and hearing a Noise in the House, I went in, and found the Wife of the Prisoner sitting in a Chair, by the Chimney Corner, in the Ground-Room, - the Shop, as they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173909060005"/> call'd it, where they sold Greens; she was holding one Arm with the other, and cry'd, O that wicked Villain! that wicked Villain has wrung my Arm to Pieces! The Prisoner was present, and said, - Did I do it, you old Toad? I only flung a Pint of Beer at you. I look'd down, and there was indeed a Slop upon the Ground by her. I did not stay long with her, but went home to my own House, about four Doors from the Prisoner's; and in about two Hours Time I heard an Outcry again, upon which I return'd, and saw the Deceased's Face all over gore Blood; he had drove her in that Condition out into the Street, and she cry'd, - O that Villain, - now he has done my Business! This was on the 15th of July, and I saw her no more from the 15th to Friday the 20th, and I happen'd to call to see her that Day, before she died. While I was then with her, he came up into the Room, and put his Arm under her Back, to raise her up; and, Gammer (says he to her, I think that was the Word) have you any thing to alledge against me? She shook her Head, and would not have spoke, but he urg'd her to speak, and in the mean time she had a Convulsion Fit, so he laid her down, and when she came to herself, he asked her again, if she had any thing to lay to his Charge? Upon this she put her Hand to her Throat, and said, - he had been the Death of her, but she forgave him, if the World would; the Prisoner immediately said, - That was the Word he wanted.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mrs. Cadmore, did not she fall down and hurt herself? And when I asked her, whether she had any thing to lay to my Charge, did not she say, - No?</p>

            . The Deceased was my Mother. The Prisoner marry'd her about a Year or 14 Months before she died, and during that time, he us'd her very barbarously. While I was at home with her, I never saw him strike her with his Hands, but he would heave Stones, Brick-bats, Pans, Pipkins, and Iron Bars at her, and bruise her in a gross Manner. Once he hit her on the Head, - on one Side of her Eye, and she frequently had black Bruises about her, tho' she did not keep up on these Occasions, because she work'd for her Bread; but on the 15th of July he struck her, and did her Business. About Ten or Eleven o'Clock that Morning, my Mother was a-dry; I went and fetched her a Pot of Beer; the Prisoner was at the Ale-house right against our House, and seeing the Beer come in, he flew over, and swore he would heave the Pot and the Beer at her: She had the Beer in her Right Hand, he beat it down, and with one Hand he caught hold of her Left Arm, which was lame, and twisted it; with his other Hand he grasped her Throat, and struck her Head against the Wall. Her Arm was very bad; but she did not feel much of that, by reason of the Misery she was in with her Throat; but when the Neighbours came in, she told them, That Rogue had broke her Arm again, - all to Pieces. About two Hours after this, he came in again, (he had been drinking) and he buffeted her in the Face with his Hat, till her Eyes ran down with Blood; and then he call'd her old Bitch, and bid her go and shew her Marks, and take him up again Tomorrow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. O fie upon you Mary!</p>
               <p>Spalding. He had cut her in the Head before, (I can't tell how long it was ago) and she had him taken up for it. The last ill Usage was on Sunday the 15th of July; on the Tuesday she took to her Bed, and never came down till she was brought down; she died the 20th.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why Mary, she died on the Friday.</p>
               <p>Spalding. Well, - that was the 20th. We spoke to a Surgeon about her the same Day that she died, but he did not like the Looks of the Prisoner, and he would not go up Stairs. I did not take Notice of any Marks upon her after she was dead, so I know nothing of Them; but she complain'd to the last of her Throat; he did not hold her by the Throat above half a Minute, yet to the Day she died she could not swallow any thing. She complain'd likewise of her Back, for something better than a Month before, I saw him give her a Kick on the Back, with some Violence, when she was on the Middle of the Stairs, and she slipped down three Stairs, after which she complain'd of her Back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mary, did I kick her down Stairs?</p>
               <p>Spalding. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No, my Dear, I never did; I only beat the Pot of Beer out of her Hand; I never did any thing else to her; - there she stands, and knows it. - She says, I buffeted her with my Hat, and made her Eyes bleed; - she always had sore Eyes.</p>
               <p>Spalding. When he buffeted her with his Hat, he cut the inside of her Eyes, with the Edge of it. I am sure the Blood came from the Inside; for her Eyes were afterwards wash'd, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173909060006"/> Corners were sore, and after I had washed away the Blood, it ouzed out for a Minute or two, - it did not run fast.</p>

            . I am very sorry I did come to the Place; I rather had been in Bed, sick, than (have) seen such a Sight. The Deceased and I were very great; she had nobody but me, she could tell her Secrets to; so on the Tuesday after he had done this Damage, she sent for me. I saw her in a dangerous Condition, and she told me she was very bad; her Neck was very sore, and she complained very much of her Back. I told her she had catched Cold, - no, no, (she said) my Husband came home in a drunken Manner, and pinch'd my Throat, and struck my Head against the Brick-wall, and it has been my Death. She was a poor Woman, like myself, and she used to go a Shoring (picking up what she could find upon the Shores, when the Tide was down, for Firing) and about a Week before this Hurt was done her, she fell down on the Shore, and hurt her Arm, and was very bad with it then, but she now complain'd of nothing but her Back and her Throat.</p>

I saw the Deceased on the Wednesday and on the Thursday before she died, and the Prisoner then shew'd all Love and Kindness to her, and spoke to her as a Husband should speak to a Wife. She bid him go to Work; but he would make much of her, and sit by her; then she bid him go away: She did not like to see him, and told him he had done what he should not have done to her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. O fie upon you!</p>
               <p>Lutolph. On the Day she died he came to her again; and said, Gammer, Mrs. Fox and Mrs. Poor want to come and see you; she told him, she did not care to see them; but I persuaded her to bear no Malice; so they came with the Prisoner to the Side of the Bed, and he said to the Deceased, - People say I killed you, and that I shall be hanged for you, now tell before Mrs. Fox and Mrs. Poor if I killed you: He took her by the Shoulder to raise her up, and she fell in a Convulsion Fit; when she came to herself, he asked her Forgiveness; how can you (said she) ask Forgiveness of me? I will forgive you if the World will.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. O mind what you say.</p>
               <p>Lutolph. Yes, I do. - After she said she would forgive him, he turned himself round on his Foot, and said, - a T-rd for you all, that is all I wanted. Before she died, she desired me and another to lay her out, and then we should see (she said) what she had gone through; She died that Day; we laid her out about Ten o'Clock that Night, and only observ'd that her Neck was swelled; but next Morning it was very black a Hand's Breadth, and as far(we imagin'd) as he had grasp'd. While she was alive, her Throat was so swell'd that she could not swallow a Quarter of a Tea-spoonful, nor could she pin her Cap.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I ever take her by the Throat? Indeed I did not.</p>

She told us the Prisoner had pinch'd her Throat in such a Manner, that it was the Occasion of her Death.

            , Surgeon. I view'd the Body of the Deceased three Days after her Death; she was terribly bruised all over her Body, from Head to Foot, her Sides and her Back in particular; and there was a large Tumor on the Left Side of her Throat, which was very black, and which, I imagine, was occasioned by pinching or strangling. The Coats of the Gullet were putrify'd, and in the Passage into the Stomach there was extravasated Blood, which had turn'd into Pus or Matter; and this occasioned the Soreness which prevented her swallowing, and, in my Opinion, was the Cause of her Death. On her Back, between her Shoulders, were some black Places, as broad as the Palm of my Hand, which I imagin'd were made by beating or kicking. On her left Side, and just under her Breast were great Marks of Violence; but I did not find her Arm fractur'd, I believe the Disorder in her Throat might occasion her Death, and that the other ill Usage she had received might hasten it.</p>

I went, and saw the Child in a Meadow, covered with a little Grass. It had been taken out of the River before I came, and did not seem to be swelled, or to have any Water in its Body; but on the left side of the Head it had had a Blow; the Blood was congealed, and the Place was so soft, that I could have thrust my Finger into the Scull: I took it to the Stock-house, and on Monday the Overseers of the Poor sent to Mr Wright, the Coroner, for Letters to bury it. While they were gone, a Woman came to me, and told me she suspected the Prisoner, who worked in the Gardens, and gathered Fruit. I went after her, but did not take her; the Overseers of Teddington brought her to us, and our Churchwardens ordered me to get her a Bed, because she was not in a fit Condition to be sent to Newgate. On Wednesday the Coroner sat on the Body, and he ordered me to shew it to the Prisoner. She begged I would not bring it near her, for (said she) 'tis my own Child, - born of my own Body. I asked her how she could tell That, unless she saw it? She said, it was, and she was very sorry for it: But she did not see it, nor would she suffer me to open the Coffin. When she was first brought to us, we told her under what Circumstances we found the Child, and she did not then say any Thing to it; but on Thursday Night I sat up with her, and in the Middle of the Night she asked me, if I had been to see after John Gadd? I told her no, I did not know him. She said he was at Drayton; that he went there last Monday, and had taken a Field of Wheat to reap; that she was with him last Sunday Night, and was to have met him again had she not been taken.</p>

She said, yes; she was delivered on the Monday before, in a Field as she was going over a Style, and some Men coming by, she went away and left the Child behind. I told her, that Story did not appear feasible, and asked her if it was born alive? She said it was not: And I reply'd I was sure it was born alive by its Head; for it was very much bruised and swelled, and the Blood was congeal'd, which I apprehend it would not have been, had it been born dead. After I had told her I was a Midwife, and it would be better for her to tell me the Truth; she said - then, Mrs. Midwife, I will tell you the Truth: - The Child was born alive, and liv'd a Quarter of an Hour, but as she was sitting in Pain by the River-side, with the Child in her Lap, it rolled out of her Lap into the Water. I asked her again, how long it liv'd, and what she wrapp'd it in? She said, it lived half an Hour; that she tore a Piece of her Apron to wrap it, and that it had been dead half an Hour, or an Hour before she threw it in. I enquired of her, if she had made any Preparation for its being born? She told me, she had two Caps given her, but she had given them away again. The Child was brought to my House, before they carried it to the Cage; and I plainly saw its Death was occasioned by the Bruise on the Head, for no Water appeared in it, and it was very fresh when I first saw it.</p>

I was then on Horseback. Three Men on Foot came up to me, and clapped each of them a Pistol to me, and cry'd, - d-mn you, stop the Waggon, or you are a dead Man, They asked me if I had any Fire-Arms, or any Guard in the Waggon? I told them, - no, I had not; and that there was only an old Man in it, who was going to London. The Prisoner I believe was the Man who stood Guard over me while the others robbed the Waggon. I had a little Knowledge of him, for he visited me one Night upon the Road, near the same Place, about One o'Clock, in May last, and robbed the Waggon then, with one Man in his Company. The Moon at that time shone pretty bright, and I could discern something of him, for we had then a pretty deal of Talk together; and by his Size, his Voice, and Manner of Speaking, I verily believe he is one of the Men that robb'd me now; but this last Time it was dark, and I can't say I discerned his Face, but I remembered his Size and Voice, and was in Hopes he would have let me gone on, as he had robbed me so lately; but I was mistaken, for he came up with two others, and presenting their Pistols at me, they bid me stop the Waggon; I bid them stop it themselves, - I would not, - but they made me do it, and then the Prisoner (I apprehend) stood over me, while the other two got up into the Waggon, to see what they could find. They were in the Waggon near a Quarter of an Hour, and threw out a Chest of Drawers, a Portmanteau, a Trunk; and a Great Coat, with a Shirt in one of the Pockets, which one of them who had been in the Waggon put on; but on my telling them it was my Coat, the Man who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173909060009"/> guarded me bid him give it me again.

They asked Russel, (who was then driving the Waggon) whether any Body was in it, and whether he had any Fire-arms? He told them, no; and then a tall, brisk, active Man (such a Man as the Prisoner, by his Size and Voice) said to his two Companions, - d-mn you, get up into the Waggon. I am pretty sure the Prisoner is the Man. As soon as the two Men had got into the Waggon, they threw out a large Scale-beam, and a Horse's Harness; a Chest of Drawers, a Trunk, and a Portmanteau, which was wedged in between some Barrels of Beer. They came in at the Tail of the Waggon, and went out at the Head; but before they left it, one of them took my Coat which lay by me, with a Shirt in the Pocket, and put it on. I am Russel's Brother, and he being lame, I came up with him to help him. The Man (whom I take to be the Prisoner) talk'd to him about five Minutes. They were not long in doing what they were about.</p>

We afterwards search'd her House, and found these Sleeves which Mrs. Atwater own'd; Mrs. Kitchen said she had them from her Son, and he did not deny it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was sick when this Robbery was committed. Pray did I say I gave my Mother those Things?</p>
               <p>Becket. Yes: These Things (the Sleeves) were found in his Mother's Drawers, and when we had them before Mr. Deveil, he would had the Mother to have made herself an Evidence. He asked her, before the Prisoner, where she had them, and she said, - her Son made her a Present of them.</p>
               <p>

            . I keep a publick House in King street, St. Ann's. The Prisoner came to lodge at my House on the 2nd of June; he lodg'd there seven Weeks, and behaved well; I never catch'd any thing upon him He lay abroad two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173909060010"/> Nights in the Time; but I don't know when it was: He was sick when he first came, and had a Wound in the Face, but I don't know how it was caus'd: He had a Nurse with him a good while. I once ask'd him how his Face came to be hurt, and he told me, he had been quarrelling and fighting.</p>
               <p>- Bold. I nursed the Prisoner, but I know nothing of his Illness: I came the 2d of June, and was with him seven Weeks; I sat up with him four Nights, and then I used to go home; I did not stay with him every Night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. These Things were brought into Mr. Nicholene's House, and I gave them to my Mother to dispose of.</p>
               <p>Bold. I saw his Mother bring some Things into that House, but what they were, I can't tell. <rs id="t17390906-9-verdict49" type="verdictDescription">

I did not stay long in the House, - 'twas not above ten Minutes, or a Quarter of an Hour, and indeed I did not miss my Watch till next Morning. How I came to go to this private House with them, at that Time o'Night, - I can't tell. - They asked me to give them a Dram; and I was in Liquor. I miss'd my Watch next Morning; and hearing the Prisoner had it, I got a Warrant, and took her up: While we were carrying her along, she desired I would go back with her, and accordingly I did, and she return'd me the Watch, the Seal, and the King's Road Ticket; but she said it was not she who took it from me, she told me the other Woman took it, and gave it to her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Pray did not the other Woman - sit upon your Knee?</p>

               <p>Prisoner. When he and I went into this House, we went up Stairs together; and the other Woman was jealous, because he took more Notice of me, than he did of her, and so she went to him, and sat upon his Knee.</p>

Her Character! - as to that, - I can't talk about that: But the Man did come in with the Women, and the Prisoner was one of them; I serv'd them with Liquor; they had five Half-pints of Wine, and after the last Half-pint was serv'd them, my Maid came down, and asked me, if I would take the Gentleman's Watch in Pawn for a Guinea? Money was short with me, and I told her I would not. The Maid that serv'd them with Liquor, was not the other Person - who sat upon his Knee, and that's all I know of the Matter.</p>

They had five Half-pints of Wine, and when the Reckoning came to be paid, the Gentleman gave me - but half a Crown, and a Piece of Paper, and told me he had no more Money; then he pull'd out his Watch, and desired me to go down to my Mistress and get a Guinea upon it: My Mistress would not lend the Money, so I carried it up to him again, and I saw him give it to the other Woman who was then with him - not to the Prisoner.

The Prosecutor lost his Watch on Sunday Night; and on Monday Night as I was out - looking for my Husband, the Prosecutor laid hold of me in Oxendon-street; I told him I did not know him really; come, come (says he) is signifies nothing for you to deny it, - You have got my Watch, and if you won't go with me, I will swear a Robbery against you; I ask'd him where he lost it? He told me, - at such a House. I went with him thither, and the People knew nothing of me. Upon this he treated me with a Pot of Beet, asked my Pardon, - and so we parted.</p>

            . On Tuesday Night, after the Man had lost his Watch, I was drinking at the Butchers Arms, the Corner of Lombard-Court, and there I saw the Prisoner in Custody of a Constable. In a little time they went out, and came in again in half an Hour; and then the Gentleman told the Constable, he must discharge the Prisoner, for he had nothing to say against her: The Constable said, he could not do it, without carrying her before a Justice; no Justice was to be found, so the Constable would have carry'd her to the Round-house; but the Landlord said, the Prisoner was a Gentlewoman of - such Honour, - that she would to be sure come again in the Morning; so the Constable took her Word, and she accordingly came.</p>

               <p>Counc. You say you remember their going out to be married on the 31st of August.</p>
               <p>Wilson. Yes, very well: It was on a Sunday Morning, twenty-seven Years ago. I might very well remember it, for I was married to her Father five Years before, at the same Church, by Dr. Richardson.</p>
               <p>Counc. You say they lived together five or six Years afterward.</p>
               <p>Wilson. Between six and seven they lived together, and then Tom. Fowke (the Prisoner) left her, and she was forced to go to the Parish where he served his time, for Relief of her and her two Children. When she was sick, I saw her, and she died with Grief.</p>
               <p>Counc. When was the last Time you saw her alive?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I believe it was two Years before she died, less than two Years, but I heard from her within that time. 'Tis now about 5 Years since I saw her, - within five Years, I am sure of it, - but I am old and don't remember particular Days. He cohabited with her sometime after the Marriage at my House, and they lived together six or seven Years I dressed the Wedding Dinner,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173909060013"/> tho' I did not go to the Wedding. We were not young Folks, nor so flashy as to want to go to Weddings.</p>
               <p>Counc. You say he lived with her six or seven Years?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Yes: And after that he left her, and liv'd upon the Strole, and lov'd to gad about, as Men do too much that have the Breeches, and she was forced to put herself and Children on the Parish, while he lived where he pleased, as most Men like to do.</p>

After the Prisoner left her, she made her Application to this Raddish, who was Clerk to a Brewer, and kept an Alehouse, and he took her to be his 24th of April 1736, because I was then at work, at Joiners Hall, and having 15c.wt. and one Quarter of Lead to carry, I went there to hasten the Carman, and this appears by my Books.</p>

            . I knew Sarah Parsley: she lived with me sixteen or seventeen Years, or upwards. She died the 6th of September 1736, and was, (I think) buried on the 9th.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173909060014"/>Council. Do you know the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Raddish. No; but I have seen him at my House several times before the Death of the Woman, and he has seen her often at my House.</p>
               <p>Council. Have you seen him at your House, within nine or 10 Years last past?</p>
               <p>Raddish. I have seen him who they said was her Husband; but I never spake three Words to him in my Life; - I don't know him; I never saw him to take Notice of him; but I have seen him, and when he has been gone, People have told me, That Man was Sarah Parsley's Husband. He has been often at our House.</p>
               <p>The Witness being old, and his Sight weak, he was ordered to go to the Bar, and look at the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Council. Now you have seen him, do you know him? Have you ever seen him before?</p>
               <p>Raddish. Yes: I reckon he is the Man; I have seen him at my House; but I cannot justly tell how long before her Death: I believe it might be a Year. This was the last Time I saw him, and before he went out of the House, I sat down by him, and when he was gone, the People told me he was Sarah Parsley's Husband.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did he then see Sarah Parsley?</p>
               <p>Raddish. I don't know whether she was dead or alive then.</p>
               <p>Counc. Just now you said it was before her Death.</p>
               <p>Raddish. I can't well tell when it was.</p>
               <p>Counc. At the time this Man was in your House, did she come into the Room to you?</p>
               <p>Raddish. She did not then; there was only he and I in the Room: I don't know where she was at that time: She commonly went out of the House when he came in, and staid till he was gone.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did he ever come but that Time?</p>
               <p>Raddish. As they told me, he had been there a great many times; but I never saw him to know him but that time: and then I sat down with him, and talk'd with him, about its being fine Weather - a fine Season; but I was not with him Half a Quarter of an Hour. When he went out, the Neighbours asked me if I knew who that Man was? I said no; they told me it was Sarah Fowkes's Husband: And I am sure she was then alive.</p>
               <p>Counc. And how long is this ago?</p>
               <p>Raddish. About four or five Years ago. The Prisoner is the Man; I believe he is the Man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Crane. About ten Years ago, the Prisoner and I went into Raddish's House, and had a Pot of Beer; but I did not see his Wife. He reported that she lived with Raddish, and was his Whore; this was about eight or nine Years ago; he often said, she was a Whore and a Bitch, and lived with old Raddish, and tuck'd him up, and lay with him. This he often said, between eight and nine Years ago. I am positive it was within nine Years, and that within that Time I have asked him, When he saw his Wife? And he has said, - D-mn her, I have not seen her, - so long. We often talked about her; I have had some Conversation with him since that Time; but his Wife was not mentioned, except once, and that was about three Months ago; I then saw him in the Tipstaff's House, and ask'd him, how he could be so base, to marry another Woman, when his first Wife was alive? D-mn it, (said he) what's that to you?</p>
               <p>Counc. How long ago is it since you had any Conversation with him about his Wife, in her Life-Time?</p>
               <p>Crane. I can't be positive to half a Year. 'Tis nine Years ago, or thereabout.</p>
               <p>Counc. Are you sure it was within ten Years, or eleven Years?</p>
               <p>Crane. No.</p>
               <p>Council to Raddish. Did not she die at your House?</p>
               <p>Raddish. Yes.</p>

On the 20th of August, about Three o'Clock in the Afternoon, I lay down on a Bed in a Closet behind the Room where the Accident happened. About Six, some Carpenters, who were at Work in the Yard, making a Noise, I 'wak'd, and heard the Word - Bitch, in the little Room. 'Twas a small Drinking-Room on the Ground-Floor, and parted off from the Room where I lay by a Single-deal Partition, pannell'd. I imagin'd somebody was abusing my Wife, so I got up; and as I was coming through this little Room, I saw the Prisoner with his Left Arm round the Deceased's Neck, and his Right Hand somewhere on her Breast. Lord, Sir, said I, what's the Matter! His Answer was, - The Gentlewoman is in a Fit! In a Fit, said I! I am afraid 'tis something worse; how came her Mouth to be so bloody? For the Blood ran from her Mouth down her Stays and her Apron, and she was sitting in a Chair, with her Head lolling back over his Arm: I called three times for Water, and the fourth time it was brought: I sprinkled some in her Face, and endeavoured to make her drink some; but she was gone. While I was doing this, the Prisoner escaped out of the Room, and left some new Linnen behind him, and a little Child of the Deceased followed him, crying. Some small Time after this, another Child of the Deceased came to our House, and said, Lord, Sir! I hear my Mother is killed, pray let me see her. I told him his Mother was better, and asked him where his Mother used to buy Linnen? He told me - at the Corner of Carnaby Market. I took the Child and the Linnen to the Place, and the Man knew it, and said it was bought of him about Four o'Clock that Evening. The Boy then told us the Prisoner's Name was Watts, and that he used to meet his Mother at one Carter's, the Red Cross in May-Fair. We went thither, and Carter said the Prisoner had not been there for three or four Days; he believed we might find him at Kensington, where he was Usher in a School. At Kensington we enquired after him a good while to no Purpose; but at last, one who was with us having some Acquaintance with Carter's Son, (who was Coachman to Madam Jacob at Kensington) he put us upon going to the Stables where the Coachman lay. When we came there, we ask'd if Mr. Watts was not there? and, to prevent Suspicion, I shamm'd drunk, and said, I would drink no more. Carter's Son spoke to us out of a Window, and asked us what we wanted with him? We told him we wanted to speak with him: Upon which he [Carter] came down and open'd the Door: Then we got in, and upon searching the Hay-loft, I observed some Straw to stand up against the Wall; I put it aside with my Stick, and found the Prisoner behind it. We searched him, and found nothing upon him but his Penknife. His Ruffles and his Right Hand were bloody, and he had the same Shirt on when we carry'd him before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. Was the Door of the Room in which you was asleep lock'd, or unlock'd?</p>
               <p>Pemberton. There is a Lock to it; but whether it was lock'd or no, I can't tell. 'Twas not lock'd when I came out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Is there not a Window in the Room where this happen'd, which looks into the Yard where the Carpenters were at Work?</p>
               <p>Pemberton. Yes; and there is a Glass Door, with a Curtain before it, which looks into the Common Drinking Room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I call for Water, and desire Assistance?</p>
               <p>Pemberton. Not, as I remember.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not you in Liquor at that Time?</p>
               <p>Pemberton. I was as sober then, as I am now.</p>

That immediately afterward, he heard a Woman was dead in the House; upon which he went in, and found her sitting in a Chair, bleeding at the Mouth, and her Head lolling on one Side. That he thought proper to wipe the blood out of her Mouth, and finding her dead, he went to Mr. Despagnol's, to enquire if any body had been to fetch him to a Woman at this House, and was informed, that no one had been there for above an Hour past, upon which he told them, the Woman had not been dead above half an Hour. He added, That he saw the Prisoner the Day after he was taken, and was positive he was the Man that he directed to Mr. Despagnol's. That he had sat at the Door about half an Hour, before the Prisoner came out; that the Place where he sat, was about the Breadth of the Court from the Room in which the Woman died, and that the Prisoner came out at the Back-door.</p>

She was a Stranger to me, but yet I would go and drink with her, and I had my Watch when I went into the House with her, for I look'd to see what it was a Clock, when I was about 3 or 400 Yards from the Door. While we were above Stairs together, we only sat talking together, - she on one Chair, and I on another, we and after we had talk'd and drank together, we came down Stairs, and in the Entry she pick'd the Watch out of my Fob; - 'twas not in the Room, - 'twas in the Entry, and I felt her Hand in the Pocket when she took it out: As soon as she had pull'd it away from me, she ran into another House: I did not cry, Stop Thief, but I ran after her, and could not overtake her before she got into the House; and when I enquired for her at that House, the People told me there was no such Woman there.

               <p>Summer. But I am sure I was robb'd the 29th of July. She took the Money out of my Hand the 29th, and I charge her only, with taking it in the Warrant: I am positive she is the Woman. I saw her (I believe) once before, in Smithfield; she is a remarkable Woman, and is a little humpback'd.</p>

               <p>Summer. I did ask him to give me some of it again, before he was committed; I should have been glad to have got some of it again. <rs id="t17390906-38-verdict176" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>It appear'd from the Evidence, that Thorn kept a Chandler's Shop, and the Deceased meeting with the Prisoner there, the Deceased call'd the Prisoner Black-guard Rogue and Rascal, and told him he was a Bailiff's Follower, and they were worse than Dogs; that the Prisoner call'd him Blockhead, and bid him be quiet, but the Deceased (being a little in Liquor) went up to him, threw his Hat in the Prisoner's Face, and tore his Coat; upon which the Prisoner, as he sat upon a little Table, gave the Deceased a little Kick on the Backside, and bid him be gone; but he (the Deceased) turn'd, and gave the Prisoner a Blow in the Face, and then they laid hold of each other, and fell to the Ground together. The Prisoner got up, and the Deceased told him, - he would do for him. The Witnesses gave no farther Account of Blows, or Kicks, only that the Prisoner complain'd of the Deceased's having pull'd him twice by the Nose, and the Deceased told him it was no more than he deserv'd.</p>
               <p>Other Witness deposed, That the Deceased being in Extremity in Thorn's House after the Fray, they would have had him blooded, but Mrs. Thorn declared, she'd have none of his nasty Blood there; upon which he was carried Home, and declared to his Death, that the Prisoner had murdered him, and that when he lay upon the Ground, Mr. Thorn and one Meredith (a lame Man) and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173909060019"/> Prisoner, each of them gave him a Kick. Mr. Wood (A Surgeon) who attended him 'till he died, gave the same Account of the Deceased's Declarations: And having opened his Body after his Death, he found the Guts swelled, a Quart (or more) of Water and Blood in the Cavity of the Belly, an Ounce of Blood in the Cavity of the Stomach, and his Bladder burst at the Bottom, but no outward Marks of Violence.</p>

I had my Watch at a Quarter past Ten, and miss'd it before she went down Stairs. We had been pretty near together, and I felt her pluck something out of my Pocket, but I could not tell what it was: As soon as I miss'd it, I ran down Stairs after the Prisoner, and met a Woman upon the Stairs, and she blew the Candle out, to prevent my following her; but I pursu'd her, and found her out; and took her last Friday, but she would confess nothing, and I have never seen my Watch since.</p>

I am sure I had it when I first went thither, for I pull'd it out to tell the Fellow that ran from her what it was a Clock; but then this uninhabited Place is a Quarter of a Mile from the Place where I pull'd it out. We staid in this uninhabited Place together till Four o'Clock in the Morning; I miss'd it indeed half an Hour after I got there; and I told her I had lost it, but she knew nothing of the Matter. At last I heard it click in her Bosom, and then I struck her, and she cry'd out Murder; yet still she deny'd it, and so the Prisoner and I came together about Four o'Clock into the Town, and meeting with an Hostler that formerly belong'd to the Duke of Ormond, I told him of my Loss, and we all three went back to this uninhabited Place to look for my Watch, but 'twas not to be found; we hunted about in the Stable, (where we had been together) but we could not find it. She deny'd it all this time, and while I was talking to the Hostler, she ran away; but she was taken on Sunday Night following, and I went to her at a publick House at Kensington; there I heard the Watch was pawn'd at the Three Bowls, in Old Soho, and at that Place I found it. When I came out of the Justice's House with her, I asked her - how she could be so cross, as not to give me my Watch? And she told me, she would have given it me, if I had not beat her,</p>
