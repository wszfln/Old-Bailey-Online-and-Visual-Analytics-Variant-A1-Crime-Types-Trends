He seem'd to be well pleas'd with them, and call'd for Pen and Ink to set down the Weight and Value. I began to suspect that he wanted to make off, and I happen'd to think right, for he took up the two Rings and ran out; I follow'd, as well as the Gout would let me, and cry'd, Stop Thief! He was soon seiz'd, and when I came up to him he had the two Rings in his Hand, and I took them out my self.</p>

I observed Brian drawing something under her Peticoats with a Hitch and a Hitch thus - but did not then imagine she had stole any thing, for I thought her Peticoat was got loose and that she was tying it up, and I did not care to speak of it because there were some Men in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173306280003"/> Shop.

But the Linen might be folded up so as not easily to be felt by such a slight Search.

               <p>Mr. Brian. No; but she came out and gave it me directly.</p>

               <p>Mr. Brian. She's gone out of the Way, under Pretence of going to see her Mother.</p>

We staid a Quarter of an Hoor below Stairs, and then I paid for the Leequor and my Loadging, and I and the Preesoner went up tull Beed, and Mrs. Humphries lighted us. I undrest me and got intull the Beed, but I tuck oot my Watch to see what a Cloak it was, and it was part II. Then I put it intull my Fobe and laid my Breeks under my Heed. But the Preesoner wonno' strip, but laid her sell doon by me wi' her Clothes on.</p>

Why, Mrs. Buruess, because you beat me before the Justice, you thenk tull frighten me now, but it wonno' do, troath wull it not. - And so, my Lord, I desir'd Mrs. Humphries to caw me up by sax a Cloak in the Moarning; and than, being pretty weel in for't, I sell faist asleep. Accordingly next Moarning Mrs. Humphries came tull, my Beed-side and wak'd me. Loard, Sir, quo' she, I am afraid this Betch has roab'd ye, for she has brock open my Door and run awa'.</p>

               <p>Humph. You have reason to say so, indeed. This Man came in with the Prisoner. I lighted them up to Bed. I saw him pull out his Watch, and put it into his Fob again. Then he bid me call him up at 6 in the Morning, and so I left them together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Hark you, Landlady, don't you remember that you and your Husband were whipt for keeping a Bawdy-House?</p>
               <p>Humph. What's that to you? - Next Morning I found my Door broke open I ran up in a Fright, and waked the Prosecutor. He said he had lost his Watch and 2 Rings, and a Guinea and half. I told him she had a Loadging in the Neighbourhood, and I'd find her if possible, but when I went thither she was gone from thence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Hussy, you lie; you are a vile Toad, a vile old Baud; you lie, you lie, you lie.</p>
               <p>Humph. Then the Prosecutor took me up the same Morning ( it was Wednesday ) and the Prisoner was taken at Night. I bid her help the Man to his Watch again, but she said it was too far gone; but if I would say that I had never seen the Watch, we should both be discharged.</p>

            , Constable. The Prisoner was brought to the Watch House between 10 and 11 on Wednesday Night. I searched her, and found this Brass Mourning Ring clenched in her Hand. I have lately had her 4 or 5 times in my Custody for the like Facts.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Well, if you have, that's no reason I must be guilty of this too. So many against one is a little hard. It's well known I am no bold Woman. He pick'd me up, and said he would lye with me, if I could carry him to an honest House, and I went with him to Mother Humphries's, tho' much against my Will, but he would take no Denial. He gave her a Shilling for a Loadging. She sent for a Pint of Anniseed, and the reckoning came to a Crown, which be paid, and then we went up to Bed. He gave me 3s. 6d. but I insisted upon more, and then he put the Ring upon my Finger. As for the Watch, he gave it me to look upon, and I might forget to give it him again.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any Witnesses?</p>

This provok'd me so far, that I was going to strike the Chairman, when presently the Prisoner came up and struck me in the Face, and so he and I went to fighting. He fell down and pulled me over him, at which time I felt my Watch drawn from me. The Mob soon gather'd about us, but upon his getting up they clear'd the Way, and made a Ring that we might have room to fight; but upon my saying I had lost my Watch, he ran away.</p>

There are Steps to the Door, and going up, I put the Key into the Lock to open it, at which Time I felt somebody behind me, and fearing it was some Rogue who intended to get into the House, I turn'd about suddenly and cry'd out. He made an Offer to strike me, and I believe would have knock'd me down, but being aware of it, I partly shunn'd the Force of the Blow. so that he did not hurt me. Upon which he catch'd hold of my Cloak and tore the String (and if the String had not been torn, he pull'd 10 hard that I might have been choak'd). However, I got hold of one part of the Cloak, and he still pull'd to get it from me. My crying out had alarm'd some of the Neighbours, and

They said he had robb'd Mrs. Woodnot ; they had not hold of the Prisoner, but they [and others ] surrounded him. I ask'd them why they did not secure him? They said, they could not stay, because they were obliged to wait upon their Matter ( Mistress ) but they hop'd I would take care of him, and so he was deliver'd to me. I collar'd him, and brought him back up the Court, attended by several others. After he had struggled hard to get away, but without Success, the People pressing about him, Sir, says he, you have me now in your power, but I hope you won't let me be stifled, give me liberty to breathe a little. By all means, says I, and so the Crowd making way, he set his Back against the Wall, but I still held him by the Collar; he put his Hand down, but whether to his Pocket or Bosom I cannot be certain, and presently the People cry'd, Have a Care! there's a Pistol! I saw the Pistol presented at my Head, but my surprise was so great that I cannot take upon me to say, whether 'twas he or any other who held it. The Pistol was immediately fir'd but as it happen'd no Mischief was done. Upon this I carry'd him, and threw him down, and others assisting we tyed him, and carry'd him to the Watch-house.</p>

            , Carpenter. My House is next but one to the Prosecutor's, I heard her cry, Murder! Stop Thief! upon which I ran out, and saw the Prisoner then disengaging himself from her. He ran away, I cry'd out, Stop Thief, and so did he too; but however, he was stopt by a Chairman. I had left my Door open, and as soon as I saw he was taken, I went back to lock it, which when I'd done, I went down the Court again, and met Mr. Hilliard, and others bringing the Prisoner up. The Prisoner said he was an innocent lame Man, and never did an ill Thing in his Life. After some struggle, he said, he hop'd we'd give him leave to fetch his Breath; and so setting his Back against the Wall, I saw him put his Hand downward to his Pocket or Bosom, I can't say which, and pull out a Pistol and fire it. Upon which Mr. Hilliard knock'd him down, and I wrenched the Pistol out of his Hand, and then we bound him and search'd him. We found loose Gun-powder in every Pocket, and in one there were 2 or 3 Cartridges, and some small pimple Stones (Pebbles) which I suppose were to serve for Bullets. We were forced to carry him by main Strength to the Watch-house, for he would not walk one step that way; it was then too late to go before the Justice, and so for better Security we carry'd him the same Night from the Watch-house to the Gate-house. Next Day I went in the Coach with him to Newgate, and going along, he damn'd me for a Son of a Bitch, and swore if he had a Knife, he'd stick me in the Guts.</p>

            , Esq, Sept. 29. 1719, between 9 and  at Night. The Prosecutor being in a Coach in Pall-Mall, the Prisoner cut the Back of the Coach, and snatch'd off the Wig, the Jury found him guilty Capitally, but he was afterwards Repriev'd, and order'd for Transportation. See his Tryal in the SESSIONS-PAPER for October 1719.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As for the Pistol and Powder, I can give a good Account how I came by them. I was Cook of a Ship, that was just come from New-England, in Company with another Ship, and our Captain invited the other Captain on board our Ship, and that Captain brought his Cook with him; and this Cook was more expert than I, in taking, and telling Stories and singing a Song, and besides, he could dance, and tumble, and play twenty Tricks to make Diversion; and your Captains, you know loe to have their Frolicks when they are at Sea. So that this Captain set great Store by this Cook, and this Cook took a great liking to me, and say he, Let's take some Cartridges of Powder, and make Wildfire to run about the Streets, for the Glory of God, that we are come safe to old England ; and so I came by this Powder, sweet Jesus Almighty knows it to be true. And as for the Pistol, this Cook was an, Flannovernia and a loyal Soul he was to his Majesty, and so he gave me this Pistol, and we drunk our Sovereign Lord King George's Health, and at every Glass we fir'd off a Pistol in honour of the Royal Family; and the Lord above knows, that this is the whole truth of the Matter, and that I had this Pistol on no other Account than to shew my Loyalty.</p>
               <p>Court. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The same Day that I was taken too.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was the Ship ?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At Limehouse.</p>
               <p>Court. And how came you to Angel-Court.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. God knows that, for I was elevated, and can't give a particular Account ; only I remember we came from on board about 4 in the Afternoon, and this Cook row'd us a-shore with the wrong Ends of the Oars; and I believe he had some relations that liv'd about Angel-Court, and so I might bear him Company; and tho' I had a Pistol and Powder, I had no Ball.</p>
               <p>Court. But it seems you had small Pebbles. How came you by them?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Pebbles ? Why I remember we were heaving Ballast the Day before, and the Cook and I threw many a Shovelful of Ballast at one another for Sport, and so I suppose some of it got into my Pocket. I have a great many Captains to speak to my Character, tho' it happens that none of them are here; but I am an innocent lame Man, and I further, it is wilful Murder.

The Prisoner and her Husband and another Man and Woman were sitting together, and when I had paid my reckoning and was going, the Prisoner's Husband ask'd me, if I would not drink with them? Yes, I said, I am not Charish. I staid till 2 Tankards were brought in, and then I paid 6 d. which was more than my sha e came to; they saw which Pocket I put my Money into, and if they had seen my Watch too, I might have lost that. I went out and stood to make water, when in a minute, I felt the Prisoner's Hand in my Pocket, I catch'd hold of her wrist, and heard the Money chink in her Hand, but before I could get it from her, she had shifted it to the other Woman who stood close to her. The Prisoner was not out of my Hands, till I gave her to the Watch, but the other Woman went off directly. I had half a Guinea, 6s. 6d. and some Copper in my Pocket, all which was then taken from me.</p>

Her Husband said, it was worth 15 or 16 s. a Yard, and he would give us 8 s. a Yard for it, and we agreed, and he gave us 2 Guineas cown, which the Prisoner and I divided equally betwixt us. And the Prisoner went several time, afterwards and brought me 3 or 4 s. at a time, till I had receiv'd 15 or 16s for the Remainder of my Share.</p>

They demanded my Money; I put my Hand in one Pocket and gave them what I had there, but how much I cannot be certain. They took my Hat and Cane; but upon my a king for my Cane again, they return'd it to me. I believe they left me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173306280012"/> sooner than they wou'd have done for fear of the Drovers, who come that Road on Thursday Nights. It was dark, and I cannot swear to either of the Prisoners. I heard of them afterwards by means of an Advertisement in a News-Paper.</p>

            . I went to see the Races at Hampstead, and there I met the Prisoners; from thence we went to the Shop on Sn-Hill, where we had 2 or 3 Pints of Beer, and staid till between 9 and 10. Then says Tanner, I must have Money to fetch me. out of Pawn. God damn your, let's go out all together; for he had stole a Haymaker's Coat in the Fields, and I had pawn'd it for him; so we agreed, and went to the Barley-Mow and sit upon the Bench. When we had waited about half an Hour, a Man (about the Size of the Prosecutor) came by. I collar'd him with one Hand, and held a Pistol in the other. Tanner stood by with a Knife; and Cecil, with another Knife, struck the Gentleman on the Head. Tanner took his Hat, Cane, and Money; I think there was 10 s. The Gentleman said we had used him ill, and cut his Nose, and desired us to return his Cane, which we did. Then we went to the Haycocks near Hoxton, and lay till Morning, when Tanner looking on the Hat said, God damn you, how came this Cut? Why, says Cecil, I did it. God damn you, says Tanner again, how could you be so barbarous? We not thinking it proper to pawn the Hat, because of the Cut, I gave them a Shilling a-piece and took the Hat to myself; and so Tanner went to fetch his grey Coat out of Pawn (he has it on now) and I went home; but we had agreed to meet again at the White Bear in Old-street Square to play at Skittles. When I came to them, Tanner had won all Cecil's Money, and then he [Tanner] said he must go home to his Wife, for she had no Money, and he would come to us again. But not meeting us according to his Promise, I fear'd he was going to make himself an Evidence; and so, to be before-hand with him, I surrender'd myself directly to Mr. Cathery, the Constable, and he advertised the Robbery in the News. I became acquainted with the Prisoners at Whitehead's, and here is a Witness that saw us together the Day the Robbery was done.</p>

I parted with him on the Heath, and taking a Turn I met him again, and two Men with him, who, by the Glimpse I had of them, I believe were the Prisoners, and especially for next Morning I went to see my S Law Mrs. Whitehead, who at Mr. Jackson's in Brick-lane, in and there I found Kempson, and I saw lurking about the Door, and says I to Kempson, There's a young Man wants you, I suppose. Why do you think so? says he. Because (I said) I think I saw him with you at the Races. Well, says Kempson, let him walk. But at last Kempson went down to him, and my Sister's Husband coming to the Door, we all agreed to go to the Races again, so we went together about 2 a Clock, and by the Way they began some Discourse about a Robbery and a Hat, and Skickle and I walking a little before, he opened the Secret to me.

As we past by the Prisoner and another, who were leaning against a Post, the Prisoner said to the Deceased, Make haste home, young Man, or your Master will be angry, and won't give you another Holiday to Morrow. The Deceased answered, Suppose I have no Master, and what then? I was afraid of a Quarrel, and desired the Deceased to go along and not mind them. But he said, As I affront nobody, I won't take an Affront from anybody, and I'll revenge my own Cause. This occasioned more Words on both Sides, and I still urged the Deceased to go, but he bid me not be afraid, for he would do no Hurt. By this Time our three Friends were gone a pretty Way forward, but to prevent Mischief I called to them. Mr. Austin cry'd Hoy! and the Deceased cry'd Hoy to him again, and said to the Prisoner, Honesty, I was not alone ; I have got Company. Our Company came back, and Mr. Porter asked what was the Matter? I told him the Prisoner had affronted the Deceased, and he resented it. Upon this some angry Words past between them, and the Prisoner struck Porter in the Face, and the other Man struck the Deceased, and so they fell to fighting. In the Scuffle, the Deceased and the other Man were got on the other Side of the Way. The Prisoner and Porter fell together, and when they got up the Prisoner went off, and Porter staid to look for his Hat and Wig, but I had taken them up. Then the Deceased called to Porter, and said, Jemmy, Jemmy, I am stabb'd. I went over and took hold of him, and he said, That Man has stabb'd me. He did not name what Man, but the Prisoner was nearest him, for the other Man was gone. I called to our Acquaintance; the Prisoner ran; I cry'd Stop him, and they pursued him down Duke-street. I carried the Deceased to an Apothecary's Shop just by; the Apothecary's young Man advised me to go to Mr. Stevens the Surgeon, and coming out, I met a Croud with the Prisoner. - He lived but 21 Hours afterwards.

The Grissel between the Ribs was divided in two Places, the Caul hung out of one, and part of the Guts, as big as my Fist, out of the other: I reduced them.

I am sure it must he broke; for you might have heard the Sound of the Fall 20 Yards off.</p>

             stole these Pipes and Cocks about 2 o'Clock on Whitsunday Morning. Fish put us upon it; for he said he had been out all Night, and could tell us of a rare Chance. We did one Parcel till 9 at Night, and then carried it to Will. Green, in Stanhope-Street, Clare-Market, and sold it him for 19 s. 6 d. He called us good Boys, and bid us take Care. Then we went about Eleven the same Night, and got as much more, and hid it in a Dunghill by the Ditch-side; but it was found by a Boy who went there to ease himself, and so the Prosecutor came to hear of it, and we were taken the next Friday Morning by a Watchman, as we came out of Brown-low-Street with some Lead we had stole; and so I was made an Evidence. Green is run away. He was tried here about 7 Months ago for receiving stolen Goods  *.</p>
               <p>* It was for a Burglary and a Felony, in December last. See his Trial in the SESSIONS-PAPER, Numb. 1. page 13.</p>

I presently step'd back, and bid the Door-keeper of the Walks let me know if he saw any suspicious Persons loitering about there: A Boy came and told me, that he saw two Men pick a Gentleman's Pocket in the dark Passage by the Bookseller's Shop. I went to the Passage, took hold of the Prisoner, and saw him throw down a silk Handkerchief. Sir, says I, you must go with me. Sir, says he, I am a Gentleman; what d'ye mean? I could find no Constable, and so I took him to my own House; he fell on his Knees, and made many Protestations of his Innocence, but upon searching him, I found my Handkerchief in his Bosom. Then he said, he was no Pick-pocket himself, but was only retain'd by them, and had 1 s. 6 d. a Day to attend on them, and take what they stole.</p>
               <p>Rich. Smith. When my Father had brought the Prisoner home, the Prisoner kneel'd down and call'd Christ to witness that he never pick'd a Pocket in all his Life, tho' at the same time I saw him pull a Handkerchief out of his Pocket and put it into his Bosom; but when he found that my Father was resolved to search him thoroughly, he took it out of his Bosom again, and gave it to my Father, who own'd it; and then the Prisoner said, If it's your's, I can expect no Mercy.</p>

            . Aleck Watson and Jemmy Maddox, and I, stole the silver Dish out of the Prosecutor's Window, about 6 at Night. We raised up the Grate, and put a Stick under it to keep it from pinching our Fingers ; and so we drew the Dish out, and I carried it to Mrs. Walker's, a Brandy-shop in Cross-Lane, near Long-Acre, and she kept it for us all Night. Next Day, I and Watson, and Mattox, went with the Dish to James [William] Howard's, and he and Mattox went to sell it at an Ale-house (I think it was the Ship) in the Old-Bailey. I saw them go in with it, and I stood at the Door to watch, for fear they should run away with the Money. They brought me out one Guinea, and then they went in again and fetch'd six Guineas more, and so went to Mr. Rodes's, at the Goat and Leak in White-horse-Alley.</p>
               <p>Howard Where did we go first ?</p>
               <p>Baker. To The King's Head, the Backside of the Old-Bailey, and there we ran up a Score Then we went to the Ship Alehouse. I stay'd at the Old-Bailey -[Sessions house] Gate, leaning against a Post for half an Hour, and then you came out and brought a Guinea. Then we went and bought half a Goos, and carried it to Rodes's, where we stay'd two or three Hours, and drank Cherry-Beer and Brandy; and then went again to the King's-Head, and you and Mattox went to the Ship again, and brought six Guineas more. Then we took Coach and went to Mrs. Walker's in Cross-Lane, who had trusted us with Liquor till the Dish was sold, and she bought two Fowls and Bacon for us: There we divided the Money; we three had two Guineas a-piece, you had about 6 s. out of the odd Guinea, and the rest of it we spent in eating the Goose, and one thing or another. I had eight or nine and twenty Shillings left after I had paid Mrs. Walker. Watson and I lay together in St. Giles's, and we bought some new Clothes, and made a Noise about the Seven Dials, and

               <p>Watson. Where did you meet me in the Morning?</p>
               <p>Baker. At Buck's Brandy shop in St. Giles's, and from thence we went to Walker's in Cross-Lane, and about six at Night we went out a thieing.</p>
               <p>Watson. Who took the Dish?</p>

               <p>Watson. When was this ?</p>
               <p>Baker. I can't write nor read, but as near as I can guess, it was about the 5th of January. When we came to Howard with the Dish, Mrs. Walker lent him her Apron to hide it, but he thought that would not do, and so he went up into hisfs own Room, and brought down a Bag and put it in that, and so he carried it to the Ship.</p>

               <p>Baker. No; we stay'd at Clerkenwell because we had not Money to discharge the Reckoning till they brought the Guinea, and then we went to Rodes's, and from Rodes's they went for the six Guineas, and so to the King's-Head</p>
               <p>Court.

            . Mattox, Watson and Baker came into my House together towards the Evening, about half a Year ago, and called for Liquor. Mattox had a deep silver Dish under his Arm.</p>
               <p>Court. Baker swore that he carry'd the Dish.</p>
               <p>Walker. When they had run up 8 or 9 s. I asked them for the Money; they said if I would go with them they would pay me, I asked them if they thought I had nothing to do but to tag after their Tails when I was with Child and not well; they said, I should have a Coach, and so a Coach was called, and we drove to the Horn at Clerkenwell-Green. They had no Money to discharge the Coach, and so I paid 1 s. 6 d. for them. Mattox went from the Alehouse and fetch'd a young Man (I think his Name is Howard) who drank once, and then he and Mattox went out together, and when they return'd Mattox chang'd a Guinea, and paid for four Pints of Ale that we had had. They insisted upon my Eating something, and so we went to another House, and had a Quarter of a Goose.</p>
               <p>Court. How long was it after they brought the Dish, before you went with them ?</p>
               <p>C. Walker. Some Hours.</p>

               <p>Howard. At what time was it that you eat part of the Goose?</p>
               <p>C. Walker. I can't tell the Hour, but it was at Supper late at Night, and then from thence we all, but Howard, went home in a Coach; they sat me down at my Door, and then they discharged the Coach.</p>
               <p>Howard. Baker swore that we went to the Kings's-Head after we had eat the Goose; did you see me bring the Money, or have the Dish?</p>
               <p>C. Walker. No; Mattox brought the Money, and it was he that brought the Dish to my House.</p>
               <p>Howard. Baker charged Walker with the Dish.</p>
               <p>Baker. That was only for keeping it all Night.</p>
               <p>Court. She swears you took the Dish with you the same Night.</p>
               <p>Baker. No it was next Morning.</p>
               <p>Howard. Was not she taken up about the Dish?</p>
               <p>Baker. Yes.</p>
               <p>Howard. How came she to be discharged?</p>
               <p>Baker. Because she own'd the Dish and deliver'd it.</p>
               <p>Howard. Watson was discharged of this Dish last Sessions.</p>

I heard one or both of the Guineas they took from me fall, and one of the Men stoop'd, but I don't know whether they found 'em or not.</p>
               <p>Kelly. What did you lose two Guineas?</p>
               <p>Mr. Owen. Yes; I had two Guineas when I was in Golden-Square, which was but a little before.</p>

            . The Prisoner and I lodged together with Sam Quan +, who was hang'd in the Country for a Robbery about three Months ago. Sm Goodman was with us at Quan's, and about 11 at Night we went to see him home. We met the Prosecutor in one of the Streets in Covent Garden, where the Mercers live; Goodman hit him on the Shoulder, and bid him stand, and Kelly took two Guineas out of his Pocket, and drop'd them both on the Stones, I stoop'd and found one, but we lost t'other, for another Gentleman was coming by, and some Chairmen stood over the way, and saw us rob, so that we were forced to make off - Sam Goodman took a Gold Wire Ring off the Prosecutor's Finger.</p>
               <p>* Quan and Conway were try'd in London, for Robbing Job Nutton, in January 1731-2, but were acquitted. See the SESSIONS-PAPER for last Year, Numb. II. Part II. pag. 58.</p>
               <p>Court. Off his Finger, are you sure?</p>
               <p>Baker. We all reckon'd so, because it was a Ring, but we did not see where he took it from. He took a pair of Brass Studs to; as we were going away Kelly cut the Gentleman over the Eye, with the butt End of a Whip.</p>
               <p>Kelly. What time o' Night did we come into your Company?</p>
               <p>Baker. We all three lay at Quan's, and eat and drank together, and about 7 or 8 at Night, we went to

               <p>Kelly. You swore before Alderman Brocas, that the Gentleman was robb'd of 2 Guineas and a Watch, but now you know nothing of the Watch.</p>
               <p>Baker. No, I said I believ'd Goodman took his Watch, and we three said so that Night at Quan's House, and you your self spoke of it first, but next Day we heard it was no such thing. We thought so because Goodman pick'd the Gentleman's Pocket.</p>
               <p>Kelly. You said just now, that it was I that pick'd his Pocket.</p>
               <p>Baker Yes, you was fumbling about it, but Goodman push'd you away, and did it himself, and as he went to Sea the next Day, we thought he had snk the Watch.</p>
               <p>Kelly. But you swore that he took a Watch ?</p>
               <p>Court. Did you swear it positively?</p>

               <p>Kelly. Can you tell your Story over again?</p>
               <p>Baker. Yes, Goodman took the Gentleman by the Shoulder, and bid him stand, then Kelly put his Hand in his Pocket, and riffled him, and drop'd the Gold, and I pick'd up one Guinea.</p>
               <p>Kelly. Just now you said Goodman pick'd his Pocket.</p>
               <p>Baker. You and Goodman both riffl'd him, after we all four had push'd him up against a Door, and kept him fast, and when he was robb'd, Kelly struck him with a Whip, and made the Blood run down his Cheek.</p>

             they had riffled me they drew me from the Door, toward the Kennel, and one of them gave me a stroke over the the right Eye, I thought it was done with a Stick. I was laid up for 6 Weeks, and had two Surgeons to attend me here's the Scar to be seen.</p>
               <p>Kelly. How long was it after the Robbery before you saw the Gentleman again?</p>
               <p>Baker. He was out of Town last Sessions, and I did not see him till this Sessions.</p>
               <p>Kelly. It's strange when you saw him but once by Night that you should know him again, half a Year afterwards ?</p>

I think they were dark Colour, but I can't tell justly, because we were all in a Surprize; for we were pursu'd in a Minute by the Chairmen and Watchmen, and I ran across Covent Garden, and so directly to Quan's; and Kelly and I had 2 or 3 Words, and he said, You Dog I have a good mind to hang you, and so I went and surrender'd myself, and inform'd against him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Owen. I called the Watch, but whether it was before or after the Blow, I cannot tell, and immediately the Street was full of People - My Cloaths were a Chocolate Colour. - I saw Baker one Day this Week at Hicks's-Hall, and he said he knew me.</p>
               <p>Cath. Walker. The Prisoners and Baker have used my Shop, but it was but seldom; I remember they were there in February last, and had two half Pints of Gin, and Baker said, I must take his Buckles or go without my Money.</p>

Baker would sometimes come and sit upon my Stall, and so we grew acquainted. - He has been in Bridewell, and cast for Transportation - Grace and I met him in St. Giles's a few Days before we were taken up. He had a Woman with him, but what she is for her Body I don't know. He asked us to drink a Quartern of Gin; and two Days afterwards this Woman came to a House in St. John's-street, where Grace and I were together, and she called him out, and he went with her. I would have fetch'd him away, but he said he would stay with her all Night, and so he did; and I staid in the same House, and the next Morning I made the best of my Offence home to my 'Biding; and the Day after I met him again in St. Giles's, and going into Drury-Lane, we were both taken by Baker, and the Thief-catchers Atkins, and Adley.

I got up and found the Till of my Shop broke; the Lock and Brass Tobacco-Box that my Money was in lay upon the Counter, but the Money (50 s.) was gone. I went backward and found my Casement, which neither opens nor shuts, was taken off, mash'd 10 pieces, and thrown under the Window; there was a Shutter belonging to it, which I had fastened myself over Night with a wooden Bar and Pin and Key; but I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173306280021"/> found the Bar had been wrench'd till the Spring of the Key was broke, and so it was forc'd open.

               <p>Henry Lane, Watchman. Being at my Stand I heard a Noise of a Window breaking ; I planted my Brother Watch at the Street-door and went backwards, and finding the Window broke open, I called the Prosecutor up: I went in; the till was open, and the Lock and a Brass Box lying on the Counter. A pair of Shoes lay by the Window, and one said, I know those Shoes and the Owner of them, and he can't be far off. We found the Prisoner in the Stable with his Head under the Manger, and without Shoes. He own'd the Shoes to be his. - The Stable is about 20 Yards from the Window.</p>

The Stable-door had been nail'd up for some Time, so that there is no way into it but by getting up into the Hay-loft ; so we got up and came down into the Stable, and there he lay in a muck Sweat, without his Shoes; I burst the Stable-door open with my Backside to get him out, and he own'd the Shoes.</p>

I wrote to Mr. Brereton, and received his Answer the 16th of February, after which, Smith and Griffith came to me again; I told them we had agreed that the Sisters and their Husbands should all be conusant of the Fine; and as the two Estates were in the same Parish, to save the Charge of two Fines they were to join them in one. Griffith agreed to this Fine, and undertook to go next Morning into Essex (where he said Smith's Brothers and Sisters lived) and procure them to come up next Monday: And on Monday in the Afternoon he came and told me, that the Brothers and Sisters were come up, and desired me to get all ready against next Day. It happened my Lord Chief Justice was not then at Leisure, and so we agreed on Wednesday. I went on Wednesday to his Lordship's Chambers, and in the Evening Griffith came to me there, and said that Mr. Smith and his Brothers and Sisters were all below ; I went down with him, and he shewed me the Prisoners sitting on a Bench under the Arch of Serjeants-Inn: Are these they? says I; Yes, says he. I proposed that they should go to the Coffee-house, and be made acquainted with what they came about. It was agreed to, and we all went together into an Inner-Room.</p>

               <p>P. Coun. But you are not positive which is which</p>
               <p>Mr. H. The Prisoners were altogether in the Room, and I said to Mr. Smith, Are these your Brothers and Sisters who are to join in the Fine? he answer'd, Yes. Have you told them, says I, what they are to do? he said, Yes; and that he had paid them the Consideration Money. I ask'd the three Women if their Brother had paid them that Money, and if they were content to pass the Fine? they in general answer'd, Yes.</p>
               <p>P. Coun. But can you take upon you to say, that they all, or any one in particular, answer'd, Yes?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173306280023"/>Mr. H. I can't say that every one in particular answer'd, that they had received a Consideration ; but Mr. Smith said, he had paid them the Consideration Money; and the Women said, in general, Yes. I think Prestidge said, that they were all contented.</p>
               <p>P. Coun. If they only said they were contented to pass the Fine, they might not be apprised of the Iniquiry of the thing. Can you be positive that every one in particular said before she sign'd, that she had received the Consideration Money?</p>
               <p>Mr. H. I can't be so particular. I produc'd a Paper, and wrote the Concord - The Precipe was in Latin, and I read it to them in English - I produc'd the Instrument at the same time that I ask'd the Questions, and desired Mr. Smith to write his Name first, which he did, and the others sign'd after him.</p>
               <p>P. Coun. It's laid that one personated one, and another another: Now what particular Person did Josias Reader personate?</p>
               <p>Mr. H. I think the Name of Scruby was sign'd by Reader. Court. Which is Reader ?</p>
               <p>Mr. H. He that stands behind there.</p>
               <p>P. Coun. How can you take upon you to swear that Reader, rather than any other Person, subscribed the Name of Scruby ?</p>
               <p>Mr. H. I believe it was he Court. Do you remember his Act of subscribing?</p>
               <p>Mr. H. I asked who was the elder Brother, and as I remember, Reader answer'd, and wrote first: I believe it was he, but I cannot be positive to a Man that I never saw in my Life before. The next Name is

               <p>Court. Can you recollect the Act of each, and apply it to each ?</p>
               <p>Mr. B. No; nor do I remember the Identity of the Persons; except it be Pretidge, and, I think, I remember her, one of other of them answered to all the Names. I asked them if they were content to levy the Fine of the Premises within mentioned, and they consented. P. Coun. Are you sure they all answered? Mr. B. I cannot say whether they answered or bowed. Then the pretended Husbands withdrew, and the Women staid to be examined apart. His Lordship asked one of them, if she was willing to pass the Fine without Compulsion ? - She hesitated. - Upon which he asked her where she was born, and what her Maiden Name was? She appeared confused. Another of the Women who was behind, fell in a Swoon; and the third, which, I think was Prestidge, came behind the first, and told her it would be best<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173306280024"/> to discover the Truth; upon which (before the Men came in) they confest the Whole, and said that

               <p>Mr. B. The first Woman hesitated at the beginning of the sole Examination.</p>
               <p>P. C. Then the other two Women had not been examined at all?</p>
               <p>Mr. B. I think they had not.</p>

               <p>Mr. B. Yes; for after those Questions, his Lordship examines the Femme Coverts apart, and when that is over he signs the Caption.</p>
