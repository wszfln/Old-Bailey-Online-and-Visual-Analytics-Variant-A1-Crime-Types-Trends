                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). Prior to 17th December I received instructions from Hyams and Sons, tailors in Cannon Street, in consequence of which I watched their premises at 1 o'clock with Bryant—we saw Kyle leave and go to Evelyn's, 5, Cloth Fair, Smithfield, about 12 minutes' walk off, a small woollen and trimming shop, with windows back and front, so that you can see light through—just inside the passage on the left-hand side of the door is the shop, and looking down the shop on the right side in the back corner is a little office—any one in the office could not be observed from the street—Kyle went into the office, and I could not see what he was doing—he stayed 15 minutes the first day, and then came out and returned to Messrs. Hyams's—on the same day at 6 o'clock he went again to No. 5, Cloth Fair, and into the back office, where he stayed about 15 minutes—on the 18th I watched the premises again—Kyle went at 1 o'clock to No. 5, went into the small office, and stopped five minutes—at 6 o'clock on that day he met Evelyn and they had a conversation right opposite Evelyn's shop, and I saw something pass from him to Evelyn, and I heard Evelyn say, "We must both be careful, good night"—I passed them a third time that afternoon—on 19th December I again watched the premises at 1 and 6 o'clock, and Kyle went to 5, Cloth Fair to the back of the shop out of sight, remained a short time, and came out—the same thing happened on the 22nd, 23rd, 24th, and 29th, and Bryant observed it on the 30th and 31st—on 1st January I was watching, and stopped Kyle after he left the warehouse and had some conversation with him, took from his pocket two pieces of Italian cloth, and left him with Osborne, who took him to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188502020002"/>
               <p>the station, and I then went to Evelyn's premises in Cloth Fair, called him outside, and told him we were police-officers, that we had got a person in custody named Kyle for robbing his employers, Messrs. Hyams and Co.—Hardy and Osborne were with me—I said, "He has made a statement that he has brought the Italian cloth here to you, and you have received it every day; have you any now?"—he said at first "No," and then paused a minute, "No, I don't think I have," and then he went inside to see—before doing so I said, "Do you know where he is employed?"—he said, "Yes, at Messrs. Hyams's in Cannon Street"—I said, "We shall have to go inside and see if you have anything"—I went inside with Hardy and Osborne and Evelyn, and the latter handed me two pieces of Italian cloth, which he said he had bought from Kyle on the previous evening—I said Kyle had made a statement that he had been bringing the whole of it there, all that he had stolen, which was twice a day—Evelyn said he acknowledged that he had received it, but that he did not steal it—he was taken to the station and formally charged—I searched the premises—there was a small roll of cloth and several short pieces in the window, and a number of large parcels round the shop, which we found to contain waste paper, dummy parcels—I also found one or two bills and one or two invoices which had been paid—that was all there—when charged at the station he only said that he had received the goods, but that he did not know they were stolen—the next morning at the station I showed Kyle in Evelyn's presence the two pieces of cloth—Kyle said he had taken them to him the night previous, and Evelyn said, "Yes, it is quite right"—Kyle said, "I have taken it all to Evelyn, and Evelyn knows how I got it."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Several little short pieces of cloth were in the window exposed for sale, so that any one could see them from the street—about 3 1/2 to 4 yards long—I do not know that Kyle carries on a business himself—he lives in a private house—the firm are Jews, and shut up on Saturdays—Kyle is not a Jew—I have heard the prosecution say he does business at his own house on a Saturday—the stuff I saw in the window was woollen, not like this Italian cloth: it was about the same length as this—the little place at the back is under the staircase; it is his office where he makes out his invoices, I should judge—it is lighted from the shop; the partition is not up to the top—any person in the street who stopped and looked could see him going into the office—I do not suppose Evelyn knew I was there—a dozen people could stand in the office—Evelyn said, "I send my traveller out to sell it"—a man came into the shop while we were there, and he alluded to him as his traveller—he said he sold the cloth to small tailors—the traveller brought a bag in with him; I did not see at the time if there was anything in that, I took nothing out of it—I did not say at the Mansion House that I saw the traveller take two pieces of cloth out of it—I did not hear the prisoner say he gave so much per yard for the cloth, I understood him to say 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a piece—I did not take the conversation down—I am prepared to say that I did not hear him say "per yard."</p>

On 1st January I was with Old-hampstead, and arrested Kyle on a charge of larceny of cloth from Hyams and Co.'s, of Cannon Street—he handed me these two pieces of cloth—I was present next morning when Evelyn was brought up and shown the cloth in Kyle's presence—Oldhampstead said that Kyle had made a statement about being concerned with Evelyn—Kyle said, "Oh yes, I have been taking this cloth from my employer since last August almost daily, Evelyn has had it all, and knows where I got it"—I searched Evelyn, and found on him County Court and judgment summonses.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 46, Lorne Road, Finsbury Park, and am manager to Messrs. Hyams and Co. at 69, Cannon Street—Kyle was in their employment about 11 months—his wages were about 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day—he worked on the top floor of the warehouse—there is a recess round the top floor where the goods are kept—he used to keep his coat and hat in the recess, and worked alone in a corner—I have identified these pieces of Italian cloth as my employers'—pieces of this description would be regularly served out to Kyle for lining the garments he was at work upon, and he would cut from the roll what he wanted—he was not allowed to remove any of it from the premises—in consequence of information I instructed Oldhampstead to watch Kyle on 17th December and following days, and on 1st January went to Thames Police-station and found Kyle in custody—he made a statement to me—subsequently Evelyn was brought, there—I went to Evelyn's premises in Cloth Fair with Oldhampstead and Osborne, and saw there two pieces of Italian cloth, which I identified as Messrs. Hyams's property—I think the total value of all this cloth is 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there are various qualities, it varies from 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The price depends on the length—the average price of pieces 45 yards long would be 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d.;</hi> this piece would be 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we have similar articles in our warehouse—there is no mark of ours on this—it may be made for every house in the trade; Italian cloth is a common article—these cloths would be about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard; there is no fixed price for a remnant—remnants are valuable to us, we can use them up—they would be valuable to small tailors—I don't know anything about small tailors; we sell nothing to them.</p>

               <p>about 5.30, I came home and saw the Prisoner there—the Potman had gone out for change—he came back and gave it to Mrs.Rendle, and I saw her give it to the prisoner—I noticed that it was all good—the prisoner put his hand to his left trousers pocket, and then to his right, while the change was lying on the counter—I saw something in the palm of his hand—he picked up the change, dropping a shilling and asked for a sixpence and sixpenny worth of coppers—I put the shilling to my teeth and broke it in half easily, and one half doubled up—I placed them on the counter and said, "This is your old game"—he said, "I'll go over and tell them of it," and made for the door—I said, "You need not trouble, I'll go," and jumped over the counter and stopped him—I saw him putting his hand to his mouth, and Mrs.Rendle said, "Don't swallow those pieces"—he said, "I am not swallowing them, I am trying the other money to see if it is good"—he made for the door, but it was bolted—I stopped him, and sent the potman for a policeman—he was gone so long that I went outside myself, and while I was outside the prisoner stepped behind me and went down the court—I followed him with a constable, who took him—he gave his address, 2, Sandford Lane, Stoke Newington, and began to run, but I kept him in sight till I gave him in charge—the pieces of a shilling produced are not the pieces I broke—I have tried to break them with my teeth and could not—the one I broke was very soft and gritty, and these pieces are hard and not gritty-this piece has been stained.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a compositor in the employ of Messr. Abraham Kingdon and Co., printers and publishers, 52, Little Moorfields—last Friday week, 22nd Jan, about 2 o'clock in the day, I was in the street, going into Mr.Kingdon's premises—I saw the prisoner at the corner of Moortields, at the side of Mr.Kingdon's premises—I spoke to him first, and asked if he was the man that sent me away to Manchester two years ago—he said he was—I told him that ho had sent me away under false pretences—we had a few words—he said ho would get me a memorandum—he paid I could please myself whether I went in or not, and I went in to work at Messrs. Kingdon's—I came out again about 4 o'clock and went into the Bull and Bell public-house just by, about 20 yards off—I waited there about 20 minutes, then the prisoner and several more came in—he said I had better get out—I said I had as much right as he to stay there, it was, a publi bar—ho said if I didn't get out he would dash my brains out—after that I went out—later on in the evening, a little after 7 o'clock, I went into the public-house again; the prisoner came in, he repeated the same language, that he would dash my brains out if I didn't get out—he said he was not fool enough to do it himself, he might get three months for it but he would get some one else to do it for him—he left the house</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188502020013"/>
               <p>for a short time then, and returned in about half an hour—he said "Are you here still? if you don't get out I shall do what I said, I shall dash your brains out"—he took me by the shoulders with both his hands, pushed me out of the door, and hit me on the side of the head with his fist and knocked my hat off; it was a pretty keen blow—upon that I went across the road into Messrs. Kingdon's premises, and just before I went in somebody hit me behind; I can't say whether it was he or not, he was shouting out at the time—I was knocked down, I got up and ran into Messrs. Kingdon's premises—I saw Mr. Abraham Kingdon and he came out into the street with me shortly afterwards—I saw the prisoner two or three yards from the premises in custody of a policeman—at the station he called me a scoundrel and all that sort of thing, and he called Mr.Kingdon a thief, and said he would ruin his business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I saw him in custody I was asked if he was the man that had assaulted me, I said "Yes"—Mr. Kingdon brought me out of the hat shop, where I had been to buy a new hat—when I accused the prisoner of being the man who had sent me to Manchester under false pretences there was pretty strong language on both sides—he said I might please myself about going to Kingdon's; he didn't exactly inter<lb/>fere with my going there; he said I should regret my going, and I did go and worked for a couple of hours; I then asked leave to go and get my pay from my former employer—I had got my money in the morning, but I said that in order to go out into the Bull and Bell—I was not aware there was any strike taking place, nor was I when I went to Manchester—I got 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and my fare paid—that was with respect to Messrs. Head and Mark's—there was not a similar case with regard to Morley's—I am not a <hi rend="italic">loafer,</hi> I am a workman—I went away at Waterlow's, but I never got anything there—I told the men I was a machine-minder, and they said they had telegraphed to Manchester and found it wasn't true—I wasn't expelled from the Society, I left and tore my card up; they told me to he off and I did walk off—Mark's case was some little time after that—I told the manager at Kingdon's that I didn't feel comfortable, and he said I had had too much <hi rend="italic">Perkins;</hi> I said I might have had—it was after that I went into the Bull and Bell—the row didn't begin then—they didn't complain to the landlord about me—I went for a policeman to save any trouble—I was trying to get away—I wasn't drunk, far from being drunk—I don't admit that I had had too much <hi rend="italic">Perkins,</hi> I wasn't quite <hi rend="italic">compos</hi>—I stayed there for about an hour and a half waiting for a friend to come in named Young; he came in with the prisoner and several more—when the prisoner said he would dash my brains out I did not say "You had better try," I said "Don't be a fool"—I didn't fancy he could do it.</p>

I am in partnership with Charles William Cook as printers and publishers, 52, Little Moorfields—on Wednesday, 21st January, I discharged eight or nine men—we usually employ about 40 hands, including apprentices, machine minders, and boys—I discharged all the Society men; the prisoner amongst others—we advertised for non-society men to fill the vacancies—we got some, Wilkinson amongst them—he commenced to work for us—on Friday afternoon, January 23rd, I noticed men outside the premises during the day accosting the men who applied for work—I constantly saw the prisoner and his companions—I saw him constantly in the course of the Thursday and Friday walking up and down in the front of the place—every man who came in was laid hold of; he entered into conversation with the men, and also with Mr. Ball, the editor of a trade newspaper—I generally leave the premises at 5.30 or 6 o'clock; on this Friday afternoon I stayed later—I saw the prisoner in front of our place during the evening—about 8.30 I heard a noise out<lb/>side, and Wilkinson rushed in without his hat rather excited followed by two women, who said he had been knocked down and badly served—I went out with him in a few minutes; I went to buy him a hat—the police were quite aware of what was going on, and they had the prisoner—I asked Wilkinson to point out the man who had assaulted him, and he pointed out the prisoner—he held up his clenched fist, and said to me "If that policeman wasn't here I would blacken your b——eye"—he also said he would have his eye on me, and see that I lost my business—I went to the station, when the prisoner was there in custody, and he called me a thief and a scoundrel, and made use of repeated threats—he said again he would have his eye on me, and that I would lose my business; he repeated that again and again.</p>

On Saturday, 17th January, about three in the afternoon, I was called to the premises of Mr. Randall Perry at 4, Lea Bridge Common, Clapton—there is a front shop and a room behind—there is a doorway in the passage from the shop to the room behind, but no door—the room is 18 feet by 8 feet 6 inches, and the height 11 feet—I was called there with reference to a charge against the prisoner of stealing—there was a box on the counter—the prisoner unlocked it and I opened it—I called his attention to what I was about to do, that he was to see that I did it fairly—as I was taking out the articles the prisoner was standing at the far end of the box—I had only taken out a few articles when I heard a shot fired—I had taken out a purse, and was just handing it to Mr.Perry; it was afterwards found to contain some pawn-tickets for articles which Mr. Ferry claimed—on hearing the shot I turned sharp round and saw smoke coming out of the revolver in my face; it was about two yards from my head; the prisoner was standing about three yards from me, with his hand out straight at my head—I dodged my head down, thinking a second shot was coming, and went towards him, and as I was doing so the manager rushed in from the other shop and struck his arm; the second shot was fired and the bullet struck the wall on the left-hand side of the room—the pistol was pointed at me; I could see up the barrel—I took the prisoner by the throat and pushed him back into a corner; the manager wrenched his arm behind him and pulled the revolver away from him; it dropped at my feet, and I picked it up—the prisoner did not speak—I held him there and sent Mr.Perry after another policeman—I afterwards searched him and found this packet of bullets in his breast pocket; there were six large and eight small ball cartridges in a purse—the large ones fit the big revolver which I took from him, and the small ones fit the little one, which is a pin-fire; that was in his breast pocket; that was fully loaded; it is a six-chamber revolver—on the way to the station the prisoner said "I did not mean to shoot you when I pointed the revolver at your head; I was re-cocking it to shoot again; if I had had the little one it would have been all right; the big one kicked"—I could have counted 20 or 30 between the first and second shots—he asked me to post this letter—the inspector afterwards picked up two other bullets.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chair and couch manufacturer, of 21, Wick<lb/>hampton Street, Shoreditch—the prisoner is my son; he has worked for me ever since he came from Liverpool in August—I keep a book in which I enter the wages which are paid to him—this is it—I am able to say by looking at it that he was working for me on November 6th—it contains the money I pay him on Saturday afternoons, and on November 6th he took 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he did not work full time for me that week, because he worked at a job in Holborn; but I am able to say he worked on my premises on November 6th—he takes his midday meal with us between 1 and 2 o'clock—I have nothing but the book to fix my recollection as to whether he took his midday meal with me that day, but he did so daily,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188502020032"/>
               <p>and I can say that of the whole of November—he works in the workshop where I am, and takes his dinner in the kitchen with us—last Session was the first time I heard November 6th mentioned—on 12th November my wife and I and my son and one or two friends were at the next door neighbour, Mrs. Pike's, at a birthday party, till 12.30 p.m.—I am able to recollect from that that my son was at home on the morning of the 12th; he took his dinner with me as usual that day—as to November 13th, when it is said that he was at Cook's warehouse between 1 and 2 o'clock, I am able to say that he was at home at that time; I can bring two customers of mine, one of whom is downstairs now—just after 12 o'clock on the 13th Mr.Platt, of 223, Curtain Road, came to me about making some seats for a music hall, and we went back into the workshop, and the prisoner drew a sketch on a board of how the seats were to be planned—Mr.Platt went away, and Mr.Bircham, who is here, came in at the workshop; my son was there, he had just done his dinner—two or three other persons came, and one was Mr.Williams, who we were making six chairs for, and he had them home on November 15th—I was at work in my shop on 13th November till 8.30 at night, and left my son there; he took his dinner with me, and his tea too—it is a good half-hour's walk from Wickhampton Street to St.Paul's Churchyard—since the last hearing I found the prisoner's time-book in his jacket pocket in his bedroom; his wages are so much per hour, which he enters here, and I keep check against the time on a board in the shop, and at the end of the week they bring their time-papers in for so many hours—he has entered on November 13th, that would be Thursday; he puts the day of the week at the beginning; he started on the Thursday at 10 and worked till 11—I have found this book since the last trial—here are daily entries in it of the hours he worked on November 6th, 12th and 13th—on 22nd December, the day he was taken, I saw him about 9.30 a.m. till about 11.15; he was not going to stop at home then—I had just taken an order to make four chairs, and everything was cut except four pieces, and when he was having his breakfast I told him to get those four pieces cut; he then went out to buy a hat, and I never saw him again till the constable came.</p>

I am an oil and colour warehouseman, of 3, Wentworth Road, Mile End—about 12.15 a.m. on 12th January I was outside the Plough, Mile End Road—Tompkins came up and wanted me to fight—I said I did not understand fighting, I was going home—he then struck me on my face and knocked me down—I got up and at<lb/>tempted to strike him with my stick, but another person, who I cannot identify, threw me, and I fell on my face—I immediately rose again and told him I did not wish to fight, I was going home—Pinnock came behind me, put his right arm round my neck, and threw me to the ground—I turned round and was thrown on my right side; Pinnock laid somehow on my face, and Tompkins laid across my feet, and two other persons with them held my arms straight out across the pavement for some minutes—I was struck in the face—I got up and saw Pinnock running away, and Tompkins struck me in the chest and knocked me down again—I called out "Police; stop thief"—a constable came up; I made a statement to him; he gave chase to the prisoners—they were both per<lb/>fect strangers to me—I was sober—I am quite sure they are two of the four men who assaulted me—after they had gone I missed my watch and chain—I always carry them loose in a pocket inside my waistcoat, the button of which was torn off; the waistcoat was torn open—the chain was not visible from the outside—I lost my cap and cane and 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which had been loose in my right-hand trousers pocket—soon after the robbery I saw the prisoners in custody in British Street, about 250 yards off—I looked on the ground afterwards, but saw nothing there of anything I had lost.</p>

I am the prisoner's wife—we were married on 11th October last—prior to that time I had carried on business in partnership with my sister as a greengrocer at 20, High Street, South Norwood, and when I married I had an account at the Croydon branch of the London and County Bank, with a balance of 245<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. standing to my credit—after the marriage I did not continue to carry on the business—my husband induced me to go to the bank and have the account transferred to our joint names on the day we were married, after the wedding—a few days before the marriage I had advanced him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to buy clothes with to get married in—I asked him why it was to be placed in our joint names—he said it would be much safer and botter for the business accounts in going to the market and if anything happened to me—we lived together up to 6th November at 4, Campdell Terrace, Tufnell Park—on 3rd November the account was transferred to the King's Cross branch of the same bank—he said nothing to me at any time about altering the account to his own name, or that he was going to the bank to do so, I did not know he had been—on 6th November he brought me this cheque (he kept the cheque-book), with which he said he wanted to pay the gas deposit, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was nothing on it except the figure "6," which was where the "5" is now—he said the gas deposit was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said no, it was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I altered the 6 to a 5, and then I signed a cheque and gave it back to him—there was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188502020037"/>
               <p>then nothing on it but the 5 and my signature—he said he was going to pay the gas deposit and would soon be back, he went out with the cheque and never returned—the next morning at 4 o'clock I gave information to the police and went to the gas company and then to the bank, where I found that the cheque had been altered to to 305<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then took a warrant out—I did not see or hear from him again till he was in custody, nor did I know where he had gone to—we were going into a new business in the same line after we were married—he told me after the marriage as we came to the house that the shop was prepared, and he took me to an empty house—we never started the business—I know his writing, this signature to the cheque is his and this "Pay self and wife," and the words "Three hundred and five" are his writing, all but the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is his—after the marriage I paid into the bank the money I had for dissolving partnership with my sister—no money was paid into the bank after our marriage except mine—I gave the prisoner no authority to alter this amount from 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 305<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Cheques were signed by both my husband and myself, and I had no power to draw out money by myself, it would require his signature as well as mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I gave him no authority to draw a larger amount than the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the gas—I had this letter in my husband's writing after he was in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Golden Anchor, Park Street, Southwark—on August 11th I was in want of a barman, and a man called for the situation who gave his name Henry Owen—I asked him for his references, and in consequence of what he said I went on 11th August to see Mr. Mason, of the King and Queen, Shadwell—on alighting at Shadwell Station I saw Owen, who walked with me to the King and Queen—there are three compartments—I went in at one, Owen at another, and there was a compartment between—he stood about three yards from me, but the conversation was not loud enough for him to hear—I said to Mason "I have been referred to you by Henry Owen, who gives you as a reference as barman; he says he has been with you some months"—he said "He has been with me eight or ten months; he tho<lb/>roughly understands his business; I discharged him because I was coming into the business myself, and did not require his services" said "Have you any doubt about his honesty?"—he said "No; cer<lb/>tainly not," and turned to his wife, who said that she had none—he said "He has been away from here a month"—we spoke about business, and it came out that the prisoner had been a clerk at some docks ten years, or some such time—it did not occur to me to say "He is in the house now"—the prisoner did not mention him by any other name than Owen—he came into my service on Wednesday evening, August 13th, and remained till midday on the Monday, when I told him I had heard that he had been convicted, and had a bad character generally, and told him to pack up his boxes and be off—I keep a daily takings book, and while he was with me the takings fell off, but after he left they resumed the same standard as before—I have not seen him since—I did not go back and see Mason; I placed the matter in the hands of the Society.</p>
               <p>

It is part of my duty to attend to matters relating to licences in the district where the King and Queen is situated—Henry Owen was the previous tenant; the licenco was trans<lb/>ferred to him on January 12. 1884—the previous tenant was George Jar<lb/>bom—he continued uuder that licence up to the annual licensing meeting, when his application was adjourned in consequence of my serving him with a notice of opposition—I had had him identified by an officer who knew him—the Magistrates heard it through, and directed him to with<lb/>draw his application for a licence, and the house was closed, and remained closed till May 5—I may have allowed him to continue for a few days—when Mason applied the usual inquiries were made by me—I saw him on the evening of transfer day, May 5, when the licence was confirmed, and said "I have been deceived by Mr. Owen, and he will deceive you, or any one else if he can"—the grant was made under Sec. 14—I spoke to him about Owen; he is in the licence as Owen, not as Turner—on May 16 Owen was charged with being drunk and riotous in the street, and the defendant bailed him out—I said "I am surprised, Mr.Mason, that you should bail that man out, after what I said to you some time since"—he said he would do it for any one in trouble, he did it with the best intention—he was in the name of Henry Owen, barber, of Rotherhithe—Owen was only employed at the King and Queen, where he was the master, and had the licence; he was not a servant there.</p>

The portions upon which the perjury was assigned were that she had never received anything for taking charge of the child, that she took it and provided for it on her own account, that she was in the habit of writing her own letters, and never got any one else to write letters for her, and that she had expressed no intention of giving the child up, nor said she did not wish to keep it, and that she never told Hunter, or Sim<lb/>monds, or Saltwell that she received 5s. a week for the keep of the child.</hi>)</p>

She said she was fond of the child and did not want to lose it. She told me she had on one occasion gone to the grandmother's with a hat under her cloak and a shawl round her waist. She said she went through the shop and took up the child, and she was going to take it, but the grandmother would not let her. She said she walked out with the child and put on the hat and shawl and took it away. She said Mrs. Dellar came and tried to get the child back. Mrs. Powney told me she had received no money since she had stolen the child away."</p>

I am a printer of 62, Compton Street—on Sunday, 4th January, at 12.15 a.m., I went to the Crown coffee-house in St. John Street for a pot of ale—I was outside at the door when a man named Bartlett stood on the step and prevented my going in—he struck me a violent blow on the left cheek which knocked me down—the witness Rogers came to my assistance, and as he was assisting me up the prisoner ran out of the coffee-shop with about eight or nine others; he said to Rogers "What do you want?"—Rogers said "Nothing;" with that the prisoner aimed a blow at Rogers, who made a blow at him back again—I saw the prisoner put his hand in his coat pocket behind—Rogers said "Look, he is drawing a knife"—I said to Rogers "Let's run away," and we both ran away—as I was running I heard the report of a pistol the bullet whizzed past our ears—we were running arm in arm—I turned off and ran up John Street and Rogers up Mitre Court—the prisoner followed Rogers and fired a second shot, I heard the report—I then saw the prisoner run out of Mitre Court into John Street; he had a revolver in his hand; he pointed it at somebody at the bottom of the court, and said "Do you want one?" he then ran away—a constable came up andfs</p>

I am a tinman's labouror, and live at 9, Albert House, Bell Alley, Goswell Road, St. Luke's—about ten minutes past 12 on the morning of 4th January I was standing in St. John Street at the bottom of Mitre Court talking to Harry Toole, the last witness's brother—I saw Bartlett knock William Toole down—I ran across the road and assisted him up—the prisoner and eight or nine more rushed out of the side door of the coffee-house—the prisoner came up to me and asked what I wanted—I said "Nothing;" he turned round and punched me on the left cheek—I returned the blow—he put his hand into his inside coat pocket—I halloed out to the people round "Look, he is pulling out a knife"—I ran backwards; as I was running he pulled out a revolver and fired—I and William Toole were running with his right arm by his side—I heard the report of the pistol, and the bullet whistled by my right ear—I saw the pistol; it was presented at me and fired—I was about eight or nine feet from him at the most—I then turned round and ran across the road up Mitre Court; the prisoner followed me—I had got about thirty feet up the court when I heard a second report and felt something going through my right arm like a needle—I ran up the court and tumbled down in a doorway, where I remained till somebody came and picked me up; the blood was running down my arm—I was taken to St. Bartholomew's Hospital and was there eight or nine days—the bullet has never been extracted—the prisoner was a perfect stranger to me.</p>

               <p>women came rushing across from Mitre Court, I should say at least 10, in addition to the two that were already there—they immediately com<lb/>menced hustling me about and threatening me—I had slipped off the step and pulled the door after me, to try and prevent their entering—Rogers gave his quart can to one of the girls—about this time the prisoner came out from the house, followed by Batt and Moore, the other two young men that were at supper—Rogers said to the prisoner "You are about my size, I will start on you"—Batt stepped between them, Rogers reached over Batt's shoulder and struck the prisoner a violent blow in the mouth with his fist, and immediately on that the mob all closed around, making a great noise—I then saw Batt holding Rogers and Toole, but Rogers broke away and again followed the prisoner, endeavouring with the rest of the mob to strike him—the prisoner was in the middle of the road—he then pulled out his revolver and fired at Rogers—the prisoner gradually retreated down St. John Street, and seeing the whole mob fol<lb/>lowing him he fired a second shot at Rogers, who at that time had gone up Mitre Court—Toole was then about 20 yards up the street—Rogers had his back to the prisoner at the time he fired, running away—the prisoner purchased the revolver some weeks ago, as he was going to Texas—I have known him three years; he is a pocket-book and purse maker—I never knew him to do an injury to any one; as a rule, he was a well-behaved man—I should not think he was very drunk on this occa<lb/>sion—he was rather excited when I went in, as if he had had rather more than usual.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 24, Wool Exchange, and am a clerk to Sydney Herbert Jewel and Co., merchants, who have a house in Sydney and one in London—about the end of December I received this bill of lading, dated 31st December, referring to a case of merchandise marked "J. D. and Co.," as being shipped on the Garonne from Sydney to London—I also received an invoice which stated what the goods were. (<hi rend="italic">The invoice was dated Sydney, 13th November, 1884, and gave a list of gold and silver watches.</hi>) That invoice is supposed to be the contents of the case, the value altogether was 195<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the Garonne arrived at the Royal Albert Docks on 13th December—I attended at the Custom House and passed the entry and declared the true contents of the case as they appeared on the invoice—I then transmitted the bill of lading to the office of the London and St. Katherine's Dock Company that they might obtain possession of the case, which they were to forward to our address—I received instructions that the case was not to be found—there are about 40 watches here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), the numbers on which correspond to the numbers on the invoice—they would not be sent over tied on strings like these are—the case was marked with the same mark as appears on the bill of lading, "J.

                  </hi>. I live at 21, St. Andrew's Road, Plaistow, and am a shore engineer—on 6th January I was examining the machinery in the lower hold between 1 and 2 o'clock in the afternoon and observed a light in the lower hold about 40 feet from where I was, where the red cross is marked in this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I turned my back, and when I turned round shortly afterwards it was extinguished—I then went towards the place and I found a silver watch similar to these on the ship's floor underneath the shaft tunnel, there was a deck over it—I took possession of it—there might have been cargo there when the ship arrived—I then went on deck, and before I left the hatchway I called Napier and stationed him there—there is no other exit from the hold except that particular hatchway—I reported the matter to the superintendent engineer, who was on board at the time, and came out of the engine-room</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188502020059"/>
               <p>with him and went in the direction of the hatchway—we met Napier following the prisoner immediately behind him—Napier said "This man has just come out of the hold"—we all went on the upper deck then—the place where he came up was the entrance to the same hold where I saw the light—the watch was found in the centre tunnel in the narrow part—the hatchway goes through all the decks perpendicularly from top to bottom, and you can get into the hatchway from each deck—the tunnel is in the middle of the ship; I was on one side of it, and a person to go to the hatchway would go on either side of the tunnel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The after hold is very dark—no light but artificial light can get into it, it is below water, and there are no port holes in that part—I only set Napier to watch, and as soon as Gilbert came up Napier came away with him and there was no one to watch then, I don't know if any one else might have been down and came up—it is possible that some one else was down, but barely probable—the after hold includes all the after part of the ship—the lower hold is the hold under the lower deck and is included in the after hold.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 371, East India Road, Poplar, and am chief engineer to the Garonne—on Tuesday, 6th January, between 1 and 2 o'clock, I went with Stewart down the after hatchway to the lower after hold and was examining the machinery with him—the only means of access from the main deck to the lower and orlop decks and lower hold is down the after hatchway, which is where it is said the prisoner came up—Stewart made a communication to me and I accompanied him towards where he had seen the light, and he showed me a watch after he had picked it up—we went on deck, placed Napier by the hatch, and were present when Napier came along following the prisoner—I heard what he said—the hold had been declared empty that morning by the prisoner's brother, I believe—the lower hold is the open space under the screw, you can walk underneath the screw chamber—I went with Stewart, Napier, and the prisoner to the chief superintendent engineer Dunlop—he asked the prisoner "What were you doing in that hold?"—he said he had been sent down there by the foreman to look for a case that was missing—he was then sent forward to the main hold—it was about 15 or 20 minutes after I came up with Stewart that I saw the prisoner followed by Napier.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Anybody searching the hold would have to use a light; it would not be extraordinary for the foreman to send a man who had been at work on the ship to make a search—it would be quite possible for some one to secrete himself in the after hold—it would take about twenty minutes to search the after hold.</p>

               <p>me on the vessel before I went towards the engineer's room—I saw the superintendent engineer—I said in the prisoner's hearing, I believe, "This is the man that has come up the hatchway"—he was then going up the companion-ladder to the spar deck; he said nothing.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 17, Rayner Road—I am contractor with the Dock Company for clearing the Orient line of ships—on 6th January I was clearing this vessel and employed my brother, the prisoner, as one of the hands—he was not a hand on board the vessel, but was employed from the start of my contract as a dock labourer—it is my duty to report the hold clear; I had fifteen men in that hold; several of them, the prisoner among them, declared the hold was clear—about ten minutes to 1 on the 6th I had information that a case was missing—I sent my brother down again about ten minutes past 1 to see if he could find the missing case, and I next saw him about a quarter or twenty minutes to 2 on the spar deck against the main hold with Mr. Dunlop—Mr. Dunlop asked me if I knew him, I said "Yes"—I had told him to go down to look for the missing case, that would include the whole of the lower hold and a part of the after hold—Mr. Dunlop said he was seen coming up out of the after hold, and asked me what he was doing there; I said I had told him to look for a case—he said "All right, keep your eye on him"—I sent him down the main hold to finish his work, during the interval after I sent him down, at ten minutes past 1 I was look<lb/>ing after the work in the main hold, the fore and after holds were empty, it was not known in which hold the supposed case was—it was twenty minutes to 12 the hold was declared empty—I heard Dunlop say to my brother that he had been seen down the after hold with a light, and said "It was a funny thing you could not find anything down there, and I could find this," and produced a watch—my brother said nothing.</p>

On 8th January, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I received the watches and afterwards apprehended the prisoner the same day on shore—I said "I shall take you in custody for stealing a case of watches from this ship," pointing to the Garonne; he made no reply—I sent him on to the station with a plain-clothes officer—at the station I charged him with stealing the case of watches, the property of Jewel, Davis, and Co.; he made no reply—I had previously searched the lower after hold and had found a lot of broken cases similar to this piece of wood, which could not be identified; and a tin case, where no doubt the watches had been, had been broken in very small pieces; it could not be identified at all.</p>

I live at 53, Wickham Road, Brockley, and am servant to Mrs. Kersey—on 13th August, 1884, about 12.30 p.m., I was in the hack kitchen and received a communication from Annie Marchant, the servant next door, in consequence of which I went to the front door and saw a man going down the road about six or seven houses off; he was going from our house pushing a hand barrow with hearthstones and bones in it—I followed him to Brockley Station, where he stopped; I then accused him of going into our dining room—he said I had made a mistake, and if I wanted him I must follow him—I followed him along the Brockley Road to the Malthus Road—a gentleman came forward and called out "Stop thief," and the prisoner dropped the truck and ran away down one of the streets—I lost sight of him—I am quite sure he is the man—when I returned home I missed from the plate basket eighteen silver spoons and nine plated ones—the plate stood on that morning on the dinner waggon opposite the window—that could not be seen from outside—there are glass doors to the room through which anybody could have easily come from the private entrance, which is usually locked, but which on this morning had been left open, as some men had been in to measure for a blind—I did not see the prisoner after the 13th August until a month last Saturday, when I saw him at Brockley Police-station, and picked him out from a number of others.</p>

Between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon they came home and said they had lost the barrow, that they had some<lb/>thing to eat at a coffee shop and left the barrow outside, and when they came out they found the barrow gone. I said "Do you know where you lost it?" They said "In Peckham, somewhere." I told them to wait while I told the man to whom it belonged. He said I was to make inquiries, and when I returned the men that borrowed the barrow were gone."</p>

Mamma! Murder!" and a few minutes after I heard these screams I heard a splash in the water—I and my mate Barnham got a boat and a pair of sculls and rowed across in the direction of where I heard the screams, and when I got near the other side I saw a ripple on the water; I handed my mate the sculls—I saw a black object in the water, and caught hold of it, and found it to be the prisoner—I pulled her into the boat, and when I had done that, about six yards lower down I saw something else floating—I pulled it in and found it was one of the two little children; and then rowing a little up stream I saw another object floating, and took it into the boat, and found it was the other child—on looking at the prisoner and the two little children they appeared to be dead—I put them in the boat as dead—a little farther down I found two hats, one child's hat and the prisoner's hat—I got them all three on shore, and took them into Mr. Maynard's house; medical aid was sent for and they were attended to, and ultimately recovered.</p>

               <p>Pritchard, of 93, Percy Road, Shepherd's Bush; at the end of last year the prisoner was in our service, about five weeks and four days, she was general and only servant—my sister, Mrs. Weir, came to stay with us with two little girls and two little boys; the two little girls were Amy, aged seven, and Maud about five; the two little boys were older—my sister had been staying with us about three weeks; besides the household work the prisoner looked after the children; it was not her place to do so, but she wished to do it while we went out—on 31st December I went out with Mrs. Weir about twenty minutes past 1 p.m.—I left the prisoner in the house with the two little girls, the boys were out, and my husband was away as well—before I went out I had seen the prisoner, she was very sulky and very sullen; I had spoken to her about my bedroom, I told her that it was much too late to commence my bedroom, that she ought to have commenced it at 10 o'clock in the morning—she said "I will do it, <hi rend="italic">mum:</hi>" instead of saying "I will do it, ma'am," which was her usual way of speaking—I said "You will not do it to-day, Emily; I will help you to-morrow," and left the kitchen—I went upstairs and locked the bedroom door, and put the key in my jacket pocket and took it away with me; this conversation took place about twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour before I went out—I had noticed before that she was rather sulky, but not sullen; she was self-willed—I noticed nothing about her demeanour or manner besides that—I and Mrs. Weir went out and returned about 6 o'clock; we knocked and could not get in—the house was in darkness—afterwards Mr. Weir came with the boys, and he got round to the back and opened the door; when I got in I found in the sitting-room things knocked down and broken; some bronze candlesticks, some castors out of the cruet-stand, bottles out of the inkstand, and a large desk opened and papers and letters scattered all over the room—some pictures that I had from America had been taken out of the hall and carried downstairs into the cellar and the glass broken; the pictures were not broken—in the kitchen I found that the dinner, tea, and coffee services had been smashed, and a portion of it down in the cellar—the silver salver out of the hall stand was bent, and was in the cellar also—I found in the front cellar the prisoner's box; that was not the place where it was usually kept—it was kept in her own bedroom before my sister came over, in the second-floor bedroom—I saw one of the prisoner's dresses which she had worn in the morning ripped into strips—the police were then communicated with, and in the evening about half-past 8 I and my sister went to Maynard's boathouse and there found the two little children and the prisoner—the children were very ill for three or four days; they were looked after and now they have quite recovered—before the prisoner came into my service I believe she had been with Mrs. Best; she gave me a reference there.</p>

I am 7 years old—I used to go to school, but I don t go now—I came over from America—I know the prisoner—on the day I was in the water my mother and aunt went out, and the prisoner and I and my sister Maud were left in the house—my sister is 5 years old—the prisoner took us both out, down to the river—I could not tell how far the river is from Shepherd's Bush, and I could not tell how long it took us to go there—before we got down to the river I and my sister and the pri<lb/>soner</p>

Mamma!"—I called out as loud as I could—the prisoner had on a grey boa and she put it round my mouth, and she took it off again before she pushed me in—I had not got it round my mouth when I was pushed in—she put it on before I called out and then took it off again—the prisoner had always been kind to us before this—it was just getting dusk when this happened.</p>

My husband Joshua is a sawyer—we occupy the top back at 42, Wootten Street, Cornwall Road, Lambeth—the prisoner lived in the room underneath us on the ground floor—on the morning of 24th January I was in bed and asleep at about 3.15, and woke up and found the room full of smoke—I woke my husband, and while he was getting a light I rushed to the door—there was such a body of smoke coming up to the door that I was nearly choked—I went hallway down<lb/>stairs and saw the prisoner in the passage in a stooping position making to the front door—she appeared to be nearly suffocated with smoke—I said, "What have you done?"—she said, "Nothing, Mrs. Ransom; only my room is smoking and my chimney wants sweeping"—I said, "It is something more than a chimney; it must be rag burning, for the house is full of smoke"—she then went back to her room, and I went upstairs again and woke up the woman who is living in the next room to me, Mrs. Row—she ran down to the prisoner's room—I partly dressed myself and then went down after the policeman came—the prisoner was fully dressed when I saw her in the passage.</p>

I sat down in front of the fire; I had a thin apron on, and I suppose it caught fire, and I laid on the bed; it must have set fire to it"—I examined the flock bed in the room—about a foot from the bottom of the bed I found a place about a foot square had been burnt, and it was surrounded by several burnt holes about the size of nuts—on the top of the bed there were two pillows; one, at the head, was three parts burnt out, and the other pillow, about a foot lower down, had a burnt hole about the size of the palm of your hand—I turned the bed over and found another burnt hole near the foot about the size of the palm of my hand—there were four distinct burns in the bed—by the cupboard a pail was standing on the floor, which was three parts full of flock—I pulled some out, and about half way down found it was smouldering—that was put out—in the corner, about three feet from the fireplace, were three or four sticks of wood nearly burnt out; there were no signs of fire in the grate—at the police-court she said, "I was sitting in front of the grate; a cinder must have fallen into my hair and set alight to the pillow"—when I went there on the morning of the 24th she appeared to be under the influence of drink.</p>

I said, "Davey;" he said "All right, I will open the door;" he opened it, and I went in and found Emma Wilson in bed in the ground floor back room—I said "I she take you for being concerned with a person in custody for possessing counterfeit coin and implements for making the same;" she said, "Oh, God! that is all through a letter I received from that woman; I am sold; she is a bad, vile woman"—she jumped out of bed and a purse which laid on a small table; it had a letter in it—Scott said, "She has got something in her mouth"—I attempted to get it, but she swallowed it, and while Scott was examining the papers she rushed to the bed and placed both her arms between the mattress and the bed—Sergeant Jones and I got her round the waist and pulled her away and took her to the station, where I said, "Where is the letter you received this morning?" she said, "It is on the table;" I said "No, it is not;" she said, "Which letter do you mean? do you mean the letter I had from the Infirmary or the one I had from Mary Young from the House of Detention?" I said, "The one you had from Mary Young;" she said, "I have burnt it"—the male prisoner said, "Don't tell them, let them find out themselves"—</p>

I am at present manager of the Grosvenor Bank—I was appointed on 31st March last year—I went through the books in May—I did not examine the register of members—you drew my attention to it in June, and you paid to inspect the books—you said they were in a mess—I took steps to ascertain if that was true; I went to Somerset House and found it was not—you as good as said there was no return, but I found a return there which purported to be a copy of the register, made perfectly, according to my view—this is the register (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there is a copy of 1881 here made up to 11th October; it is a summary of capital and shares of the Grosvenor Bank Discount Company, Limited—it is "Amount of capital, 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. shares; number of shares taken up 10,635, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on each share called up; total amount of calls received 4,481<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., amount of calls unpaid 836<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—at the bottom of the page here is "Filed by Caleb Titcomb, secretary"—that is not Titcomb's signature, it is a copy of it—that entry has been made since I have been in the bank, the whole of it is in Percy Penfold's writing, I believe; he was a clerk in the bank; he was called deputy manager, but he had no appointment—he made the entry by my direction—I can't say whether this is a copy of the bank register, I was not in the bank at the time—the first entry of a member's name appears to be on 11th October, 1881—up to that time I find 10,635 shares in the register—this is not an annual return, but a four-monthly return only—the annual return purports to be a list of members made up to 11th October, 1881—these are your letters of 13th and 14th August.

               <p>original list and summary in that book—I cannot undertake to produce the case; I believe I read it—I had not examined the minute-book to see that the summary was right with regard to the calls made—I did not tell Counsel that—I had not referred to anything connected with 1881—I knew nothing prior to my coming to the bank—returns were entered in the book which were not there when I went there, but I did not verify particulars prior to the time I went there in any way—I can remember nothing the Counsel was told except about the agreement between the two companies. (<hi rend="italic">The agreement between the Grosvenor Finance Company and the Grosvenor Bank Company was here read. It stated, among other things, that the nominal capital was 100,000l., in 100,000 shares of 1l. each, and that no shareholder in the old Company should be called on to pay more than 10s. in respect of each share he might hold in the new Company.</hi>) The shares were all handed over, they were not assigned—I have neither seen nor heard of any assignment—this contract is signed 12th October, 1881; it was entered in the register on 11th October, the day before it was filed—the directors always met in the evening—the shares could not be entered at the registry till the 12th—the agreement was dated the 11th, and registered on the morning of the 12th—I should say the shares were entered at some time after this was registered—the date of register is 11th October—Titcomb, Holder, and James Birch signed as directors of the Grosvenor Bank Company—Titcomb signed as liquidator on behalf of the old Company—there is nothing in the minute of 21st May, 1881, referring to any agreement as to the formation of this Company—no shares were alloted on that occasion—on the 26th Mr. Wells applied for 200 shares, Mr. Thomson for 175, Titcomb for 50, Seymour for 50, Moore for 60 and 30, Booty for 13, John for 10, Holder for 10—the minute book would not say the amount to be received per share, nor whether anything was paid on account—there is no reference to any other Company there—in the cash account it says, "Received on shares half-crown per share"—there was nothing about a call being made at this meeting—on the next meeting, 2nd June, there is no mention of any other Company—I find 2,608 shares allotted—I find Mr. Holder paid half-a-crown a share, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on his 700 shares, and Birch the same; Wells paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a share on his 200, and the others a half-crown a share—there is nothing about any calls on that day—on 2nd June all the Grosvenor Finance Company shares had been allotted—among the last 10,000 I find Titcomb, Holder, Wells, J. Birch, W. S. Birch, Rintoul, Riddell, Dodson, Cox—half the nominal capital was bought up by those—100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is called the nominal capital; the remainder of the nominal capital was all taken up from 24th March to 2nd June, and it appears the majority of it by the directors—they paid half-a-crown and some paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on application—Wells paid 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 200, and Cox 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a share; Dodson paid 150<hi rend="italic">l.;</hi> Riddell's creditors have paid 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 100, James Birch paid 87<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 700, and Rintoul and Holder the same—W.

Birch paid 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 348; Titcomb 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 30—that completes the whole nominal capital of the Company, and it is all taken up on that date—there is no reference in the book up to 2nd June of any agreement or any call—there is no such entry on 9th or 30th June, or on 7th and 12th July—on 21st July there is a reference to an agreement—the minute of 21st July is "The manager (Mr. Titcomb) reported that he had received an offer to purchase the Company for 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to be</p>

               <p>paid in fully paid-up shares"—the offer was from the Grosvenor Bank Discount Company—I believe he was appointed manager and secretary of the Grosvenor Bank—the directors present on 21st July were Messrs. Holder, J. Birch, Cox, Rintoul, W. Cocks, Thompson, W. S. Birch, and Baker—with the exception of Mr. Baker those gentlemen were all directors of the bank when I went there—the Grosvenor Bank and Dis<lb/>count Company was registered on 11th July, 1881—the minute I have just read was a meeting of the Finance Company after the incorporation of the bank—here is the memorandum and articles of association of the Grosvenor Bank—the seven directors took twenty-five shares each—the same seven names appear on the balance sheet of the Finance Company—the assets of the Finance Company at that time appear as 6,408<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the balance sheet is made up differently to any balance sheet I ever saw—the net profit on the half-year appears to be 257<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the dividend to shareholders 131<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—205<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is carried from the balance sheet of the Finance Company into the balance sheet of the bank; it naturally would be—the balance sheet of the bank put forward as shares issued at that date 12,074<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Harry M. Spinks, of 3, Marchmont Street, Westminster, is registered as a subscriber to the Grosvenor Bank and entered on page 45 of the register—the date is omitted—the money was not paid till March 21st—this (<hi rend="italic">produced by the prisoner</hi>) put<lb/>ports to be a copy of the registered members from the beginning—it says here that it was supplied to you in August last—it is not a full register, it goes up to September, 1881—the last name is Susannah Burroughs, No. 12,074—that agrees with the last number in the balance sheet.

(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner here put in requests to the Company to be furnished with lists of members and other documents</hi>. ) One of these lists states the balance owing, and the other the amount paid, and I should say that they were furnished in compliance with your letter—this is your writing at the top, and this is the writing of a clerk in the bank—I gave instruc<lb/>tions to send you one or other of these—this (<hi rend="italic">another</hi>) was made by Pen<lb/>fold—I never saw it—I find in the register of members book, "Caleb Titcomb, 8395—8474"—I do not see that he is in arrear—I distinctly state that I never examined this paper—I find Mr. Titcomb paid up on those eighty shares on October 11th—Schofield's shares are paid up in the register—those are shares which were carried into the register after they were fully paid-up—I was not there when the entry was made—if there was any amount in arrear that would come after<lb/>wards; and it is a matter of common sense that it would be registered—Mr. Titcomb's shares, as far as the new Company was concerned, were fully paid up in October 8—I cannot say what were the returns to Somerset House at that time; I am not resposible for this document; why don't you call the man who entered it?—I find here the name of Pattison, ten shares,</p>

               <p>6691 to 6700 fully paid up; and Mr. Rudolf's we the same; that is through the ignorance of the man who returned it—the Grosvenor finance Company has nothing to do with me; I have, never seen their books, and cannot produce them—I found this prospectus of the bank printed when I got there—I think this is correct, "The board of directors are all well known men of business and practical knowledge"—they are men of great practical experience in their own business—they have not all had large experience as directors—it is true that "no promotion money whatever has been paid;" the premium paid for the business of the Finance Company could not be considered promotion money—none of the directors object to these proceedings against you—the Magistrate advised you to apologise for the libel; you objected to do so, and said it was true; there was no desire to punish you, merely that you should apologise—I received from you this letter of 20th December, 1884. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he never intended to include the witness in his charges against the directors</hi>. ) In answer to that I wrote this letter of 23rd December.

               <p>thought Pryor and Allen were the same person; I told the prisoner as I had promised to give him something I might make him some recompense, say 5 guineas, but the bank being closed I had not the money by me—he said, "I should be very glad if you would let me have 3 guineas to-day"—I found I had just four sovereigns, and I said, "I will let you have the 3 guineas"—no mention was made about any further sum than 5 guineas—I said, "You had better give me an IOU for this"—there was not a word about lending money—I requested him to call again the following week—he did not, and I wrote to him about 10 days afterwards, and when he called I said, "I wish you to take the 2 guineas to settle the matter," and he said, "I should not think of it, my information is worth hundreds"—with that he went away, and so it has remained to this day—no doubt if he had had the information to give which he thought he had, it would have been worth a considerable sum of money—the first vexatious proceeding against me was in July at Westminster Police-court—the next was 88 summonses on 13th August at Bow Street—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are some of them—there is no imputation in these of anything false or fraudulent, simply a default—he went to the Greenwich Police-court on 19th November because there was a branch of the bank there—the summons there was dismissed with costs, which he did not pay—on 26th November he went before the Lord Mayor against Messrs. Birch and Spinks with regard to another company—that was heard on 11th December and dismissed with 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. costs—on 18th December the matter of the 88 summonses was finally heard before Sir James Ingham, who said he acquitted the directors of being privy to the false return, but convicted them of a technical violation of the statute—the sole question was whether the 10,000 fully-paid shares given in respect of the 15,000 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. paid shares in the old coucern, and 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the goodwill and premises, should have been entered as 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. fully paid shares or as 10,000 fully-paid shares—this is the draft agreement of 11th September—there is a memorandum, "Sent to Waterlow Brothers and Layton for engrossment on 8th October," and the date is altered from September to October—an agreement was signed on behalf of the old Company by the official liquidator—it sets out the meeting of the shareholders of the old Company and the new, the terms on which the transfer was to be made, and the actual transfer by Titcomb of the assets and liabilities—this is the case submitted to Counsel with his opinion thereon (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)—to the best of my belief not a single person in the new Company got a fully-paid-up share till he paid the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it is the duty of the secretary or manager of a limited company to make the returns to Somerset House—it would be Titcomb's duty, he was both secretary and manager—if there were errors it would be entirely his fault—I new knew a director in any company look at the return—I find imperfect book-keeping in the register—as far as I have seen there is no trace in the books of a single director taking extra advantage of a shilling over and above the ordinary shareholders.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I had been there 20 years—lists and summaries were not sent afterwards by Titcomb to Somerset House—it must have been inadvertence or ignorance that he did not have a copy in the register—apart from the word "paid" being used, instead of "considered as paid," I can speak of no inaccuracy or fraud upon any shareholder or any one outside the Company by reason of the returns to Somerset House—the main charge is the 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being carried out as "paid," instead of "considered as paid"—I can suggest no fact to justify a suspicion of fraud in regard to that—I knew Mr. W. Birch was the purchaser of shares making up the difference—when the fusion took place in October I found the record in Titcomb's writing that the shares had been transferred—on 5th August, 1880, he purchased 25 shares of Tiger—10 shares were transferred to W. S. Birch on 13th August, 1880, and 10 shares in June, 1881—that makes up 558 shares to which he was entitled in the Grosvenor Bank—there is no fraud in respect of them—10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid on all of them—10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. has been paid on all the Grosvenor Bank shares—the point the prisoner made was that half-a-crown was paid on each share and that no call of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. could be found entered in the books—in many cases the shareholders have paid in ad<lb/>vance of a call, and I have given instances of that—neither a director nor any shareholder would have the shareholder's certificate for ✗1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. till the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was all paid—the allotment took place on the half-crown in some cases—the full amount was paid on application—the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was largely paid up in advance of call—the Grosvenor Finance Company's shares were 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. only was paid when the fusion took place—those shares were considered as 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. paid by the Grosvenor Bank, and the Grosvenor bank delivered certificates of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or that 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—all the directors had paid up 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. before certificates were issued—I know that there are certificates now in possession of the Bank which have been signed and sealed, but not issued because the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as not paid up.</p>

I have been a cab proprietor 30 years—I live at Westminster—I joined the Grosvenor Finance Company, and a number of friends joined me in the Joint Stock Company, which was carried on in the same street where the Grosvenor Bank was carried on afterwards, Great Smith Street—Titcomb was the manager of the Grosvenor Finance Com<lb/>pany—I joined in 1879—I took something over 1,000 shares, and paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on each—it was very successful, and the shareholders were properly paid their dividends—the greatest confidence was placed in Titcomb—there were about 100 shareholders altogether—the new Company was started for the purpose of enlarging the operations, actually on account of the success of the small Company—I am the chairman of the new Company—I had fully paid up my 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a share before I got the share certificate—the new Company bought the old Company for 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that is 10,000 shares, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each was to be paid upon them, and all the shareholders who chose to have fully paid up shares took them; 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. only was paid at first—5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was given by the old Company to the new to be distributed equally; that was for the goodwill and assets—it was sold, and every shareholder got a fully paid-up share of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for what he had paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for—5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to represent the Loan Company and 5,000<hi rend="italic"> l.</hi> for the goodwill; no one got his share before the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid—Mr.</p>

               <p>Rudolf was appointed solicitor by the shareholders, and this fusion was managed under his advice, with the consent of the shareholders—the matter was laid before Counsel—I had implicit confidence in Mr. Tit<lb/>comb in the new Company, such faith in him that I took up 1,300 shares with 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. paid, which was 650 hard sovereigns, and it went on apparently prospering down to the time of Gauntlett's trial—that was a matter for which Titcomb was responsible—it was the best thing that ever happened to the Directors, because we should never have found this out if it had not been for Gauntlett's trial—it was Titcomb's duty down to the time of his leaving to send the returns to Somerset House—I never interfered with it in the slightest—I had no knowledge of the papers he sent forward—I had not the least knowledge of his not keeping the originals of the returns to Somerset House—Sir James Ingham said that there was no fraud whatever, it was a technical error—Titcomb could have availed himself of the, solicitor if he wished—I did not interfere in the slightest with the way he made the returns—since Mr. Titcomb left, an examination of the new Company's valuables and assets has disclosed a deficiency of some thousands—he lent largely to the swindlers, Pope, Errington, and Pryor, who have been con<lb/>victed—I called the shareholders together and told them of the state of the affairs—Boaler was in the passage trying to upset the share<lb/>holders—one or two of them came up to me and said, "Who is that outside?"—I said, "Boaler, who has been taking us all to the police-court," and Titcomb and Pryor said that they would smash up and wreck the Bank—the shareholders passed a unanimous vote of confidence, and in me individually—we have had to make calls upon the shareholders in consequence of the prisoner's and Pryor's proceedings, but only upon those shareholders who had not paid up the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the new shares; the old shares were all paid up—there was an end of that Company up to the fusion taking place—the whole of the shareholders in the old became shareholders in the new Company—besides Pryor, who employed the prisoner, no shareholder has accused me of any improper could not—they have been trying to shut up the Bank, which would have been very detrimental, but the directors are keeping it open; they are resolved to keep it going without any call upon the shareholders—the share<lb/>holders say, "Why don't you make a call?" and we say, "No; we will keep it open ourselves"—Pryor's proceedings damaged the Bank every time they were put in the papers—the prisoner wanted black mail from us; he wanted 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he took proceedings because we would not settle with him—my friends and I subscribed from, 30,000 to 40,000, and the remainder up to 60,000 shares were taken up by strangers—some of the Directors have got 2,000 shares each; I have got 1,300.</p>
