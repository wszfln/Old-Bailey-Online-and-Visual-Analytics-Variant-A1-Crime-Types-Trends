I heard my gold rattle in a little iron box, that I keep in my purse, which I had laid under my head, when I went to bed: I lay still, and it was about half an hour before I could hear anybody stir in the room again; then I heard the door move (I burn a lamp in my room, but that was out; whether the prisoner put it out or not, I know not) at the door opening, the dog barked below: then I rang the bell; my servant called, What is the matter? I said, there is somebody in the house: they came down, and they took the prisoner. When they got a light, I asked him what he had done with my purse? he said, he had not got it; I sent for a constable; then he said the purse was in my room; I was then below. The constable went up, and brought my purse down; there was a guinea, three half guineas, and 15 s. 6 d. in it, my property.

She rang the bell; I came down, and found the prisoner on the stairs: when my mistress charged him with stealing her purse, he at first denied it; but at last, said, he would go and shew us where it was. I and the constable went up with him into my mistress's room; he took up the purse from the floor, and gave it to the constable. He said, when the dog bark'd, he was afraid it was a great mastiff dog, and he was afraid to go down stairs.

We went down, and found the prisoner there, in a vault, with the quantity of sugar mentioned, in his pocket.

            . On the 24th of December, betwixt 12 and 1 o'clock, I caused to be loaded on a cart, three cases, and two matted trunks, and on account of one of the trunks, I did not chuse to trust any body with them, but went myself with the cart, and did not lose sight of it, till it got down to the Custom-house key. When I got into Tower-street, I overtook our waterman which we employ, Mr.

            , who accompanied me down to the key; there I saw these trunks and cases unloaded, and put safely under the crane, which the merchants use for shipping goods, about 2 yards from the water-side. I gave orders care should be taken of them; they were delivered to the waterman, in his presence, and he was to ship them, but we were to wait a little: the thing in dispute was, which of the two ships we should ship them on board. When we had discharged the carman, Mr. Turpin and I went up together, to give him particular directions concerning shipping those goods; and I knew nothing to the contrary of their being shipped, till the Monday following, about noon, when Mr. Turpin came to my counting-house, and brought the captain's receipt for only four out of five of these cases. The ship is a Spanish ship, called the St. Michael: Mr. Turpin told me, at the same time, that the other trunk was missing, and he was in hopes it was wrong shipped. Upon which, I was very anxious of finding it, it was the richest of the trunks, marked with a Heart, and a Crow-foot on the top, divided in the middle with three letters, J. G. C. in Roman capitals, with No. 15. upon it. The others were different marks; this was a flat trunk, about 3 feet long, and about 22 inches broad, and about 20 deep. I went with Mr. Turpin upon the key, and we made all the enquiry we could, among the shipping, but could not find it; I suppose they must produce this trunk to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the contents of the things in in the trunk?</p>
               <p>Lucas. There were 871 fans, value 164 l. 5 s. two gold trinkets, set with diamonds, value eight guineas; a gold repeating watch, set with diamonds, and other precious stones, value 630 l. a gold toilet, value 28 l. a mother of pearl necklace and ear-rings, and other things; the whole value of the goods, I remember, were from 1000 to 1100 l. I saw them put into the box, which was matted and corded, and I sealed the key with wax, in the counting-house, under the matting. I have made all the diligent enquiry I could, but never could hear any thing of it.</p>

               <p>Henson. My master is Mr. Hunter, a watchmaker, at the corner of Lombard-street, next door to the pastry-cooks. I was sent by my master to the custom-house key with a clock, the day before Christmas-day, to be shipped on board; after that I had another Errand to go to Burr-street, St. Catherine's. I delivered the clock at the custom-house key. When I came to Brewer's key I saw Lot Lash standing under the crane, with a flat parcel, like a trunk, matted and corded; he desired me to help him up with it; I went to help him, but it was too heavy for me; I tried but could not; then she said he was afraid the officers would seize it; then I proceeded on my other Errand as far as the Tower; then I saw him with such a thing on his shoulder coming along.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you describe the shape or size of that parcel?</p>
               <p>Henson. I cannot directly; it was heavy; I followed him over Tower-wharf, where he turned round several times, but for what purpose I do not know; when I came to the farthest end of the wharf he turned towards Tower-hill, and I saw no more of him; I went of my errand, and then home to my master.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to recollect this?</p>
               <p>Henson. By the warning being brought to my master's; when he said there was a trunk stolen, then I told him what I had seen.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Brewer's Key?</p>
               <p>Henson. It is two or three keys farther than the Custom-house key, towards Tower-hill.</p>

            . On the 30th of January the bankrupt came to my house, and said he had information the prisoner had some of his leather, and desired me to go to Mr. Finleson who got a warrant, and we went with a constable to the prisoner's lodgings; there we found, I think, twenty-five pounds weight of inward sole leather, fifteen lasts, (all marked with the bankrupt's name) and fifty pair of soles, ten dozen welts, and other parcels of leather. The prisoner said he bought eighteen pair of them soles at Mr. Marshman's in the Broadway, Westminster, and picked out eighteen pair from the rest. I asked him in what Manner he bought them; he said, by two or three pair at a time, and said the rest were all the bankrupt's property; and that his method was, as he worked for him at his own lodgings, he went and bought worse leather at the leather-cutters, and put them in and kept his master's soles; and his master's clicker brought the lasts to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has Mr. Skene been a bankrupt?</p>
               <p>Edmonds. He has been a bankrupt ever since October last, when he ran away. There were a few shoes out among the workmen, and when they came in the trade was stopt. I believe the prisoner could not have carried on this scene since he was a bankrupt.</p>

I saw upwards of twenty pounds weight of inward sole leather found, fifteen lasts or upwards in a bag, with the initial letters of the bankrupt's name on each; and I saw found fifty soles, and about ten dozen of Welts. The prisoner told me he bought worser soles, and kept his master's himself, and put in the bad one's in his master's shoes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Finleson. The prisoner is a creditor to the bankrupt of 21 l. and I do think this prosecution was done in malice.</p>

               <p>Skene. About 14 or 15 pair. I delivered out all the Materials. I delivered out lasts, but not those that were found in his house; the lasts that he had were only for the army, but these were customers lasts.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had taken and kept your leather, and put in worse, could you have discovered it?</p>
               <p>Skene. No; not thinking of any fault.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner a creditor under the commission?</p>
               <p>Skene. He is of 21 l. I borrowed money of him at two guineas at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you become a bankrupt?</p>
               <p>Skene. I became a bankrupt in October.</p>

               <p>Skene. No; he never pressed me for money, or to give him security for it. (The goods produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Skene. The lasts I know by my name on them; they are mine; and I know the soles to be mine by the cutting; they are my own cutting. The prisoner told me he had sent two parcels of my leather to Scotland that he had got in this manner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I bought two or three dozen pair of welts. There were several journeymen worked in the house I lived in for my master; and when they went away they did not carry home their lasts; they were found in my custody, but I did not bring them there; I bought a number of soles of journeymen who had them to sell, and in leather-cutter shops, and cut it out myself.</p>

I went to enquire about among the pawnbrokers, and found the petticoat pawned in his wife's name in Turnmill-street; then I went and got a warrant to take up the prisoner and his wife on suspicion; I took them before Justice Welch; the prisoner there cleared his wife, and owned he himself robbed me of all the things, and confessed where he had pawned them; some in Turnmill-street, and some in the Strand. The justice directed me to go to the people; I went, and they brought the things to the justice.</p>

            . I keep a public-house; the prisoner brought a coach-glass to my house to sell to an old cloaths-man this day fortnight: I had a frame that would near sit it; and as he said it was given him, I thought he did not steal it, so I agreed with him for it for half-a-crown. When he was gone I took up the news-paper, and there read an advertisement of such a glass being stolen. He had told me his master lived at the Swan at the bottom of Hay-hill,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176402220009"/> by Brudenell's muse: After dinner I went there to enquire: I found the prisoner was discharged there, and they gave him a very bad character, and that they had forbid him coming there. In the evening there came the other witness and asked to see the glass; he measured it, and said he believed it belonged to the prosecutor. The prisoner came the next evening and called for a pint of beer; I stopped him; he would go with me to his master at the Swan, but he attempted to slip from us as we came near the house. (The glass produced in court.)</p>

The other servants had left work. I cry'd, Hollo, Who is there? He said, It is I, master; I said, What are you doing there? he answered, he was looking for an old shoe; I said, What have you done with your candle? He said. it was dropt down in the bin: I ran int o the kitchen and fetched a candle, and found him in the same position; and opposite to where he stood was a parcel of glass in a sack, about three quarters of a hundred weight; we sell it at seventeen shillings a hundred weight; he said he did not know how the sack came there. After he was gone, I went and made a chalk mark on the sack, and my mother stuck a pin in it; I then went to the next house; my father came home; I immediately told him what I had seen; we went to the warehouse, and the sack was taken away; I fetched a constable; we hunted about for the sack for a considerable time; at last we found it hid under the cellar-stairs; the chalk mark had been in part rubbed out; the pin remained in it; we challenged him with putting that glass in the sack; he would not own it. The prisoner had sold us 221 lb. weight of cullet; we asked him how he came by that? He said he bought it at an old iron shop in St. Giles's; I and the constable went with him to the place in a coach, but the people declared they never saw him in their lives; coming back, he confessed the whole affair in the coach; he said he used to take it out of the Bin by a little at a time, and carry it to our stable in St. John's square, till he made up that quantity. He sold us three parcels more, one on the 11th of November, the other the 18th, and the other in December: He acknowledged they were all our own property.</p>

            . On Sunday night, the 15th of January, I was coming from St. James's end of the town to Billingsgate, I met the prisoner on Ludgate-hill, a little after eight at night; she took hold of me, and asked me if I would go along with her; I asked her where she lived, she said, Just by; I went along with her to <placeName id="t17640222-20-crimeloc109">Addle hill</placeName>

               <p>Q. How came she to have an opportunity to do it?</p>
               <p>Cole. We were upon the bed at the time; I was going to be familiar with her, but after I found that I declined; upon the other coming in with what we sent for to drink, I got from the bed, and felt in my pocket and found it out.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what spoiled your familiarity?</p>
               <p>Cole. That was the other woman coming in.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you spent that day?</p>
               <p>Cole. I had been with my Brother that lives with Esquire Castle in Spring-gardens.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Cole. I was quite sober, I had drank only one pot of beer with my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen your 36 s. piece?</p>
               <p>Cole. I took it out of my pocket and looked at it after the other woman was gone out of the room: I had that, a sixpence, and half-a-guinea; I charged the prisoner with it, she said she knew nothing about it; I asked her if she knew any thing of the brass piece, she said she did, and that it was her own; she stript off some of her cloaths to let me see she had it not; I searched the bed but could not find it; I kept her in the room till 10 o'clock; then I charged the watch with her; I offered her half-a-guinea if she would return it, but she would not own that she had it; she was carried before Mr. Alderman Rawlinson the next day, but she said nothing there.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor seemed to be very much in liquor; I know nothing of his money; I buy and sell old cloaths; I was at that house, he took hold of me and charged me; I never was upon Ludgate-hill that night.</p>

Yesterday was fortnight, about six in the evening, I was coming out of my parlour, my apprentice said, the thieves were at the window, that had been there before (we suspected some fellows that had been at the window the Monday before) I gave a look, being within a foot of the door, and saw Bunyard take some goods through the glass, and run away with them: candles were lighted in the shop, I went to the window, and found a bit of glass broke out, and some goods gone, I cannot swear to all that was taken; I asked my apprentice if he had seen the thieves? he said, he had; and said, he should know them again: then I thought it necessary to be a little upon the watch, in case they should return. In less than five minutes, Bunyard returned, and took the residue through the hole; he put his hand in, and pulled them out. I saw him move with them in his hand from the window: I followed him immediately. In his running, I cry'd, Stop thief: he ran against a woman, knocked her down, and fell over her; I had not lost sight of him. He was taken, brought back, and committed; he had conveyed the goods away. I can swear he is the man that put his hand in, and took goods out. My goods were taken up by a person and brought into the shop; the prisoner said, he heard the cry, Stop thief, and he ran, in order to catch the thief, and so he fell down. I saw no man running but him, nor none by him, when he took out the goods. (The goods produced.) These are my property, and were lying by the glass which they had broke, within the shop. He told me, he was a watch engraver.</p>

He sent me to the Compter, to see whether I should know the prisoner, Price; I looked through the rails, and saw all the prisoners together; as soon as I saw Price, I knew him; I believe he is the man I saw with Bunyard, on Wednesday night, when these handkerchiefs were lost. I saw him at the shop window; I cannot swear particularly to Bunyard, but I believe upon my oath, Price was one of the two. I heard the other say, which I suppose to be Bunyard. Where is Joe? at the window, just before the handkerchiefs were taken.</p>

            . Yesterday fortnight, I was going through Bishopsgate-street, about 20 yards from the prosecutor's door, I heard the prisoner, Bunyard, hallow out, Stop thief. There was a gentlewoman, she not giving way, he knock'd her down, and fell over her, and I laid hold of him: the prosecutor came up, and said, he had robbed him of some handkerchiefs, from his shop window. The prisoner said, he was running after a thief that was gone before: there was no other person past me, but the prisoner. As I had hold of his collar, I saw him pull his hand out of his pocket; I said, are you going to pull any thing out? he took his hand out; I did not see any thing fall; but in about ten minutes after he was in the prosecutor's shop, the handkerchiefs were brought in by a stranger.</p>

I found five locks broke; I lost out of a closet a silver salver, two small silver dessert forks, a silver table spoon, two silver teaspoons, a pair of cotton stockings, and a pair of worsted stockings, and several things that I think trifling to mention; there was a feather-bed thrown out at a window into the garden.

            . On Sunday morning, the 22d of January, the prisoner Robins, came to my house, and knocked me up: my wife went to the door: he said, he had a piece of plate to sell. I imagined he wanted to inform against me, in case I bought any thing on the Sunday: I sent the maid privately for a constable; she went, and brought one. The prisoner told me, he lived in Gray's-Inn-lane; I asked him if any body recommended him to me? he said no; but that he had bought a watch of me a while ago, and that I had used him very ill, it would not go, and he was forced to sell it to a Jew. I knew at the same time, I never sold him any: he told me, the salver was a family-piece of plate, the property of his mother. I gave the constable charge of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolt. I know all the prisoners. I was sent for by the prosecutrix, on Tuesday the 17th of January, about 2 o'clock, in order to see in what condition every thing was. When I came there, the glazier was just putting in a quarey; (that is the reason he is produced here as an evidence, I not seeing the window in the condition he found them) we found her chest of drawers broke open, in the passage leading to the room, the door of her chamber broke all to pieces, and a large kitchen poker broke in two pieces, lying near it. In her room, several of the drawers were open, and the things had been rumaged. Several boxes were broke in another room, and the locks lying by them; there was never a bed on a bedstead; the bed was thrown out at a window; we found several cupboards broke open. I came to town, and having a great deal of business, did not go to Sir

             till the Thursday morning. I got the things advertised, and put out some hand-bills; and on Monday night, I had a letter by Sir John's order, to let me know a man was taken up on suspicion of stealing plate, and that he owned he had buried a silver salver behind a hay-rick, in Mr. Bannister's ground; he keeps an inn at Stains, near where Robins lives. The Justice advised us to go and search the ricks, and the house where Robins lived, for the rest of the plate. I went there, and found a hole that had been fresh dug, we could find nothing; we searched the rick, then we searched the prisoner's lodgings. The next morning, Madam Watts came to town, and swore to her salver; then Robins declared before Sir John, that he and the other two prisoners were concerned in the robbery; he said, the first made an attempt on the cellar-door, and broke it open, but the water was so deep<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176402220013"/> in it, they could not go in that way; then they got a ladder, from between the cherry-nursery and the barn, and set it against the window; that there was a round or two out of the ladder, and Galliher had like to have fell down; that they could not lift up the sash, so they broke the glass, and put a hand in, and unscrewed it, and got in there; and that Godfrey, in attempting to go up the ladder, fell down.

             both went in, and down into the kitchen, and found the fire was not out; then there was such a noise of thumping in the house, in breaking the door and things, that it might be heard as far as the Turk's-Head, (that is 200 yards distance); that they brought the plate out at the window to him. Then they consulted who should sell the plate; he said, he himself was not in the house, but stood all the time at the bottom of the ladder, and walking backwards and forwards; that he himself was pitched upon to sell the plate, being the cleanest dressed. That he came up on the Friday morning, and sold the small plate. We took a coach, and went to the place where he mentioned, a silver-smith, Mr. Masters, in Coventry-street, and found the applescoop, table-spoons, and the forks; we took him in the coach with us; I had a warrant from Sir John, and took up the other two prisoners. I met the woman in the street first, and gave her in charge of a constable; she said

The prosecutrix's house stands upon Hamptoncourt road, some distance from any other; that Davis lives in the town, and they used to meet at her house. After I had taken Galliher, and delivered him into the custody of the constable, Godfrey sent for me, and said, if I would let her out of the round-house, she would confess all to me. I had her brought to my house; she said no more to me, than she had said before; but when she came before Sir

Before Sir John, Godfrey said, another person was concerned; upon her swearing to that, he was taken up, and appeared innocent, and Sir John set him at liberty Sir John would have admitted her an evidence, but I begg'd he would not.

The prisoner came to my shop on the first of February, to buy a pair of tea-tongs, and six silver spoons, and two or three other odd things: he agreed to give 29 s. for them, and gave me a shilling earnest. About half a minute before he went out of the shop, he put his hand quick into the drawer, and put something in his pocket; I was fronting him all the time. The moment he turned out at the door, he set up a running as fast as he could; I followed him through several streets, before I could come up with him. When I came up with him, I said, friend, let me know what is in your right hand pocket? said he, you shall not put your hand in; I'll put my hand in myself, which he did, and brought out this silver stock-buckle (producing one) I can't sware to it, but I missed just such a one, and here is the maker's name on it that made mine, and the prisoner owned it was mine; that he took it out of my shop by mistake: upon my return, I missed it: I did not stay to see what he had taken, when he went out.</p>

               <p>Burchall. No, it was not.</p>

               <p>I saw the stock-buckle on the outside the window; I asked him the price, he said five shillings; then I asked the price of a pair of tea-tongs; he showed me a pair at half-a-guinea, and another at 8 s. 6 d. then I wanted three tea-spoons, he weighed them, they came to nine shillings, and a pair of women's shoe buckles came to twelve shillings; the whole came to twenty-nine or thirty shillings, besides the stock-buckle: I said I had not money enough about me, but I would come again for them, and gave him earnest; business interfereing, I put a 5 s. 3 d. in my pocket, and this stockbuckle, by mistake.</p>

The constable said, no; I must execute my warrant, you must go before the justice: When we came there, the justice said, Is this the man? I said, Yes.

               <p>My husband took these buckles out of his pocket, and desired me to go and pledge them for him: He is run away, and I have not seen him since: He said he had borrowed them of one of his workmates to pledge for 6 s. that he wanted.</p>

I touched his coat and felt something heavy in it; I said, You villain, you've robbed me; we searched, and took two quart pots and a penny pot out of one pocket, and two quart pots and a penny pot out of the other; (produced in court) Here are our names upon them: They were taken from among more, that were some lying on the table, and some on a shelf by them.</p>

            . I am a constable. Between 6 and 7 o'clock, on the 24th of January, I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner at the bar for stealing a pig of copper ore; I took him to the counter; I asked him how he came to be so foolish to go to take this copper ore; he hesitated a little while, and at last said he took it for want; says I there must be two or three concerned with you in taking so much away, being told there were two or three more pigs missing; he made little or no answer; he was a labouring man upon the keys; I never saw him but once before in my life.</p>

That man and the prisoner resembled; they might be brothers, I never saw them before: I said I was not going to dispute with him about it; upon that, Mr. Miller, who was on the other side the kennel, said, Come away, don't be talking to them fellows; the prisoner was standing close to me; he saw the chain of my watch, clapped his hand upon it, and took my watch out of my pocket; I saw it in his hand, and strove to catch it: I called to Mr. Miller, and said, I had lost a very valuable gold watch; we pursued, and the prisoner was never out of my sight till he was taken; I refused fifteen 36 s. pieces for that watch the last time I was in France; there was a cornelian seal to it set in gold. I never saw a man, or any thing that could run equal to the prisoner, except a dog or a horse; he had not been catched, only some people hearing the call, Stop thief, seized him by mere chance: After he was taken, the other man that we saw talking with him came up, and said, Do you think that man has got the watch? I'll go and talk to him; he went quite close to him and jostled with him; and I make no doubt but that man got the watch; he came pretending to vindicate his character.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this before he was searched?</p>
               <p>Bishop. It was; there was nothing found upon the prisoner but four or five pocket-handkerchiefs of different sorts.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. Whether you did not charge another person with stealing your watch before you charged me?</p>
               <p>Bishop. I charged the other man as an accomplice, and also a third person; I was willing to charge them all: But as I knew the prisoner was the man that took my watch, I let them go.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. Did not you come to me in prison, and-say, if I would give you your watch you would not prosecute me.</p>
               <p>Bishop. I said to the prisoner he had better confess he had my watch, for I was certain he was the man that took it. I have no other view in this but public justice; I never expect to see my watch again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Bishop. I was as sober as I am this moment.</p>

            . I was in company with Mr. Bishop on Thursday sennight all the evening. I saw the two men standing together by a hackneycoach; the prisoner was one of them: When we first came there, Mr. Bishop said he should speak to a person at the Antigallican; we went, but the door being shut, we returned down the street again; upon our second coming there, the same two men were standing as we saw them before; there was a very decent drest gentleman along with a woman; he seemed very much in liquor; I imagined the woman to be a woman of the town. Mr. Bishop seeing the gentleman in liquor, desired him as a friend to go home to his lodgings; there were several people about he did not like their aspects; he said he would assist him to his lodgings if he pleased; the woman immediately said, she imagined we were two sharpers, or pickpockets, that intended to take the gentleman from her and rob him; passing along, one of the two men, not the prisoner, said to Mr. Bishop, that the woman might be as honest as he, or e'er a one of us, and wanted to quarrel, and kept shuffling backwards and forwards within a couple of yards of us; I stept on about six or eight paces before him; the first thing I heard was, Mr. Bishop calling me to stop, he had lost his gold watch; upon which I stopt short, and saw a man run across the street, who I immediately pursued; (that was the prisoner) he ran very fast; I called out, Stop thief; he ran a considerable way before he was stopt; I was not twice the breadth of this court-room from him all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did he run?</p>
               <p>Miller. He ran towards St. Paul's. I am a stranger in the town. There were other people pursuing; as I kept calling he was brought back to the watch-house, and was there a considerable<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176402220018"/> time before he was searched; there was a number of people came in. I did not observe the other man in particular near him; there were six or eight people about him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say for himself?</p>
               <p>Miller. He said, at Guildhall, he ran away because he thought Mr. Bisho p was going to beat his competitor. Mr. Bishop was positive to him as soon as he saw him in the watch-house.</p>

            . I was coming along Fleet-street with my shop-mate, the last witness; I heard the cry, Stop thief; we ran and took hold of the prisoner, who was then running, and two or three more after him. He was taken to the watchhouse. The prosecutor came and said he had robbed him of a gold watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any body running before the prisoner?</p>

               <p>Reynolds. On Friday, the 3d of this instant, between 10 and 11 at night, my servant came and told me there was a light in the one-pair of stairs room; I knew nobody should be there, because that was not inhabited: I took a couple of pistols and ran there; there I found a bed at the foot of the stairs, wrapped up ready to be carried away: I called for assistance, Mr. Scott came: The back door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this your dwelling house?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. No, It was not; it was an uninhabited house of mine; the woman at the bar was found concealed under the sacking of the bed. I went and searched the prisoner's apartment, and there I found five blankets, a quilt, two pillows, and two pillow-cases; six pictures, 2 glass decanters, a large looking-glass, and a great many pieces of china, all my property: They were taken out of the one-pair of stairs, and two-pair of stairs rooms, in that house. The prisoners were tenants of mine. There came twenty or thirty people to my assistance. The man was taken among the rest of the people in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the prisoners man and wife?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. I know nothing to the contrary but that they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the man when you first went into the room?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. No, I did not. On the Monday a person came from the Compter, and let me know where I might go in Harp alley and find more of my things: I went into Harp-alley; there I found a pier glass and eight pictures. (The goods produced and deposed to.)</p>

            . On the 3d of February, between ten and eleven at night, I was going to bed, I heard an out-cry of fire; then I heard there were thieves in Mr. Reynolds's uninhabited house; I went, and there stood Mr. Reynolds in the yard, with a pistol in his right hand, and another under his left arm. I asked him if he knew who was in the house? he said he could not tell, but had reason to believe there were thieves; he was afraid to go in. I said, give me one of the pistols, and I'll go in; he did. I went in, and the first thing I put my hand upon, was a bed that lay against a door: I went up into the one pair of stairs room; there was no bed upon the bedstead, and in the two pair of stairs room, I found the woman at the bar, under the sacking of the bed; she seeing I had a pistol, begged I would not hurt her; she came from under the bed, and I took her down stairs, and delivered her to the watchman. At the time they were taking charge of her, the man at the bar came down with a blunderbuss in his hand, and said, he had been firing it up the chimney, believing there were thieves there. I stopped him, and asked him where he was going? he said he was going to Mr. Reynolds's house for more fire-arms, to fire up the other chimney below; I said he should not go till Mr. Reynolds came: when he came, I delivered him to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him you had got his wife?</p>
               <p>Scott. No, I did not. They were both carried to the Compter; and on the Saturday, before my Lord Mayor. My Lord asked the man what he intended to do with the goods that were found in his apartment? he said, he did not take them with a view to sell them, but only to make a little money of them. As we were carrying them to the Compter, the woman said, she was very sorry for what she had done, but it was done, and there was no help for it: if she was to die, she was not the first that must die. I asked the man, which way they got in? he said, by breaking the cellar door: I went to Harp-alley, and saw the other things there.</p>
               <p>Q. What name did the woman at the bar go by?</p>

The prisoner got the stick, and struck the deceased on the shoulder, but it did not knock him down; the prisoner went on again, and the deceased followed, and knocked him down again; then the deceased tumbled over the prisoner, and fell on his head, and never spoke more: this was in the highway, where were stones.</p>

My landlady went to enquire among the pawnbrokers in the neighbourhood, and came home and told me, Mr. Davidson would have me to call upon him; I went to him, and he asked me what sort of buckles mine were? I told him, and where I bought them, and that I gave 27 s. for them. He asked me if I had any suspicion of any body? I told him, I had, of a man that lodged in the same house. He said, if I could bring that man to his sight, he would help me to the sight of my buckles. My landlord and I went to see for the prisoner, and found him, and with a great deal of persuasion, he came home with us. Then my landlord went for Mr. Davidson: when he came and saw him, he said, he was the man that brought and sold a pair of buckles to him; then I got a constable and charged him; the prisoner fell into a great passion with the pawnbroker, and called him villain. Mr. Davidson shewed me a pair of buckles, but I thought they were not so wide as mine; I had worn them but twice in my life; I had had them but 13 days, they were taken out of my pumps in my room. (A large wrought pair of silver buckles produced in court. He takes them in his hand.) I can't pretend to swear to them; if I do, I shall swear against my conscience.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you buy the buckles you lost?</p>
               <p>Underwood. I bought them in Coleman-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you describe the buckles to the pawnbroker?</p>
               <p>Underwood. I described them as a large pair of wrought silver buckles. The prisoner proposed to make me satisfaction before the constable; when I charged him, he called the constable and me into a back room, at the Coach and Horses, in High-Timber-street, and said, if I would let him go about his business, he would make me satisfaction in a fortnight's time: he said he was not the thief, but he knew who the thief was.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. Whether he has not acknowledged these buckles are not his?</p>
               <p>Underwood. I never have acknowledged them to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think of them now?</p>

            . I live at Queen-hithe, Thames-street; (He takes the buckles in his hand) These buckles I bought of the prisoner at the bar, on Monday, about the 17th of January. I asked him if the buckles were his own? he said, they were. He said, he was just come out of the country, and wanted a little money. I asked if he wanted to pledge them? he said, he wanted to sell them outright; that they cost him 27 s. and they were not much the worse for wear; that he expected not to lose a great deal by them; they weighed 4 oz. 4 dwts. there are two brass wires, for which we commonly allow 2 dwts. I gave him a guinea for them, and the next day I put them in the window, for sale. The prosecutor's landlady, a woman I knew extremely well, came and asked if there had been such a pair of buckles brought to be pledged: she gave me a very good description of them: I asked her a good many questions, whether she suspected a man or a woman? she said, she suspected a man. I asked what sort of a man; she gave me a very just description of the man that brought them, which was the prisoner. I bid her send the prosecutor to my house; when he came, he gave much the same description of the man and the buckles, as she had done before. I bid him go and find the man, and produce him to me, and I would help him to the sight of the buckles. It is customary with many, if they can but get their goods, they don't care what becomes of the thief. They found him the next day, and I was sent for. I went with the buckles in a paper in my hand: when I came there, said the prosecutor's landlord, the man is in the room, which is he? the prisoner was stooping on the table; he looked up with his hand over his face; said I, that is the man: the prisoner held up his hand, like threatening me, and swore, if I said so again, he would knock me down, and called me villain, and other bad names. I asked the prosecutor if these were his buckles, and shewed him them; the landlord and landlady said they had had them in their possession, and declared those were not the buckles; so said the prosecutor. I said, be kind enough to send for my apprentice (They accused me with changing the buckles, which I scorn upon any terms to do.) I sent for my boy; he came in, and pitched upon the prisoner, as soon as he came into the room.</p>

            . I am constable. On the 18th of January, between 11 and 12 at night, two men came to the watch-house at Queenhithe, and desired I would go with them to the Feathers; I went there, and the prosecutor gave me charge of the prisoner for stealing a pair of silver buckles; after that, the prisoner desired the prosecutor to go into a back room, and me along with him. We went in; then he said, Tom, how much do I owe you? the prosecutor said, the buckles cost 27 s. and he owed him 8 s. 3 d. besides, which made 35 s. 3 d. he said, if he would let him go, he would pay him the money in a fortnight's time; that he was no the thief, but knew who did steal them. I came out of the room, and left them there by themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What is your landlord's name?</p>

               <p>My landlord and the prosecutor came to me on Wednesday in the afternoon, where I was drinking part of a tankard of beer; my landlord said he wanted to speak with me. I went out with him; he said, do you know any thing of Tom's buckles? I said, no. He said, go along with me, and clear yourself: accordingly I did. When I came to the Feathers, in the street where my landlord lives, he went and fetched Mr. Davidson. When he came in, I heard my landlord say, that is Mr. Cook: as soon as Mr. Davidson looked at me, he said, that is Mr. Cook that I bought the buckles of; upon that, I was a little enraged; I never was in his shop in my life-time; he never bought a pair of buckles of me. They sent for a constable, and I was sent to the Compter. I do not remember my saying I knew the thief, or any such thing. The prosecutor mentioned the price of the buckles, and the money I owned him, and put them all together himself.</p>

             said she had got no money. He said, don't trifle, for I'll blow your brains out. I then said I had 2 s. all that I had in the world; you shall have that, and welcome. I was attempting to pull my glove off: he said then to me, don't trifle, but make haste, or I'll blow your brains out, with an oath. Then I gave him the 2 s. and he went away, and was not far from us, when a little lad on horseback came to us (he was going towards Newington). I bid him take care how he passed that man, for he had just robbed me. He spoke to a coachman who was coming to town with a chariot; and there was a man on foot that met the prisoner, just as he went out of the road, over a hedge or gate, into a field; he robbed me in full view of the turnpike. A gentleman came on horseback; he bid the man on foot go over after the prisoner; the man went over after him, and the gentleman and his servant rode round after him, till he was taken.

            . The prisoner at the bar met the prosecutrix and I, between Newington-green, and Islington turnpike, near the pond in the road. About half way between the turnpike and Islington, I observed him coming along, but did not take any particular notice of him; when he came close to us, I went to give him way, to come by: he bid us stand. I said, What does the man mean? I have got nothing. Immediately I looked behind me, to see if any body was coming: then I looked the prisoner in the face; he said, your money; I said, I had not a half-penny: then he held up his stick, or cane, to our heads; and said, if we did not deliver our money immediately, he would blow our brains out. I said, What do you mean to have my money, whether I have any or no? He twice said, if we did not deliver, he would blow our brains out, fixing his eyes on her the second time. Then Mrs. Curtise said, she had 2 s. she would give him that: she took the 2 s. out of her pocket, and held up to him, and said, if that will content you, it is all I have. He snatched the money out of her hand, and bid us go along silent, and he went away towards Newington, and I walked after him at a little distance; there was a chariot coming along, and a man on foot in the foot way, by the side of the chariot; I walked up to the chariot; the prisoner took over a gate or bank, into a field; by that time I was at the chariot, there came a gentleman and his servant on horseback; they asked what was the matter? I said, that man in a brown coat, going along the field, had robbed us. He ordered the man on foot, named Hecock, to go over the field, after him, and he would ride round the road, and prevent his crossing again; the gentleman rode back, and ordered his servant to follow him; he saw other men, and bid them assist, and at last they took him. I did not see them take him, but am sure he is the man that stopped us. As soon as he was taken, the gentleman sent his footman for us; we went with him to the turnpike-house, at Kingsland; and as soon as he saw Mrs. Curtise, he offered her her two shillings again, and said, it was the first fact he ever committed. I saw the 2 s. in his hand; I can't say particularly his words, but he wanted to be set at liberty.</p>
               <p>Q. Mention his words as well as you can.</p>
               <p>M. Cadwell. He said, to be sure I have robbed you, and there was the money again, if she would be so kind as to take it.</p>

            . I am a shagg-weaver, and live at the Green-man, at Ball's-pond, Newington. I was going from thence to Islington, just after one o'clock: about an hundred yards from Ball's-pond turnpike, I met a little boy on horseback; he shewed to me a man, and said, that man had robbed a couple of women; he was not then fifty yards from me. I was not satisfied with what the boy said; I asked where the women were: I saw them, and ran to them, and asked them; they told me the same: a gentleman and his servant came up; I told the gentleman that man had robbed the two women: the prisoner was in the field. The gentleman said, do you follow him: you may catch him before he gets out of the field, and I'll ride round, and give him a meeting. I went into the field; the prisoner crossed the first field, and came to a house they call the Rosemary-branch. I kept about 50 or 60 yards behind him; he crossed the road that leads from Rosemary-branch to Newington, and went over the bank into another field, and crossed one or two fields more, and went towards Kingsland. I was not above 10 or twelve yards behind him, when he got over the last bank.

The prisoner was very much in liquor last Tuesday, between 11 and 12 o'clock, at my master's house; he had been at his club the night before, that is kept by the wool-combers in Goswell-street, and the next morning he drank a dram or two, and a pot of beer: He went out very much in liquor: He was not at all qualified for his work. If he drinks a little too much, he is as mad as one in Bedlam. When he is sober he follows his work very hard.</p>

            . On the 30th of January, in the evening, between five and six o'clock, the prisoner brought this watch to me, at my master's, Mr. Gunston's, a pawnbroker, in Germain-street, St. James's: He wanted fifty-five shillings on it; I bid him two guineas. I recollected I had seen such a watch advertised to be stolen in Drury-lane playhouse. Then I went and acquainted my master: He and another man came into the shop and secured the prisoner; and we carried him and the watch to Sir

               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Conyers. I believe I have seen him once or twice at our shop before.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the prisoner say he came by it?</p>
               <p>Conyers. He said he bought it of a sea-faring man for 36 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. When you carried the watch to your master, might the prisoner have had an opportunity to run away?</p>
               <p>Conyers. My master was at a public-house; but I went back into our back parlour, and so out the back way for him, and there were people belonging to our house in the shop; and I did not tell the prisoner what I was going to my master about; he might think I was gone for the money for him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>All my defence is my innocency. I came very honestly by the watch by buying of it. I was journeyman to Mr. Dawson in Monmouth-street: I had left him about four weeks.</p>

               <p>Harrison. A very good character. His father and mother kept a shop in Monmouth-street: She has been dead about three years, and since that he has been with his brother-in-law, Mr. Dawson. He has often been along with me. I should have trusted him very readily with any thing I have, and should have thought myself very safe in so doing.</p>

               <p>Q. How long has his mother been dead?</p>
               <p>Gofton. About three years. I am very sensible he need never want money; it was only asking any of his brothers, or the last witness, and he might have it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use to haunt playhouses?</p>
               <p>Gofton. No; except he went with his sister, or if his mother has ordered some of the journeymen or me to go with him. He has had a very great education.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live now?</p>
               <p>Gofton. I now live at the other end of the town, but the prisoner has been at places in Rosemary-lane; and it has been in his power to rob his masters was he so inclined; but I never heard any ill of him.</p>

            . I have known him from his infancy. My brother married his sister. He was my servant and had a guinea a week. He never asked me for money but he had it. He was intrusted with 16 or 18 hundred pounds worth of goods. I never missed any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to leave you?</p>
               <p>Dawson. He had a difference with a young lad, my apprentice, so he left me last month. He rather chose to deal for himself, in buying and selling leather breeches. If he had wanted five, ten, or twenty pounds, he might have had it. I would take him into my service, and give him a guinea a week now, was he out. He lodged in my house, and always kept good hours. He says he bought this watch at Gravesend.</p>
               <p>Kednull Dawson. I was in partnership with the prisoner's mother. The prisoner has been under my tuition twelve years; I have done every thing possible I could for him; I always found him honest. He lived in as much reputation as any gentleman in court. As honest a person as ever was born. I would now trust him with untold gold.</p>

               <p>Harrison. The prisoner gave in the name Davis because he knew himself to be very innocent. He was ashamed to give in his own name.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>

            . On the 8th of January, in the evening, I came up the Old Bailey, and called at the Bell, and had a pint of twopenny, near about 7 o'clock. There were a parcel of men drinking in the house; one of them stepped out, and brought in the prisoner and another woman, nam'd Ann Hill: They said one to another, I wish you would give us a dram; said Ann Hill and the prisoner, This gentleman will give us a dram, no doubt, meaning me: I said, I'll give you a dram of gin: No, said they, we drink no gin; we drink rum: Said I, you appear like gentlewomen, take a quartern of rum; I'll pay for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>


               <p>Porter. I have been a <rs id="t17640222-43-viclabel232" type="occupation">sea-faring man in his majesty's and merchant's service</rs>

After this, in about half an hour, in came a sort of a gentleman, and swore to the prisoner; and said, You stole a handkerchief of mine, such a night; and fell to laying on her with a rattan: I said, gentlemen, I am not used to such sort of work as this; if she has done any thing amiss, let her be tried by common law; upon that, two men fell upon me unaccountably. The landlady's son-in-law said, Nobody shall use this man ill, (meaning me). Come, Mr. Porter, said he, go home, for here are a parcel of bad people in the house; out at the door I went: I had not gone two doors before the prisoner and Ann Hill ran after me: Said they, now you have seen us righted, we will go to the King's-arms, in the Fleet-market, and there we will bring some people that shall see you righted: They went and brought those two men up that had a hand in robbing me. We had a pot of half-and-half, at the King's-arms, to put themselves in spirits, as they pretended. They came up to the Bell again; there they sell to writing, and taking these men's names down that had used me ill there. After this, said I, gentlemen, I must wish you all a good night; my wife will think I am lost, because I never am out late. Said the prisoner, we have had a good deal of trouble in seeing you righted, we hope you will see us home, to Whitecross-street: No, said I, I am just at home, gentlewomen, I do not think it proper: Said they, we do not like to go home alone: They persuaded me to go with them: I do not know where Whitecross-street is, no more than the dead: They brought me down to Fleet-market again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in liquor?</p>
               <p>Porter. I was very little in liquor. It grew late. I said there, I do not care for staying any longer, nor will I stay. I went out; out came the two women and the two men: Come, said they, this is the last house till we go home; let us have a pot here, (the White-hart in the Fleet-market): Said I, In case you will not drink more, I'll give you a pot. We went all of us there: Said the landlord, I will not draw any of you any beer, except this gentleman, (meaning me). I am a poor man, said I: He brought it, and I paid for it. While we were drinking it, there was a great quarrel in the house: Said the prisoner and Ann Hill, Mr. Porter, don't you stir; these men are fighting one among another; we know them.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to know your name?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176402220029"/>Porter. Mr. Balf, the landlady's son-in-law, at the Bell, called me by my name: I am acquainted with him. After this, the two women and I, came out to go to Whitecross-street, to see them home; the two men went away just before us; coming up Turnagain-lane. I said, I will go home, for I live upon Snow-hill; they catched hold of me, and the prisoner said. No, d - n it, you shall not go; I said, this is my way home, and I will go. Standing a little while, there came four or five watchmen, and took them and me to St. Sepulchre's watch-house: Coming along, one of the watchmen said, What, Mr. Porter! What makes you be here? I never saw you out late; I'll give any security for you; I thanked him, and said, then I'll go home; but, said he, before you go home, tell me what these women are; God knows, said I, they appear like gentlewomen: He said to them, Gentlewomen, Where have you been to night? Said they, we have been to a gentlewoman in Fleet-market, that has detained us longer than ordinary, and we are going home to Whitecross-street; and this gentleman will see us home. They took me through St. Sepulchre's Church-yard, and down Snow-hill, and into Field-lane, then to Chick-lane: Said I, In the name of God, where are you going now? I do not understand this part of the town: Come along, said they, we will show you the nearest way to Whitecross-street: They turned into <placeName id="t17640222-43-crimeloc233">Black-boy alley</placeName>

The prisoner says, Doleman was the man that whistled, but I believe it was herself: I found I was beset directly: I turned round, and saw three men, but I can't tell but two that meddled with me, and the two women. I said, for God's sake, Gentlefolks, don't use me ill, upon the account of my family; take my money, I'll freely forgive you: One struck me on the head, and said, God blast you; we will have your money, life, and cloaths, before we leave you. After this, with their striking me over the head, and the women punching me on the stomach, to make me loose my hold, for I had hold of them to keep myself up, the men beat me with sticks, and cut me terribly: At last, one of the men catched me by my legs, and hawled me down; and hawled me from that door to another, and from thence to the corner; the women were down, and held me down, and one of the men took a handful of money out of my pocket, and the other man came with a knife, and our my pocket out. I cry'd out murder, when I found what they were upon, and for help and mercy: the prisoner clapped her hand upon my mouth, and pinched my throat, and said, Blust him, murder him, as he cries cut murder; for we shall be all apprehended. She pinched me very hard, after they got my money; Doleman stamped upon my neck, and shook the money over me in the pocket, and said, You old blackguard, here is your money and your totes, and made the blood fly out of my mouth. I was in a terrible condition, both head and mouth: the prisoner and Anne Hill never quitted me, while the men were robbing me. Somebody opened a door, and some of them fled, and I arose up: the fruiterer's servant, that the prisoner has given an account of, was going to stoop for my hat, I went and pushed him down, his name is

            , and I also pushed the prisoner down. I hauled Wright up to Chick-lane, and called for the watchman to assist me: the watchman said. Sir, you had better let him go, for I cannot assist; if I do, we shall be murdered, here is such a number of thieves here: let him go, and go you to St. Andrew's watch-house, and get assistance. I went there, and they told me that Black-boy-alley was in St. Sepulchre's parish; they advised me to go to St. Sepulchre's watch house, and alarm them. I went there, and when they saw me in so bloody a condition, they said, Mr. Porter, we are very sorry this thing has happened, and wished we had known what sort of women they were, then this thing should not have happened. They advised me to go to bed, saying, they thought the thieves were got far enough off by then.</p>

I got up, and went to him; he was lying on his left side, and said, he had been used very barbarously, and robbed of his money, in an alley that two women had carried him down, saying, they were going to White-cross-street; that it was done by

I enquired into the woman's character, and was told, she keeps a very good sort of a house. On the 10th of January, when the prisoner was taken, I was in bed; the prosecutor's wife came up to me, and said, a messenger was sent to her, and begged I would get up (this was about 12 at night) and go to St. Bride's watch-house; I went, and there saw the prisoner and prosecutor.

               <p>I went in at the Bell, about half an hour after six on that Sunday night, and the other woman; this gentleman sat there; he sent a person after me; he made room for me to sit down, and asked me if I would drink, and insisted on my drinking. After that, he asked me what he should give me to lie with me? I said, I never did any such thing; I never made any such bargains in a public-house; he said, a trifle should not part us. In came a man, and gave me a switch with a little thing in his hand; this gentleman arose up, and said, he did not do well in using me so; then a man arose up, and hit the prosecutor a blow: the young man and I went out, and were going down by the side of the Fleet-market; he said to me, we will go into a house, and have a pint of beer; there was Mr. Porter sat in a box, with ten or twelve in company, one of the men came and asked me if I knew who used Mr. Porter ill? I said, I would go and shew him the person. When we came up to the Bell, the man was gone: we had half a pint of rum; then the man came in, and seeing several people there, he went out again directly: then we all came out, and went to the Blue-Anchor, by the side of the market; there we had some liquor: then they began to wrangle, and went out at the door, and fought, and a young man came in all over blood. I said to Mr. Porter, I would not have you go out, I know none of the men, fearing you should come to any harm, and we will stay here; as the gentlemen had been so good as to take his part, he would not leave them; every one of them left the house. Mr. Porter and I, and the other woman sat together in a box; he would not go away. Then the man of the house said it was very late; then we went out, and there were some watchmen took us all up, and had us to the watch house: they asked me where I lived? I said, in White-cross-street; so said the other woman. Mr. Porter said, he would go with us, and lie with us both: we had hold of his arm; he told the watchmen he was going along with these women, and desired them to let him in when he came back; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176402220032"/> went with us to Black-boy-alley to lie with us. Just as I was going to knock at the door, a young man came up and struck him, and I heard him cry out, Mu rder. I ran away as fast as I could, and wondered the young woman did not come home all night: I went to a house, and found the young woman and that young man that was in company, eating beef-stakes for breakfast; I asked them, how they came to serve me so ill? they said, they did not; but said, why should I go to knock at the door: I saw them sharing some money; he had 12 s. and I saw him give the others money. I know nothing at all of the robbery. I only know the people.</p>

             to put this order in execution, at the Royal Exchange: when we came into the entrance of <placeName id="t17640222-44-crimeloc239">Cornhill</placeName>

                        targets="t17640222-44-off236 t17640222-44-crimeloc239"/>, we found a great number of people assembled together; this was, as the order mentions, about one o'clock; there was a great noise, by hissing, and the like, which in a great degree prevented my getting up to the place where the fire was made for burning the paper before the Royal Exchange. Not being able to get up to the place, I got out of my chariot, and went to the place where the fire was made; during that time, there was a great deal of noise, and pelting a'vast deal of dirt: but notwithstanding that, I read this order of the house, and then gave the paper, Number 45. of the North-Briton, with my own hand, into the hand of the executioner, which he then attempted to light; but the wood being wetted by the dirt, that had been thrown, it did not catch fire so proper as it should; so there was a difficulty in lighting the paper to make it burn, which caused him to put it upon a link: I saw him put it upon the link, and when I thought it was sufficiently consumed, I returned to my chariot. When I was in, I ordered my servant to turn about and go home; but the people pressed to close upon the horses, they would not suffer them to turn. By the time I got into my chariot, the people had broke in upon the constables, who guarded the fire; they took up the billets that were to compose the fire, and threw them at the horses and coachman, and one of the billets came directly on the fore glass, and broke it to pieces.</p>

               <p>Q. How near might your chariot be then to the fire?</p>
               <p>Mr. Harley. About twenty yards. Perceiving this, I thought it the best way to get out of the chariot; there was a great deal of glass stuck in my face: I walked to the Mansion-house, and after I had been there a little time, the constables brought in the prisoner at the bar; he was there examined, and committed. I can say nothing as to him.</p>

            . On Saturday the 3d of December last, I was going along the Poultry, and saw the Sheriffs going towards the 'Change; I followed the chariots to see what was going to be done: when I came pretty near the 'Change, Mr. Sheriff Harley's chariot stopt; Mr. Cook, the city-marshal, went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176402220033"/> and spoke to him; the mob began prodigiously to throw mud, particularly the prisoner at the bar, and another young man that stood close by him, much about his size; I saw him as plain as I see him now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Bates. I never saw him before, to my knowledge; the mob gave way at the right hand side, and he was plain fronting me, about 5 or 6 yards distance.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by the mob giving way?</p>
               <p>Bates. That was by the sheriff's chariot drawing up; the sheriff seeing he could not get so near the fire as he would. he got out of the chariot; the constables that were upon duty, were fighting with their staffs: I saw the sheriff go towards the fire, and another gentleman with him; he had been there about six minutes, or hardly so long: he came back with some mud on his head, he got immediately into his chariot; the horses were going to turn round: when the chariot was upon the lock, the front of it was pretty near fronting the prisoner at the bar; the prisoner was directly fronting me; the faggots were thrown about, and I saw the prisoner take one of the faggot-sticks, and throw it immediately at the chariot, with a hissing, and crying out, D - n him, kill him, or kill them: then he and the other young fellow began hallowing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what became of the stick?</p>
               <p>Bates. No, I did not. I saw the sheriff come out of the chariot, with his face bloody; I heard the glass fly; Mr. Cook was by him; the glass was broke by that same billet, and there were several more sticks thrown at the time, I am positive the prisoner threw the first stick that I saw thrown; there was a deal of dirt thrown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the stick go to the glass?</p>
               <p>Bates. No, but the glass clattered directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you say this stick broke the glass, when you say there were other sticks thrown at the same time?</p>
               <p>Bates. Several other sticks were thrown at the coachman and horses; several hit the coachman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner taken?</p>
               <p>Bates. No, I did not. The prisoner owned before my Lord Mayor, and Mr. Sheriff Blunt, that he threw mud.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Bates. I am a ticket-porter, and live in Snow's-fields. I am a house-keeper.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you attended by meer accident, or whether you went designedly?</p>
               <p>Bates. I was there accidentally; I had no notice of the thing, any more than of my dying day. I did not know what was to be done at the 'Change.</p>

            . I am constable for the ward of Queenhithe. That day I attended on the sheriffs, by the beadle's order, at the burning the North-Briton; the sheriff's chariot was just come; there was a croud of people; I got near the chariot-door, before Mr. Alderman Harley got out of the chariot: the faggots were rather billets, and were wet, they would not light; the crowd forced the constables out of their order; the prisoner and two more were coming forwardest; they took up mud several times before the billets were lighted, and threw it. I advised them to be cool: just as sheriff Harley came out of his chariot, the mob hissed prodigiously. I saw the prisoner take up dirt, and when they began to throw the faggots, I received a blow on my forehead, which knocked me down, and gave me a cut there, which appeared some days after.</p>

            . I was there a constable. I was ordered by the beadle of Farringdon without, to attend, and was there half an hour before the faggots were brought; as soon as they were brought, I observed mud and dirt thrown pretty thick; in a short time after, I saw the sheriff's chariot coming up; upon which, the pelting increased, and his horses could not get up: there was such a hissing, and shouting, and pelting, the horses started. I saw the chariot door open, and I went and attended the sheriff to the place, with others that stood by, while he read the paper; I could hear him speak the words, and saw him give the paper into the hangman's hands; and when it was burnt, I helped him into the chariot, under his left arm; after that, I saw the chariot-glass broke, and saw him get out again, his face was bloody; the first stick that I observed, hit the footman behind, the next stick broke the glass; upon which, the sheriff got out, and turned up by the piazzas; then Mr. Owen said, that is the man that broke the glass, pointing to the prisoner; I took him, and carried him to the Mansion-house, and heard him own to Mr. Alderman Blunt he threw mud. When they called to know, if any body knew any thing of the prisoner? there was Mr. Bates (whom I had never seen before); he said the same there, as he has here; I know of no variation at all.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer, and live in Gravel-lane, Hounsditch. I was a constable, ordered there by the beadle, to attend the burning the North-Briton; there was such a mob, I could not stand where the faggots were to be lighted; I got away, and stood till Mr. Harley came in his chariot; the mob was so great, he was forced to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176402220034"/> get out, and walk to the fire. I was one that attended him till he got up to the fire; then the mob was outrageous; they shoved the constable on my left hand into the fire, and threw the fire down; I took him up out of the fire, and went away again, and was got about forty or fifty yards distant, and there stood and saw Mr. Sheriff Harley come down the street, with his face all bloody; and when the chariot was turned, I saw the glass was broke; and when it was about the breast of me, I saw the prisoner with a stick in his hand; he threw it directly at the chariot, and hit the back of it; Mr. Harley was then gone down towards the Mansion-house: I turned on the right hand, and said to the last witness, I saw that man throw a stick at the chariot, and pointed to the prisoner; said he, follow me, and we will take him: the prisoner still followed the chariot; we let him go by us, and kept behind him; we told two or three more constables what he had done, and they followed us; he seeing himself beset, went to go up Lombard-street; I catched him by the elbow, and said, friend, you must go along with us: then the constables got round him, and carried him into the Mansion-house.</p>

               <p>I was coming through the mob, and was taken as one of the rioters; but as to what Bates and the rest have said, it is entirely false; I am ready to ask the court pardon. I had not been in town above a fortnight; I came from Norfolk; I was apprentice to a grocer and haberdasher, and came here to seek employment. I came a passenger from Yarmouth; Mr. Wescote can prove it.</p>

            . I live in Cannon-street. The first knowledge I had of the prisoner, was about 19 years ago, when he was an infant; I never saw him here before the day fortnight before the burning of the North-Briton: he first addressed himself to me when he came to town, as he told me; his parents live at Stetford in Norfolk; his mother is a relation of mine, and at that time was in very good reputation.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Wescote. I am a merchant. He addressed himself to me, for employment of any kind I had for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain he was fresh come to town?</p>
               <p>Wescote. I firmly believe he was. I procured him employment to be steward to a West-India-man; he left the captain and me about half an hour before the burning of the North-Briton, with intent to embark on the Monday morning; it was not more than an hour, before he was going to buy some necessaries, in order to embark; the ship went down the river the Monday morning following: I have had an opportunity of hearing of him since. I never did hear any thing much amiss of him. I verily believe he had no kind of intention at that time he left me; if he had any, it must be an extreme confused one; I always looked upon it as a matter of mere inconsiderateness: he told me, the mob would have broke his head, if he had not joined them.</p>

On Wednesday, the 8th instant, about 7 o'clock, I was sitting in the shop; the prisoner came in, and reached at the goods, which then lay in the window, which is sashed; he could reach them by putting one foot on the threshold: On seeing him, I said, Hey! What are you at? He took no notice, but still kept reaching: I then called, Stop Thief. He took the goods mentioned in the indictment, and carried them clean off.

Then I went and took hold of Davidson. Grief secured the prisoner. We took them before my Lord Mayor. About a quarter of an hour afterwards Mr. King came in, upon hearing there was a person taken with stockings. The seven pair were laid before him; he took out one pair from the rest, and said he could swear to them; they had been old shopkeepers. (The stockings produced in court. King takes up one pair.)</p>

These I can swear to as my master's property; they have been soiled in lying in the shop: I put these in the bundle among others; I believe they are all my master's property, but cannot so particularly swear to their marks.

There I went afterwards and saw Davidson; he wanted to impeach, or, he said the prisoner would impeach him; so I took him again before my Lord Mayor, and he owned to the taking the stockings.</p>

He said, when we were got home, he lost seven pair of them, by running cross the way, or in getting up behind a coach: But, after a little while, he sent out two pair by a woman that he kept company with: She sold them for two shillings. After that, he said, I will not slang you out of them; I had ten pair. The next morning he sent her out with another pair, and she sold them for thirteen pence.

On the 14th of January, between 7 and 8 in the evening, the prisoner came to our shop, and wanted to look at a Sattin bonnet: I shewed her one: After that she looked at some cloaks: She bid two guineas for a sattin cloak; I said I could not take under three; she said she would consider on it, and come again on Monday morning, as we had agreed for the bonnet. I had a very fine pair of laced ruffles, that I had made up for the queen's birth-day, which hung upon a line in the window; I went to open a glass-case, and, on turning my head about, I miss'd the ruffles; I immediately took hold of her cloak, and said, you have robbed me of a pair of Dresden ruffles: She had her hands under a long black cloak; she turned herself aside, and said, I have not your ruffles; don't go to say that I have your ruffles. She was then on the threshold of the door; then she had, as I thought, an opportunity to drop them: I kept hold of her arm and cloak and pulled her, and said she should go into the back parlour: She did not seem unwilling<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176402220036"/> to go. When I had got her into the middle of the shop, I left her, and went to the door; there I took up the ruffles, all done up together like a pocket handkerchief; they did not appear at all like ruffles; I shook them out, then I saw they were the ruffles I miss'd; but I miss'd the bosom: I told her I miss'd the bosom; she shook her apron, and I found the bosom of the ruffles lying at her feet: I took her in to the parlour; she behaved very impudent and very rude. We found in her pocket a gause cap, doubled up as the ruffles: that was not mine. I took her before Sir

The next morning, according to usual custom, the person that went on my errands, sent a little boy to inform me my shop door was open.

Steers said, he was a weaver, and lived in White-lion yard, Spital-fields: This he said to the prisoners faces; and that he paid the money at two payments, 15 l. at each time. The prisoners both denied it before Sir John, and said they knew nothing of Steers. Steers produced three hats there, to see if I knew them: (produced in court, one gold-lace the other two plain) These are the same. I told Sir

            . I am a weaver, and live in White-lion yard, Norton-falgate Some time in November, I believe the 17th, 1762, Hitchins came to me, about 8 in the morning: I was in bed: He told me he had a quantity of hats to sell. I went with him to his house, which formerly had been a house of mine. He shewed me the hats in a chest in a back room: There were fourscore or more of them. He asked me 40 l. for them; we agreed for 30 l. I told him I would meet him the same evening, at the King's head, in Leaden-hall-street, where he said Watson, Lee, and Askur, would be. I went there; they were all together.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176402220037"/> I paid him 15 l. I gave it into Watson's hands. They said I was very honourable in paying it so soon: That money, to the best of my knowledge, was shared between them. In two or three days after I paid the other 15 l. they were all together then. These three hats here produced, are part of the hats I bought of Hitchins at that time.</p>

I got by Parsons. They gave a run by me at Garraway's, and continued before me to Lombard-street. They made a stop at the bottom of 'Change-alley, in Lombard-street, and I past them. I was going to my house in Gracechurch-street. When I got a little way from 'Change-alley, Parsons and the other man were behind me; then Parsons gave a run by me again, and came into the road before me, and went a little farther, and stopt at a post, and set out his backside; I brushed briskly by him, and took notice of him, and thought it very strange a man should stand in that posture. I looked back to see what posture I left him in, and walked forwards, about twenty or thirty yards; then he brushed by me again as before. I gave a look at him; he passed by me again, and about twenty yards he set himself over a post as before; I then gave two shoves before I could get by him; the other man was close behind me at the time. I was a good deal provoked in my mind to think he should stand so twice. He looked down the street, as if he wanted somebody. I passed on, and thought he should not have an opportunity to get by me again. When I got pretty near the end of Lombard-street, there were three or four coaches standing one behind another: Just before I came to the first coach, Parsons brushed by me a third time, in the same manner: The coach stood close to the post, and he placed himself over a post close to the coach: I gave three shoves, and had a great deal of difficulty to get by him. I felt somebody behind me; then, before I had past ten yards, I miss'd my book with the bills in it. I was in a prodigious agitation of mind. I recollected it must be them that had got it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you felt it last in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Wright. I had felt it in 'Change-alley. Then I went to the Bank, and told the case; and if they suspected any body, to send for me. On the 14th of December, they suspected a man there,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176402220038"/> and sent for me; I took him to the mansion-house, before Mr. Alderman Cokayne: He could give no great account of himself. While we were there, Parsons came to see what was the matter; he opened the door, and put his head in; I suppose he saw me: He shut the door, finding he was likely to be discovered: He ran down the stairs as fast as he could: then I and another pursued him: He ran under the Piazzas: As soon as they brought him out, I knew him: I then told Mr. Cokayne, the prisoner was the man that behaved so and so before me. He was committed; after that he got bail, but did not appear last sessions: He was after that taken up by justice Fielding's men. The justice sent for me there: Parsons told me what he had denied before. He said he was in company with

               <p>Wright. Yes, a neighbour of mine brought the book to me, and all the bills in it: He said his servant was at work in the cellar, and the book came tumbling down the window. The bills are all now paid. (The book produced.) Parsons is now here to give evidence against the prisoner.</p>

            , Watson, Philips, Abrahams, and myself. We went from one Lumley's in Golden-lane, up Fleet street, towards Temple-bar. Usher, I, and Abrahams, had a shilling's-worth of punch at a public-house, between two and three o'clock: I don't know the sign; it is by Chancery-lane end. From thence we went directly to Covent-garden playhouse: This was between three and four o'clock. There we saw Mr. Marsden, and some of Mr. Fielding's people, coming cross Covent-garden. I saw Carpenter; he asked me if I had seen any thing of Munday or Taylor; I said, no: Said he, What do you do here? I wonder you are not among the people: Says I, I have a couple of watches in my pocket. I left him there. Then we went to Kit Andrews's, in Charles-street: We had not been there long, before in came Munday, Taylor, Hays, Carpenter, one Irish Jemmy, and

            . We had not been there long, before one came in, and said, there was Mr. Fuller in the tap-room; with that, we all ten of us came away directly: We were afraid of him; he belongs to Mr. Fielding's people. We went all together down the Strand, towards St. Clement's church. One of them said, let's turn back to Cranebourn-alley, then we shall see the king and queen go to Leicester-fields; and, if we go there, we shall be pretty sure there will be none of Sir John's people there, and we shall be pretty safe. We all went back, and into Cranebourn-alley.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176402220039"/> Just as a gentleman was coming, almost at the end towards Leicester-fields, Munday said, Here it is. We all got round the gentleman: He fell down, and Munday picked his pocket of a gold watch. I don't know who that gentleman was, I did not see his face. I was close to Munday's hand; he delivered the watch to me, and I walked away directly, and looked at it, and found it had a shagreen case to it. I gave it to Watson, and we all ten of us went down to a house in Tavistock-street: I don't know the sign. We staid there, and had seven or eight pots of beer; then we agreed to go to the Black Prince, in Shandois-street; there we went up-stairs, and had some a-la-mode beef. Watson pulled out the watch; and, as he was looking at it, somebody came up with the a-la-mode beef; upon which, he put it in his pocket again. We agreed to stay there till the play was over, and then go back again to Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the seal?</p>
               <p>Parsons. I did not observe that: It was a gold watch, with a box and case in one; with an enamelled dial-plate, and yellow hands.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My watch, that I lost, was as he describes.</p>
               <p>Parsons. We spent a quarter of a guinea, and, I think, six-pence besides: I saw it paid. I believe we had about ten or twelve plates of a-la-mode beef there; we eat them as fast as they were brought up. I don't know which paid: It was proposed, that when the watch was agreed about, it then should be settled. I know we had two quarterns of gin. We came away, just before ten, to Covent-garden, and there we again saw Mr. Marsden; so came away, leaving only Edward Roach, and Irish Jemmey, by the end of Charles-street. The other eight of us went to the house of a woman, whose name is English, near Drury-lane playhouse, where we had not been long, before Mr. Fielding's people came in, and took us all but Watson. Hays got away as we were going to Justice Fielding's. I saw

I asked Usher to drink a glass of punch; he said, he would, and went in with me, and Abrahams and Parsons followed us.

On Thursday, the 19th of January last, the day his Majesty, and the Prince and Princess of Brunswick, went to the play, I was at the apprehending seven men, at a house in Russel-street, two doors below the blue posts; the five prisoners, the evidence, and another that got away, named Hays. They were all in company, and I think they had a bottle of wine before them on the table. We carried them to the Blakeney's head, and put them in a room all together.

            . I was in Russel-street when some people were apprehended there on a Thursday night. I was desired to go and put up the window shutters at the house where they were taken out. The woman of the house, whose name is English, went out and left me to take care of her house, and not stir till she came in. She did not return that night. I fell asleep upon a chair. About 7 or 8 in the morning I took down the shutters, and saw a handkerchief under a chair, with a watch appearing out of it. I went to the Angel, in Charles-street, and enquired for her. She came home, and took up the handkerchief. There were two silver watches, and two covered, like leather; (they were yellow ones); and another in a woman's glove. I do not know what became of them.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of Parsons. I was at the play at 5 o'clock, and staid there till it was over; coming out, a young woman asked me to give her a glass of wine; I said, I did not care if I did: She took me up-stairs, and treated me with a pint of wine: When we came down, I treated her with another in the parlour; and had not been there above three or four minutes, before these people came and knocked at the door, and came in and took us away. I never saw Parsons in my life before that night.</p>

            , and bought goods of her; (she keeps a broker's shop) which came to about 10 l. and paid her the money, and was to give her half a guinea a week for my fire, candle, victuals, and the use of the room. On the 24th of last January, between four and five in the afternoon, came the two prisoners, and a constable and attorney with them. (Dove was a company-keeper with Mrs. Glass, as far as I understand; sometimes he lived in the house, and sometimes not): Taylor said, all that were in the house, was his property, for he had a bill of sale made to him by Dove. I said, then he had better pay me for my goods: when I first came to the house, I lent Mrs. Glass 20 l. and she gave me some papers, which she had of Capt. Leicester's, at Hull; they were in my chest, in my room, amongst my cloaths; I had also in the chest, a note for 4 l. 8 s. another for 4 l. 4 s. and another for 2 l. 2 s. I had also in the chest two dollars, a pistereen, and seven buttons, all Spanish money; two pair of silver sleeve buttons, and a razor; I saved nothing but what was on my back: I found since, four cheque shirts (which were in the chest when they took possession of all) at a pawnbrokers; they took away also my bed and bedstead, curtains, looking glass, fire-shovel, tongs, stove, and other things: I got a warrant, and took up Taylor, and had a search warrant granted to seach his house; there I found my coat, bed, and chest, but nothing in it; there were three disorderly girls in his house, who were sent to Bridewell; he keeps a very bad house: I found nothing upon Dove. I had been arrested at the suit of Dove, on the 22d of January, for 4 l. 4 s. and I never owed him a half-penny in my life; I never had any thing of him. I regularly paid my half guinea every Saturday, to Mrs. Glass; the other lodgers in the house always paid her. Dove is a labouring-man, at the White-lead-works, Whitechapel: Taylor lives in Buckle-street; he is an officer.</p>
               <p>Dove. Logan said, all the goods, and my wife and all, were his; he has taken my wife from me.</p>

I paid 2 s. a week for my lodgings; I never paid Dove, I always paid Mrs. Glass.</p>

I lived at Mr. Taylor's house, and was taken out of it as a disorderly woman; I saw several chests brought to his house, on a Thursday, about the 23d or 24th of January; Dove said, one of the chests was Mr. Logan's chest; Mrs. Taylor sent me with four shirts to pawn that are produced here, which I did, to Mr. Beckworth: I saw a green purse, with several pieces of Spanish money, at Taylor's; there was half a dollar, five bits, a pistereen, half a pistereen, and a pair of silver sleeve buttons: I was a sailor's wife, and have been used to know this sort of money.</p>

I took a peace officer, and the man that filled the bill of sale, up with me; and Mr. Dove put his hand upon a clock, and said, This I give you, and all above as well as below.</p>

               <p>I was married 20 years ago to that woman, (meaning Mrs. Glass) at Edinburgh: I have been in Flanders, in his Majesty's service; and when I came home, we lived together in love, till Logan came to live there: he had her always with him, and neglecting her business. I saw him and her in bed together, and began to be jealous of her: she said I should never lie with her any more, for I had got nothing. I got a warrant for them both; the justice ordered us to go and make it up; after that, I was advised to go and sell all the goods, but I never had a penny of Taylor for them; he and the attorney took upon them to clear me.</p>

            . On the 14th of last month, between twelve and one in the night, the porter brought a basket, and called out watchman; hollo, said I: he said, here is a basket that belongs to Mr. Mott; he is a salesman, and sells goods for the prosecutor; after that, he brought a sack, and pitched it by the basket: he told me they were Smith's.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The basket contained half a score of turkeys; and the sack, the fowls and ducks mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Ward. In about ten minutes after the sack was pitched, up came the prisoner at the bar; take care of these goods, said he, for they are mine, for Mott. He used to drive a higler's cart from the country, about three years ago: I said, yours,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176402220045"/> how can that be? they are Smith's. Said he, my name is Smith, he and I are cousins. Said he, I am d - ble cold, wet and dirty (the water squashed in his shoes); said he, take care of my things, and I'll go to the Hare, in Lime-street. He was gone about six or eight minutes, and came again, and said, I am afraid of the sack. I said, you need not; it is as safe as your basket, and all the other things about here. Said he, I wish I could go to sleep a little bit: I said, he might lie down under a stall, which was near; he said, he would not lie there. Then I directed him to go up to the Bee-hive, a night-house. Said he, I am afraid of the sack. Said I, it is as safe, as if you had it in your pocket. Said he, I think, I'll take the sack along with me, and go to the Beehive, and put it in the bar, and have some purl; the sack is not my own, and I am more afraid of the sack than the fowls: he gave me a penny to get me some purl; he carried them away, and I never saw them any more.</p>

We carried handkerchiefs to him, sometimes three times a week, and sometimes twice a week: he lives in Tyburn-road, but I do not know the name of the street; he never asked us where we came from, or how we came by them. He would lend us a couple of shillings upon a good silk handkerchief, about a yard wide; and a linen one, with no holes in it, he would lend us a shilling upon it; or a white one, with a red border, he would lend us 14 d. if they had holes in them, perhaps not above 3 d. or a groat.

We intended to send Redmond in for two-pennyworths of bread and cheese, and he was to take the till. The people were in the shop, and took care of the door. After that, we walked up Wapping, and peeped into several houses. We met with the prosecutor at the bottom of Nightingale-lane; he asked the way to Chelsea. Rockett stept before him, and said, he has got a watch. He said, I'll show you the way. He was going quite the contrary way, being much in liquor. Rockett ordered Redmond and I to keep off a little while, and go another way and meet them. Bevas and Steward followed behind. We went through Swan-alley, and met them all at the end of Nightingale-lane. The prosecutor said to them, I have no change, or else I would give you something to drink. I went down Swan-alley steps and hid myself, that he might not mistrust, seeing so many of us. They all walked up towards East-smithfield; then I came out, and followed behind. They went down Helvet stairs. As soon as they got him under the gateway, Bevas knocked him down with a poker, which he had from Mrs. Kennedy's house; the second blow knocked him down; then he took his watch. Rockett stood over him. All five of us were close by. I had the watch in my hand as I was going along the New Road. A woman said, next day, the gentleman lost three guineas, but I heard of no money. Bevas dropt the poker while he was riffling him.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. On the 19th of January, I was behind the counter in the shop, in the parish of St. George's, Bloomsbury: between 5 and 6 in the evening, the prisoner at the bar came and broke the window; I heard it, and saw his hand in at the hole; he reached, and took out a piece of cotton. I immediately ran to the door, and called out, Stop thief. I saw nobody pursued that was likely to take him. I ran, and overtook him in about sixty yards. I threw him down: He had the cotton in his arms; as he fell, that was under him. I brought him and that back, and sent for my master. The cotton is my master's property. He said he was drunk, but he ran very fast; he did not appear to be drunk.</p>

            . My Husband's name is Thomas. The prisoner came and said she wanted a neighbour of mine that was not at home. I let her stay in my room: This was on the 24th of January. My neighbour not coming home, I let her stay all night in my room. I asked her where she came from, she said from Dulwich; I asked her if she knew any other person besides the woman she wanted to speak with; she said, no; she had no other acquaintance but the trunk-maker, the corner of St. Paul's. She said, the woman she wanted, owed the trunk-maker three guineas. She not resting in the night, said, she would get up and go to her cousin, and let him know of her; for, if the woman was to know that she was there, she would go away. She got up, and would not let me strike a light. She was a long time in dressing herself. I got up and let her out; and when I came to get up, I miss'd all the things mentioned in the indictment. (Naming them.) She said she would be back by the time I was up. I never saw her from that time, till I happened to meet her in Fenchurch-street, the Monday following. I said, How do you do, Madam? Said she, How do you do? You have got the advantage of me: I don't know you. Said I, you have got the advantage of me, I think. She then had my cardinal on, and my linen handkerchief round her neck, and her cardinal in my silk handkerchief, tied up. Said I, are not you ashamed to use me so for my good nature? She owned that she was guilty directly, and that she would go and shew me where my gown was. She said it was in the Borough. I went with her to where she said: It was not there. Then she took me to Tooley-street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176402220049"/> and said the things were there. Then she brought me three times round Dock-head, and knocked at people's doors; and at last she said, she did not know where they were. She said, if I would not meddle with her, she would walk all the way with me. I carried her to justice Fielding's without a warrant. There she told Sir

             . My husband's name is James. Katharine Adams came to me on the 8th of this instant, about 10 at night, (this was in the street) and said, Mr. Jones had given his watch to her to pawn for half-a-guinea till the morning. I said, I had not so much money about me; that if I saw the owner, I would get him half-a-guinea on it. She said, do you dispute that I did not come honestly by it? You may see the owner tomorrow. I said, Where is the watch? She put her hand into her bosom, and took it out. The prisoner came up, and gave me a blow under my right breast, (I did not fall) and snatched the watch out of my right hand; and, with an oath, said, if I made any words, he would stab me. We cry'd, Stop thief; he turned back, and said, he would run me through.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he strike you before, or after he took the watch?</p>
               <p>Green. That was after he had taken it. He made his escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any instrument in his hand?</p>
               <p>Green. He had a knife in his hand when he turned back.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you put in fear when he took the watch from you?</p>
               <p>Green. I was not frighted.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Green It was so light that I could take particular notice of him, and there was a lamp just by. He was pursued directly, and in better than half an hour he was taken; it was under an hour. The watch was found upon him. They sent for me.

             trusted me to pawn his watch. I went to the pawnbrokers, there were none up. I came and brought it him again. He then asked me, if I would lend him half-a-guinea on it? Then Elizabeth Wall, who was in the house, said, Go up to Mrs. Green; if she has not the money, she will get it for you. I was going up to her, and met her as I was going. I asked her to go and pawn this watch for me for half-a-guinea. She asked me where the owner was; I said, at Mrs. Cook's.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mrs. Cook?</p>
               <p>Adams. She deals in Rag-fair. Said Mrs. Green, let me see the man. Said I, you may go and pawn the watch, and come down and see him. Upon that, she and another woman were going a little way together; saying, she was going to a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176402220050"/> woman. Then I thought I would go and do it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the watch then?</p>
               <p>Adams. I had. I was going up Church-lane to a woman where she intended to pawn it. I met the prisoner, and a man that I knew; he ask'd me if I would go and drink a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. And had you never seen the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Adams. No, I never did see him before.</p>
               <p>The Court ordered Esther Green, and all the other evidences out of court, in order to be separately examined.</p>
               <p>Q. What alehouse did you drink at?</p>
               <p>Adams. The King and Queen in Cable-street, almost opposite Church-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay in that house with the prisoner and other man?</p>
               <p>Adams. I did not stay with them above ten minutes; I left them, and was going up Church-lane, and Mrs. Green called to me, and said, Kitty; I did not answer the first time; Kitty, said she again. Now, said she, I will go and do it for you. I gave it her out of my bosom. The prisoner came up, and said, Let me look at that watch? She gave it him out of her hand into his to look at, and he made his escape with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he and you go out of the house together?</p>
               <p>Adams. He followed me out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Green see you and the prisoner, and the other man, go together to the alehouse?</p>
               <p>Adams. I cannot say whether she did or no.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take the watch from her, or did she give it him?</p>
               <p>Adams. I will not swear; but to the best of my knowledge she gave it him out of her hand. She said, Why should I let you look at it? and to the best of my knowledge she gave it him.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be sure she gave it him, or that he took it out of her hand?</p>
               <p>Adams. I cannot say, indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. How near to you was he, when you took it out of your bosom to give it to her?</p>
               <p>Adams. He was just by. - Why should I go to swear against a man?</p>

            . On the 14th of this instant, the prisoner (whom I have known a year and a half) and another man, came to my house and called for a pint of beer; he desired me to go backwards, saying, he wanted to speak with me; then he ask'd me if I would buy any broken silver, he would sell it very cheap, it came from the Havannah; I said, let me look at it; he said, to tell you the truth, it is a tankard, and shewed it me; he said it had been twice advertised; I said, I would have nothing to do with it. When I went to draw him another pint of beer, I turned my head, and saw him take my tea-kettle, (which had not water in it, and holds about two gallons) and give it to the other man, and sent him on the out-side of the door with it. I was afraid of pur suing, having seen they had two pistols under their cloaths. I took the prisoner on the 16th, near Rotherhith church. I never got my kettle again. The prisoner did belong to the Gravesend press-gang.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in his defence said, he went with a man that had got some plate to sell, and what that man did he knew not.</p>
