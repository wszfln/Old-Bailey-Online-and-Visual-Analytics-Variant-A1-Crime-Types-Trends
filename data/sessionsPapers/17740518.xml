               <p>Q. Did you know them?</p>
               <p>Blundell. Yes, I knew them before they came out; of the two prisoners, one caught me round my neck, and the other held my arms; they rifled my pockets; I attempted to cry out, and they stopped my mouth; they took my pocket book, about fifteen shillings in silver, and a tip-staff I had in my pocket (I am an officer in the Marshalsea) a handkerchief and other things I had in my pocket: they swore sadly, and Dyer said she would cut my throat if I made a noise; in my struggling because I kept my hands fast they did cut me a-cross the fingers with a knife I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. A pin perhaps?</p>
               <p>Blundell. No, it must be more than a pin; when they left me I catched hold of one, and said I had been robbed, and she was one of the persons; a man came up and bid me go about my business or it would be worse for me; I left them and went away; after they robbed me I followed them into a house, which I saw them all go into; after they had taken my things first in the street I followed them to be sure to know them, and I went into the house; they were people I knew when I lived five years in the neighbourhood; I thought I would be certain to the persons of them; I took hold of one that was tried last sessions that I was obliged to let go. When they were taken before Justice Sherwood,

             wanted to be admitted an evidence; they were taken two or three days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all taken together?</p>
               <p>Blundell. No; first two were taken; then the other two, one over night the other next morning; Mr. Sherwood took her aside afterwards and said she was a principal concerned and he could not admit her an evidence; she said she would produce all my property if he would; he would not; then she swore a great oath that I never should have my property; Mr. Sherwood advised me to offer some little reward for my pocket book; I offered a guinea; it was brought home next day by a man that keeps one of these girls company; he was afterwards taken into custody and was discharged last sessions.</p>
               <p>Q. This was pretty late at night?</p>
               <p>Blundell. About half after ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure these are the women?</p>
               <p>Blundell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Salt-Petre-Bank acquaintance?</p>
               <p>Blundell. I lived in business five years in East Smithfield, and knew these people backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your business there that night?</p>
               <p>Blundell. I had been at Nightingale lane and other places at that time upon business.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you deal in watches?</p>
               <p>Blundell. No; I had one since I had been out; I had not put it out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. It is extraordinary you should have two watches in your pocket on Salt Petre Bank?</p>
               <p>Blundell. I had not been home to put it out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. If you live in that neighbourhood how came you to think of following them into the house to be robbed again?</p>
               <p>Blundell. I wanted to be sure that they were the people.</p>
               <p>Q. When were these two women taken up?</p>
               <p>Blundell. Two or three days since the last sessions; they were all taken up, but they were all four rescued out of the coach going through Rag Fair.</p>
               <p>Q. In the day time?</p>
               <p>Blundell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I fancy you was not much in earnest?</p>
               <p>Blundell. I was not with them then, there was the keeper belonging to Clerkenwell Bridewell.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177405180004"/>Court. Did you miss your things as soon as the women left you the first time?</p>
               <p>Blundell. Yes, immediately, because I found them take it from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in liquor?</p>
               <p>Blundell. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Not at all?</p>
               <p>Blundell. I had been drinking but was very sensible and knew every transaction that passed.</p>
               <p>Dyer. Farrell came in with him into the house I was sitting in, and asked him if either of the women were there; he made answer and said, no; he took a lad out; the people said he was an apprentice; he said he was not one; they sat down and had a pint of beer; Farrell asked him again if any of the women were there; he said no, and both of us were there at that time.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I told Farrell these were the women; he said never mind them, they are to be had at any time, it is the man we want first; we were afraid of taking the women lest the man would get away; I knew they were the women; the constable said let them alone, we can get them at any time.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear you did not say they were not the women?</p>
               <p>Blundell. I did not.</p>

            . I live in King-street, Tower-hill, the Queen's Head; I remember the two prisoners and the prosecutor being at my house on the 7th of May; the prosecutor had a handkerchief when he came in; they were in the kitchen; there was nobody there but the prisoners, the prosecutor, and another; after the men were gone, the prosecutor said, landlord, the man has gone away with my clothes; I asked what man; he said the man that was gone away; he had been gone some time.</p>


               <p>Q. Which of the men was it that was gone out?</p>
               <p>Andrews. Mecum. The prisoners had been in the house that day before; there was a man standing by him; I asked him if he was concerned in taking the clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you threaten the prosecutor that if be made any disturbance you would send him to gaol?</p>
               <p>Andrews. He said he had lost the clothes at gaming; he said they laid twenty pounds against his clothes, that they named a halfpenny three times out of four; I said if I had known as how they had been gaming, I would have sent for an officer, and sent them to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bruce. Do you hear what this man says, is it true?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you understand he had been gaming with them, or they gaming among themselves?</p>

               <p>I went with this man to Tower-hill; we went into a public house, and there we met with Bruce; Bruce and I tossed up for a pint of beer; then Bruce said he would not toss up for any more beer, he would bet his clothes against some money; I betted twenty guineas against his clothes, and won them; when I had won them I asked him if I should have them, and he gave them to me, and said they were mine, I had won them; the bundle was not opened; he said they were worth twenty guineas.</p>

               <p>I met the prisoner on Tower-hill; I thought he was an old ship-mate of mine; when I found my mistake I asked him to have part of a pint of beer; we went into the Queen's Head; there was Mecum and another in the box tossing up for a pint of beer; Bruce was drawn in to toss for another pint; after this they ageed to toss for the clothes against a sum of money; I have forgot the sum. He owned before two proper witnesses of the Surry militia that he had won the clothes. I know nothing of the gaming, or gambling, or correspondence one way or other: I am a baker, and am in the Surry militia.</p>

            . I am a midwife: I was sent for to the work-house to see if the after-burthen was come from this woman, because they had not found it; I examined her, and she told me the burthen was between the bed and the sacking, wrapped up in a coarse apron; the women had found it before I got there. I saw the child alive at ten at night. The prisoner told me to tell her mistress where the sheets were to be found which she had dirtied in her labour; she said they were in a tub in the corner of the cellar; I went to her mistress, and she sent me to Tingle and Mackerness, who had found the sheets and were then washing of them; the next morning at eight o'clock I went to see the child, and found it dead; I went to the prisoner and told her the child was dead; I did not find any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177405180012"/> thing the matter with her, only she said she had the head ach; the child was at its full growth; had its hair and nails; I asked her how she came to cut it; I told her there was a cut a-cross the belly above the navel; the bowels were out; there was a mark on the shoulder, and confusions in the face, but not such as to kill, only bruise; upon this the prisoner said if it was done, it was with the stick she poked it down the vault with; I asked her how she came to throw ashes in upon the child; she said because she thought the soil was not deep enough to cover it.</p>

            . I am a surgeon: I was sent for on the 2d of February between six and seven o'clock, to look at this child; accordingly I went and found it in the lap of a woman in Mr. Cauldwell's kitchen; a considerable parcel of the small intestines came through a small wound about three quarters of an inch above the navel; I could not return them into the abdomen till I had dilated the wound; when I had cleaned and returned them, and stitched up the wound, the child was then alive. I had a good deal of difficulty in reducing these intestines into the place; some few ashes or cinders were upon them; they were not wounded: the wound appeared as if it had been made with a sharpish instrument, though not a knife; it was rather too irregular to be made by a knife; I saw no other particular marks; I think the wound could not be made by a blunt stick; it might be by meeting some sharp thing in the soil, or in throwing the child down, or by a nail in taking it up. I believe the wound and the intestines being so long exposed to the cold air were the occasion of the child's death; when the child was dead I opened it before the coroner, and could plainly discover which were the intestines that had been exposed to the cold air, because they were discoloured. The child lived seven or eight hours; I opened it to see if the wound had been done with a knife, because I think if it had, it was almost impossible but some of the intestines must have been wounded; upon the whole I have no doubt but the child's life was lost by this wound and the intestines coming so out of its body.</p>

I am one of the watchmen for the Tower Royalty; we were talking together of a gentleman being attacked upon the hill; the prosecutor came up and said he had been robbed; he described the men to be in blue jackets; he said he should know one of them: we took off our watch coats and went into Darkhouse-lane; there we saw the prisoner; he said, I will be d - d if you are not upon some rig, I believe you are some of Sir John's men, I will assist you. The prosecutor charged him with being one of the men that robbed him; the prisoner first said he belonged to a man of war; afterwards he said he came home in an Indianman, but when the constable was called up, he told him he came from the Pilgrim, in Holborn, at about half after two; that could hardly be true, because he was in custody a quarter before three. The waiter at the Pilgrim did appear at the Justice's, and was examined there.</p>

               <p>It is a false charge against me: I was at the Pilgrim in Holborn at the time; I had been at the Rainbow, the corner of Fleet-market, to take some money from there. I went to a pawnbroker's,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177405180014"/> at eleven o'clock, in Holborn, for my coat that was in pawn, and then to the Pilgrim; there I supped; I thought it so late I should be locked out of my lodgings; I went down to Darkhouse-lane, meaning to sleep there, and these men came and challenged me because I happened to have a blue dress; I said they might as well challenge any man in the king's navy. I have witnesses to make my defence good, that I left that house at half past two o'clock.</p>

Cunningham and myself were stopped in a coach near the Half-way-house leading from <placeName id="t17740518-26-crimeloc124">Knights-bridge</placeName>

                        targets="t17740518-26-off121 t17740518-26-crimeloc125"/>, by one man on horseback; he said to the coachman, God d - n your blood stop, or I'll blow your brains out! upon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177405180015"/> which I let the glass down which was then up, and he put a pistol to my breast, and demanded my money; I had one shilling and sixpence and some halfpence loose in my waistcoat pocket; I gave him that; I had half a guinea in my fob, which I preserved; he said to me, God d - n you, do you give me nothing but halfpence! I told him it was all I had, and desired him to take the pistol from my breast. In the interim Capt. Cunningham was moving a pocket book from his right hand waistcoat pocket into his left hand breeches pocket, in which were bank notes to the amount of between four and five hundred pounds; he had twenty-six or twenty-seven, guineas in his breeches pocket, but being in liquor he refused being robbed, and said he would not be robbed; the prisoner saw the pocket book, and took the pistol from my breast, and said, God d - n you, give me the pocket book! he replied he would not give it him; the prisoner said, God d - n you, I will fire upon you immediately! Capt. Cunningham told him to fire and be d - d; he did fire within four inches of my head, and made a kind of confusion on Capt. Cunningham's left arm, but got nothing from him, his horse flew from the coach door, and I saw him feeling as it were for another pistol; I opened the opposite door, jumped out, and assisted Capt. Cunningham out; the coachman said to him, Sir, for God sake don't shoot my horses; he replied no, you are an honest fellow, I shall know you again, and he read the number of his coach, which was 745.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he read it aloud?</p>
               <p>Hart. Yes, he spoke it loud; he asked the coachman whether there were any pockets in his coach; the man replied there were; he got off his horse, and searched the coach; Capt. Cunningham with a small stick beat his horse, and d - d him for a scoundrel; when he was off the horse he had a second pistol in his hand I believe from the shortness of it, and which he held presented as to me, and swore if I came near him he would blow my brains out; I was then at the distance of five or six yards from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish the pistol?</p>
               <p>Hart. Yes: it was a fine moon light night. I must confess I was not very fond of going very near him; he got upon his horse again; Capt. Cunningham was till beating him with this little swish; the prisoner pulled the trigger of the second pistol at his head, within the distance of something less than a yard, and it missed fire; I threw a stone at him on its missing fire, and he rode immediately to town. He was taken a fortnight or three weeks after; I saw him the day he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before he robbed you?</p>
               <p>Hart. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What hour was it?</p>
               <p>Hart. Between nine and ten; the moon was near the full; it was very light.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man?</p>
               <p>Hart. I am certain of it: he was six or seven minutes with us from the first stopping of the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish his person?</p>
               <p>Hart. Yes, quite clear.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish his dress?</p>
               <p>Hart. Yes: as near as I can charge my memory, the coat he has on now, with a waistcoat of the same, a hat flapped, with his hair hanging loose about his ears. I saw the horse afterwards, but could not swear to its identity; it appeared to be a dark one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he hold the horse by the bridle while he was in the coach?</p>
               <p>Hart. Yes; Capt. Cunningham was striking the horse all the time; he struck the prisoner after he was upon the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. I should suppose from your account of Capt. Cunningham's behaviour he must be much in liquor?</p>
               <p>Hart. He was excessively.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to draw the captain off from provoking him?</p>
               <p>Hart. He was nearer than I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure this is the man?</p>
               <p>Hart. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is become of the captain?</p>
               <p>Hart. He embarked on the 15th of April for his regiment in Ireland. The coachman was at Sir

On Friday the 19th of April, between eight and nine o'clock, he went out, and left me at home; I went out about half an hour after, and locked the door; I went to a chandler's shop; I staid there till after nine; while I was there, between eight and nine, he came for the keys; after nine o'clock I went to him for the keys to the public house, went home and found the door open, and the padlock lying with the staple drawn on the outside; I ran back and asked him how he could be so wicked to draw the staple of the padlock and leave the door open; he said he was not in the house, and that the young woman with him saw he was not; he bid me go home and see what I had lost; I went home and missed three gowns out of a chest in the back room on the ground floor. I went to four pawnbrokers that night; the next morning I went again, and at Mr. Fleming's in Drury-lane, I heard of one of my gowns, the white one; he told me there had been a woman there with a gown, and called the boy to describe her; the boy said she had a brown gown on, snaggled teeth, and a scar over her eye; by the description I knew it was the prisoner; I went and took her up directly, and the boy swore to her person; when she was taken she denied the fact, till we were going by Mr. Henshaw's in Crown-court; then she owned she took them, and said she had pawned them there; I found all the gowns there; I told all the marks before I opened them; she said she did it for want of money; she said she was not willing to put my husband to the expence to withdraw her recognizance: she had been in a quarrel with a person, and my husband had been bound in a recognizance for her.</p>

            . On the 16th of March I met the prisoner at large in Wapping; he spoke to me first, I said, What, is it Thompson! he said yes; upon which I having an intimation that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177405180018"/> had been seen at large and people being on the look out for him, I charged him with having returned from transportation, and had him secured.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>Your Lordship will be pleased to understand I was bred to the sea from my infancy; I have no other dependence for my livelihood, but by going to sea; as to what the keeper of the Borough Compter has said I will in no wife deny that in one respect, but on the other hand when your Lordship considers how the case has turned out with me since that time, I hope you will be pleased to see it in a favourable light. On the 22d of July last I went out of London on board the transport ship; I was next morning before sunrise turned out of my consinement and ordered to do my duty on deck as the rest of the ship's company; I did so till I got to Virginia, there I shipped myself on board a vessel which belonged to that part of the world going to Piscataqua in New England; I shipped myself as a man on board that ship. When we got to Piscataqua we took a cargo of fish on board, and went from there to Lisbon in Portugal, and according to our articles of agreement with the captain, we should have returned back to Piscataqua without touching at any other port; but about a fortnight after our arrival in Lisbon, a schooner arrived which belonged to our owners in New England, with letters to countermand the voyage, directing the captain that he should proceed and take in freight for London; when I came to understand that the brig was bound to London I objected against proceeding on the voyage, not thinking it proper to let them know the real reason why I objected to it, because I was a native of the place where the captain and all the people lived, and it would have deprived me of my livelihood if it had been known that I had been transported from this country; I demanded my discharge from time to time of the captain; he said he could not do it seeing it would wholly distress the vessel if he discharged me there, he must get a man in my room, that he was not willing to discharge me. Knowing that the English Consul then residing in Portugal would have insisted upon my discharge, I went on shore and applied to him; he told me I must go on board the vessel, for he could not pretend to discharge me, or else I must go to gaol; I thought it hard to go to gaol in a foreign country, having no friends there; I thought I would go on board the vessel and endeavour to get my things out of her and go on shore; the captain came on shore towards evening; he said if you will do your duty as usual on board the vessel, and stick by her till we are ready to fail, I will discharge you; this encouraged me a great deal, and I willingly staid in the vessel. I had been to work upon the sails and mended them; I overhauled the rigging, and helped to take in the cargo; the vessel was by and by loaded, and I repeated again the demand of my discharge to the captain according to his promise; he told me to get my things on deck: there was a shore boat along side; he said I should go on shore in it if I would help him to get down the fails; I staid on board, not thinking proper to disoblige the captain, for fear he should not be willing to give me my wages; I had twice as much wages as I could get out of any port in Great Britain; I had three pounds sterling per month; I could not get so much by coming here, nor had I any one friend here to induce me to come; I staid on board, helped to unmoor the ship, and get her under sail, and went down along with him till we got below Bellisle Castle; when I got there, I said to Capt. Brown my things are on deck, I beg you will be as good as your word and pay me, and let me go on shore, seeing it is so disagreeble to me to go London; he said you attempted to distress me before, now I have put it out of your power, you must go to London: this was the reason why I came to London. I could have no inducement in life to come to London, seeing I am an entire stranger to it, my wife and family being in America, and seeing I could have twice as much money in America for my labour as in London; I could have no reason to induce me to come to it; I hope your Lordship and the jury will take these my unhappy circumstances into consideration, and as to this gentleman of the Borough Compter, who has sworn against me, I believe for the time I was in his custody last year I dare say he can give me no other than the character of a well behaved man.</p>
               <p>Court. Where is the ship now you came home in?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was taken on Thursday; I lost my chest, my clothes, my wages, and every thing. She sailed the Saturday following; I could get no person to go from Clerkenwell Bridewell, where I was committed, to go on board; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177405180019"/> had no money in my pocket, and could get nobody to go of an errand for me. Seeing I was in such danger of my life and liberty, I thought it most prudent in me to keep still on board the vessel, and have as little acquaintance on shore as needs must; I knew my life and liberty were in danger; I thought no harm in speaking to that man; as for what he has said, I wish for his own sake it was the truth. I had no acquaintance with any people in London; had I known my case would have turned out so dangerous, I would have got acquaintance with people that should have appeared for me; I thought there would be no danger as I kept myself on board the vessel; I committed no error to any man.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hale. How got you the first intelligence of this man?</p>
               <p>Hale. A person came to the office, and informed us there that he was returned from transportation; he had been on shore a good while; I believe I saw him two months before that, but did not know then that he was returned from transportation.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him then?</p>
               <p>Hale. At the sign of the ship in Cable-street I believe, by Salt Petre Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what ship he belonged to?</p>
               <p>Hale. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was carried before Justice Sherwood, did he give any account of what ship he belonged to?</p>
               <p>Hale. He told the Justice he need not swear that gentleman for he was returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Justice ask him no questions?</p>
               <p>Hale. The Justice asked him how he came to return; he said he got ten guineas, and ten gallons for the run home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what ship he came home in?</p>
               <p>Hale. He did not mention any ship as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell the same story he has done now?</p>
               <p>Hale. Not a word of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he complain then of having endeavoured to get on shore at Lisbon, and that the captain brought him here against his will?</p>
               <p>Hale. He did not say a word at all of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was hurried away.</p>
               <p>Hale. No, he was there the whole day; here is a man in Court that told me he had drank with him several times in the two months.</p>
               <p>Court. Call that man.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Did he give you any account of himself?</p>
               <p>Chater. He said thank God I have got over my misfortunes very well, and I have had a good voyage; he said he was going to look for another captain to go another voyage as soon as possibly he could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know at the time he had been ordered to be transported?</p>

On Saturday the 16th of April, about two in the morning, the prisoner broke in at the sash window of my tap room; he broke the shutter and wrenched the bolt.

               <p>Q. Did you know when you saw him that he was the same person you knocked back in the window?</p>
               <p>Guest. Yes; I had my lanthorn in my hand; I know him very well; I took him up once before about a hat he stole. I took him into Mr. Watson's tap room; as soon as I got him there he said to Mr. Watson, here, take your money; he gave him some halfpence; I saw one handful loose; I took him to the watch-house and delivered him up to the constable of the night. In the tap room I found a chissel, a dark lanthorn, and a hat, and another chissel was taken out of the prisoner's pocket at the watch-house; I saw it taken out by the constable, and at the same time a tobacco box with tinder in it, and part of a bunch of matches.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Monk, who keeps the sign of the Post Boy, in Sherborne-lane, at the back of the Post Office. As I was coming out of a house next door but one, about a quarter before nine, on Saturday night the 30th of April, I saw the prisoner wrenching up a bar with a piece of wood that was fixed to the bottom of Mr. Jackson's window, who is comptroller of the Post Office; he had just wrenched the last nail as I past him; I informed my master of it; the prisoner then walked away; my master came out, saw it was loose, and pursued the prisoner and took him in Lamb-alley; he threw the piece of wood into a house in the alley.</p>

On the 30th of April, about a quarter before nine in the evening, my boy had been to carry some beer out to a neighbour; he came in and informed me a man had wrenched up a bar of the Post Office window; I went to the window to see if the bar was wrenched up, and he made off up the lane, and turned into Lamb-alley; I did not lose sight of him; I pursued him and took him; my boy was with me when I took him.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you go to work with him?</p>
               <p>Peak. About six weeks ago I believe; the first house we worked at was in New Court; that was Cooper's house; we were to have twenty seven shillings a week and our board.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Patten and Rogers to have?</p>
               <p>Peak. The same. We used to cut them out and press them with a great press; we used to buy the copper and so finish them: we bought the copper on Snow-hill, in large sheets, about three-quarters of a yard long, and about the thickness of a common counterfeit halfpenny, and about fourteen or fifteen inches wide. We cut them out, scowered, pressed, stamped, and finished them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who used to cut them out?</p>
               <p>Peak. Rogers mostly; Cooper used to lay them in the press.</p>
               <p>Q. Who struck the dye?</p>
               <p>Peak. Cooper used to make his own dyes himself. I have stood by him an hour at a time while he has made them; he had but one pair<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177405180032"/> made at first, whether he made any more after that I cannot say. Patten and I were at the fly.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the house were these implements kept?</p>
               <p>Peak. In the cellar; we used to work at the heavy work.</p>

            . I went to New-court, St. John's-street, on the Saturday, I believe the 30th of last month; I am not certain to the day; a woman who calls herself Cooper let me in; I saw her and a little boy about ten years of age; I saw neither of the prisoners there at that time. I found in the house these four pieces of copper in a corner cupboard in the parlour; I found nothing else. Mr. Clark and Mr. Phillips went with me; they made a further search both up stairs and below; Cooper came in about three quarters of an hour after we had been in the house; we secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other prisoners come in?</p>
               <p>Heley. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing?</p>
               <p>Heley. He was confused at being charged with that crime; he did not say any thing. We left the press and things standing as they were and locked up the house. On the Monday following I went again and took down the press, and in the bottom of the press I found thirteen halfpence; at the cutting out press I found these three blanks.</p>

            . I was employed in making this search on Saturday the 30th of April. The witness (Peak) was sent from Coventry with an information made before a magistrate there; in consequence of that we went to the house of Mr. Cooper; when I knocked at the door his wife opened it; she was a little troublesome; I took her to New Prison; we waited till the husband came home; he was taken into custody, and in the cellar I found a large press to coin, and a cutting out press, both of them fixed.</p>
               <p>Q. For what?</p>
               <p>Clark. Halfpence I believe, by what I found, the reverse of the dye of a halfpenny, fixed in the press; the other stood on the window, and the halfpence found in the house appear to have been struck from this dye; there is a crack upon the head side, which is upon the counterfeit halfpence. Upon the stairs I found some copper (produces several slips of copper); here is some cessil of the same sort. I found this dye fixed in some cement; here are the impressions struck; these halfpence do not correspond with the dye; they were stamped before the dye was cracked.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they counterfeit halfpence?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes; the blanks are smaller than the halfpenny, because the stamping of the impression of course spreads it something.</p>
               <p>Cooper's Defence.</p>
               <p>As this evidence is so strong against me, I leave myself entirely to the mercy of the Court; I have a large family. I beg for a merciful sentence.</p>
               <p>Rogers's Defence.</p>
               <p>This Peak and I were in partnership in the buckle business; he said he had worked at the cock-making business; I did not know what he was gone to; he left the business to me; I was to have one third of the profit of the buckle business; he used to come now and then to see how the business went on; there is a person in court worked with me till the 23d of April; his name is Woodhouse. I never worked for Cooper in my life, except I worked with him at one Bailey's a good many years ago; this Peak took an opportunity on the 21st of April, when I was gone to my breakfast; I live at the Wheatsheaf, in Oxford-road; he came to my shop; he knew where the key was; he took the key, and locked up my door; I went to his lodgings; I saw the woman he kept; she said he had turned me out of the shop; he said no work should be done because I owed him some money. I gave myself no great concern to look after him for fear of being arrested; the next news I heard was, that he had sold the tools. From thence I went to live at Islington, at the Boot; the Sunday following they came and took me out of the room, searched my pockets, and my wife's, and the drawers; they could not find any thing; they took me with them, but this evidence's sister used to come to me to the shop, to persuade him not to keep company with this woman he lived with; I endeavoured to persuade him off but could not.</p>
               <p>Patten's Defence.</p>
               <p>I am innocent of the fact; I know nothing at all of Peak; I had about six or seven weeks acquaintance with him, doing buckles for Peak and Rogers. The house I live in is in White-cross-street, where I was taken from.</p>

            . I saw Rogers the 21st of last month; he complained he could not get in to work, at his apartments in St. Ann's-court, Soho; I have been in his company several times before; I have seen him at his daily labour; I have been at his shop several times; I always saw him; I know no further but that he is an honest man; I have seen him daily several days; I have breakfasted, dined, and supped, and kept company with him till nine, ten, or eleven o'clock at night; I never saw him out of his business.</p>
               <p>Q. You used to be with him all day long?</p>
               <p>Cogens. From eight in the morning till ten at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you work with him?</p>
               <p>Cogens. No. I was troubled with the stone; he advised me to go to Dr. Chadwick. I have been out of employment a vast long time, and have had nothing to do. I stood in the shop and saw them at their plate-buckle-making: I was obliged to stay till between twelve and one before I could see Dr. Chadwick. They had beer at different times: I was out of employment and not capable of carrying on the peruke-making business: I served my time in the Temple.</p>

               <p>Q. But you are an attorney?</p>
               <p>Wood. No, I shall be called to the bar speedily. On the latter end of March last, my house at Hampstead was broke open, and a great many things lost; it was on the 28th or 29th of March, Monday or Tuesday; I had been at Kingston Assizes; I came home on Monday;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177405180034"/> my housekeeper came to town on Monday night, and did not return again till Wednesday; she left every thing safe when she came away; she came away I believe on Monday; there was no servant in the house when it was done; on Wednesday the 30th I went to Hampstead on horseback, and my housekeeper and servant girl went by the stage coach; we got there about eight at night; they had just got there; they told me they found the street door was bolted on the inside, and they were afraid the house had been robbed; I went to the door and found it to be so; then I ordered one of them to go to one of the servants of Mr. Sewel, and go in the back way at my back garden, and get in at the back door; the servant did go; there was a little alarm made, and some of the people might hear we were in a consternation; Mr. Sewel's servant got a ladder and got into my back garden; the back door was shut but not locked; he unbolted the door and I went in with the housekeeper and servant; I found somebody had been in the house and committed great devastation, broke many things to pieces and plundered the house; the pannel of the parlour door was very near broke; there was some china in a beaufet, and other things; they had broke the glass and cut down by the side of the lock so as to get a poker in which was there, which seemed very much strained by attempting to break open the door; there were a great many drops of blood upon the floor, so I suppose one of the thieves cut themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did they get in?</p>
               <p>Wood. They had begun untiling part of the house, but finding the timbers too close, they desisted; they got in at the cellar window of the adjoining house which is unoccupied, got along a parapet wall and in at my garret window. I lost all the things mentioned in the indictment ( repeating them); I had seen some of them about a week or ten days before; I left Mrs. Pettit and the servant in the house when I went away; some of the things were found in the possession of Mrs. Ripley, at Wandsworth; I had a search warrant to search Everett's house; Sir

On the Wednesday this happened between nine and ten in the morning I heard the nurse of the foul ward cry murder; I found the prisoner trying to get in at the window of the foul ward; I heard her say they were a parcel of pocky whores and she would kill them all; I took her at that time from the window, and sent her about her business, but she said she would get in and beat them all, for that she would get to the fire; but there was no further disturbance till about an hour after; then I heard the cry of murder again; I went and found the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177405180042"/> prisoner in the soul ward; there were Gogan, the deceased, and two other persons, and Jones the nurse of the ward was standing at the door; I saw the prisoner by the fire-place, with a poker in her hand, with which I saw her strike the deceased upon the right side of her face: I ran up to her and took the poker out of her hand; I asked her what she meant, and said she had killed the woman; she said I was a street-walking bitch, and she would serve me in the same manner; with assistance I tied her hands, she abusing me me all the time; we got her away and put her into the dead house; the deceased bled at the mouth directly and said that Holding had murdered her; it was a short bit of a poker that belonged to the ward; the deceased lived four weeks and two days and then died; the prisoner was not in her senses as I thought like another woman; she had had fits and they had much affected her.</p>

I was in bed in the room where this happened; I was in a salivation; my bed stood with the back towards the fire-place, so that unless I got up I could not see what passed; there was first a dispute between the deceased and the prisoner about the fire; the deceased got up, and the prisoner having rose up out of her chair to get at some coals to put on the fire, the deceased sat down in her place, upon this the prisoner struck the deceased a blow on the forehead upon the right side of her cheek with the poker; her mouth immediately started out with blood, and she bled continually from that time to her death; with some difficulty the prisoner was put out of doors, and then she wanted to come in again through the window and threatened me because I had endeavoured to take the deceased's part; the mistress of the workhouse put the prisoner then into the dead house, where she continued some time; the room where they were is a long narrow room; my head was towards the fire place; I fate up in order to take the deceased's part.</p>

I am master of the workhouse; I was not at home at the time; when I came home I understood the woman had been hurt: the prisoner was the person accused; she was not in any custody; when the woman was dead I thought it necessary the committee should know it; they issued their orders to have her confined and then she was not to be found; she voluntarily surrendered herself afterwards to take her trial.</p>
               <p>- Tyrrell. I am a surgeon; I attend this workhouse: the deceased, who had been in a course of salivation under my care, was perfectly recovered and was fit to be discharged; she was kept in the house a week longer only out of greater caution; I saw her the next day after this accident happened; I found a wound in her right cheek, which was only a quarter of an inch each way; there was a violent contusion and inflammation, and I judged from its appearing to have bruised the maxillary glands, that it would prove mortal, because being just come out of a salivation the parts were very tender, and though she was perfectly recovered, yet a wound there might produce those consequences, and be mortal: this wound was the cause of her death.</p>
