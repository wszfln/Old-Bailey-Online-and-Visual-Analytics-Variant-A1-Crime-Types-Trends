On the 29th of August a man came and told me he was at a house in Snow's-fields, in Southwark; I went as directed, and not knowing him I stood by him some time; he made off and ran, I ran then after him, and took him; he asked me what I had to say against him; I said, I took him for receiving a parcel of watches that had been stole from me; he said, let me alone, and I will go quietly, is your name Scott; I said, it is; he said, d - n the watches, I wish I had never seen them.</p>

               <p>Scott. He keeps an old clothes-shop in Red-lion-market, Whitecross-street.</p>
               <p>Q. to Smith. How was you paid?</p>
               <p>Smith. I was paid part in money, and a note; they came in all to 26 l. and 6 d. I have a note of hand for 6 l. 8 s. the prisoner at the bar paid all the money, saving the 6 l. 8 s. for which he gave a note of hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>On the 21st of April Territt came to my house, and asked me if I would be so kind as to go to Mr. Smith, and get him to let me have the watches out for the use of him; I asked him why he could not go himself; he said, because there was a writ out against him, and he lived just by Mr. Pain; he said there were six of them; he gave me 19 l. 12 s. 6 d. and desired me to lay down the rest of the money; I said I could not, for I was going to Yorkshire, and should want money; he said, if he had not them out directly, he should lose the sale of them, the gentleman that was to have them was going abroad; I went to Mr. Smith, and desired him to let me have these six watches; Mr. Smith said, he believed Mr. Territt to be a very honest man; he brought them one at a time; they came to 22 l. and 6 d. I paid him 19 l. 12 s. 6 d. and desired him to trust me the rest a day or two; he said, if I thought proper, he would take my note; I gave him a note, and he delivered the watches to me, and I carried them to Territt's house, and delivered them to him.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. When was your shop broke open?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was broke open in January last, and I advertised the watches above a month in all the papers, and handbills, describing them almost all.</p>
               <p>Q. to Smith. How came you, when all this was done, not to make a discovery to Mr. Scott?</p>
               <p>Smith. None of these watches tallied with the papers.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner very busy upon the wharf, I thought he belonged to a ship; I saw him take up this truss, and put it on his shoulder, and looked sharp about him, and made a bit of a run at first, and then went softly; I hallooed to him, and I and another man ran after him, and asked him where he was going with it; he said a man ordered him to carry it; I bid him produce the man; he said he did not know where he was; we brought him back, and took him into the compting-house.</p>

I am a watchman on that wharf; my master sent me on an errand, just as I returned I saw the prisoner with the bale of goods; I asked him how he came by it; he hallooed out for one Tom; I told him there was no Tom there; I saw no body that belonged to him; we brought him back with the goods on his back.</p>

               <p>Q. How much did you demand?</p>
               <p>L. Letter. I valued my gown at forty shillings.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Cain. I live in the Fleet-market; a woman brought this gown to me on a Sunday night, about a month ago; I knew nothing of the woman; she asked me if I would buy a gown; I said, I did not want one; she said, it is Sunday night, and I cannot go to the pawnbroker's with it; said I, is it your own; she said it is not, it is the property of one Mrs. Morris, in Salisbury-court; she desired I would lend her 2 s. upon it, and said, she had not had a morsel to day; I lent her 2 s. I said, do you come for the gown to-morrow morning; she said she would; my maid said it is a pretty colour, she should like it, if I could get it for a guinea; I never opened it, nor looked at it; the next morning the woman came, and gave me the money I lent her, and said, if I had a mind for it, the price was 16 s. I said, if there is any dispute about it, bring me my money, and you shall have your gown again; that same day I saw the prisoner, who said it was her gown; I asked her if she had had the money; she said she had; I said, how came you to sell your gown; she said, she sold it for want.</p>

               <p>I never knew that Mrs. Letter had such a gown in her house; the reason I quitted my lodging was, I owed her a little money, and could not pay.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>A. Parker. Yes, I have seen him many times before; he was a neighbour; he lived but about a mile from me, and worked with Mr. Stanley, a blacksmith.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him at the time he used you thus?</p>

               <p>Q. What family have you got?</p>
               <p>A. Parker. I am a widow, and have five children; the next morning I went and had the prisoner taken; he was at work.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk or sober that night?</p>
               <p>A. Parker. I cannot tell; I had seen him at a public-house, where I had called with my oysters, but had no thought of his coming after me; I had not been gone from that public-house above half an hour when he attacked me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think if he had been sober, he would have made such an attempt upon you?</p>
               <p>A. Parker. He bears a very bad character in the neighbourhood, and if he had not perceived the light coming, I do think he would have killed me.</p>

            . I am a servant at the White Horse at Mile-end; last Saturday morning I saw the prisoner at the bar take two turkies out of Mr. Horsenail's fields.</p>

               <p>Martin. I was looking out at a window.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he take them?</p>
               <p>Martin. He took one under one arm, and the other under the other arm, and went out of the field with them; I can say nothing farther.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. When was the prisoner taken up?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. We took him up but yesterday.</p>

               <p>I was going along the fields, I catched up one turkey in my hand, and put it down again, and went on, and never took one away.</p>
               <p>Q. to Martin. What time of the day was it you saw the prisoner with the turkies?</p>
               <p>Martin. It was between eight and nine in the morning.</p>

               <p>Mr. Robinson. I am a butcher, I have known the prisoner eight or ten years, he is a drover; all I know of him is, he has drove many a score of bullocks for me, and brought them home safe like an honest fellow.</p>

I am servant to Mrs. Hubbard; the prisoner knocked at the door about the time my mistress has mentioned, I opened it; he said he wanted to pledge his handkerchief; I seeing a handkerchief tied over his nose, asked him how he came to be disguised; he said he had a sore nose; I went to my mistress, and he followed me, and clapped a pistol over my right shoulder, and said to my mistress, your watch and your money; I turned round, and clapped hold of the pistol, and pushed him out of that room into the shop, and struggled with him some time; he said let it go, I will not hurt you; he got it away; then he went to my mistress, as she was behind the counter, and said, your watch and your money; she gave him first silver, then gold; then he asked for her watch again; she gave him a silver watch; then he not being contented wanted more money; then she gave him gold again, then he wanted more; she then took out some, and said, here, take all; then he wanted to see the till, and put his hand over, and found it a large drawer, then they went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner?</p>

               <p>Q. How was he dressed when he robbed your mistress?</p>
               <p>A. Rimmington. He had a brown wig on, and a flapt hat, and I perceived he had short hair under his wig *.</p>

Lloyd had then no bundle. he denied having any; we searched very particularly under the shop-board where Murphy was at work, and could not find the bundle; we were going away; Noaks said, I shall have another look; in going to the fire-place, here it is said he, and took it up; I said, I knew it to be the same bundle that he brought in; Murphy said he brought in no bundle, he brought in this coat, (meaning a coat he was at work upon.)</p>

            . About three quarters of 2 year ago, I was drawn into bad company, and did many robberies; Murphy and his wife used<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176710210024"/> to buy things of us; Mrs. Murphy generally paid the money, for what I and other boys carried; they gave us hardly any thing for what we brought.</p>
               <p>Lloyd's defence.</p>
               <p>I was going down to Limehouse to see after some work on the Tuesday night, before the Wednesday that I was taken; coming home between eight and nine in the evening, I had occasion to ease myself; going down a gateway I found that bundle, I took and brought it home; and in the morning I saw what it was; and as Mr. Murphy had made me a coat and several things, and was making a coat at the time, I had seen two or three handkerchiefs hang at his door; I went to see whether he would buy them; I was afraid of getting into trouble, made me not own it at first.</p>
               <p>He called seven people to his character, but none could give any account of him, or his behaviour for three or four years last past.</p>
               <p>Murphy's defence.</p>
               <p>I had a green coat to turn for this young man, he brought it in a bundle; I did not know where he lived; he desired me to get it turned and pressed; I had had it about nine days; then he agreed to let it alone a little while, I being busy; the week following he came for it; I promised he should have it by 12 o'clock the next day; about a quarter past eleven he came in, I was tying my garters, or buckling my shoes, I do not know which, I discerned something under his arm, but what it was I could not tell.</p>

Edwards came first, and said, Lucas, make me a shilling's worth of punch; I made it, and offered them glasses; they refused them, and drank it standing at the bar; Dunderdell asked my wife if she drank tea in the afternoon; my wife answered, sometimes she did, and sometimes she did not; said she, if it is not too much trouble put on the tea kettle, we will be back very soon; they went away, but never returned; after they were gone, I found the lock of my room-door where I lie, broke, and the lock of my bureau in that room broke; there were four locks broke in all; I missed fifty-three guineas in a woman's glove, and a purse which had 20 l. in it.

               <p>Thomas. I have seen this key and hook before in Edwards's possession.</p>
