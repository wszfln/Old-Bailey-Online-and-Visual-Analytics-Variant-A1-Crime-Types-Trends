            . I am a salesman, and live in Field-lane. On Sunday night, the 9th of November, about a quarter to ten o'clock, I was out, and was sent for; when I came in two persons were standing at the door - I found the prisoner inside; he had some gentleman's clothes in a portmanteau - I said it was rather an awkward night to bring clothes, and I should not buy them; I said, "How came you to bring clothes on Sunday night?" he said his master was going away early in the morning; he said he, or his master, was going to leave town that night or early in the morning: I left him in the shop, and went out to look for an officer; I returned in ten minutes, when he and the two persons were gone; the clothes were left behind - I took them to Hatton-garden next morning, and gave information; I was desired to go to Bow-street, and took the clothes there between eleven and twelve o'clock, and found the prisoner in custody; I had left the clothes at Hatton-garden for three hours, with Limbrick; I have no doubt that I took the same to Bow-street - they were shewn to Mr. Lawrence there; I had never seen the prisoner before the Sunday - he was dressed in livery that night; I have no doubt he is the man.</p>
               <p>COURT. What opportunities had you of conversing with him? A. I might have been in the shop five minutes: I had a candle - I saw they were new clothes, and directly said, "I don't buy anything on Sunday night;" I was not at home when they first came - I found the clothes lying on a chair, not in a bundle; I went for an officer in about five minutes, and when I returned they were gone - I did not see him again till next day at Bow-street; the clothes were three coats, two pairs of trousers, two handkerchiefs, and a table-cloth - they were not in the portmanteau; I put them into it, and gave them to Limbrick at ten o'clock, and left them at the office till one, when I think he gave them to me. I think the prisoner is the man; I do not think I have the least doubt of him.</p>

The prisoner has lodged in our first-floor for six years - he does not do any business, but lives on his half-pay, I believe, I took some carpets up stairs on the 24th of October; I was in the room, and was going to take them down stairs - the prisoner came into the room where I was, with a drawn sword in his hand - he stabbed me with it; he said nothing to me before he stabbed me, nor had I said any thing to him - he stabbed me four times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you between the different times he stabbed you? A. No. The sword went through the carpet; I do not know how many times it went through the carpet, but I had one stab in my side, one on each knee, and one in the stomach; I called out, and my uncle came - the prisoner then went out of the room: I do not know where he went to; when he was gone I locked the door - my uncle did not come into the room at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When you locked the door did you look at your wounds? A. No; blood came from all of them - I called out of the window, and my uncle came up to the landing-place; I unlocked the door, and went on the landing-place, and my uncle took me down; I was confined to my bed for a week - a surgeon attended me; he is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the extent of the wounds in your side? A. Rather more than half an inch deep; the one in my stomach was very small - it was not deep; one of those on my knees was about three quarters of an inch deep, and the other about half an inch; the surgeon attended me every day - I got better at the end of the week; the surgeon was called in about ten minutes after: I have always been on good terms with the prisoner - he was always civil to me; this happened at two o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever heard the prisoner talk to himself? A. Yes - I have heard him talk to the chairs, tables and things; he has done this at different times, nearly all the while he has lodged with us: I am nearly sixteen years old- he used to call the chairs and tables by different Christian names, and tell them to answer him - that was all he used to say.</p>
               <p>Q. How long used he to continue this? A. I do not know; I used to go up stairs at times and hear him, but I never used to stop to listen - he had his meals in the house, but not with the family - he had them alone; I had not observed any thing else about him - he had friends who came to see him; I have heard him talk to them rationally.</p>
               <p>Q. Before this time, did you ever perceive any thing of violence about him? A. No - he would not speak to any body for a week together sometimes, and we used not to speak to him, for he would not answer us; he did not appear to me to be in possession of his right mind.</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix's uncle. On the 24th of October, I heard her call out and went up stairs; when I got to the top of the stairs, I met the prisoner with the sword in his hand, pointing it right at me - he never spoke at all; I went down stairs again as fast as I could, and made an alarm - persons came up with me, and he was then blowing the fire in his room; I went up to my niece and found her at the door, bleeding - I took her down stairs: I did not see her wounds - we went for a surgeon, who dressed them: she was confined to her bed about a week before she got about; I have lived there twelve months - the prisoner has been there all that time; I never exchanged twenty words with him - I have heard him talking to himself, but what about I cannot tell: he did not appear like a man in his right mind - I never heard him quarrel with my niece.</p>

            . I live about thirty yards from Pace.'s. On the 24th of October, I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody - I went up stairs and found his room-door locked; I called to him to open it - he came and did so directly; I asked him to sit down in a chair - I looked round for a sword, and found this one; it is a sword in a stick - it was in the stick when I found it, up in one corner of the room; I told him he must go with me, and he requested I would allow him to put on another suit of clothes - I said it was not worth while, as he was going a very little way; he then requested me to allow him to lock up his apartments, for all the property there belonged to him - he did so, and we went down stairs together; I took him to Lambeth-street Office - he appeared very sullen and quiet; he never spoke.</p>

            . I am a widow. The prisoner is my nephew - he was under my care from eleven years old, for seven years; he is now forty-two years old - I consider him a deranged man: In 1815 he cut his throat, and he escaped from my house after that, with a wound in his neck - here is one of the hand-bills I circulated to have him found; I afterwards put him in the White House, Bethnal-green, which is a madhouse - he was there six or seven years, in and out; I have known him run about quite naked - I am certain he is subject to fits of derangement; since he has left the White House, he has exhibited symtoms of derangement - when he was sane, I always found him a very humane, kind man.</p>

            . I am a City officer. A commonication was made to me on the 3d of October, by Warre; I went that day with him to Ship-yard, Temple-bar, and found three of the prisoners there - on my entering the room Warre pointed out Mrs. Gray, as the person who sent the castors there to pawn; I then desired the others to leave the room - I then told 
               <persName id="t18281204-3-person134">Gray</persName>
             I was an officer, and had come to make inquiry about the castors which she bad sent to pledge: I asked to whom they belonged - she said they belonged to a friend of hers; I asked who the friend was, and where they resided - she said they were gone into the country - she did not know where they resided, but she expected they would return in a few days; this was after I had told her I was an officer: on my conveying her to the Compter she gave me another account of how she became possessed of them, and in consequence of that I returned with her to Shipyard, in search of the person she said she had the castors from; I found Marshall there, but Shearston was gone - I asked Marshall what had become of the young man; she said he had gone out of the house immediately - I then took Gray to the Compter: I endeavoured to discover the owner of the property, and advertised it, but could get no information, and on the 11th of October the Magistrate discharged Gray, on her own recognizance to appear when called on; the castors were given over to me, and have been in my possession ever since: I first saw Miss Palmer about a fortnight after Gray was discharged; I was sent for to the Bank, and produced the castors, which she claimed and identified. On the night of the 1st of November, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw Marshall and Gray walking up the Old Bailey- I said to Gray, "You did not appear according to the recognizance you entered into;" she said, "I did not know what I was to do:" I said, "You have left Shipyard" - she said, Yes; I said, "Where do you now live?" she said she had no lodging; I took them into custody, and the nurse at the Compter searched them - some keys were given to me, which Gray said were hers, and that she lodged at Mr. Smith's, No. 51, Portpool-lane; I went there next morning (Sunday), and found a box in her lodging, which was locked - the keys I had opened it, and in it I found, among other articles, this fan; I asked Gray repeatedly, if she had pledged any thing else, or ever had any thing else - she said she had not, repeatedly: I asked her if the whole contents of the trunk were hers; she said they were; I asked her afterwards about a watch - she denied having had one; I told her I had received information that she had pawned one of the gold watches which were lost - she said she never had; I said, "You had better say you never pledged any of the forks or the mustard-pot - she said, "Yes, I did pawn them;" I asked where she had pawned them - she said somewhere about Fleet-market, she could not exactly tell me the name of the street. On Friday, the 7th of November, Crossley came to the Justice-room at Guildhall, to prefer some complaint, and I took him into custody: I got information, and went to Harrow on Sunday, the 9th, to Northall, to a cottage kept by one Ball, a bay-binder; I saw Ball - he came out of the cottage; I got in at last, but the prisoners were not there - I went into the yard, looked to the left, and saw Shearston just stepping through a gap of a hedge, which led to an adjoining field; I called him, and said, "Your name is Robert Shearston - I want you;" he stood still - I took him, brought him into the cottage, told him I was an officer, and apprehended him on suspicion of robbing the house where his sister was a servant - I did not hold out any threat or inducement to him; he was dreadfully agitated, and said he was very sorry for what he had done, and hoped his poor sister had not got into any trouble; I said, "It was a shocking thing of you to be guilty of such an act, when you were bound to protect the property;" he was so agitated he could say nothing more -I then brought him to town, and on the road he said he had given the whole of the property, except the clock, to some persons whom he named; I asked what he had done with the clock - he said he had lost it: before that I cautioned him not to say any thing which would be injurious to him - on our way to town he wished to see his sister, and saw her at Miss Palmer's; they were both so dreadfully agitated that neither of them could speak; I only heard the sister say, "Oh! Robert, how could you do so;" I took him away directly - he told me he understood the duplicates were wrapped up in brown paper, and placed somewhere for security, but he did not know where; I afterwards found the duplicates at Price's gin-shop, at the corner of Broad-court, Long-acre - I received them from Mrs. Price, wrapped up in this brown paper, which also contained a pair of snuffers and four knives, which have been used.</p>

            . I am clerk to the prosecutors. I received this letter from Mr. Flint, enclosing a 20l. Leicestershire note; I took it to Messrs. Pares and Heygates' Bank, and got three 5l. Bank notes and five sovereigns for it - I did not take the numbers of the notes; I deposited them and the sovereigns in a drawer, in a desk in the office - I paid away the sovereigns, and saw the three notes there on Tuesday, the 11th of November; the drawer was not locked - the prisoner had access to it; he has a salary and is not an articled clerk - he had only been there a week: I missed the notes on Thursday, the 13th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many clerks are there? A. Only him and myself: the notes were in the clerk's office - there is a passage leading from the Inn; the desk was not locked - I am certain I had received the notes at Messrs. Pares and Heygate's; when questioned about them, (from the state of my feelings at the moment, thinking I might be charged with it myself,) I stated that I could not, at the moment, state where I changed the note, and stated to the Magistrate I thought it was at Messrs. Williams and Co's. - I am sure I said I thought so; I did not speak positively - that was the impression on my mind then, and that I had received four 5l. notes and no sovereigns; I signed a deposition containing both those statements.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you account for the difference? A. From the agitated state of my feelings, fearing I might be suspected: the notes were missed on the Thursday, and he was before the Magistrate on the Friday - my agitation would have continued up to the present moment if he had not confessed it: the impression on my mind was that I changed it at Williams', but I afterwards looked at the book and found there were more Leicestershire Banks than one, and seeing that one paid their notes at Pares and Co's. it came like an electric shock upon me, and I recollected going to Pares', where I had never been before, and had to inquire where it was; I corrected my deposition at the second examination, which was on the following Friday.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever change a country note at Williams? A. I beheve not; I have been there with cheques shortly before, but had never been to Pares'.</p>

            . I am a constable. Dyson came to me on the 17th of November, about a quarter-past five o'clock in the evening, I went with him to Mr. Marshall's, and saw the prisoner with two companious; I secreted myself in a doorway, in James'-street, where I had a command of his actions - I found him and his companions repeatedly going up to the window; they attempted to get the glass out, and every time they attempted it, I passed them and saw the glass was secure, except the crack - the last time I saw the prisoner take from the window some articles, but could not perceive at the moment what they were; I went up and tried to catch hold of him first - he ran away and I after him; I cried out Stop thief! and as he ran he threw the glass bottles from him in every direction, from his hat and his pocket; I caught him at the corner of Mary-le-bone-street, and never lost sight of him - I was so close that I struck him with my staff three times: one or two patrols assisted me in taking him - it was five or ten minutes after six o'clock when we took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you took me back, I asked you where my hat was? A. You did: I believe somebody had taken his hat from his hand, but I cannot say - I thought he had thrown it away with the bottles, as he threw his handkerchief away; he ran at a tremenduous rate - if it had not been for the patrols, I do not think we should have taken him.</p>
               <p>Q. You said "Your hat is right, you can have it directly"? A. I do not recollect saying so.</p>

             I am watch-house-keeper of St. James'. The prisoner was brought to me on the 17th of November, soon after six o'clock in the evening; two smelling-bottles, a toilet-bottle, and some broken pieces of bottles were delivered to me, by the patrols, who picked them up - Dyson delivered me both the smelling-bottles, and Powell the toilet-bottle; I have had them ever since - Dyson delivered me the hat; I offered it to the prisoner, and he denied it being his.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told him mine was a silk hat, and that was a beaver one. Witness. He said his was a silk hat.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was passing along the street, and going tdwards the square, heard a cry of Stop thief! I turned round, and saw a young man following me; I was stopped and accused of robbery, and in the bustle lost my hat: as I was taken to the doctor's shop, I asked the constable where my hat was - he said I should have it directly; he had picked it off the ground.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it Castile soap? A. It is called so - it is a particular kind of soap; Gale and Co. are the only persons who sell soap of that nature - I have never seen any like it elsewhere; I do not swear masters are the only persons that sell it, but I believe so - and here is a quantity of soap of my marking and perfuming - here is one piece I can swear to, it was cut into bars, and here is where I cut out some dirt, it is then cut in pieces and stamped, but this is not stamped - one piece has the stamp on it, which we use; I swear to this piece marked "Old Brown Windsor Soap," we never sell that in London: it is damaged, and damaged soap is never sent out of our premises, but melted again - the damage was discovered after I stamped it, there is n white speak in it, it was locked up with others to'be melted; here is another piece, I can swear to, having cut a white speak out of it about six months ago- I cannot particularly say when I cut it out.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When the prisoner came into the watch-house he was immediately searched? A. Yes: he was not asked if he had any objection to be searched -I have no recollection of his saying he had no objection; I was not there all the time, I was there when he was searched, but they might have searched him again - he was not about to be discharged; the prosecutor appeared agitated, and as if he had taken a little, but not intoxicated - he did not say the prisoner was not the man who robbed him in my presence, nor was the constable of the night about to discharge him; they sat about searching him directly he got into the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 9th of November I was in Cateaton-street, and as I was calling half-past nine o'clock, I heard a cry of Watch! Stop him! I made towards Ironmonger-lane, where I heard the voice - I heard a rattle spring, went into the lane, and saw the prisoner running down the lane, towards Cateaton-street, pursued by Branston, coming towards me; when he saw me come up the pavement, he jumped into the road, and tried to get past me - I struck at him with my stick, and got hold of him; Gardner came up just as we were beginning to take him to the watch-house- when I caught the prisoner he said, "I am not the man - I am not the man; they are gone another way:" there was nobody but him and the watchman till Gardner came to us - I do not recollect Gardner saying any thing when he came up, but the watchman said he was the right man, and we took him to the watch-house; Gardner was very much flurried, and was obliged to sit down in the watch-house some time before the night-constable would take the charge - the night-constable came in a little after us; Gardner saw part of the chain which was found, and said it was his - he was quite sensible.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Quite sensible? A. Yes; I was not in the habit of seeing him before, but he appeared sensible - not knowing him I cannot say whether he had been drinking, but I mean to say he was sensible; he might have had a drop to drink. I saw the prisoner searched - he was a little time in the watch-house before he was searched, about a quarter of an hour; the constable of the night was not there at first, but when he came he was searched - I did not hear him asked if he objected to be searched, but he said he had no objection; the prosecutor always said he was one of the men, and that he never had him out of his sight - he never said he was not one of the men, in my presence, nor was he about to he discharged. I went out to look for the chain, but found nothing; I was not in the watch-house all the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040013"/>time: a little while after the constable of the night came in I went out to my beat.</p>

            . I am constable of the night. The prisoner was at the watch-house when I came in; I saw Gardner there, and in my opinion he was a little intoxicated - he was not insensible from liquor, but was agitated very much indeed, and not for some time after he was there did he declare that the prisoner was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever express a doubt about him? A. He was in such an agitated state of mind I could not take notice of what he said at first; I never heard him express a doubt about him - he gave charge of him after some time, but before that I sent the watchmen out to look for the property; the chain was not brought in till after he was sent to the Compter - Gardner was gone then; he claimed it before the Lord Mayor - it was delivered to me by Armstrong, the superintendent of the watch: I have had it ever since - here is also another part, which was found next morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the prisoner searched? A. I did; I had then been about ten minutes in the watch-house - I did not hear him asked if he objected to be searched; he did not object - he said he was not the man; Gardner was in a state between agitation and intoxication - he might certainly have made a mistake; the prisoner and he sat down face to face.</p>

On the 15th of May I was alarmed by some one breaking my window, at four o'clock in the morning; I got up, and dressed myself, and told my apprentice to do so, which he did - I went out, and as soon as I got to the door the prisoner ran round the corner, and knocked me down; I got up - he knocked me down again, and said he would silence me; he took my hat: an officer came and took him to the watch-house - I went there, but was in an ill state of health, and it was booked as an assault; we went before the Magistrate, and he was ordered to find bail - he had my hat in his possession before the Magistrate, and I said so, but the Magistrate did not seem to pay much attention to me; he was talking to a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did you not know him before? A. Yes, perhaps for ten months; he lived at an oil-shop, kept by Brown - I do not know that he lived there afterwards; I went every where to look for him after I filed this hill, which was in September - he was held to bail that I might file a bill against him; he had a hat on when he knocked me down, and I think he had one at the watch-house: I do not know who broke the window- my wife was not at home; she came up after this - I did not see her at the time I saw the prisoner; my hat cost 25s. - it was a pretty good one: the officer who took the prisoner is not here. Vann, the officer, stated before the Magistrate that the prisoner had my bat, and the Magistrate said, "I have ordered him to find bail."</p>

            . I am a constable. I received charge of the prisoner; when I came up the people said, "That is the man;" the copper was standing by him - this was in Penton-place, about one o'clock in the day, about three hundred yards from the prosecutor's house; I have tried the copper, and it fitted exactly - the prisoner said a man gave it him to carry, but he did not say who, nor where he was to take it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had to take some things to Pentonville, and on returning I met a man, looking like a bricklayer, and a sailor; they asked me to carry this copper - I took it up, and the sailor walked before; some person came and asked how I came by it - I said, "That man gave it me to carry;" they saw him, but did not take him - he went away. <rs id="t18281204-21-verdict106" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>DANIEL WATKINS re-examined. Q. When did you first understand the money had not been paid? A. I believe it was about the 20th, but on the day previous to her being taken, she came to borrow 5l. for a friend, and we dissuaded her from that - she had not quitted my service.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long had you known her? A. I believe I had seen her about three years before - I had only known her this year, about six weeks before I married her; I got no money with her - I did not get 900l., nor one farthing; it was a match without money - I know of no other motive but affection to assign on my part; I do not feel myself bound to tell whether it was a love match - I believe it was on the 12th or 13th of July, that I put her into a mad-house; we were married on the 29th of June: I had the certificate of a medical man - she gave me reason to suppose she was going to perpetrate some fatal act, but whether on myself or any other person I could not tell; I did not let her out of the madhouse - I left my family to act for me; I was out of the country at the time, and my family had medical men to see her - my father acted for me; I had never been married before. I mean solemnly to depose on my oath, that before I married the woman at the bar, I had never been married - I swear I got no money from her; she lived in a house at Clapton; it was a furnished house taken for her - the furniture was returned to the person she hired it of; I visited her there - she had a servant, and her son lived there; she told me she had been married before, but her husband was dead: she did not desire me to make inquiries whether he was alive or dead - she prevented me from it; she implored me not to make inquiries as to her circumstances or history before I married her; or rather not to divulge what she told me respecting herself - she begged me not to mention any thing to any body respecting her circumstances; she implored me not to make inquiries respecting her - her history was very long.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were these circumstances, which were not to be divulged, any thing relative to her having a former husband? A. No, none whatever, nor as to a doubt of his being alive; I had no reason to believe that she had a husband alive; I did not make any inquiries in the neighbourhood - I had no doubt of her having been married.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did she wear stays? A. Yes - there was no money found in her stays; I never got a shilling with her - she begged me to keep her history secret; she said her husband's name was Smith - that he was executed for forgery, and that was the reason she did not wish her story to be known; I am not certain whether I asked her where, but I believe she said at Newgate - I took her without a farthing of money; I sent her to Dr. Munro, at Clapton - I continued to cohabit with her for the fortnight, and slept with her the night before I took her to Dr. Munro's; I breakfasted with her the same morning: I did not tell her where I was taking her - she thought I was going to the house she lived at; she did me no mischief - I had lived with her till then.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Chatfield. On the 27th of November my mistress sent me for change for a shilling, and when I went out the prisoner was sitting in the shop; my mistress came after me to the shop, and told me to watch the prisoner - I did not see her come out of my mistress', but I watched her into Church-street; I saw her open a shirt, and she had the other things under her arm; I took hold of her, and asked what she was going to do with them - she said to sell them; I asked where she got them - she said it was no odds to me; I took her back, and my mistress sent for the officer - she begged my mistress to forgive her; the things had been in the parlour - I had left the shop about half an hour; she dropped the shirt when I came up.</p>

            . I took William Peacock about five o'clock in the afternoon, with this sack of oats, beans, and chaff in his hands outside Mrs. Mary Gibb's gates, to whom I am servant; I asked how he came by it, he made no answer - I took him into the yard, and sent for an officer; Peacock is a milkman, and keeps a green-grocer's shop - he wished me not to make a piece of work; before I saw Peacock I saw a coal-waggon outside the door, I do not know whose it was - I had been called to look under the manger, where I saw the same bag, with the same articles<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040021"/>in it - I set a person to watch it; Ade worked for my mistress - the value of this is about 3s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is Mrs. Gibbs here? A. No; I am ostler there, and Ade was employed there - I did not see Peacock speak to the persons with the waggons, they had three or four horses in each - he had served me with milk; he came across to me; I had not called him - he held out the bag to Ade; I had hold of him by the collar - what he said was so very low, I could not hear him; I did not hear him say "Here's this bag back, I don't know what it is;" I was in a bustle at the time - I took Ade up, and gave him in charge - he was let go out of the yard - the gate was shut; there was another way he might have gone out - he went by himself to get his coat and hat; Peacock was going towards his own home when I first saw him, but he came across to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you first saw him. did you see any thing in his hand? A. Not at first, but when he came back, just passing the horses' heads, I saw the bag in his hand, he had got about fifteen yards; I cannot say whether he saw me before he turned back - I suspect so; he could have seen me, his side face was towards me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Peacock there to serve milk? A. Yes; I did not see how far he got from the gates - I saw him again in about five minutes; I did not hear him say he got it from Ade.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever say you saw Peacock put it into the waggon? A. No; the carter came into the yard, and said Peacock had put it into the waggon, then served a house with milk, and then came and took it; I keep the key of the corn-bin, but do not always lock the door - and did not that morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What does the bag contain? A. Oats, beans, and chaff, mixed, and a stable rubber, which I know- it is such a mixture as we regularly feed the horses with- I told Peacock he ought to be ashamed of himself to rob us; they both said, "Don't make a peace of work" - I said I could not look over it, because we had lost so much- I told Mrs. Gibbs' son of it.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was in Chancery-lane about one o'clock; I went to the place - the prosecutor called Watch! and he gave charge of the prisoner for robbing him of two sovereigns - in taking her along she dropped the sovereigns out of her hand; I took up one, and my brother watchman took up the other - the prosecutor appeared to be rather the worse for liquor; the prisoner owned to robbing him and taking the sovereigns out of his pocket - in going to the watch-house she tried to slip a piece of money into the right-hand cuff of my coat; that was before she dropped them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was she drunk? A. I did not perceive it; but the prosecutor was; it was at the end of Bishop's-court I took them - the prosecutor said if she would give him back the money he would not give charge of her; he said in the watch-house that he thought he had lost his watch-chain, but he had not: the prisoner said he wished to have connexion with her - I did not give her an opportunity of escaping; when I heard the call Watch!

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you serving in your own right? A. Yes; I am a bricklayer. The prosecutor was not kicking up a little row - he was the worse for liquor, but he could go along the street very well; I should think he could not have forgotten what had taken place -I did not hear him say he had lost his watch-chain; I did not hear that till this evening - I was not there for about five minutes; I was going round to see that all was right- I never said I thought he was so drunk he would not venture to come forward.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ - I caught him in my potatoe-bank on the 15th of November, with some potatoes in a sack; I asked what he thought of himself - he said it was the first time he ever attempted such a thing; it was about half-past one o'clock in the morning, and being rather an awkward time I let him go to London with his team - he came back again: he could have nothing to do with those potatoes in the course of my employ.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. When was he taken? A. The same afternoon, but he escaped, and came back on the Tuesday for his wages; I owed him 1l. 9s. 4d. - the potatoes were worth about half a crown: when he came back I asked him if he was not ashamed to see me again - I did not tell him to get out of the stable. nor any thing to that effect; he asked me for his wages - I walked out, and said, "You shall have your wages;" I went out and got the constable to take him - I paid him his wages before Mr. Hardy three days afterwards; he has borne a good character.</p>

Slater alarmed me about one o'clock in the morning; I got out of bed, went to the bed-room door, and heard a knocking, as if persons were endeavouring to break into the lower rooms of the house - I partly dressed myself, took a cord from my box, and lowered myself down with a gun; when I got to the garden I ran to the corner of the house, and saw four men come from within the stone hall - I told them if they did not stop I would blow their brains out; they did not attempt to stop - I pulled the trigger of the gun, but it did not go off; I pursued and overtook one of the men, hit him with the barrel of the gun, and knocked him down into the shrubbery - he got away; I pursued the other three - they jumped over an inner-fence, about four feet high; I pursued and hit one of them with the barrel of the gun - the other two ran to the front-gate; one ran against the bell-wire and broke it, and in getting over the front-gate I hit one with the barrel of the gun - he made his escape; I broke the barrel from the gun - I took up the barrel of the gun, and in striking the prisoner with it, as he was getting over the gate, I broke his arm and knocked him off the gate; he ran under a fir-tree, and exclaimed,"I will give myself up, I think you have broken my arm"- I said, "If you don't stop I will blow your brains out;" another one then got over the gate - a waggoner was coming by; I called him to my assistance, and the prisoner was secured - I found his arm was broken; on searching the premises we found two hats, a silk-handkerchief, and a chisel - the lock of the outer-door of the hall had been picked, and the inner-door had been attempted and the pannel broken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You have no doubt of the prisoner being the man you struck? A. Not the least - I was agitated; I attempted to fire my gun when I found they would not stop - I saw four men quite distinctly; they only turned one corner in the course of the pursuit, and were not out of my sight; I was as close to them as a man could be - quite close to them; I had overtaken one of them before they got to the corner - I stopped to fire the gun before I turned the corner, and got up to the corner at the same moment as the last man of the four; I could see round the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the prisoner getting over a gate, and on your breaking his arm he said he would give himself up? A. Yes - all the four men were dressed in dark clothes - I saw one of their faces, and I saw the prisoner's face also.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Is your mistress' house in the parish of Friern, Barnet? A. Yes - her name is Sarah Ann Mountain; she is a widow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the evening before the robbery I went with a friend to Barnet to get a situation; on my return home I was partly intoxicated - I heard a call of Stop! several times; I was getting over the gate when I was struck with a gun, and gave myself up immediately.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street On the 1st of October, in the evening, I was in Great Ormond-street on duty, with Wells and two other officers; I was going up the street about a quarter before eight o'clock- a man passed me on the same side of the way; the back of his coat being white attracted my attention - I looked over the way, and saw the prisoner carrying a bag; it was dark, but there was light from the lamps - I went after him, and when within four or five yards of him, at the entrance of Queen-square, he threw the bag down and ran away; I pursued - he got over the iron railing into the enclosure of the square; I got over also, and pursued - he ran once or twice up and down the garden; I was close to him, but could not lay hold of him - he got over the rails again, and over some more rails into a gentleman's private-garden, at the north end of the square, and was within a yard of the further railing to get into Guildford-street when I laid hold of him; I had got over; I never lost sight of him from the time the bag was thrown away - the prisoner is the person I seized; I speak most positively to his person - I found the bag in possession of a man named Cox, after I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040025"/>took the prisoner; I cannot say it was the same - I took the prisoner to a public-house at the end of Ormond-street and searched him - and found a pair of Wellington-boots, one in each coat-pocket; the soles were wet, as if they had been recently worn - on further searching his trousers, I perceived something white fall from some part of his dress on to the ground, and found it was a garnet-pin, stuck on to a piece of paper, with the name of Follett on it; I picked it up immediately, at his feet - it has remained on the paper ever since: I found Cox and another officer, standing with the bag, very near the spot where I saw him throw it away- neither of them are here; it appeared to be the same bag- I had not seen them take it up; we all went to the watch-house together, with the prisoner and the bag - it contained the articles in the indictment. I had no conversation with the prisoner, except when I was locking him up; he asked me to give him some water.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. The person you took to the watch-house escaped, did not he? A. He did; I described his person to the solicitor of the parish, and he was re-apprehended on the 30th of October - I described him as having a dark complexion, with dark whiskers, dark eyes, and dark hair; he wore whiskers at that time - he had a dark coat on, but whether blue or black I cannot tell. An advertisement was put into the papers, I suppose from the description I gave, but I had nothing to do with correcting it; I described him as having a black waiscoat and black silk handkerchief - I took particular notice of him at the watch-house, and knew him by his features - I gave the description from my observation of him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You took him within a yard or two of the rails, how did you get him out of the garden? A. The gates were opened by the servant; I took him to the public-house, and never let go of him - Wells had hold of him with me; he might have been in the public-house a quarter of an hour - I partly opened his clothes; his coat was not taken off - I found in the morning that he had escaped through the roof of the watch-house; I am quite certain of him; he at that time wore whiskers, and with running I suppose his complexion altered - he was hot with running: I entertain no doubt whatever of him - I gave the description of him four or five days after.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 1st of October, I was on duty in Great Ormond-street, with Medlycott, about a quarter to eight o'clock, and saw the prisoner at the bar carrying a bag, on the opposite side to me; I crossed over to him to look at the bag, and saw another one cross to him - he met him half-way in the street; I came back to Medlycott, and went up to the man again to take hold of the bag - he dropped it at my feet, ran down Queen-square, and got over the rails into the corner; Medlycott pursued him - I took the property and gave it into the care of Cox the conductor, who was with us, and went to assist Medlycott: the man was then in the gentleman's private garden - I got over, and came up soon after Medlycott apprehended him; I handcuffed him - we took hold of him, one on each side and took him to a public-house in Great Ormond-street - I had an opportunity of seeing his face as I went along; he was searched at the public-house- that occupied ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; his hat was taken off - I saw the pin picked up between his feet, but did not see it dropped: I accompanied him to the watch-house, each of us holding him as before, and there we left him; the prisoner certainly is the man - he has had his whiskers taken off since; I had never seen him before -Cox followed us to the watch-house with the bag; he was not half a dozen yards behind - I left him at the corner of the square while I pursued, and found him at the same place when I came back; I had been absent about ten minutes - I knew the bag by the state of it, and the colour, which was a dirty brown; I have every reason to believe it is the same - there are some holes in it, which I noticed at the time; Medlycott took the pin - it was produced at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. It was dirty? A. Yes, but not with mud, by what I could see - it was not a dark night. I saw an advertisement in the "Hue and Cry," and was with Medlycott when he gave the description - he gave it principally himself; I do not know that I said any thing: I heard him describe him as of a dark complexion - he is not a fair man; he has not got dark hair - I do not know that he was described as having dark hair; he described him as having dark eyes - his eyes are not dark; I have seen many fairer men than him: Hatton was the constable of the night - he was not there when we took him; he came afterwards, but did not see the prisoner, to my knowledge; there was only a woman there - Medlycott locked him up himself; neither Hatton, Cox, nor the woman were examined by the Magistrate, but a man was who assists in locking up - he was there when we called afterwards; he is not here: he was asked if he was the man, and said he did not know him - he had no opportunity of seeing him; what he said was not taken down.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was at the watch-house in Eagle-street about half-past eleven o'clock that night, and saw the person whom Medlycott had taken, and from the view I had of him I consider the prisoner to be the man; I will not swear positively to him, because I only put the light in his face, and looked at him, but it was a month afterwards that I saw him again; I apprehended him afterwards at a china-shop in James-street, Oxford-street, taking down the shutters - I told him he was my prisoner, for felony; I did not say what - he told me to let him take the shutters in; I said I would not- it was about half-past seven o'clock in the morning; I was passing the door: I had been looking about for him a good while - I seized him by the collar, and he held tight by the shutter; I pulled him away, and we fell into the kennel together - another man came to my assistance, and we took him straight to the watch-house - I took him, considering him the man I had seen in the watch-house, and who had escaped.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to consider him the man? A. By information I had received; he had black whiskers on in the watch-house - they were shaved off when I took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You put the light in his face, I suppose, that you might know him again? A. To see if I had seen him before, and I remarked that I had not - I looked at him that I might know him again; I took him as much from my recollection of his person as any thing - I had received information, and when I saw him I considered he looked like the man, or I should not have taken him; he had no whiskers, but there was the mark all down where they had been, and they were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040026"/>growing again - I have no doubt they had been shaved off just before; I consider that his hair is dark, (it is not light) and that he is of a dark complexion; I did not describe him as having a blue coat - I think there was a blue coat in his house when I searched it; I never told the Magistrate there was no blue coat - we brought no clothes away; Hatton was in the front-room of the watch-house when I went to look at the man - he did not go with me; his assistant was there, and at Bow-street, but was not examined - I do not believe he was asked a question by the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear no person asked him at the office, if the prisoner was the man who was at the watch-house, and he said he could not tell? A. He might, but I did not hear it; there were about fifty people in the office, and I might not hear it - I did not see Cox there; I saw Wells there, and was there all the time with him.</p>

Yes; Wells and Medlycott were there then - Hatton was in the outer-room; I do not know whether he went into the place where the prisoner was: the assistant opened the door for me - we did not continue there a minute.</p>

            . I am a green-grocer. I was at the corner of Devonshire-street between seven and eight o'clock on this night, and heard an alarm - I ran down the square, towards the cry, and saw a man getting over the rails, and the officer after him; several persons were on the other side of the square - I got over, and assisted in the pursuit; he ran towards the top of the square, and then to the bottom - he was taken at last in Mr. Bainbridge's garden; I got into the garden, and he was taken - I assisted in taking him back; I took hold of his coat - he was taken to the public-house; I continued there all the while he was searched, and am certain the prisoner is the man - I held the candle while the officer searched him; I particularly took the candle to look at his face, to see if I knew him, and am quite certain of him - his face is not in the same state now; his whiskers have been shaved off: I call his hair dark, and his eye-brows dark, and a very full eye - his appearance corresponds with the description of the man I saw in the public-house; he is the man - I never saw him before, nor afterwards, till he was at Bow-street; I knew him there immediately.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you see the advertisement in the Hue and Cry? A. No; I know the officers had given a description of him: I was not asked to describe him for the advertisement - I saw the officers the morning he escaped, but did not talk with them about his description; I have never been consulted about it- his complexion is dark; his hair does not appear so dark as when he had his whiskers on, but he had a hat on - when we began searching him the officer took it off, to examine him, but I did not notice his hair then; I noticed his whiskers more than his hair, and looked at his face: Medlycott called on me, and said he had the man in custody who committed the robbery, and I went to see him -I cannot say when that was; it was on the day of his second examination.</p>

            . I am assistant to Mrs. Harford, pawnbroker, of Windsor. On the 25th of October, before twelve o'clock in the morning, Harris came and pawned two silver table-spoons and six silver tea-spoons, they have the letter T on them; I asked him if it was his own property - he said it was; I asked his name - he said Thomas Taylor, and that he lived at Woodward's, at Langley; Tolley saw the spoons on the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HARRIS. Q. Am I the man who pawned the spoons, or did I come to buy a hat that day? A. You came to pawn the spoons.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HARRIS. I went to his house that day about half-past five o'clock to buy a hat - he said he had but one in the shop. Witness. He never came to buy a hat to my knowledge; nor did I see him at half-past five to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How old are you? A.Sixteen: my father's name is Thomas - he has no partner; I was down stairs about ten minutes, during that time, there was nobody in the warehouse - my mother was there while I went in pursuit; the warehouse-door was bolted inside - the front street-door was open; there is a middle-door in the passage, which was fast - the person who ran away had a bag or handkerchief; I never said I was positive it was a bag - I did not see it in his hand while I pursued, but I saw it when he started from the glass case.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from your warehouse is the court where I understand some watches have been found? A. About as far as from here to the corner of Newgate-street; I lost sight of him only for a moment or two - no bag was found on him; what he had appeared more like a brown canvas bag than any thing - nothing of the sort was found on him, nor in the way he had run; I never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When he said some of his friends should call on your father, did he not represent that he was unjustly detained, and his friends, and their attorney should call? A. No - he said his friends should visit us again, and we should all get our deserts; he did not say he was not guilty when he was first taken - at the watch-house door he said he did not know what it was all about; the tub was in a dark corner of a shed in the yard.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you take him from under the tub? A. He was underneath the tub, which was on a high stool- he said he was was easing himself; his dress was as perfect as it should be - I did not see him go under the tub; he turned into the gas-yard, and we lost sight of him for a moment.</p>

            . On the 6th of November, about nine o'clock in the morning, I was in St. John-square, Clerkenwell, and saw the prisoner run from Jerusalem-passage to Jerusalem-court; there was a cry of Stop thief! I joined in the pursuit, and saw him heave the watches away - he turned to heave them over a wall, but they struck against the wall, and fell back again; he threw them with both hands; I picked up one watch and one case, and gave them to the prosecutor's son, in the same state as I found them - there was a chain, seals, and a guard to the watch; I gave him the same as I picked up, and the same the prisoner tried to heave away - I stood a minute when I picked them up to see if the owner was by- he was not, and I ran on; I lost sight of the prisoner, but was present when he was taken in the gas-yard, under the butt - the prisoner is the man, I am certain; I saw him run across the square, and saw his face then, and he is the man who hove the watches away. I went to the watch-house, but did not go in, till they sent for me - the prisoner was there; he said if I appeared against him, his friends should do something to me - I am certain of that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How far were you from the person? A. Not above ten yards; I was passing the square - I could not see what he had in his hand when he ran across the square; he sumbled his hands about going down the court, and I saw him throw the watches away - I did not see any canvas bag; I did not lose sight of him above three minutes - I asked a girl which way he was gone when I took the watches up; she is not here: he had one corner to turn in the court after he threw them away; he was angry at the watch-house, and said we should repent of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear the things fall that he threw away? A. Yes; it made a jingling noise - I instantly ran to pick it up, and another boy picked one watch up I am certain I picked up what he threw away.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You knew nothing of the matter but what he told you? A. No; he is not related to me - he has been about six months with me; I am a tailor and pawnbroker - his father has been about four years in my employ.</p>
               <p>Q. A. person transacting business with them might naturally suppose they were respectable people and doing no wrong? A. That they certainly might, as they had been so long with me - the father had the entire management of the tailor's business, as I do not understand it.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Gofton's employ for six months, and left him last Sunday morning; Hall was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040030"/>in Mr. Gofton's employ, as a journeyman tailor - he worked in Barrett's-court, Oxford-street, opposite the house, and came there once or twice most days; about three months ago I asked him for 30s. to pay a debt in the City - I told him I had received a letter from the person, and it must be paid; he said I might take something and pledge it, and there would be no harm in it, provided I got it out again - I hesitated a little while, and then gave him a suit of clothes belonging to Mr. Gofton, for the the purpose of getting 30s.; he took them, and brought me back 30s. the same evening - I took the coat out of a drawer, a pair of blue trousers and waistcoat out of a wrapper; they were all in the shop - he was present when I took them, and I gave them to him; two days after I told him I thought we had better get the clothes out again, as I was afraid we should be found out- he said, "Oh, never mind - we are quite safe;" no one knew of it but ourselves - nothing was done then; I never mentioned it to him again - we had before that pawned things and got them out again: I would not have let him have these if he had not undertaken to get them out; about three days afterwards I delivered him a pair of blue trousers and two black waistcoats of master's, worth 25s., for the purpose of getting money on them, which he promised, and he brought me 10s. back - he did not say whether he had pawned them or not; he saw me take them: about a week after that I delivered him two fancy waistcoats and a pair of dark drab trousers, to get money on - he brought me back 10s., and was present when I took them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you expect to be able to get all these things out of pledge? A. No - I expected to get out the first, but not the two last; he never told me whether he pledged them or not, but brought me back the money - he never produced any duplicates.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had he been in the service of Mr. Gofton? A. I do not know - I had known him about six months; my application to him was to raise money for myself - he was in the shop when I took the black trousers and two waistcoats; I did not tell him what I wanted the money for - he was to have part of the amount he got for the goods; there was no bargain made that he was to have any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master found you out, and on his pressing you to name somebody who was concerned, you named the prisoner? A. Yes - the prisoner never told me I might take money of master's, and charge it to him as paid on account.</p>

On the 17th of November, I was standing in my shop, and saw a man at my window; I looked very hard at him, as I thought he meant to rob me - I went and removed every thing from the door; I then shut too my folding-doors, and lighted the gas; I went into my parlour and sat down - I then saw my shop-door very gently open; I rose up expecting it was a customer, went forward and saw a man stooping down, taking some plates; he ran away - I went to the door, and cried Stop thief! and then I saw the prisoner. (who was the man I first saw at the window) standing at Dr. Sharpe's, four doors from my house - Dr. Sharpe's boy came and asked what was the matter; I said I had been robbed again - he went and told his master, who sent for an officer. I described the man I had seen at my window - he came and brought these eight plates the next day, which, from the pattern, I believe to be mine; I have no mark on them - I did not see any thing in the prisoner's hand in the street; I first saw him between four and five o'clock.</p>

I found this bacon, cheese, and soap - the officer said she must be searched; she then opened her gown, and in her bosom we found this other pinafore; they are blue pinafores with a white speck - and under her feet we found this pair of pockets, which I had worn on the Sunday; I am sure it was not there before she came in, for I had been sitting there all the evening - she was very much intoxicated, and was taken to the watch-house; I found her in tea and sugar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. What time did she go out? A. About eleven o'clock in the morning; when she returned she went up stairs to pull her bonnet off, and then came down again; I found the pockets in front of the chair where I had been sitting - there is nothing particular in this cheese or bacon - there might be more like it; I allowed her about 2lbs. of soap for washing, and if she wanted more she had it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you ever give her the bacon for the use of the house? A.Whatever she wanted for the house she always had; there is no mark on the pinafores; my children made them; I had a dozen of them.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q.Had not the prisoner the care of the dirty linen? A. She washed her own things with mine - they might have been mixed in the drying; when we found these things, she said she meant to give them to a poor creature.</p>

            . The prisoner was in my service to nurse my wife, and to do domestic work; she was in my regular service from the 4th or 5th of September, to the 14th of November - I had the greatest confidence in her; I have looked at these articles, and, to the best of my belief, they are mine - I can swear to this spoon, and these sheets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you present when she was taken up? A. Yes, Sir; Mrs. Smith is very ill, and has been in a bad state of health for years; she has kept her bed from the 4th of September - the prisoner did say Mrs. Smith sent her to pawn them, and that she had given Mrs. Smith the duplicates, but my wife denied it; the prisoner did not deny pawning them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the prisoner ever taken to your house? A. No; the articles were pawned in three different names.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mrs. Smith knew of my pawning the things, to get various little things which Mr. Smith did not allow her, grapes, pastry, and liquor; if I had had millions of money, I might have laid it out for her; I laid out all my wages. and when I had no more, I thought it no harm to take various things to get them, till we could redeem them.</p>
               <p>MR. SMITH. I have every thing that is necessary in my house as a medical man, and many of these things were taken when my wife was not able to turn in her bed.</p>

My uncle and a young man were sitting in a little recess, playing at cribbage; the prisoner took up a telescope - I had my back to the till; the prisoner was by my side, looking through the telescope; it is a house of pretty much business - it was daylight; I am not the only person who has access to the till; sometimes my uncle goes to it, and sometimes Mr. Biggs, who was in the house them - all money taken from customers is thrown in the usual way, into this till; the till is opened every time money is put in; it never happened to me, in the hurry of business, to leave that till open; I never saw the prisoner till the Sunday before - he was in the bar; he appeared a very respectable man; after I took the money from him, and my uncle had sent for an officer, he said it was his own money - he had a glass of gin before dinner, and paid my uncle for it; when there is about one pound of silver in the till, I take it out; I had taken out change for a sovereign, and left only some sixpences in; I then took 4s. of a gentleman, and put that in - the prisoner was not given in charge then; my uncle could not find an officer, and he turned him out, and told him to go about his business; he was not struck and ill-used, neither in the house nor out of the house, to my knowledge; he returned in the evening, of his own accord, with two officers - I did not hear him desire my uncle, if he had any charge, to give him into custody; my uncle went up stairs with them - I was in the bar.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long before had you been at the till? A. Ten or twelve minutes; I heard the till open, and took the money from the prisoner's hand.</p>

            . I keep the house; the prisoner came into my bar, took up the telescope, and went to the window, near the till; I was sitting in a recess, in conversation with a young man; I saw my niece rise hastily from her seat, and challenge the prisoner with taking money out of the till - I rose up, and saw my niece take four 4s. 6d. from his hand; I called out, "Send for an officer!" but an officer could not be found - I kept the prisoner some time, and then told him to go about his business.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What were you doing? A. I was having a game at cribbage with a person in the recess; my niece sat with her back to the prisoner - she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040043"/>could not see him as she sat; she was sitting partly with her back to the till: after my niece took the money from his hand, he said it was his own; he had paid for a glass of gin and water about one o'clock - he gave me a shilling, and I gave him a sixpence; I did not notice whether he had any more silver in his hand; this took place about three o'clock; he returned with two Police officers in the evening, and said, if I had any charge, to give him into custody - that was not said in the presence of my niece; they went up stairs with me; I did not ill-use the man, and call out to a mob outside that he was a thief - two of the persons who ill-used him have been punished for it; I made my complaint against the prisoner on the 21st of November; I went to the office to answer a charge he made against me - he summoned me up for 4s. 6d.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.When did you take him before the magistrate? A. On the 21st of November; I knew the whole of this transaction from my niece; I did not make an accusation against him till I came before a magistrate, because I was aware of the expense and trouble of it.</p>

On the 4th of November, three young men came into the shop one after the other - the prisoner was the last of them; they took no notice of each other - the first one wanted to look at some shoe-ribbon, the second at some silk handkerchiefs, and the prisoner asked to look at some riding-belts - while I was serving the second person, I saw the prisoner take some handkerchiefs, and put them into his hat; I kept him while I served the second, and then shewed him the belts; he selected one, left 1s. on it, and said he lived in Sydney's-alley; I let him go out, then pursued, and brought him back - I found fifteen handkerchiefs in his hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Why did not you seize him directly you saw him take them? A. Because I had no one in the shop; there was a lad in the parlour who had served the shoe-ribbon, but he was in the parlour while the prisoner was being served - my master<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040044"/>is not here; I cannot tell whether it was one of the other men's hats the prisoner took, but he was the only one who pulled his hat off.</p>

            . I am a waiter at the Hope and Anchor public-house, Waterloo-street, Hammersmith. I went out with my beer on the evening of the 12th of November, and saw Ledgerwood about one hundred and fifty yards from Mr. White's, with a tub on his shoulder - I had known him before as a rush basket-maker; he passed my master's door, and was going the same way with me - I had my lantern, and walked on alongside of him about twelve or sixteen yards; there was a little mud and siush in the road and he went right through it; I said, "Halloo there, you will get into it presently!" he said, "Don't say nothing" -I still kept on by the side of him to the bottom of the lane, but as I was going to turn to the left I saw a young man -I put down my beer, and went to him; Ledgerwood went on - I then heard the tub fall; I thought he had thrown it down and gone away - I went to see, and he was alongside of the tub; I said to him, "What, can't you carry it?" he said it was so heavy; as I was turning away to go to the young man, who lives at the Windsor Castle public-house, some one down the lane called out Canter, or some such name, and Ledgerwood answered; the other one then said,"Where are you?" and Ledgerwood said, "Here I am-come on" - I believe this to be the tub.</p>

            . I am a teller in the money office at the Bank of England. I have an entry made by myself on the 16th of October (it was about half-past nine o'clock in the morning,) of a 100l. note, (looks at one) this is it - it was presented to me to be changed for a 50l. note, and fifty sovereigns; there is "Matthew Riely, No. 11, New Turnstile, Holborn, on the front of it - I wrote that myself; it is usual for the person bringing the note to write the address, but I wrote it on this occasion - the same address is on the back of it, but the word "Stile" is punched out, that was on it when it was presented, and I wrote the same on the front, being afraid the address would be punched out - I copied it from the back, the front being the proper place to put it; I gave a ticket on the pay-clerk for a 50l. note, and fifty sovereigns.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose it is usual to take the numbers of the notes for which you give change? A. No; we only take the name, and what notes we give for them -I do not think I wrote this address in the presence of the person who brought it.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live at Nos. 41 and 42, in the Poultry. On the 16th of October, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to my shop; he asked me how I did - I said he had the advantage of me; he said, "Oh, you must recollect me very well at Mr.Lane's, Lincoln's Inn-fields" - I then recollected that I had seen him at Mr. Lane's; he said he had lost an uncle, and wanted a suit of clothes made that evening by eight o'clock - I said it was a short notice, but we could get them done; I booked the order for a blue suit of clothes; the whole dress was to be blue - I asked his name; he gave me the name of William Maxwell, No. 4, High-street, Bloomsbury - after writing his name and address down, I said he was almost a stranger to me, and I should like a little deposit: he immediately said, "Oh, deposit; they say pay before hand is very bad pay, but here is the money" - he had a large canvas bag with him, which appeared to contain fifty or sixty soverigns; the clothes came to 8l. - he then said he was going to America the next morning, and ordered some shirts, a travelling cloak, and all the articles together came to 17l. - I am a tailor, hosier, and glover; he paid me the 8l. first, and paid the rest to my brother in my presence - I wrote the address he gave me in the order-book - he was going away, and had nearly got to the door when he came back, and said, "I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040048"/>wish Collier you would give me change for these notes;" he produced two of 40l. and one of 50l. - I said I kept a banker's, and never kept so much money in the house; he then said, "Oh, any of your neighbours will change it for you;" I said, "No, if it is any convenience to you I will send the notes to the Bank for change" - he said it would be a very great convenience, and gave them to me for that purpose: I asked him to have the kindness to write his name and address on the top of the three notes - he then said his name and address were the same as he had given me in the order-book, and desired me to write it on the top of each note; I did so, and put 16th of October, 1828, and my initials - (looking at three notes) these are the three I received from him; here is one of 50l., No. 13,121, dated the 13th of September, 1828: No. 2,016, 40l., dated the 23d of July, 1828; and No. 19,802, 40l., dated the 21st of April, 1828 - I was going to give them to my foreman, but he said, "Oh, never mind the 50l., the two 40l. changed will be quite sufficient;" I then returned him the 50l. and gave the two of 40l. to my foreman, to take to the Bank and get sovereigns for them - he bought a canvas bag to put the sovereigns into which the man brought from the Bank, and he (the prisoner) left a bag behind him; on the following day I received this letter (looking at it): before he left, my man brought the sovereigns which were delivered to the prisoner - he put them into the new canvas bag, and took them away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner was dressed much as he is now, was he not? A. I cannot say - he ordered a blue suit; that was not a colour for mourning - that aroused my attention, and induced me to ask for a deposit</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was sent for on the 16th of October, and went to the Goat public-house, Pall Mall, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, and found the prisoner there - he was given in charge by the landlord; he was very much in liquor - I searched him and found a 50l. note, sixty-six sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and five shillings in silver on him, also some bullets, powder, and flints, and the landlord gave me a brace of pistols; I asked the prisoner about the property, he said it was the savings out of his wages - that he was going to Ireland to see his mother; I asked him name and address - he would not give me any name or address then, but at the watch-house he told me he was a clerk to Lane and Croft, of Lincoln's Inn-fields, and gave me the name of Riely - this is the 50l. note I found on him (looking at it); I laid it on the table in the parlour, and while I was counting the sovereigns be snatched the note up and tore it in pieces - we could not get it form him he was so violent; we found it on the floor at last - I am certain this is it, the landlord put his name on it in my presence; it has been pasted together, and I put my initials on it; it is No. 13,121, dated the 13th of September, 1828 - I did not see him write any note myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The landlord of the Goat sent for you? A. Yes; I found the prisoner sitting down there making a great noise - he appeared to be very tipsy; the landlord produced the pistols; I suppose I was twenty minutes in the public-house before we could secure him - he was so violent, kicking us, and knocking us down, and knocking the tables down - I, Smith and another man were in the room; the landlord did not interfere, he was so much alarmed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not think the prisoner out of his senses? A. He appeared like a man that was so, but I really think it was the effect of liquor - I had never seen him before; he did not cry out - he was so tipsy, that next morning he did not know me, nor the man who handcuffed him - he lay down on the floor, and kicked and fought; there were three of us endeavouring to secure him - he did not bite me - I believe he attempted to bite somebody; he kicked me very violently - his coat was not off; I found the bullets in his waistcoat-pocket, and the powder in a canister in his coat-pocket; there was a fire alight in the room - the flints were in his pocket; I did not see the pistols in his hand - they were loaded, and had flints in them; there were balls in the pistols - the powder is taken out - they were not cocked - I do not know whether they had been.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know whether he lived where he has endorsed his address? A. He lived in New Turnstile.</p>
               <p>Q. In his capacity of copying-clerk, had you any reason to find fault with him? A.Latterly, I had - his memory was particularly defective, and at times he conducted himself so strangely, I could not account for his conduct; he asked me, about a fortnight before this, to lend him 10l., and I gave it to him - I have had a letter from him since, in which he says he asked me for 50l., but I have no recollection of it; I may have refused him a loan, as he frequently asked to borrow money - about a fortnight before this transaction, I gave directions for his discharge from the office - he called on me early in the morning, and was nearly half an hour in my library, protesting that if I discharged him he would not exist - that it must be his death- that he could not live without a character, and if I would take him back he would serve me as a slave - he said this quite in a wild manner, sometimes laughing, and sometimes crying, and in a familiar tone, quite different to his ordinary manner of expressing himself - he alluded to some intimacy with my maid-servants, which I could not account for, and I suspected at first that he was in liquor- I at that time would not consent to take him back, having warned him a great many times, as well as my managing-clerk, that if he absented himself, as he had often done, he would not be retained in the office, and I had made up my mind not to take him back; I was then going out - he followed me into the hall, and appealed to my feelings in the strongest manner, asking me if I expected<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040049"/>mercy in Heaven if I shewed none here; he asked me to go back again to my room, which I did - he then went to the window, and putting his hand into his bosom, drew out a pistol, and solemnly commenced a sort of oath, declaring he would destroy himself if I would not take him back; I remonstrated with him - he had the pistol towards me, at that time, I approached to take it form him; he said in the most vehement manner "Beware, sir, it is loaded and cocked;" I afterwards ascertained that it was loaded and cocked - I told him I would not be intimidated, and ordered him immediately to uncock it, and stop it, which he did - fearing what might be the consequence of giving him a positive denial, I told him to come to my chambers at eleven o'clock, (this interview was about half-past eight in the morning, at my house) - I told him he must give me up the pistol before I could speak further with him: I knew he had an umbrella with a sword in it - previous to eleven o'clock, I went to where he lodged to satisfy myself if I could, of the cause which led to his present state of mind.</p>
               <p>Q.Then I suppose you considered his mind disturbed? A. At that moment I did, because I told him I could give him a character, as a copying-clerk, as a most excellent writer, in point of his hand-writing; I satisfied myself from my inquiries, and was at that time induced to think his regret at leaving my officer had been the immediate cause of his then state of mind - I believe he always had a great respect for me - he always expressed himself so to others; he came at eleven o'clock, certainly, in a different state, and in a state which he could not have been had he been in liquor at half-past eight - that was the impression on my mind, and as such I agreed to take him back, and lent him the 10l., he asked for, to pay some debt; he brought me a pistol at eleven o'clock, and said it was the one he had shewn me, and it seemed the same - it was then uncocked and unstopped, but was primed and loaded with balls.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your intention to discharge him arose from his absenting himself, and other causes,than the mode in which he did his business? A. Yes, for absenting himself, but his manner of writing was as good as ever.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. How long before he finally left you did this transaction take place? A. About a fortnight; he continued with me till within two or three days of the transaction in question.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What made him go away finally? A. He discontinued coming to the office of his own accord.</p>
               <p>Q. At any time, except the occasion you have referred to, did he give any indication of this sort of passion? A. I always thought him passionate and strange - I have endeavoured to persuade him to conduct himself in a proper manner, and he treated it with levity.</p>
               <p>Q. But previous to this interview in the library, was this strangeness, or his intemperance, of such a character as to induce you to suspect a derangement or aberration of intellect? A. No; I thought he had been among players- he would enter the room in a forced attitude, when I have rebuked him - I was never aware of his having been in the company of players - I have asked him, and he has denied it; his manner was theatrical.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mrs. Mitchell, of Lancaster-place, Waterloo-bridge - I have very frequently seen the prisoner near the house - he never called there to my knowledge; the last time I saw him was about two months ago, about four o'clock in the afternoon - he was on the opposite side of the way in the street, walking backward and forward, beating his breast.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you appear at the drawing-room window? A. Yes; I saw him take a pistol, or something from his bosom, and hold it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it held towards where you were standing? A. Yes; I stood at the window some time and then went out to him - he said he had come to wish me good by and presented the pistol - I said I was not alarmed; I knew him before; he said he did not wish to alarm me, but probably he should be a corpse before the following morning; he appeared extremely agitated - nothing else passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, from the conduct he exhibited to you, did you consider him in his right mind? A. I considered it extremely strange, and wrote him a note to say I thought it was bordering on insanity, as I thought so.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. How long have you known him? A. About eight months; I frequently saw him - he was making love to me; I had not refused him.</p>

            . I live at No. 17. Seymour-crescent, Somer's-town, and am clerk to an attorney. I have known the prisoner several years - he lodged with me once; I have not been on very familiar terms with him lately - he used to sleep with me; he lodged with my mother for about six months, and has occasionally slept with me afterwards: it was about eighteen months since, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040050"/>he lodged at my mother's - while he was there, at intervals his conduct was the very best, and at others the most extraordinary, in fact the must ridiculous; he has occasionally told me that if he could raise a sufficient sum of money, he could establish a title to a very large estate in Ireland- from the knowledge I had of his father and mother, I knew it was impossible, as their circumstances were quite the contrary to affluence; he very often, when lodging with me, would get up at two and three o'clock in the morning, and go stamping and fuming about the room, take off his night-cap and stamp on the floor; I have remonstrated with him, and he has said I did not know his mind, and could not judge his feelings - he said he was an object that the world had crushed; he would get out of bed in the middle of the night, and recite pieces from Hamlet, and from Richard - he always told me I could not tell what his feelings were; he frequently raved in this manner: I have remonstrated with him for spending his money in the most ridiculous manner, and told him his mother and father were objects of charity rather than of contempt, for he always spoke contemptuously of their poverty, not of their conduct to him - he has made no reply to my remonstrance that I recollect; he has frequently called out Murder! in the middle of the night, and when I have shaken him to awake him, he has seemed to imagine he was within the grasp of some superior force; and occasionally when he was awake he appeared to think so; at other times he would smile, and appeared to wish that I should not speak of such matters; his conduct has been so inconsistent at times, representing me, at one time, not his friend, and at other times as his best friend, as I have been told by others: I discontinued to visit him on account of his inconsistences, and I left the lodging - about four weeks ago, I met him going from Searle-street towards Great Tunrnstile - he was coming down from Holborn, and had the stick of an umbrella in his hand; he spoke to me - I rather crossed to get out of his way, when he stopped me, stamped his foot and called out "Villain!" I smiled at him, and rather laughed; he 
               <persName id="t18281204-120-person1051">drew</persName>
             a small sword-cane from the stick of the umbrella, and presented it at me directly - he put it up against my breast, I retired towards the wall and he followed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that he presented it at your breast, or thrust at you? A. He thrust it at me, put it towards me- I went to the wall and he advanced; I thought he was mad at the time, and asked if he had been drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought that he was not in his senses, either from liquor or some other cause? A.Exactly so - the point of the sword entered my waistcoat; he called me a villain, and said "When I have got you, I will have you on the hip;" what he meant I do not know - he said his hand had wreaked vengeance on villains before then.</p>
               <p>Q. From the conduct he evinced when you saw him then, and from his whole demeanor, do you believe that at times he was out of his senses? A. I do firmly.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. The last transaction happened in Searle-street? A. No, in Lincoln's Inn-fields, against the dead-wall, about eight o'clock in the evening - it was about four months ago to the best of my recollection; it did not make such an impression on me, as to enable me to speak to the time - it is about eighteen months ago that we lodged together; that was in Clement's Inn-passage, not at my mother's, but he occasionally came to my mother's to sleep - to the best of my recollection I ceased to lodge with him eighteen months ago - he represented that he was entitled to an estate, not that his father and mother bad got any money; I was not hurt in Lincoln's Inn-fields- I laid hold of the sword; and it ended with my laughing at him.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought him mad, and it ended in your laughing at him? A. Yes - I rather unconsciously retreated against the wall; I have been in the habit of taking meals with him - he was remarkably extravagant. but not at his meals; it was in other matters - I have seen him in liquor but not often; it produced rather a merry effect - (looking at a letter) this is his hand-writing.</p>

            . I am a law stationer, and live in Portugal-street; I have known the prisoner about four years, or rather more - I have been in the habit of seeing him very constantly, but not within the last eight or nine months; I saw him constantly up to that time.</p>
               <p>Q.During your acuquaintance, what has his conduct been? A.Extremely strange at times: what first excited my attention, was his manner of stamping about the room; he would often come up, and walk up and down the room for about five minutes, making use of different expressions, but take no notice of whoever might be there, and give no answers to questions which were put to him, and about two years ago he came into the room apparently intoxicated; I thought he was so when he came into the room - he laughed hysterically, and said he had some good news to tell me; he then burst into laughter, which lasted for some time, and then told me his father was dead; I spoke to him about it; he said, "You don't know my mind," it was impossible for any one to know his mind, and that he had secrets which would die with him; I met him about two months after that, at the bottom of Chancery-lane. passed close by him, and he did not notice me; I tapped him on the shoulder - he took no notice of that, but kept on; he must have known me if he had been in his senses; he proceeded through the Temple - I followed him; he stopped several times in the Temple, and put his hand up to his mouth, as if thinking of something; he stamped several times, and appeared in thought; I was not in sight, but watching him; he then went on, stopped in William-street, folded his arms, looked up toward the clouds, knit his brow, his eyes flashed, he bit his lips and grated his teeth, as if he was thinking of something desperate; I then went over to him, and said, "Riely, what is the matter?" he did not notice me at first, but afterward turned round, frowned at me, and asked why I disturbed him; he did not wait for a reply, but said he had just been spending a few of the happiest moments he ever had - I said I thought that he was drunk, and asked if he was drunk, or what was the matter with him; he made no reply, but stamped his foot, and said, "Say no more about it;" previous to my first speaking to him, he said, "I'll do it," throwing his arms down - I then accosted him. I remember meeting him in Portugal-street, fourteen or fifteen months ago, about our months after the time I have mentioned - he was walking very fast; I stopped him, and asked why he was in such haste, and where he was going - he replied, very abruptly, "Out of the world;" he spoke in a very agitated manner, and his countenance was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040051"/>very gloomy; he continued to say, "I am sick at heart - if you are my friend, leave me to my fate;" he has repeatedly spoken about suicide - I pressed him to go to my lodgings at this time, and he said that he thought he was born to be his own destroyer; he used to make suicide a general conversation - he often said it preyed on his mind that be feared his wits were deranged; that was last November twelvemonth - I was in the habit of seeing him frequently, till within this last eight or nine months - and from my observation of his conduct, I believe him at times to be out of his mind.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. You have seen him only occasionally for the last eight or nine months? A. No - he did not lodge with me - only visited me; he would quote from different authors, when he has passed up and down the room - he has not been an actor.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness; I have known the prisoner three years - he came to me one evening, about the 20th of September last, between six and seven o'clock; my husband was not at home - he came staggering in, as if some one was pursuing him; he appeared quite exhausted, much frightened, and looked very wild- I spoke to him first, and asked what was the matter with him; he said he was going to kill himself, and that he came to die there - that he must die in the course of three hours; he produced a pistol, laid it down on the table, and said it was loaded - he took it up, and shewed me that it was loaded with powder; this very much frightened me - he perceived that; he stamped about the room; I asked him if he would go, and after walking about the room about ten minutes, he went, and cried as he went away, and said he should never see me any more, wished me good by, burst into tears, and left - I had opportunities of seeing him before this occurrence, but never saw him conduct himself in an extraordinary manner before; that was the only opportunity I had of observing his conduct.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Do you happen to know whether this was when he had the disagreement with Mr. Lane, who was about to discharge him? A. I rather think it was - he said the pistol was loaded; he appeared overcome and agitated.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live in Clement's Inn-passage. I have known the prisoner nearly four years, he lodged with me formerly, and Redman lodged with him in another house in the same passage; the prisoner lodged twice with me about four months, and after that for about two years, and it is two years since he left me - my idea was always that he was not correct in his mind, certainly, from his odd behaviour; the first thing I observed was when he lodged with me he bought a sword stick, I thought not much of that, but at last he played with it like a child, he could hardly keep it out of his sight, and always had it out - I told him I thought it was not proper conduct, and then he said he would run me through with it; I did not conceive that he meant to do so, but I told him I would not have such a thing in my house; I took it from him, and broke it; and afterwards, some time before he left me, he bought an umbrella with a sword in it - I would not allow him to keep it in my house; he pledged it, and said he could have it out then at any time he wanted it; his conduct was never at all like a reasonable person - he would come in as gloomy as if he were going to drop into the grave the next moment, and a few minutes after would be laughing and cheerful - then change again to the very reverse; I do believe he was at times subject to fits of insanity.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Did you apply to any medical person about him? A. No, nor have him removed from my house.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Did you think his behaviour was affected or real? A. I did think it was real - he would sometimes affect it, and recite plays, and so on, but I believe it was real; I do believe it was the effect of a disordered mind.</p>
               <p>- WILLIAMS. I live at No. 50, Brunswick-street, Blackfriar's-road - I have been an eating-house keeper, but am not in business at present. I have known the prisoner eight or nine months last past - the latter part of that time his conduct has been extraordinary; on one occasion, he frequented my house to dine - that was about the 12th or 13th of September; I know the date, as I gave up my house on the 15th: on one occasion he came to my house, and took refreshment, after which, a baker who lived opposite came in - he then concealed a knife under his sleeve, and went out; I followed him - he then shewed me the knife, and said "Why dare that rascal enter the house;" I said "Riely, pray put the knife down - don't conceal it in that manner;" he then came into the house again, and in a short time the baker left the house; Morell, who had lodged with me six months, came in - he looked at him in a most varacious manner - he went, and caught hold of a large carving-knife, presented it to the lodger's breast, and asked him if his life was not in imminent danger I at first thought it was a joke, but I was obliged to interfere - I never saw a man look so wild in my life - I was obliged to get the lodger to bed: he was not drunk; in the early part of the time I knew him, he conducted himself well, and dined up stairs among respectable persons - he would come down to the shop to order his dinner - he would pat his head before he could recollect what to order- I told him what I had got, and he would at times order his meat, and say "Bring me all the vegetables you have," and at times he would say "Bring me all you have" - not saying vegetables; persons in the room have observed that, and made remarks about it within a week of the time I gave my business up; I believe his conduct to be the result of an unsettled mind: on the same evening (I think) he was going out, he followed me about a dozen yards, and said"Williams, I shall never like a woman again" - speaking in rather a troubled hurried, manner; I parted with him as soon as I could; his conduct at last very much alarmed me; I did not like to disturb the neighbourhood by calling the watch, as there was another man present when he presented the knife, and I thought no harm could come.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did he lodge in your house? A. No - it was not him I wanted to get to bed, but my lodger; I prevented the prisoner from getting at him - he tore his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his saying, he should never like woman again, make you think him mad? A. No - his presenting the knife, and his manner generally, and the manner in which he said he never should like woman again - he turned and spoke to me in the most abrupt manner; I was no acquaintance of his.</p>

            . I keep the King's Head public-house, Pall-mall - it was formerly the Goat. I was subpoenaed here about an hour ago - I remember the prisoner coming to my house on the day he was taken; I had never seen him before - he came a few minutes after one o'clock,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040052"/>passed by the counter, and asked if he could dine; I said he could have a steak or chop - he said, "Let me have rump steak and a bottle of sherry, and I shall be proud and happy of your company;" I said I was obliged to him, but I did not drink sherry so soon - I went up stairs to dress, and when I came down, he again sent for me to drink a glass with him; I apologised and declined: he went away, and came again about seven o'clock, and said,"You would not do me the favour to drink a glass of wine with me before, but I shall be happy to drink with you now" - I said I was not found of sherry, but would drink a glass of weak brandy and water, which he ordered; on sitting down he pulled out a note, and asked for change of a 50l. note - I said the people had all shut up, and I could not get change; he said, "Well, drink your brandy and water, and I will be back directly - I am going to Egg's;" he went out, came back, ordered a bottle of port, threw a brace of pistols on the table, and again threw the note on the table: I said, "Really, from the manner you have behaved with this note, I should think it is not a good one"- he said, "You villain, I will blow your brains out," and raised the pistol to me; I caught hold of him, knocked his arm on one side, and caught him by the neck handkerchief - the servant came to my assistance, and the patrol was called in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you believe at the time he was going to shoot you? A. From my not knowing him before, I really cannot say; the officer examined the pistols afterwards - they were both loaded; he was sitting close to me on the same seat when he presented them - he brought them in openly in his hand; I have inquired at the gunsmith's, and found he had changed another pair of pistols for them - he is a very powerful man.</p>
               <p>Q. From what you saw on that occasion, do you think the man was in his senses? A. I should think not, for he could not escape if he had shot me - he must have been taken immediately; he had taken part of a bottle of sherry at one o'clock, and in the evening I do not think he tasted the brandy and water, but believe he drank a glass of port.</p>
               <p>Q. That was not enough to produce such conduct as the effect of liquor? A. I should think not.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q How many times was he in your house that day? A. Three - on the first occasion he had a bottle of sherry, of which two other persons partook, I understand so from my servant, but was not present; he was absent from two till seven o'clock - he did not apply to me to change the 50l. note on the first occasion, but he did to my wife, as she told me; he applied to me at seven o'clock, before he went out, and again when he came back with the pistols.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he earhest with you to procure change for the 50l. note? A. Yes - he said he was going to Ireland next morning, and that the note was of no value there; I told him it was as good there as in England, and on my intimating there was something wrong, he jumped up with the pistols; I do not suppose he would have presented them if I had not said that.</p>
               <p>The letters identified as the prisoner's writing, were as follows: - </p>
               <p>To Mr. Collier, Nos. 40 and 41, Poultry,</p>
               <p>Sir - Be so good as to send my bag, and the articles I bought of you to the Police-office, Marlborough-street, immediately, and ask for Mr. Riely; my name was not Maxwell, but Riely.</p>
               <p>Friday, 1 o'clock.</p>
               <p>To - Gates, Esq. Solicitor, Lombard-street Newgate, Nov. 1, 1828.</p>
               <p>Sir - I have to request that the clothes which I purchased of Mr. Collier may be delivered up to me, as I am here without even a change of linen; I cannot anticipate that my prosecutors will offer any objection, indeed I have every reason to think, that had I mentioned my wish before the Magistrate yesterday, it would have been complied with, and he (by the officer) sent me word, that had I mentioned it when they were there, he would have seconded my request, and he authorised me to say as much; of course the purchasing the clothes, and the forgery are two distinct things, and as I am committed for the capital offence, I trust that you will not think it necessary to detain the clothes from me; I would also mention, which I beg you will state to my prosecutors, that I have not even the means of employing a solicitor for me at my trial, begging an answer at your convenience. I remain, Sir, your most obedient servant, MW. RIELY.</p>

            . Q.Is it your opinion, from what you have related, that he was subject to occasional aberrations of intellect, or that he was always so? A. Subject to attacks - I have seen him at times perfectly himself.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Were you acquainted with the reason of these attacks? A. No - he never would tell me.</p>

               <p>Q. His behaviour was not such as to lead you to suppose his intellect was deranged? A. No, certainly not; I have seen the cheque - I should not say that it was an imitation of Messrs. Lane and Co.'s signature.</p>

Not at all - I cannot state whether any words passed between us; I think it very probable that I asked him in what notes he would take it- I observed the cheque, and imagined it to be the handwriting of Messrs. Lane and Co., or I should not have paid it; the cheque is dated the 15th - it was presented on the 16th.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time you had him at the door was any other person near you? A. No one: while I was in the act of lifting the latch to open the door, I received a stab, but what with I do not know; previous to my getting him to the door, he held me by the collar of the coat with both hands, till we got to the door, and while I was in the act of lifting the latch he let go his hold altogether; and the door being locked and latched, while I was trying to open it, I received a stab - I left something prick me very sharply; I did not see the prisoner do any thing with his hands, as my head was turned towards the door: when I first removed him from the bar, he had some money in his hands - he put it into his pocket, and seized me by the collar; the other persons were about six feet from me at the time - I have measured it since; there was no one else near enough to have done it - I kept my hold of him all the time, and got him out at the side-door, which leads into a coach-yard; two brother watchmen and a patrol came to my assistance - I found blood running down my thigh; I moved my hand down, and found my fingers all over blood - the patrol and watchmen asked me what was the matter; I said, "This rascal has stabbed me!" I found my clothes had been penetrated - I turned them up, and saw blood gush out from my shirt - here is the shirt I had on, and my watch coat also; there is a hole in it corresponding with she wound in my side: I gave the prisoner in charge of Lyons, and gave the two young men who were with him in charge also - they were taken to the watch-house: I went to a surgeon, and got my wound dressed; I returned to my beat, and remained there the rest of the night.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were the two when your face was towards the door, as you were endeavouring to unfasten it? A. About six feet from me; I could see them - they were not behind me - I held the prisoner with one hand, and the men were sideways while I was opening the door; they used the utmost exertion to get him from me, till I got within six feet of the door - there was nobody at the door but me and the prisoner when I received the stab; I said the others were within three or four feet of me, but I have since measured it - he was examined three times; I said at all those examinations that it was three feet - I had not then been to the house; I did not measure the place till after the examinations: there was no rush forward at the time the door was being unfastened - the attempt to rescue was at the further end of the bar; they tried to rescue him from the bar, and have been held to bail for it: I went and knocked a surgeon up - he dressed my wound, and I returned to my beat; I have been on my duty every night- there was no occasion for me to be confined: the attempt to rescue was a long time before we got to the door- the waterman took off one, and I got rid of the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you got to the door these men were quiet? A. Yes, and I afterwards gave them in charge; the prisoner held me by the collar, with both hands, all through the piece, till I came to the door - he had a kind of white frock-coat on, not a great coat; it was buttoned up: this is a watering-house.</p>
               <p>MR. SMITH. Q. You took him in charge by request of the landlord? A. Yes, I took him out at his request; I was perfectly sober, and he appeared so.</p>

            . I am serjeant of the watch. I was on duty on the morning of the 17th of November, between one and two o'clock in Holborn, and hearing a noise. I went into the Coach and Horses; I found Baker and the prisoenr there - the first word I heard Baker say was, "I am stabbed!" he said to the prisoner, in a short time, "Come forward - you are the villian who has stabbed me; you know you are;" I did not hear the prisoner make any reply - if he had I think I must have heard it; I gave him into the hands of Lyon, another watchman - I cannot say whether he had a knife about him; I was not more than five or six yards from him, when the prosecutor told me he had stabbed him: after Baker gave him in charge he knocked at the public-house door, went in, and called me in - there were two men standing at the bar; he gave them in charge. I afterwards went to the watch-house - we searched all the three men; I found no instrument on the prisoner - I returned with Stiggell to search for the instrument Baker had been stabbed with; the house was shut - I knocked, and Scarf opened the door; I got a light, and found a knife in the passage, between the door and the end of the bar, not two feet from the door - it has two blades; one was open: the prosecutor examined it by the light at the watch-house, and pointed out one spot on one side of the blade - it appeared to be blood, and next day I examined it more particularly; it appeared to be blood, dried, on one side of the knife: I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040054"/>saw the cut in Baker's clothes, and saw blood come from the wound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time did you get there? A. About a quarter-past two o'clock; the prisoner was then in custody - I saw nobody but two watchmen there; I should think it is not more than six feet from the end of the bar to the door; the place where they usually drink is five, six, or eight yards from the door, I should think - I found the knife between the end of the bar and the door; the door opens to the left, and immediately behind it was the knife: I did not hear the prisoner say he could not have done it, as he had no knife - Lyon had got hold of him; my attention was attracted another way - I might be four or five yards off.</p>
               <p>MR. SMITH. Q. What do you mean by the place where they usually drink? A.That is opposite another door; I entered at a side door.</p>

I was on duty in Holborn - I went to the public-house, and found Baker with the prisoner in custody, close to the door, outside the house; I saw blood on Baker's under clothes - he said he had been stabbed, and that was the man who stabbed him; he was given in charge - I went to the watch-house with the three; I returned to the public-house with Davis and saw him find the knife, with a large blade open, within two feet of the door.</p>

            . My brother, who is dead, kept the house - I live there at present; on the morning of the 13th of Novemeber I fetched Baker there, because the prisoner and several of his companions were tossing - the landlady and I requested them to leave; they refused - I desired the watchman to clear the house; I desired him to take the prisoner, as the most outrageous among them - he said,"You must go out, clear the house," as near as I can recollect; they refused to go - Baker seized the prisoner by the collar - the prisoner seized him, and then there was a general struggle; Baker kept hold of him, and took him to the door - when they got to the door I am certain there was nobody within six feet of them; they struggled a short time at the door, and eventually the watchman took him out - nothing happened at the door that I knew of; after they went to the watch-house Davis and another came back - nobody had been to the house from the time the prisoner was taken till they came back; nobody could have put a knife there between those times.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I take it for granted you saw the whole from beginning to end? A. Yes, in the house; I put the gas out to make them leave off tossing - that was before Baker came; it was lighted then - I did not hear the landlady ask Cole to light it - I do not know who lighted it; there was a candle burning in the bar - the prisoner and three or four more were at the bar when I went for the watchman; they belonged to the prisoner's party - I cannot exactly say how many there were; I told the Magistrate there might be six - there were more than the prisoner and two others - they all remained there till the watchman came; I recollect nothing about a rush towards the door when Baker was lifting the latch - he seized the prisoner by the collar of his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he seize him by the breast? A. Not till there was a general scuffle among the whole of them, then he first seized him.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Lamb's Conduit-street. On the morning of the 13th of November Baker came to me; he had a superficial wound on the right side of his abdomen, which I dressed - it appeared to have been done by some sharp instrument; I have seen the knife produced and his clothes together, and undoubtedly the wound might have been inflicted by such an instrument; the outer coat was extremely thick - it penetrated only one fold.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was a superficial wound? A. Yes - it had hardly passed into the integuments - it was a perfect cut, which you would ordinarily inflict on your finger; I put a piece of plaister on it, and afterwards put another piece on.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Gibson, a baker, who lives in Grenville-mews: the prisoner is my fellow-servant; I went to the Coach and Horses with him on this night - there might be eight or nine there with us drinking together - I did not see the tossing - I had my back against the settle; Scarf put the gas out, to get the house cleared - at the time the watchman was sent for, the whole eight or nine were about the bar; the watchman took the prisoner somewhere by the neckcloth, and dragged him away very violently; I look upon it, it must have gone so far as almost to strangle him - the prisoner resisted as well as he could; three or four more stood behind; there was a rush altogether towards the door - they all went to the door together.</p>
               <p>Q. At any time, while you were there, were the watchman and prisoner struggling together, away from the others? A. No - they were altogether when the watchman got out of the door, and complained of being wounded; Cole has been six or eight months in Gibson's service - I never saw him with a knife in my life, and have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040055"/>reason to believe he had none, for I have known him borrow one of master to cut the washers for his wheels; he had his coachman's coat on, and it was buttoned.</p>
               <p>Mr. SMITH. Q. What colour was his coat? A.A drab one; my only reason for saying he had no knife, was his having borrowed one - during no period was he and the watchman separate from the rest; I persist in swearing that; I am a glass coachman, and was never here before.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 30th of November, at half-past eleven o'clock, I was standing in King-street, Seven-dials, and heard a call of Watch! repeatedly - I was about fifty yards from Queen-street; I went up as quick as possible; the prosecutrix said,"Watchman, it is a very hard case that I should be knocked down and robbed;" I asked where the person was, could she point him out - she said No, he is not here; I ran a few yards further and picked the cloak up; I went further down and she called Watch! again, and said, "He is gone this way;" I asked if she should know the man - she said "Yes, he has got a cast in his eye;" I went and knocked at Ward's door, knowing him before: he lives on my beat - his mother let me in; I found him in bed undressed all but his shirt; Milton said he was the person - I think he squints; she said her cloak was gone, but did not say how it went from her - she said she was knocked down and robbed - she claimed the cloak.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How soon after she complained of being knocked down did you go to the prisoner's house? A.About ten minutes, to the best of my knowledge; I found him comfortably in bed; the prosecutrix saw him undressed - I was not going to take him out of bed unless she said he was the person; she did not tell me what she had been robbed of - Watch! was called with a load voice - I cannot say it was her that called; she said she had called; I did not see the prisoner till I saw him in bed: I picked up the cloak in King-street, about thirty yards from his house - I did not see Williams to know her, there were so many people about - I could not be less than five minutes going up to her; there were then forty or fifty people assembled.</p>

            . I saw all this row - I was coming home from work about eleven o'clock at night, and these two young women were before me - I live in Great St. Andrew-street, Seven-dials; I am cook at an eating-house - I saw these two young women at the corner of Queen-street, and both appeared as if they were quarrelling with each other; one asked leave of the other to lie her cloak, and she said she would not let her; Ward was coming by, and one of them laid hold of him by the arm, I cannot say which, I was not near enough to tell - she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040056"/>said something to him, and he resisted going with her; she would not let him go - he turned round, and rather shoved or knocked her down, I do not know which; she fell - she ran after him, and swore she would be d-d but she would have him, and the cloak fell off her shoulder; she called him a cock-eyed ***; she called Watch! the watchman came and picked the cloak up.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of the young women it was you could not tell? A. No; they were both quarrelling among themselves at first - the cloak was picked up about thirty yards from the prisoner's house; I have not heard the evidence which has been given - I do not know where the watchman went, for I went home; Seven-dials is generally full of women on all sides.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the watchman by at the time she called him these scandalous names? A. I do not know whether he heard it, he was coming up - after she ran after him she called him these names, and then she called the watch; the women were both quarrelling - I only saw one of them knocked down - I was about ten yards from them; I was there when Ward first came up to them; I only saw him strike one - I will swear he did not strike them both; I have seen both the women before, but never spoke to them; I live in the same neighbourhood with Ward.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live in the same house? A. Yes I did, but not at this time; and these girls lived in the neighbourhood at that time - it was about four years ago; I first heard of his being taken up last Monday; about half-past eleven o'clock I went to the office, but was too late to get in.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed when these two women laid hold of him? A. I do not know - but he resisted, and pulled his arm away; she would not let him go - they were both very much in liquor, by their appearance and their discourse.</p>
               <p>Q. What discourse? A. Why they called him a cock-eyed *** - and I dare say they wanted him to go with them; I know they did not get their living honestly when they lived in the same neighbourhood as I did four years ago.</p>
               <p>JAMES DUNN re-examined. They did not appear to be drunk - I could not see the least appearance of it; I did not know them before - if they had been loose women about that neighbourhood I must have known them - I know Collins, but did not see her there; I did not hear either of the witnesses use any indecent language.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Did either of them mention a cast in his eye? A. Yes; they said he had a cast in his eye; Collins might have been there and I not see her.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Which way were you going? A. Towards Fleet-street; I became a prisoner about ten days after; I had come straight from the New Inn; I had drank nothing that day - I did not go to see the show, but was out on busines, and on the Fleet-market side; he followed me and tripped me up; there was a great crowd and confusion - I did not fall from the pressure of the crowd, but was tripped up; I felt his hand in my pocket - he was behind me; I did not count the gang, but the officers and several people said there were seven; the crowd did not push me down.</p>
               <p>Q. The man who tripped you up was behind you - how do you undertake to swear it was the prisoner? A. I looked him in the face just after I was down - there was a great crowd near me.</p>
               <p>Q. And seeing him, you conclude he is the man who tripped you up? A. Yes; he was taken immediately and searched, but no property found.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see the prisoner from the time his hand was in your pocket? A. Yes, immediately I was lifted up; I did not see his face at the time his hand was in my pocket; only when I was lifted up.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then he did not, in your presence, charge him with the robbery? A. No - I took him from seeing him near his person; it was between five and six o'clock, and nearly dark.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was at the corner of Fleet-market about half-past five o'clock, and saw Mr. Prater; I saw the prisoner with several others pushing about in the crowd - they were not going on, but remained nearly in the same spot; as soon as a throughfare was made, by the oxen passing, I heard Prater call out that he was robbed - he was then on the ground, and the prisoner kneeling down by his side on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040057"/>one knee; I went up and saw the prisoner draw his hand from the prosecutor's pocket - I laid hold of him immediately, and the others I believe went off, but I took the prisoner away directly; he was searched afterwards, but nothing found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there any body in the crowd that was not pushing about? A.Certainly - they were all in motion, trying to go on, but they were stationary; they could not get on for the oxen - I might be two yards from Prater when he was knocked down, but I did not see it; he was down before he called out, and was surrounded immediately he fell - I pushed through them; I was behind him - the prisoner was down on one knee by the right-hand side of me, and on the right side of the prosecutor, who was on his back; I was to his left, and saw the prisoner draw his right hand from his right-hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say he drew his hand from his pocket, or out of it? A. From it - I cannot swear his hand was in it.</p>
               <p>Q.Was he not down assisting the man up? A. I cannot say, but I do not think he was; there was a gas-light - I did not seize him by the hand, but by the collar; I saw his right hand distinctly, but saw nothing in it - my brother officer was on the right-hand side of him; I do not know which of us got up first.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at work till twelve o'clock that day, and said to my wife I should like to go and see this show, because they talked about Gog and Magog; I went - there was nothing of that; I was returning when this officer came and took me, and said I had robbed a man; I was going home, only the beasts coming by made me stop - I was brought up on the Tuesday morning; the prosecutor said he could not swear to me, he believed I was the man, and on the Saturday he swore I was the man, by the officer's persuasion.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 11th of November, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I was passing these premises, and hearing the door shut too, and knowing the men had left work, I looked through the board, and saw the prisoner shutting the door - this bundle was lying down by his side; I said "What are you doing?" he said "Shutting the door:" I said "Does Mr. Brass know you are here at this time?" he said "Yes, and if you will go with me, he will satisfy you;" I said "What have you got in this bundle?" he said "Bits of wood," but I found it was lead - he endeavoured to escape, but I secured him; I saw the lead fitted - it matched exactly.</p>

            . I am a patrol. A few minutes before nine o'clock, I saw the prisoner come out of the door with a small cask on his shoulder, and a shovel - I followed him into Hart-street, and then stopped him, and asked what he had got there - he said, a small bag of composition, and what were his working tools; but I found it was a shovel, this lead, and a lock; I took him to the watch-house, and asked who he worked for; he said he could not tell me his master's name, nor where he lived; I asked if his employer ordered him to take away the lead; he said No, and I detained him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in his defence, entered into a long detail of the work he had performed, and stated that as the lodgers were removing, he thought it was best to remove the lead for safety.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The shoes were given me by different Overseers. I applied to the different monthly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040060"/>Overseers, and was mostly employed in the wardrobe; and my wife was employed at her needle; she often had shoes made her a present of - if she had not, I should not have been able to have kept her and my children; some of them were pawned because I got others, and raised money on them to suport my family; some of these never belonged to the house, though they have been mended with leather from the house. I had been employed in cutting, and the gentleman, who has the management of the house, said I must learn to make shoes, which I said I was willing to do. I have a wife now sinking in a decline, and five infant children.</p>

On the 14th of November, I saw two boys looking in at the window - they kneeled down, and one, less than the prisoner, took a pair of boots; the prisoner, I believe, was looking in at the window at the time - they went on with the boots, and I told Hayward, who ran out, and saw them - I believe the prisoner is one; he was dressed like a sailor, and had the same things on at the office - he was not dressed as he is now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you swear to my face? A. No - but I swear to the dress, and did so when I saw him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I heard the cry of Stop thief! and followed the prisoner - I saw these boots thrown away in Earl's-court; I took them up, and put them into the shop - Hayward still followed the prisoner, and I saw a gentleman stop him; he had sailor's clothes on - I had seen him and another lad together about three minutes before the boots were taken; another person stopped the little boy with the boots - the prisoner went to knock him down, and knocked his hat off.</p>

            . I live at No.8, Market-street, Fitzroy-market. I was anxious to know the truth respecting the stealing of the coat, hearing what was reported, and I called to Hawkins, who was standing with a lot more boys, and said "Is your name Hawkins?" he said Yes; I said "What is it respecting this coat, that my lodger has been said to steal?" he said "Yes, I have sworn to him; and my mother and brother say I must stick to it;" I said "The officers are after another person;" he said "I have only sworn to one, and I shall have 3l. 16s. for it; and one is enough to transport:" he said"I hear he has a sister, who is very well off, and if any body would give me a little money, I would be out of the way, and not appear against him" - this was in my own parlour.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the prisoner lodging with you? A. Yes - I am his aunt; he has lodged sixteen months with me - I think it was on the Monday night - I was at my door and called this lad; I think he was throwing himself in my way - the coat was stolen on a Thursday, and I think this was Monday; he is a notorious character, and is about with bad boys at all hours - I never knew him in custody, and did not know him before; but I have heard of him, and knew his brother well; the prisoner was very unwell one day, and did not come down till between three and four o'clock - I said to him "John, how came you so late?" he said "I was not well;" he went out to go to his father's, and I saw him no more; but I heard the report, in a short time, of what had happened; I cannot say what day it was - Warren-street is about a stone's throw from my house. The prisoner works for his father, in the same market, within a few doors of me - his father pays his rent; I know nothing of the coat: I did not ask Hawkins who was to give him the 3l. 16s. - he said the officer told him so; his own brother told me he was an infamous character, and he would not be ruled by his mother or him, and he should give him up to himself</p>
               <p>ROBERT HAWKINS re-examined. Q. Were you in the parlour with Mrs. Wilday? A. I did not know that was Mrs. Wilday - I was in the parlour with her; I said somebody told me there would be 3l. 16s. for transporting the person, but I did not wish to have any money.</p>
               <p>COURT to JOHN BAKER. Q. How long were you absent? A. Not more than a quarter of a minute, or from that to half a minute; when I returned, the boy was there; I stood with my foot on the step, and inquired what there was to pay for the letter - I had the money in my hands; the lady told me what there was to pay; I paid in copper; I believe I asked as I stood at the door, and they said 4d.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I saw the prosecutor and prisoner, and went up and asked what they were doing there - it was a few yards from Feathers-court - they seemed to be arguing aloud; when I spoke to them the prosecutor gave charge of the prisoner for robbing him - I took her; she dropped five penny-pieces, which I picked up; we thought she had something in her mouth - I put my hand to her throat and she dropped the shilling out of her mouth; I then took her to the watch-house - she had a good way to walk, and I there saw the half-crown taken from her bosom.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did you find on her altogether? A. I found nothing on her - she dropped the shilling into my hand, and the watch-house-keeper found the half-crown in her bosom; the prosecutor did not say how much he had lost till he got to the watch-house - I will not be certain whether it was before or after the prisoner was searched, that he said he had been robbed - we had trouble enough in taking her to the watch-house- she kicked, and bit, and struck every person that came near her; she appeared very drunk, the prosecutor appeared perfectly sober; to the best of my belief he did not see me before I spoke to them.</p>

The prisoner was eight weeks in my service; I suspected her; and on Monday night, the 3d of November, I went up to her bed, while she was out, and between the mattress and sacking I found a bundle of articles of mine; I did not take it away - but on the following morning I sent her with a note to a friend, desiring them to keep her for an hour; I then went up to her bed and the bundle was gone - I could not find it any where; I sent for the constable - when the prisoner came back I accused her of robbing me, and asked ber to unlock her box; she went up stairs and attempted to open her box, but I believe I opened it myself, and I found the same bundle as I had seen it under the mattress; I asked her if that was all she had robbed me of; she admitted she had taken a table-cloth and some other things.</p>

I had a cart there, which I saw safe on the Thursday before I missed the springs and the axletree - that, I believe, was on the 20th of November; I left my cart all correct, in a field belonging to 'Squire Barry - it was not under a shed; the prisoner told me, several months before that, if he wanted a pair of springs and an axletree he should know where to go; I said, "If you rob me, you will rob a church" - these springs and axletree are mine, and belonged to my cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What do you know them by? A. They are two odd springs, and here is some of the grass upon them, worn as it came from the field - it is almost growing upon them now, upon my honour; Hadley is just beyond Barnet.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Monday morning, the 24th of November, I came up to Billingsgate, being a fishmonger, and one mile, from Barnet, I saw these things in a cart, lying in the King's highway - I took them up, put them into my cart, and went to market; I then went to Cow-cross-street, and saw an iron-shop, and thought I would sell them - this officer came in, and dragged me about like a dog.</p>

A staymaker; I never lived in the same house with him - I have never been on intimate terms with him; I deliberately swear that; I have known him about twelve months as a mere acquaintance, and no more - he brought me these things to pawn, and said they were his mother's; I work for Mr. Wilkie, and other persons - my sister lives with me - another young woman lived with me, but she has left; I have never heard of another young man who went to the prosecutrix's house; I cannot say positively whether I ever heard it insinuated that another young man, a friend of mine, went to the prosecutrix's house; I have not heard that he was there; I pawned the things in my own name.</p>

On the 20th of October, she went out in the morning to nurse, and I was in bed hardly sensible; the prisoner came in as a friend - I had known him before; he asked where my daughter was- I said nursing; the drawer was open, and he sat close to it, and out of it he took these things, but I did not perceive it; I saw him take hold of the cloak - I did not miss the things till he was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw him take them? A. I saw them in his hand; and I saw him wrap the boots in the shawl and the cloak at the street-door; I was at that time at the window; I missed the things, and went as far as I could go, and then I went to the window, and called out"Mr. Clark, you have robbed me - come back! come back;" I had been almost insensible from a pain in my head - my sight is not very good; I did not see any other man in the house, and never saw Hilton till I came into court.</p>

On the 8th of November, I had twelve bobbins of silk, a handkerchief, and some money, all tied up in a bundle; I was coming from the warehouse with it under my arm, about eight o'clock in the evening, and it was drawn from me; I was rather fresh - my master was out, and I had been drinking; the prisoner picked me up, and took me to the White Horse public-house, and, having been drinking a little, I lay my head down, and went to sleep - when I awoke. I missed my bundle; she and the bundle were gone - I suppose I slept three hours; I went there about eight o'clock, and came away about eleven or twelve.</p>

            . I am a Police patrol of Bow-street. On the 14th of November, in consequence of information, I went to a house in Jubilee-court, Parliament-street, Dogrow, Bethnal-green, in the County of Middlesex - the house consists of two rooms, one over the other, and a small shed; there is an internal communication between the lower-room and the shed, and there is an outer-door to the shed - I went in company with Keys, Drew, and Messrs. Powells'; I went down the court and saw the door open - I ran into the house directly, and saw the male prisoner sitting at dinner; the female prisoner was there, another female, who gave her name as Hounsom, and a child - there is no passage, the door opens into the room; the male prisoner was sitting at a table at dinner and the female prisoner also, but Hounsom was sitting away from the table - I understand she is the female prisoner's mother; the room is very small - I said to the man "Coleman, what have you got in the house?" he said Nothing; I handcuffed him, and commenced searching the place - I left him in the custody of Keys while I searched the lower part of the place - the door of the shed leading from the room was ajar, about half a yard open; I went into the shed, and directly I got there I saw a tub with some straw in it - there was a donkey and some fowls in the shed; here is the tub with the straw in it, and in this piece of paper, under the straw, I found these moulds, which I now produce - they have the impression of a shilling on them; there is a mark of the letter T on one of the impressions - I afterwards saw a shilling produced, and that shilling corresponded with the mould, and had the letter T on it; I took care of the male prisoner while Drew and Keys went up with Rhoda to search up stairs - and while they were up stairs

             said," Thank God you have not caught me making any thing;" he repeated this again, and I said "No, you were sitting at your dinner" - he afterwards said,"Vann, tell me the worst they can do with me for having the things in my possession;" I said "You had better say nothing, it is a capital offence, you had better hold your tongue" - he stood still for a minute or two, and afterwards said, "Did you ever know any body hung for it?" I said,"There was a man convicted at Kingston;" he said, "Oh, you mean ireland, but he was not hanged" - he then said,"Well, I don't mind, if they send me and my old woman away;" there was a little scuffle with the prisoner - he was in a state of agitation; he pushed against the table and some things fell down, but I do not know that it was more than an accident - Drew came down and threatened him unless he was quiet, and went up again; when they all came down I commenced searching the lower room - I searched a cupboard by the side of the fire-place, and found a pipkin containing fused metal quite cold, but it had been fused, and on the floor of the cupboard I found a similar piece of metal and two tobacco-pipes, one of which had part of the same kind of metal in the bowl of it, and that pipe was black from the smoke of fire; I also found in the cupboard a pot containing some glass-paper and pieces of leather, and a piece of rag - they have been used with something of a white description; I found a tin canister in the cupboard that contained the paper and rags; I found a counterfeit half-crown and shilling in a canister on the mantel-piece over the fire-place - there was some matting before the fire-place; I examined that, and found several splashes of metal on it; they had fallen on the matting and adhered to it - I tore it off and have brought it here; I found in the room a file, which appears to have a particle of white metal in the teeth of it - the outer-door of the shed was closed; Drew examined that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.What time of day did you go there? A.Between one and two o'clock- the door leading from the room to the shed was ajar; there is another door which opens to the street - there was a donkey and fowls there; I found nothing in the shed which appeared to have been used with the metal, except the mould - there were no tinker's tools in the shed; there were such tools in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know he is a man who works in metal and travels the country? A. No; I had rather say nothing about that - I do not know it; I did not search his person - I should think it was about three yards from where he sat to the tub in the shed - directly on entering the shed the tub stood close to the threshold of the door: it might be four yards - he did not say the donkey and things in the shed did not belong to him; he said he was a costermonger, and got his living by the donkey - he did not say he had lent the donkey to any body; I had found the things before I had the conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Q. He said, "Well, you did not catch me doing anything, and so you cannot hang me?" A.Those were his words; that is part of what he said.</p>
               <p>Q. And afterwards, with the same danger before his eyes, he asked you the worst of it? A.Just so.</p>

            . I am a Police constable. I accompanied Vann and Drew to this house, at Bethnal-green; I entered at the front-door as Vann did; I stood and saw him handcuff the male prisoner - they were at dinner; I stood for a minute, and then Vann commenced searching- he looked into a cupboard first; he went into a shed, and called out to Mr. Powell and Drew; while they were bringing the tub out, I said, "Is that your donkey, Jem?"<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040075"/>he said, "The donkey is mine, Sir:" after that I went up stairs with the female prisoner, and Drew commenced searching the bottom of a cupboard, and found this basket, containing a quantity of charcoal and a quantity of bar tin: I searched the grate - there was no fire in it; I found among the cinders some bits of metal, which appeared to have dropped - it has the appearance of having been melted; I pulled the grate out, and behind that found a paper bag containing plaster of Paris - I found a tobacco-pipe on the grate, with some metal inside it, and some sticking about it - it appears to have been used to melt metal; the hole of it is filled with metal, so that nothing would run through; I found two knives on the top of the stove, with plaster of Paris on them, and I found a pair of furnace-tongs, which are used to lay hold of things in the fire; we found in the room a piece of tin, with grease on one side of it, and plaster of Paris on the other- I found a quantity of rags with plaster on them; while I was searching, I saw the female prisoner taking something out of a flower-pot - I asked what she had got there; she said only a few shillings, which she had got there unknown to her old man; I took them from her - they were three good shillings; one of them had some plaster or something sticking on it: I said I must search her - she pulled two shillings and two sixpences out of her pocket; they were good - she pulled out a tin box, which she opened, and there was a half-crown, a sixpence, and shilling, good money, in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You asked the man whose the donkey was? A. Yes; he said it was his own - he did not say he had lent it to any body, nor that he had lent the shed to any body, in my presence - there are a number of poor persons living about there.</p>

            . I accompanied the other officers to the house; I stood at the back part of the house till the prisoners were in custody; I then went round, and went into the shed with Vann - he went to the tub, lifted up the straw, took something out, and said, "What is this?" he gave it to Mr. Powell - I went up stairs, and found five Britannia metal table-spoons on a shelf; the shelf seemed to have white on it, as if wet had been put on it - plaster of Paris or something; I found several pieces of leather, and a knife with plaster of Paris on it, two old tooth-brushes, with the handles covered with plaster of Paris; I found a cup with some paper and powder in it, and sandpaper, which had been used, apparently, to rub white metal - I found the bottom of a plate with plaster of Paris on it; I also found a large piece of cloth, with drops of metal on each side of it - in the cupboard, I found four Britannia metal tea-spoons; I went down stairs, and saw a woman who goes by the name of Hannah Hounsom; I searched her, and found a purse, containing three sovereigns, a half-crown, a sixpence, and two shillings, all good; the prisoners were present at the time - she said it was her money, and before I asked her how she got it, she said,"The two shillings I took of my daughter, for making a shirt, which I brought home this day;" I have since looked at the shillings, and a mark, like the letter T, is on the head side of one of those shillings on the neck - I have that shilling, and produce it; while I was up stairs, I heard some words below - I went down, and asked Vann what was the matter; he said Coleman seemed very restless - I said, "Coleman, behave yourself as you ought to do, you will have nothing but civility from us; if you make any resistance, by G-d I will shoot you!" he said I might shoot and be d-d; he then addressed himself to Vann, and said, "You did not catch me doing any thing; you cannot hang me."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You found marks of white on the shelf - that might be whitening? A. It might; I found sand-paper, which had been rubbing white metal - not leather; leather is used to clean spoons, or metal goods, no doubt.</p>

            . I am an inspector of counterfeit coin: this mould is composed of plaster of Paris - there are the obverse and reverse sides of two shillings on it; it is made for casting two shillings at once - by the obverse side, I mean the head; I have seen the two shillings found on Hounsom - one of them has on the neck of the head a punch mark of the letter T; I have compared that shilling with one of the impressions on the mould, and there find a letter corresponding with the T on the shilling - I have no doubt the impression on the mould has been made with that shilling; the mould appears to me, from the discoloured state of it, to have been used - the discolouration would arise from pouring hot metal into it; I have seen another shilling, produced by Drew, and that appears to me to have made the other impression in the mould - there has been a crack in the die from which the good shilling was made, and there is a corresponding impression in the mould; they are both on the obverse side.</p>

               <p>MR. FIELD. This mould is capable of making the impression on both sides of the shilling, by the process of casting, and a very perfect one; both the obverse and reverse sides; I have compared the impression in the mould<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040076"/>with the two shillings, and have no doubt it was made from those shillings - the mould is capable of giving a very good impression of both sides of a shilling; they are the best I ever saw - I have examined the various articles produced by the officers; the greater part of them are such as may be applied to the process of casting, or making money - I have seen sand-paper and leather, which may be used to give it a brighter appearance after it has been cast, to render it fit for circulation; I cannot say much about this file having been used with white metal; here are some small pieces of glass-paper, which have apparently been used to metal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. All these materials are applicable to ten thousand other purposes? A. They might be used for other purposes - the impressions are quite white, but the mouth of the mould is discoloured, which I suppose to have been done by hot metal.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not the beat of the metal produce the same degree of discoloration in the impression? A. No; you might pour metal into it several times without producing discoloration on the impression, but the metal is at an increased heat at the mouth, but is much diminished as it goes down the channel; if it had been used very much, it would be more discolored, certainly; I do not swear, from the appearance of the impressions, that any shillings have been made by it - I rather think there has, by the general appearance, from the channel.</p>

            . I live in Jubilee-court, and know the male prisoner - he lives at No. 3; I do not know what trade he is, further than seeing him go out with a donkey, and with fruit; I know his house and shed, but was never in it much - his shed is open at all hours, day and night; I have seen it open at twelve o'clock at night and five in the morning; I have seen several people going in and out- he lent his donkey to Lyons, his next-door neighbour, who is a costermonger - he used to go to the shed - it was left open a good deal for the use of both parties; I never saw any thing carried into the shed.</p>

            . I live in Jubilee-court, next door to the prisoner - he frequently lent me his donkey for about seven weeks at times when he was not using it; his shed has an outer-door leading to the court; that was left open; the bolt was broken off about eight weeks ago: since that, it has been fastened with a nail just put through into the doorpost; I have seen it open, for the ass could open it by knocking his head against it, and I have had to go to the field to find the ass, as it has got out - I have gone into the stable to feed the ass.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you seen other people go in and out? A. I have seen people who I have brought with me go in.</p>
               <p>MR. ATKINSON. The prisoner was never employed by the Mint - he had no authority from the Lords of the Treasury, or any body else, to make money.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. FIELD. Q. Is it your opinion that the good shillings have been polished? A. The brightness on the shillings is produced by the plaster of Paris being on it; some spoons have been produced which are made of similar metal to that found melted.</p>

            . I live with my father, at No. 25, Queen-street, Spitalfields. On the 5th of November, at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040077"/>half-past nine o'clock in the morning, I was coming down Brick-lane, a young man snatched my cap off and ran into George-street with it, and there was a whole mob with a man - they had a young man with a mask on his face in the mob - there was no donkey then; they took the man up in their arms and carried him down George-street - and when they came to near the end of George-street they turned round another street, and round another at the end of that, and went up Hare-street-fields; they there met three or four young men coming with a donkey, and sat the man in the mask on it - they then went down towards Bethnal-green-road into Hackney-road, crossed there, and down some more turnings into Philip-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Well; did you see Mr. Brooks at any time? A. Yes; I was in what I think is called Hyde-place - a good many of them collected round him; some went on in front and came back again; they all turned to him, and John Quay struck him with a stick; I am certain of Quay's person; they all got round him, and I saw a young man put his hand to his watch and pull it out; I should know him again I think - it was not any of the prisoners; he took his watch, and then ran away across the bridge and down a place - I saw Wheeler there, he was round the mob and acting with them; I did not see him do any thing - he was among the men who were engaged about the prosecutor. I got my cap from the young man.</p>
               <p>Q.After the gentleman was robbed, what became of the party? A. They all went across the brick-field - they kept together while they were in my sight; I saw an officer and told him, and came to Worship-street with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there not a great many persons there? A. Yes, it was

            . I live in King's-row, close to the Rosemary Branch. I saw a Guy and the mob; I was close to Mr. Brooks with my little girl; I saw Mr. Brooks step out of the carriage-road on to the footpath out of their way - I saw the crowd rush against him, and I suppose that was about three minutes before they got his watch; they struck him three or four times on his face and head - the blood gushed out of him and came on my hand: Wheeler and Dennis were there; I saw Wheeler rush against Mr. Brooks for the space of half a minute, and then I saw his hand in his pocket; I did not see Dennis do any thing, but he had a stick in his hand, and was close with Mr. Brooks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q.How old was your child? A.Four years - she was walking; she was alarmed and cried, and I was alarmed; I am sure I was close to Mr. Brooks, and observed the crowd before they came up to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe before they came up that they had a quarrel among themselves, and were striking each other? A. No, I did not; there might be four or six persons close to Mr. Brooks at the time I saw Wheeler's hand in his pocket - but I saw Wheeler for the space of half a moment before he went up to Mr. Brooks; I did not say the mob all rushed on him together - I do not mean to say they went up singly; the footpath is only on one side of the road and I was on that side; I know Moss, he was not there - I did not see him there.</p>

I am the prisoner's father - he was at work on the 5th of November; he came up to my place where I live, which is right opposite Cecil's, and asked me to give him a bit of stuff to mend his harness - that was about ten minutes before eleven o'clock; after I gave it to him he walked towards the back-window - some boys were letting off some little cannons in the yard; he looked at them, came from the window, and said, "Father, it is just gone eleven o'clock, I shall go back and get to work till dark, and then leave off.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. About what time of day did he come to you? A. About ten minutes before eleven o'clock- I know the time by what he told me; he told me the clock had struck eleven - he goes by Spitalfield's clock, which is about a quarter of a mile from our window, and we can plainly hear it; I did not hear it - I am not so quick of hearing, but my daughter heard it.</p>

I had had this gelding five years - it was a roan colour; I put it out on the heath on the 12th of September, and saw it there about twelve o'clock that day - I went there on Saturday morning, the 13th, and it was gone; I found it at one o'clock on the 20th of September, opposite the Swan public-house, at Kennington, standing in a chaise - I saw the ostler there, and spoke about the chaise to him; I proposed to hire it, and in consequence of what I said the ostler went away, and returned in about ten minutes with the prisoner, who asked if I was the gentleman who wanted the chaise - I said I was, and asked what he charged an hour; he said 2s. 6d; I said, "Don't you think that is a great deal" - he said that was a regular fare; I said it was a good deal - he asked how far I was going; I said not much farther, and then told him the poney belonged to me, and I should have him locked up, and the poney too; I asked what he gave for it - he said he gave a fair price for it; I said if he would take me to the man he bought it of I should be satisfied, and would let him go - I told the ostler to take the poney out of the chaise, and lock it up; he unharnessed it, and I took hold of the prisoner - I caught hold of my poney, and let of the prisoner, to put my poney into the stable; the prisoner said he bought it in Smithfield on the 12th of September, at nine o'clock in the evening - I said, "That must be a great story, for you never bought it in Smithfield at all;" he then said, "No, I did not buy it in Smithfield, I bought it coming away from Smithfield-market" - I told him it was mine, and pointed out a large W on the near shoulder; he was very willing for me to have it; I left him in charge of Sturges while I put the poney into the stable, and when I got back he was gone - I got over the top of a water-butt to look for him, but could not see him; I got over several fences, but could not find him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did you see me go over the wall? A. No; I could see nothing of you when I looked over the wall; I had missed you about a minute - I never lost the horse before; and did not buy it as a stolen one; I know George Wood, who, I believe, deals in horses.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How do you know the horse? A.By a large W which I burnt myself in the near shoulder, and it has three white feet - two behind white, and one white about the fetlock joint; I am sure it is mine - I had had it five years - it was four years old when I bought it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you really believe that I stole it? A. If you did not, you know something about who did; I never bought a horse of Wood - it was owned from me as a stolen horse; it had been stolen at two years old from Jackman, a drover; I bought it about two years after that- I have seen Wood - he is wanted now, I believe - I have not seen him for six or seven months; I used to see him at Hampstead; he had horses, but whether they were his own I do not know; I was never intimate with him - I never drank with him to my knowledge; I bought the horse of Bolton, who kept the Hour Glass public-houses, at Walworth.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. On your oath, did you see me in the garden? A. No; we pursued along the gardens - I did not see you get over the fence; I was not at all intoxicated - <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040080"/>I had drunk nothing that day; the impression on my mind is that you said you had the horse a fortnight or three weeks - I will swear you said so.</p>

On the 20th of September, I was at the Swan, at Kennington - I am employed there by the ostler when he goes out with his chaise; I was there on Tuesday, the 16th of September, and saw the prisoner there then - his horse stood there at livery: it was a kind of roancoloured horse: I saw him there on Friday - he said nothing about the horse that day: he came to see it fed, but said nothing to me about it - I saw him waiting there while the ostler fed it; it continued there till Saturday, the 20th; he was there every day; I did not see the horse used till the Saturday, when it stood in the chaise eating a feed of oats, which I had given him; Rodwell spoke to me about it - I went to the cookshop to the prisoner; he came up to Rodwell, who said "Do you own this?" (meaning the horse and chaise) - he said Yes, that he bought it on the Friday, at Smithfield; Rodwell asked if he let it out - he said Yes; Rodwell said "Do you charge so much an hour, or so much by the job?" Yes, said he, half a crown an hour, or so much the job; Rodwell said he was in no hurry, and then said "This is my horse, and it was stolen from me;" the prisoner answered "I am very willing to go with you to the man I bought it off:" the horse was unharnessed -Rodwell asked me to lend him a bridle to take it to livery, I said he might as well leave it there, and it should be taken care of, and it was put into the stable.</p>
               <p>Q.Did the prisoner give you any directions about the horse, between the Tuesday and Saturday? A. He used to dress him over, and wash his bad eye; I put it into the stable, and left Rodwell and Sturges talking together, and when I returned, the prisoner was not there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did I not work the horse on Wednesday and Thursday? A. I was not there all day; it was in the afternoon, if you did - he did work it in the afternoon, in the ostler's chaise - I was not there on Thursday or Friday.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I went near the Duke's Head public-house, Kennington-lane, on Monday, the 3d of November, and met the prisoner with a bridle on his back - he was a little intoxicated; I told him I wanted him, would he step a little way with me? he said"Let us go in here;" I said No, I wanted him on a charge of felony; he said "Then I shall not go further, unless I know what it is for;" I said "It is respecting that horse you stole from Hampstead Heath;" he then made a little resistance - I told him it was of no use, though he had escaped once, he should not escape from me, but if he would walk civilly with me, I would not behave rough to him; he said he would; he said the horse was his own - that he gave 4l. 10s. for it, at the Ram public-house, Smithfield; I took him towards Queen-square: he said "Why, I know how it will be - I know how it will go - you may as well round it at once - twenty sovereigns is no object to me to make it up" - I had not either threatened or promised him any thing; I told him I did not do my business in that way - as he had escaped once, I would take care he did not again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Why did you not apprehend me when you saw me at Croydon fair? A. I had not then got an exact description of you; I swear you offered me twenty sovereigns to make it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 12th of September, I went to Smithfield, and bought the horse, between six and seven o'clock, at the Ram-inn door, as I came out - I bid the man 6l. for it; it had a large lump on his off-haunch; he would not take the money, but said he would take it home, and cut his head off first; I at last gave him seven sovereigns - he gave me 5s. out of it - one Sanderson and Goodman were present when I offered for it - I bought it to let out, at Kennington, and was offered money for it several times, but would not sell it; I had seen the person I bought it of several times in the market, but never spoke to him before; he was a stout man - I had seen him dealing in horses, and considered I gave a fair price for it - I had no reason to believe it was stolen; I put the man's name down on a piece of paper - he gave me the name of

            . I am in the employ of Messrs. Heron and Co. About three weeks ago the prisoner came and delivered some goods from Eastman and Co., and after he brought them in, he was standing in the warehouse, his hat fell off, and I perceived a great many nutmegs falling about in different parts; I looked into his hat and saw some more nutmegs, and two pieces of ginger - there might be a pound or a pound and a half of nutmegs; he said it was a parcel he got had to deliver, and the paper or bag had burst - he said who he was to take it to, but I forget the name; I sent to Mr. Eastman's about it.</p>
               <p>MR. EASTMAN. In consequence of a message from Mr. Heron's, I saw the prisoner soon after seven o'clock in the evening, and asked what he had done with the nut-megs which fell out of his hat; he said "What nutmegs?" I asked him again, and he said "I had no nutmegs;" I put the question to him a third time, mentioning Heron's,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040081"/>where they had fallen from his hat - he then said if I would step aside, he would tell me all about it; I said nothing to induce him to confess - I retired behind the premises with him, he fell on his knees, begged I would not hurt him, and said he had taken them away, and that he had done it through distress; he had 18s. a week - he said, at that time, his wife and child had not bread to eat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is he a married man? A. I suppose so; I saw his wife and child that night.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you go and look into his cart that evening? A. He told me they were in his cart, and I saw the officer find above 2lbs. of nutmegs there - they are worth more than 11s.; he repeated his statement before both my partners - we had missed 2lbs. or 3lbs. of nutmegs from a cask that day; they were such as these,</p>

She said a man had taken her into the yard, and used her in amost cruel manner - and said it was a stout man, and afterward she said it was my son; he had not come up stairs for the key, but took it down, as he left the school-room.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. I got the key from my mother, and came down with it in my hand from the school-room; I went into the kitchen about twenty minutes past twelve o'clock - every thing appeared secure; I only went to the window and took up my hat - I did not notice the things on the dresser; I went out, leaving the key in the door - I returned in five minutes, and picked up a basket of potatoes; I returned to the kitchen, and in ten minutes went out to change a 5l. note; I returned in twenty minutes, and found my father and the prisoner in the kitchen - I had not seen her there before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your father had been giving you some warning? A. Not respecting this person; he has given me lectures, as it is a father's duty to do - he has warned me about women, but I am not that way inclined -I had not been out that morning till then; I have seen the prisoner once, about ten months ago, in Bridge-street, quarrelling with another woman, and an officer of Bridewell called me to assist in parting them - I did not speak to her.</p>
               <p>Q. You remember her well? A. I can remember any one who I have seen before; she said I had been with her, but I strongly deny it - I never saw her, but at the time I mention; I did not tell her where I lived, and have never seen her since - my father never found me at all prodigal.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say he had said he would turn you out of doors if he found anything? A. Never - the prisoner did not accuse me on the spot; she did at the watch-house, and she accused my father before me - he was not present, but three officers were; she at first took me for the officer; she said this much, that it was the gentleman belonging to the house, and that he had ill-used her; that it was au elderly gentleman - and then that it was a pock-marked gentleman, in a blue coat; I had not a blue coat on - my father is not pock-marked, nor am I; she did not mention my father's name - I swear I never had any intercourse with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040083"/>her; I never told her my father had threatened to turn me out - he has cautioned me, as it is a parent's duty; if I read my Bible, I cannot help seeing a reprimand against women - my father never saw me with women, or given that way.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the watch. I took the prisoner in charge; when I went into the kitchen Mr. Budd said she had entered the house, got into the kitchen, and moved things from the drawers to the dresser; I took her to the watch-house - she there begged to be allowed to go to the water-closet, and directly she went in an officer said, "You are doing wrong;" he opened the door, and said she was putting something down there, and I took out of the pan these two common keys, which I tried to the kitchen-door - one of them opens it; she said some old man, pock-marked, took her into the house, and left her in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been intimate with this young man for ten months; he has given me a trifle of money - he gave me encouragement to be more sociable with him: he said he objected to go to a house, but when his mother was out he could go to his apartment with me; I met him on this day as the children were coming out of school - he said, "My father is just going out - come here and wait in the kitchen a few minutes till I go up and get the key to open the door, and I will speak to you;" I said I was in a hurry - he said,</p>
               <p>"Wait, for I have not seen you this fortnight;" he went up, came down again, and opened the door: his mother called him up to get change - he said,"Wait here, and if my mother comes down go, into the cupboard, or I shall be turued out of the house;" I staid a few minutes, and hearing somebody coming I went in - his father came to the door, and he ill-used me; I said,"Wait till your son comes back, and I will give you a proper understanding how I came here;" the father dragged me about: I said, "If you will let me stay here till I can give you a proper understanding I shall be thankful;" both mother and father ill-used me - the son came in; I applied to him for assistance - he held up his hand, and said, "Don't say any thing," and so I did not, thinking he would speak the truth to his mother privately, but at the watch-house he turned round upon me, and said he did know me, and then he did not know me; I told him to speak the truth - he said, "Don't say any thing - my father won't hurt you."</p>

            . I am a Bow-Street patrol. On the 20th of November. I saw the female prisoner in White-street, Spitalfields, with a bundle containing six hats, and a cloak over it; I asked where she got them - she said she had brought them from over the water, from Mr. Harris', to pick, the day before, had left them at a house close by, and had called for them; she said if we went with her she would shew us where they lived - I handed her to my conductor: she was going towards Bishopsgate, and might have gone to the Borough that way.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Then she told you if you went she would shew you the house? A. Yes, and she staid with me while my conductor went to the place; her account was true - it was in some street in Surrey-street.</p>

            . I am conductor of the patrol. Mitchell gave the female prisoner to me on the 20th of November; he said, "I have stopped this woman with this bag, and she says there are hats in it;" I asked her how many there were, and she said half a dozen - I found it was so: she said she did not know the street, nor number, but she would shew us the house; I asked where she lived, and she said in a street in King-street, Borough - I asked whose hats they were - she said her husband was foreman to Messrs. Harris, of Winchester-street, Borough - that she brought the hats over last night, left them at Mr. Coffee's, and when she called for them they were removed - that she had them to pick, and was returning them; I left her in custody, and went to Harris'.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Thames Police. I received this ear-ring and box from Mr. Griffiths; I know both the prisoners perfectly well; they were lumpers employed in stowing ships-holds - they were not employed in the East India Docks to my knowledge; they were first taken in the mouth of September, and brought to the Thames Police, where they were discharged for want of evidence; I took Dillon again on the 15th of November - I told him it was for the jewellery: he said it was a had job; I took Mahoney on the 16th of November - I told him it was for the box of jewellery; he said he saw me the night previous, when I was going to the watch-house with Dillon, and that if I had not apprehended him, he should have come forward at the examination on the Monday; from the list which I received from their employer, (Mr. Wright.) it appears the prisoners were employed as lumpers in the early part of September, but I do not know it myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When in September were the men taken first? A. I think about the 19th, but I did not take them - I think they were dis<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040085"/>charged the latter end of September or the beginning of October; they had four or five examinations - I think they were kept in prison about a fortnight, or something more.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to WILLIAM WOOD OGILVIE. Q. Did this woman offer to pawn these articles with you? A. yes, she did; she came into the shop first, and said"William." and then went into one of the side boxes, and asked if I would lend her 10s. upon these ear-rings -Miss Wood was in the shop, and I think she heard what she asked; I shewed them to Miss Wood - she desired me to stop her; she asked her where she got them - she said she found them by a lamp-post, near Shadwell church; there was no one with her when she came into the shop, that I know of; they are gold ear-rings; I had heard of the robbery.</p>

A man walked into my house, one Tuesday evening, between seven and eight o'clock - I cannot tell what time it was, nor how long before, I was examined; I should know the man again; I saw him before the Justice, but I do not see him here - he brought three, or four, or five pairs of ear-rings to sell; I did not buy them - I looked at a chain and a pair, which I said if he liked to leave he might, as my husband was not at home, but he did not leave them; he brushed them off the counter where they say into his hat, and went off in a very great hurry; no man came in with him, but when he went away I looked out, and I think I saw two or three men, but I do not know whether they were with him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He said he supposed it was about the box taken from the Alfred? A. Yes - the reason I let him go was, because he lived near me, and I have known him these seven years.</p>

I did not see the prisoner, but Jolley gave me the twenty bits to dispose of; I offered them to different people in the trade - I had 1s. 6d. a pair offered for them; I left them in Doughty-mews - I did not see the prisoner afterwards; I was before the Magistrate, but was not questioned about it when I was first taken; I offered them to a Mr. Gullock, and a Mr. Cobb - Mr. Cobb shewed them to Mr. White; I was with him - that was on the Monday morning, and he bought them for 26s.; I did not receive any money till Wednesday, when I called, and received one sovereign from Mr. White's shopman - the rest of the purchase-money was paid on the Friday; it was on the 14th of November, I was taken up for this - the prisoner was taken up three days before I was discharged; I had no bits but those I received from Jolley.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not make any particular observation of the bits? A. No; I cannot swear to them- I was in custody thirteen days.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you give this information about the prisoner? A. My brother-in-law gave the information; I said where I got them, but I was not allowed to say one word - the prosecutor was not there; witnesses appeared against me, and then I was remanded till the following Wednesday - then the same charge was made against me, and I was remanded till Friday, and then again; I was not committed for trial - I was discharged as soon as I was allowed to speak; I wished to speak on the first examination, but the prosecutor was not there - he was there the second time, but I did not state it then; My solicitor was in full possession of the facts - he advised me to say nothing about it then, for reasons best known to himself; I gave this account the last time I was examined at Hatton-garden - it was the fourth time I was before the Magistrate; I was not asked a question before- I do not know that I was prohibited from speaking the second time, but the first time the Magistrate said the prosecutor was not there.</p>

            . I drive a hackney-coach, and live in Brunswick-mews. I know the prisoner by sight; on the evening of the 7th of November he came and asked if I wanted a pair of reins; I told him No - he said he had a pair in pawn for 2s., and asked if I would buy the duplicate, as he was very poor, and greatly distressed; I bought it of him for 1s.; I went to the pawnbroker to look at the reins, but he would not allow me - I came out and gave the prisoner 2s. 1/2d. to get them out, and I bought them of him - I gave up the same reins at Hatton-garden, I think about a fortnight afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you any great bargain? A. I did not consider it so; they were worth perhaps about 4s. to me as a wearer.</p>
               <p>MR. GRAY re-examined. Q. Are these your reins? A. Yes; I judge so by the shape and make of the buckles, which correspond with the leading reins, which were not taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there any thing particular in this kind of buckle? A. Yes; some are square and some round, but these are neither one nor the other - I do not know that I ever saw such as these till within the last twelve months; I had them of Mr. Maberly, at the Horse Bazaar.</p>

I took the prisoner in Hollis-street, Mary-le-bone - I told her it was on suspicion of stealing Mr. Stokey's watch; she replied very impassionately, "If I took, it I took it" - I took her coming down stairs in the house where she lived; I found no duplicate, and only three halfpence on her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to work at this lady's; I had done work - I went and came back again, and then she told me to go to Queen-street for her little girl; I went there and the child had been sent home - I then went home, as my child had been left all day, and my husband wanted his tea; the servant came to me afterwards to go there, and I went; I saw a man coming out of the kitchen, who put the watch down - I took it up, and did not know what to do with it, put it into my bosom: and as I am in the habit of going to Newgate-market, I left the watch there with the intention of taking it out, and returning it when I had done.</p>

I saw the prisoner on the 18th of November, a few minutes after nine o'clock in the evening, near Staines-gate - he was coming towards town; he could have gone to Ashford that way, but it was not the direct road, and his face was towards London - soon after I first met him, a person came and asked me if I had seen such a man - I said I had; I went after him and took him - he was intoxicated; I found this coat on him, which was claimed by Anstee, and this handkerchief, which is claimed by Pullen, was in the pocket of it- he said the cloth and the cord he had sold, and he had done wrong.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been travelling through Kent, Sussex and Hampshire, and was in great distress-for days I have been without victuals; it was distress that induced me to do what I did - I perserved to try to get some little business; I never did this with a criminal intention, but meant to return them - misfortunes crowding on me have crushed me almost to my grave: life is not sweet to me, death would be more preferable, providing it were an honourable one - I went that night into a house where some persons were having a little drink, and I took some, which affected my head, as a little does; I was on my way home - there is a way across the fields, but I did not like to go that night.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, and found the two prisoners in the box; I asked them how they came by the books - they said that a person, calling himself Hodgson, gave them to them under the Pantheon; that he came to the corner of Berwick-street, pointed out the shop, and requested them to pawn them for 30s. - they both said so alternately; I said, "You should not take books so" - Hall then said they did not know the man, but they were to have 1s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Then one confirmed what the other said? A. Yes - I inquired about Treeherne, and have heard that he is a very respectable young man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you made any inquiries respecting Hall? A. Yes - I find his friends are very respectable; Mr. Hodgson's brother was in the shop, and he owned the property as his brother's and sister's; I said, "Is that the Mr. Hodgson" - they said No, he was a taller man.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to No. 2, Henry-street, Hampstead-road - but previous to that, I had received a button which the prosecutrix picked up in the yard; when I went into the apartment. I saw the two prisoners, and I saw a coat on the back of a chair - I asked the man if it was his coat, and he said it was; I took it, and found one button deficient, and the button I had corresponded with the buttons on the coat - I told him what Mrs. Hines had lost; he made great resistance, and said he would not be searched - this is the coat, and the button; I found nothing on him.</p>

            . I keep the house No 2, Henry-street. I remember William Hunter going to see after the roof, and to repair a chimney-pot; he laid the bricks straight which were on the wall - I cannot say that he had such a coat as this on then, but I think he had, and for a fortnight afterwards he wore black.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did he repair the house? A. I think about a month before; he had a blue coat on that day - I do not know whether he lost a button; the wall has been broken these twelve months: all the bricks were loose, and some had fallen down - some of them are often knocked off by cats; on the 6th of November some were pushed over within two yards of the chimney.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You went and searched the waggon? A. Yes, and put the shilling and the bill into the bag; I saw there were currants in it - the waggon was brought to our door in the morning, and I directed two officers to go to the half-way house, to watch it, and see if any thing was taken out - I went to Hammersmith afterwards, and helped to unload the waggon; when it is loaded other persons can get to it, if the waggoner lets them. Hale has been in our service nineteen years.</p>

            . I am a constable of Mary-le-bone. On<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040093"/>the 23d of October, about ten o'clock in the morning, I was desired by Mr. Wood to go to the half-way house at Kensington, and watch their waggon; I took another officer with me - we went across the park - when I got to the half-way house I waited some time; it was a very wet morning, and when the waggon was coming up to the house with Hale, I went out and crossed the road, to watch the actions of Hale, and Marks, who was the ostler there; I saw Marks go out and speak to Hale for a minute or so, then Hale went up stairs into the ostler's room -Marks went to the tail of the waggon, and took out this bag - I can swear this is the bag; I put my name on it: I hailed the other officer, and followed Marks - when he got to the top of the stairs, into his room, I was at the bottom; I went up, and this bag laid between him and Hale; the two men stood amazed - I said, "Halloo! have I made a mistake, or are they currants?" neither of them said a word, and I handcuffed them: I left them in charge of the other officer, and went to the prosecutors'.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. It was not Hale who took the bag out? A. No, Marks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Then Hale, who had gone with the waggon, had gone up stairs? A. Yes; Marks had had some conversation with him, but I could not hear what; Marks did not say, "God knows what is in it, for I don't;" I did not say it was a bag of stolen currants.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long after you saw them conversing together, did you see Marks taking the bag out? A. Not two minutes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. What time was this? A. About eleven o'clock in the day; Early and I were near to them - Marks carried it openly, in front of him.</p>

            . I am a constable of Mary-le-bone. I received this bag from Bolton; I cut it open, and found this shilling and this washing-bill in this lump of currants - there were 43lbs. of currants.</p>
               <p>MR. WOOD. This is the bill and the shilling which I put in; these currants are of exactly the same description as ours.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you any parcels to send any where that day? A. Yes, to Mr. Archer, two hogsheads of sugar and 15 cwt. of refined goods; the other parcels I spoke of were in the body of the waggon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How long had Hale lived with you? A. Nineteen years, and had gone that road every fortnight; nothing is more likely than that persons on that road must have known he was our servant.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Where did you find the other parcels? A. When I found the prisoners handcuffed together; I went on to Mr. Archer's, and took out the two hogsheads of sugar; I found Hale's smock-frock in the waggon - one of these bags of sugar was in one sleeve of it, and the other in the other; and this bag of currants in the body of it.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q.Did not Marks say, in your presence, that he did not know what was in it? A. I do not think he spoke till he was going out, and then he said he knew nothing about it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you not know that he was robbed himself? A. No; I heard somebody had run away with his change, from the bar of a public-house - he said something of that sort at the watch-house; I cannot tell now whether he did say so or not -I believe he is deaf; I talked to him loud enough to make him hear.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not ask him for 2l. to let him go? A. No; it was his first proposition to me; I do not know Jones, the watchman - Stokes, the beadle, was present, and said he would not have such a thing arranged there; I said if his master could raise 2l., but it was not my first proposition - I have not had 1s.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Explain this? A.When I went to the watch-house, he fell on his knees, and begged me not to prosecute him, and said he would give ever so much to be liberated; I then said, "Can you raise 2l.?" he said he could raise 1l.; I said could not his master raise the other pound.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You would let him go for 2l. though you were sure he had given you the beating you have described? A. Yes; he did not appear stupified, for he was very resolute with the watchman.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you not know his hand was only up to his ear, to assist himself in hearing what was said?

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He appeared wild? A. Yes; he was rather the worse for drink, I think - he has been out of his mind I am told; I heard something of his having been in a public-house, and somebody running away with his change, whether it was from him I cannot say - it was next day, I think; I know, it was not that night.</p>

            . I was with Glibbery. I am a constable, and was present when the prisoner was apprehended; he was near Norris, but I was at a distance, and did not see his hand up; the prosecutor was not well enough to give the charge - we laid him all along in the watch-house, and the blood came from him; we could get nothing from him for some time, and we left him there - he got up about half an hour after; the watch-house-keeper got his direction, and he was led home - I saw him next day, and he described the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you look at the prisoner's hands to see if there were any marks of blood on them? A. No; he had no weapon - we did not know whether there had been a robbery till the morning; I have said I did not think the prisoner was one of them - that was only my idea, because he fell on his knees and prayed, and said he was innocent; he had only one hat - he seemed much alarmed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent; I came up Church-street, and there was not a soul there; when I came up to the watchman, he said, "Keep off:" - "Well," said I, "my friend, I want to keep off," and they took me to the watch-house, and found 1s. 9d. or 1s. 10d. on me; when the man came to me, he said, "You are the very man who struck me. I bended my knees down before my Maker; and am as innocent as ever there was a prisoner before the bar; I never put a hand on the man - he has certainly sworn my life away; he said I knew where his hat was - I said,"My good friend, there was not a soul with me when I went up to the watchman, if it was the last word I had to say:" he said he could swear to me by the corner of my handkerchief, and said,"Is not that the handkerchief you had on last night;" I said it was; he came to me on the Monday, and said "You are the very man who struck me; if I was to go to your master, and ask him for 2l., don't you think he would lend it you?" I never put a hand on him - I told him I would have my trial and justice.</p>
               <p>THOMAS JONES. I am a watchman of Bethnal-green. I was at the watch-house when the prisoner was there - the prosecutor was talking to him at the cage-door; I heard him say if he would give him 2l. he would make it up when he came to Worship-street; I was obliged to go to the watch-house, and did not hear the prisoner's answer - there was only me, Stokes, and the prosecutor there.</p>

On the 1st of November, I went to take a pie to Cattle's shop - Smith came in just as I was coming out: in the course of the time, Smith sent me out for some gin - Cattle poured out about half a glass; I took a little of it, and in the course of conversation, I said I was going to Hoxton, in the evening; both the prisoners were present when I said that; about twenty minutes before six o'clock, I went out from mistress to go to Mr. Hunter's, Britannia-gardens, Hoxton, to receive 5l.; I had a receipt for it in my hand; mistress desired me to go a public way: I passed Cattle's shop in my way - I owed him 1d. for a tart - I went in and paid for it; Smith came in directly I got into the shop - I do not know whether I then mentioned where I was going; the prisoners went out of the shop; I remained there five or ten minutes talking to Mrs. Cattle, and then went out; Cattle overtook me when I got to the Goldsmiths' alms-houses, in Hackney-road, and said he was going my way; I said "Are you?" I saw Smith, in a few minutes he came up; they were talking together - I could not hear what they said; after going on a little while, I heard Cattle tell Smith, what a pretty sweetheart he was, for he had never spoken to me all the way; I went on, and got at last to Pitfield-street, and at the corner of that street, I asked Cattle if he would be so kind as to come down Britannia-gardens, as it was such a lonesome place; he said he was in a hurry to get his yeast, but if I would go as far as St. Luke's church with him, he would see me to Britannia-gardens; I went with him - Smith went also; and when we got a little distance, they both asked me to go into a public-house to have something to drink; I went in, and Smith gave me a glass of gin, which I drank - I stopped by St. Luke's church, while he got his yeast - we were all three together.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, after that you set off to Britannia-gardens? A. Yes; I went to Mr. Hunter's, and received five sovereigns - the prisoners waited for me by agreement, till I came out- I wrapped the five sovereigns in a piece of paper, and put them in my bosom - my gown was pinned over it, and my apron tied over that - I found them waiting for me; Cattle said, had I got what I went for; I said Yes - I had the receipt in my hand in his shop; it had a stamp on it; I kept it in my hand all along the road; after going a little way, Cattle said if I had got any paper, or any thing to take care of, he would take care of it for me; I said I was capable of taking care of it myself; they asked me to go to a house, No. 9, opposite Britannia-gardens - I refused; Smith said it would not hurt me - he took me by the hand, and pulled me in: I do not remember whether Cattle said any thing - we all three went in; some gin was called for; Smith brought me a glass to the window, which I drank - I do not know who paid for it; I was standing by the window, and had not sat down; the prisoners were at the bar; I came out with them; we turned down a court by the side of the public-house - it was dark; I said I did not know where I was; Cattle said I was going right; about five or ten minutes after this, I felt very sick and giddy; Cattle repeated two or three times that he would take care of what I had, if I would give it to him; I refused - I do not remember going to any other house, except one, where I had a glass of liquor thrown over me, and I believe that was the Red Cow public-house, at Dalston; Smith threw it over me, because I would not drink it - I have no recollection whatever of what happened after I got out of this public-house, till I remember the patrol taking me up off the ground - I am seventeen years old, and single - I have lived at Mrs. Smith's four years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.How far from Cattle's shop does your mistress live? A. A very short distance - about as far as from here to Newgate; I knew him perfectly well - mistress never went to his shop; he was known in the neighbourhood; I was at this house twice that day, but did not say what I was going to Hoxton for - the recipt was folded up in my hand - nobody could see what it was - I do not recollect telling either of them I was going for money; I had only known Smith about three weeks - I had seen him at Cattle's,</p>
               <p>Q. As you were insensible from the time you left the public-house till the patrol came up, can you venture to say you did not give Cattle the money to take care of? A. I cannot swear whether I gave it him - whether I dropped it, or whether it was taken from me; I have not the least recollection of giving it to him, and think if I had done so I must recollect it; I wore a close dress, pinned up at the bosom; I put the money down near the pit of my stomach, then put up my dress, and tied my apron over it; the gin thrown over me went down my neck; I did not open my bosom to wipe it.</p>
               <p>Q. After you got out, was there no romping or toying between Smith and you? A. Not that I recollect; Cattle's brother came to our house on Sunday morning, while I was at chapel, and I went to where cattle was, but did not see him; I spoke to him throught the rails.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say to him, "I won't hurt you - I am sure you did not intend to rob me"? A. No, I did not; he said "If you say I took the money from you, it will transport me for life," and I said "I cannot say whether I gave it you or not;" that is all I said.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Why did you go to the watch-house? A. By the persuasion of his brother, or somebody who came.</p>

               <p>Q. When you came up, did you hear any thing?

On the evening of the 1st of November I was on duty in the lane, and saw Cattle - I met him walking; I said "Patrol," and bade him good night; and after that I saw Watson fifteen or twenty yards behind me - I cannot say whether Cattle could hear what he said, as the wind blew away from him; he said something to me, and in consequence of that I went after Cattle, who continued walking till I got very near to him, and then took to running; I had said nothing to him then, but when he ran, I said, "You had better stop, young man," and sprang my rattle - he continued running: I ran, but could not overtake him - there are three paths on that spot; he did not take the path towards Margaret-street - he was a mile or two out of his way from Hoxton to Margaret-street; I sprang my rattle, and after that went back to Smith, Watson, and the prosecutrix, as I could not overtake him - on the way to the watch-house the prosecutrix began crying, as her petticoats fell off; Smith said,"Don't cry" - I said, "Have you got this young woman's money?" he said," No, I have not, Cattle has it - I asked her for it, and if she had given it to me I would have put it where no b-r alive could have found it;" two patrols overtook us with Cattle in custody - I said to Smith,"Then this is the man who has got her money;" he said"Yes, that is Cattle, he has got her money" - I do not think he was near enough to hear that said; I said nothing to him about the money in Cattle's presence - when we got to the watch-house I gave charge of them; Cowley asked me the charge - I said, "We have brought in these two young men, on suspicion of robbing this young woman of 5l.; Cattle immediately said "It is no robbery at all - here are the five sovereigns which she gave me to take care of," and gave them up directly to Cowley, the constable of the night, (who is since dead;) they were then locked up.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Hackney. I was on duty on the 1st of November, between eight and nine o'clock at night - I heard a rattle spring, and saw Cattle coming towards me at a regular walking pace; I went up to him, and called him - he said at first," I am not the man, it is a young man and a young woman over in the field;" I said," I must detain you" - he said I had no right to detain him, and as he spoke I perceived he caught his breath;" I said, "You are out of breath, and I shall detain you" - he said I was doing him an injury in detaining him, and keeping him from his business; I said I did not wish to injure him - if he would go with me to the party, I would not detain him, if they said he was not the person; we proceeded across the fields - I do not remember his saying any thing more; he did not say a word about having any money - I took him across the fields, and met Gregory, the patrol, and left him in his custody; I went on and called Pilton, who came to me - the place is a narrow passage; I went back to where Cattle was, and heard Pilton say to him, "Cattle, you are the man who robbed the girl" - I do not remember his answer, but think he said,"How do you know?" Pilton said, "If I had not known you, how should I have picked you out from the rest;" a gentleman hearing this, said, "Now you secure him - secure his hands;" I proceeded towards Hackney watch-house with him in custody, and overtook Smith in custody near the Cock public-house - up to that time Cattle had not said a word about the money, but then something was mentioned that he had the money; the impression on my mind is, that he owned having it then - we went to the watch-house where Smith gave another name.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When Cattle said he was not the man, you had not charged him with any thing; whether it was for stealing money, or for assaulting a woman with intent to ravish her, he could not tell? A. No - I did not know myself; he said he had the money before he got to the watch-house.</p>

On the 25th of November, a little after eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to my lodging; I was up - he knocked at the door; I answered him - I did not know him before; he asked me for a person named Johnson - I told him my name was Johnson - he said he came about the 4l. 9s., the robbery, and charged me with having robbed a gentleman in Cock-hill, Liquopond-street, the night before; there is a house in Cock-hill, where I occasionally sleep - he did not mention who kept the house; I told him he must be mistaken, I was not the person - he said Yes, he knew I was the person, for he had a description of me, as having a tooth out in front - I said I had two teeth out, and then went down stairs to the kitchen, to see my landlady; the prisoner, and a watchman named Reeves, followed me - the watchman had stood at the side of the door: the prisoner called him, when he came down stairs; I went into the back place - Brown and Reeves followed me; they shut the door - Brown desired Reeves to search me - previous to that I had taken 2l. 12s. out of my pocket, and had it loose in my hand; Reeves searched me, and took two sixpences out of my pocket - I dropped the 2l. 12s. out of my hand by accident; Brown called for a light, which a little girl brought - he picked up the money, and Reeves gave her the two sixpences he had taken from my pocket; we then went into the front-kitchen, and he told me not to be alarmed, that I was no prisoner, and he had not come to hurt me, that he had got what he wanted, which was the money; I told him where he was going, I would go with him; as they were both going away he said, if I knew when I was well off I should keep quiet and say nothing about it - I said I was innocent of any charge, and asked where he was going; he said he was going to see the gentleman on Cock-hill, whom, he said, had been informed I had robbed - I told him I would go with him; he said, if I would go I might, and that I could follow him, as I knew where he was going; I desired him to wait while I got my bonnet and shawl to go with him - I went up, put them on; we went out together, and as we went along he asked if I knew where they sold good gin; I shewed him a public-house - we had some gin there - I went into the gin-shop and had some gin with him, and Reeves - the prisoner paid for it; we then went straight to Cock-hill, and on our way they wished me to have move, but I declined till we got to Cock-hill - I had some more there; he then told me he had an appointment with this gentleman at three o'clock in the afternoon; I asked him where the appointment was - he said at his own house; I asked where he lived - he would not tell me; he said he would bring the gentleman to Cock-hill at three o'clock, if I would be there; I said I would, or else he said he would see me at eight o'clock, when he was on his beat - he is a patrol; he never came at three o'clock, for I sent, and went myself at eight o'clock and stopped till nine, but he was not on his beat; I never saw him any more till I saw him at the watch-house the night following - he said he had seen the gentleman, and returned him the money, and he gave him the 12s. for his trouble - I had gone to the watch-house to see for him; this was on Wednesday night, between eight and nine o'clock - he said he had got a receipt and could shew it to me, but he would not, and I then gave him in charge for robbing me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you take the 2l. 12s. from your pocket for? A. I thought it would be more safe in my hand; I did not give it to him - I tried to take it up when it fell, but he called for a light and prevented me from touching it, and took it up himself against my will; put it into his pocket, and took it away against my consent.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. I believe you are an unfortunate girl? A. yes; I understand he is a patrol - Reeves saw all the transaction - I have not taken any pains to bring him here; I have not seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did you go down into the back-kitchen? A. I became alarmed, and went down to tell my landlady of it - I suppose he thought I was going to make my escape, and followed me; the landlady was preparing her breakfast in the kitchen - I went through there into the back-kitchen, that is not very dark, but is not so light as this place; there is a door opens into the light kitchen, and there is a little hole; there is a great deal of rubbish in the place; I swear the money fell out of my hand - there might have been a little rubbish thrown over it in the scuffle - I had passed part of the night before with a gentleman at a house on Cock-hill; the 2l. 12s. was given to me by a gentleman between eleven and twelve o'clock the night before - he was three or four hours in my company; he gave me no more than 2l. 12s.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, on the road, making any observation to him, about the woman who keeps the house on Cockhill having told of the robbery? A. No: I do not recollect any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say "D-n her, I meant to have given her half the money if she had not nosed upon me?" A. Nothing of the kind - he did not say the gentleman lived sixty miles from town, and could not stop to prosecute me; he said he was to meet him at his own house, but at the watch-house he said he was to meet him at the Spread Eagle; I went to the watch-house on the Tuesday night, but did not find him till Wednesday - I have seen his wife repeatedly since this, and told her I did not want to hurt him, - I did not wish to see her and the family go to destruction; and she said I should have the money back - I did not say I would not appear against him: I was bound to appear.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 26th of November, between eight and nine o'clock at night, Johnson made this charge to me, and I took the prisoner Brown- (having been to his house, and brought him to the watch-house,) the girl stated the charge in his presence; he said he had paid the money to a gentleman at the Spread Eagle; I said "Then perhaps Brown you can point out the person at the inn who called the gentleman" - he said he could; Harper and I went with him to the Spread Eagle; he said it was a waiter at the tap that called the gentleman - we inquired at the tap, and found they kept no waiter - he made some excuse, and we went over to the house to find the gentleman there, but we could find no gentleman - a female at the tap said, in his hearing, he had made an application there that morning, and he was in company with a woman when he made the application, and that was at twenty-five minutes past nine o'clock: he said at the watch-house that the gentleman he paid the money to went off by the nine o'clock coach; I do not recollect that he made any answer to the female: we went to the tavern, and made inquiry, but could find no gentleman there who had been robbed; Brown was with us all the time; we then returned to the watch-house: he said he had a receipt which the gentleman gave him; the ward-beadle told him if he had the receipt, he should not be locked up that night; he said he would produce it to-morrow before the Magistrate, but would not produce it then; he was locked up in an hour or two, and remained in the watch-house till then.</p>

            . I live at No. 6, Cock-hill. Johnson was in the habit of coming to my house at times; she came there on Monday night, the 24th of November, at a quarter to eleven o'clock, with a gentleman; I was not at home, but my servant informed me so - I did not see her; she was brought there, between nine and ten next morning, by Brown and Reeves, and said she had been at my house the night before; Brown had knocked at my door, at a quarter to five o'clock that morning; I asked who was there - he said a gentleman in the first-floor had called to him, and said he was robbed; I said "If you will wait a moment, I will take a light of you;" I did so, went up stairs, and asked a gentleman in the bed-room what was the matter - he said he had been robbed of 4l. 9s.; I told him not to make an alarm; I knew the person who had been there well, but I could not tell what time she had been away; he dressed, and went down; I then let Brown and Reeves in; Brown said he was not satisfied but what the woman was in the house; I told him he was welcome to search it - he did so, and found nobody - Brown, Reeves, and the gentletleman went away together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear the gentleman say he lived in the county? A. No; I was out when they came in - I came home at two o'clock in the morning - my servant is not here; my house is shut up at eleven; I described the prosecutrix to Brown, and told him where she lived.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Riley and Harper have an old grudge against me, and have taken this opportunity of using this against me, or they never would take notice of what an old prostitute, and well-known thief, have said - they have been trying for some time to spit a spite against me; the gentleman told me he did not wish to be exposed.</p>

            . I am a watchman, on the adjoining beat to Brown. Mrs. Abrams made a communication to me respecting a robbery; I went with Brown to the prosecutrix - when Brown told her the charge, she ran down stairs into the back place - I got into the dark place two or three seconds after Brown, and I found her in a stooping situation, by the side of some dirt; the prisoner asked her where the money was - she denied knowing any thing about it; he called for a light, and said he considered the money was deposited in the dirt; I saw him find the money in the heap of dirt - it was covered all over with the dirt; there was not a piece of it to be seen before the dirt was raked over - it could not have been placed there by accident; she was close to the dirt when she was stooping; I was with Brown when the gentleman came out of the house; he said he was going sixty miles on the following day; when the money was taken out of the dirt, she asked him what he had got; he said 2l. 12s. - she then exclaimed that was all she had robbed the man of.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What were her words? A. She said"That is all I took from the gentleman;" she said nothing, in my hearing, about the landlady of the house; I did not hear the gentleman call out of the window - I was not near enough; Brown called me - he has been a patrol about two years.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had the prisoner a coat or jacket on? A. No; he had disposed of the coat, he had a tight waistcoat with sleeves, such as I have seen many people wear; the cart was not in sight when I first started - I met it; some apples and walnuts, and two coats, were found in the cart - they were entire coats.</p>

            . I am a painter and glazier, and live at Holloway. I saw Talbott endeavouring to stop the horse, and noticed the man in the cart, and am certain it was the prisoner; I pursued as hard as I could, and saw them both jump out; the boy went up a passage, and the prisoner turned to the right.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Vine has some children? A. One; it runs about, and used to play in our room - we occasionally lent each other things.</p>

I went to bed about ten o'clock on the night of the 15th of November - I expected Humphreys home that night; I heard a noise in the course of the night, and thought it was Humphreys coming up to bed quietly, that he should not disturb me- I had pulled my waistcoat off when I went to bed, and tucked my watch inside the sleeve of my waistcoat; I heard the steel seal gingle against an old coin which was fastened to my watch - I then suspected something was going on wrong; I jumped out of bed, and called, "Will, Will," three times - Humphreys did not answer; I suspected it was him; he ran down stairs without saying a word - I ran down stairs after him, and saw a person going out of the window on his belly; two persons outside were pulling him out: I caught hold of his legs, but they pulled him out - he had no shoes on when I caught hold of his legs; there was another man inside the room, standing on the top of an old bedstead while I was pulling his legs, and he hit me on the forehead-they got him clear away; then the other man and I had a tustle together - he caught hold of my throat, and pretty nearly strangled me; it was dark, and I did not know who it was, as not a word was said: after the struggle he jumped out of the window frame, and was pulled out; I lost my watch, two shirts, and a night-cap - my watch was worth about 50s.; it was silver: I examined the premises directly we got a light, and found that they had got in at the front window, they had gone to the back of the house, and took two squares out of the window-frame - I suppose they could not got in that way, but then went round and broke a glass, and opened the front-window by unhasping it; I found Humphreys' hat and handkerchief in the room where they entered, and I found his shoes outside the window - I know them to be his; he did not come home that night to sleep: I was present next morning when he was taken, and he did not deny the hat, shoes and handkerchief being his - he was asked if they were his, and did not say they were or were not; I think he was asked if they were his: he said he was there, and three others whom he named, were with him and told the constable where to take them: he said he came up stairs first, took my watch and gave it to Peat, who was in with him - I have not found it since; I have got one shirt and a night-cap from the watchman.</p>

            . I am errand-boy to the prosecutors. On the 1st of November I had this parcel to deliver at the Bell and Crown, and was going down Skinner-street - the prisoner stood outside Muncaster's (the pawnbrokers) window, and called to me; he asked if I would go and fetch him a coach - I had another boy with me: he said he would give us 6d. a piece - he gave us 1s.: I put my bag down, and said to the little boy, "You mind the bag," and while I was going I met the little boy by the Saracen's Head; I had been absent four or five minutes: the boy told me to bring a chariot - I immediately ran back to where I left my goods, and the prisoner was gone, bag and all; this was on Saturday - I saw him on the Monday morning, and knew him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Of course you pointed him out the moment you saw him? A. Yes - I saw him come out of the lock-up place; the officer met some gentleman on the Saturday night, in Gracechurch-street, but I did not think right to go near them; I do not know whether that was the prisoner - I did not see his face - I was about three yards from him, but was not looking that way; we were going along and met him - I was about a yard behind the officer; the officer tapped him on the shoulder, but I did not see him do that - he stopped, and talked to him, and then I went away; it was rather dark- I did not hear what passed, and did not know it was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were looking that way? A. They were looking towards Fenchurch-street, and I towards Bishopsgate-street; I described the person who robbed me as being above forty years old, and of very low stature; I had never seen him before, to my knowledge - I went to St. Andrew's watch-house, and gave information directly, and about half-past five o'clock saw the officer tap the gentleman on the shoulder; I was robbed about four.</p>

            . I was with Moorhouse; a man stood at a door in Skinner-street, by Seacoal-lane, and a man at the top said, "A man wants you there;" we went to him: he said he would give us 6d. each to fetch a coach - I staid by the goods, and he said to me, "Go and tell him not to fetch a coach but a chariot, and make as much haste as you can;" I went, and when we came back the bag and man were gone; we went to the watch-house directly - I left the bag with the prisoner; he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Had he the same clothes on then? A. No, he was dressed in black - he had black trousers on; I never saw him before - I was keeping my eye on the goods: I was with the prisoner about nine minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been repeating your story to any body? A. No, Sir - Yes, Sir; nobody told me to say it was nine minutes - the man appeared about forty, but not more, and of a low size; nobody told me to say he was about forty.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What age do you think the prisoner is? A. About forty, and of low stature.</p>

            . I am an officer. About a quarter-past four o'clock on Saturday a lad came to St. Andrew's watch-house, and said he had been robbed; I went in pursuit, and met two persons in Aldgate High-street that night - the prisoner was one; he said, "Mr. Gray, how do you do?" I said, "Very well, thank you," and walked away; the boy might be a yard or two off: I went to the office, and gave information.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He knew at the time you were looking for the robber? A. Certainly - he was walking in the same line with me; he might pass the prisoner face to face - he might be a few feet behind, but he must have passed him; it was near a shop window, with a gas-light to it.</p>

               <p>AMELIA WOODROFFE. I live at No. 17, Denmark-court, Strand. On the 26th of November, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I had been to the English Opera-house; I went, also, to Drury-lane Theatre - I was coming back to the English Opera-house again, and, as I came out of Drury-lane Theatre, I saw the prisoner, in <placeName id="t18281204-216-crimeloc1149">Bridges-street</placeName>

That was the first time I saw him; I said, "I don't know," and then the one in the white fustian jacket said to the prisoner, "It is of no use, it is a duffer's watch" - (I had had no conversation with the woman and the man; she had left me on the Friday, and this was Monday) the prisoner said, "Never mind, we will have it;" I then crossed over Russell-street, towards Bow-street, to get from them - the prisoner then came up and said, "What is it o'clock?" I made him no answer - this was in Bow-street; both of them had followed me - I did not see my servant again; I went into Bow-street - the prisoner came up to me again, pulled my cloak aside, and took the watch in his hand, but it was supported by two watch-books and a tape; it hung it my belt - he turned it round; the other man was ten or fifteen yards from him at that time - that man gave a whistle, I think with his fingers in his mouth, by the sound, and the prisoner caught hold of the watch; I called Watch! the watchman came up and took the watch out of his hand; I still retained possession of it - the books still held it to my belt; he said to the watchman, "It is of no use taking me - it is only a duffer's watch;" the watchman laid hold of it at that time - he asked the watch-house-keeper to allow him to speak to me; he then gave me a desperate blow, and knocked me down in the watch-house - I had a desperate black eye; the Magistrate would not believe he had knocked me down, but he said himself that he had; he said, "Will you appear against me to-morrow?" I said Yes, and he gave me a desperate blow; I never saw him before, till I saw him talking to my servant, nor had I seen the man in the fustian jacket before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How many names have you? A. Clara Fisher is the name I go by, because I do not wish to disgrace my parents, by going by my right name; I was living with Mrs. Belasco - she keeps a brothel in Denmark-court; my servant's name is

               <p>Q. Was there any difficulty in getting the watch if he was disposed? A.Decidedly; because I held the seals, and pulled the watch, or he could have got it - I pulled the stone out of one of the seals with holding it; I will take my oath it was in his hand when the watchman came up; Ward told the Magistrate that it belonged to Belasco.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I heard the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040105"/>prosecutrix call Watch! I was a few yards off - I came up; the prisoner, and a good many more stood in the street - I suppose five or ten stood together; the prisoner said "Watchman, it is of no value, it is only a duffer, not worth 5s. - I don't call it any thing to be given in charge for;" I asked if she insisted on the charge - she said Yes; she charged him with attempting to take her watch, and breaking the guard from her side; I took him to the watch-house, and he there hit her on the bridge of her nose, and knocked her down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. About what o'clock was this? A. After twelve; I sprung my rattle when I got him in charge - there were two of them together; one wore a fustian coat; she said he was one, and so I sprung my rattle - I have not had the watch; she had hold of the seals, and he said to me, taking hold of the watch,"Watchman, it is only duffer:" I will not swear whether he had hold of it when I came up - I saw it in his hand, but did not see him take hold of it; I now know where Belasco lives - I have been there for Woodroffe three times: I did not know her before this: she has kept the watch herself - the Magistrate ordered it to be given to her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What does duffer mean? A. I asked him what he meant; he said it had no works in it; I never knew Belasco's house before this happened - it is not in my parish.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I hope you will put the watchman on his oath whether he thinks this is spite or not - it is nothing else; I have known the woman ever so long, but lately have not spoken to her; and seeing me talking to Ward, she and Belasco took and followed me, took hold of me, looked me in the face, and let me go; I said to Ward, "These young women are following us;" they came and stood round us; the watchman came by - she said, "I give charge of this young man:" he said, "What for? I won't take him unless you say the charge," and she said, "He has attempted to take my watch:" I have known her these nine months.</p>

            . I lived at Belasco's four months; it is a house of ill-same - there was a dress lodger there besides the prosecutrix; I was in Belasco's service, not in hers; this happened on the Tuesday after the Friday on which I left; I met the prisoner in Brydges-street - he stopped and spoke to me; he walked on - I stopped to tie my patten; she and Mrs. Belasco came out of Mother H.' oyster shop - I heard her say to Mrs. Belasco, "Here he is, so help me God I will;" (I have often heard her mention the prisoner's name, and say she would send him out of the country if it laid in her power) the other young woman said, "No, don't Clara:" she said," I will;" she gave Mrs. Belasco her muff, opened her cloak, then took a brass watch which she wears, and gave it to Mrs. Belasco, who took off her gold watch, and gave it to her; and, before they could get to Bow-street, Mrs. Belasco stopped and took hold of this young man by the collar, and then let him go again; Mrs. Belasco and Clara then ran round him and began a quarrel with him for the space of five minutes; she called the watchman, and insisted on his taking charge, and when he was taking him to the watch-house Mr. Belasco went up to him, and said, "Let him go:" the watchman said he must do his duty - I did not go into the watch-house, for Mr. Belasco heard me say I would speak for him, and he wanted to give charge of me; I went away, but went before the Magistrate the next day, and stated what I have here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had there been any quarrel between Fisher and the prisoner? A. Not that I know of; they never associated together or cohabited; I cannot say why she wished to send him out of the country, for I never heard - she meant transportation no doubt; I saw her change the watch, and then she charged him with attempting to take it - she never had a gold watch in her possession before; she was only trusted with the brass one - I suppose she was ashamed to swear a robbery against him for the brass watch; he did not attempt to take it from her - he was never near her; they followed him - she gave him in charge at the end of Bow-street, she followed him all that way, and then called the watchman; I was behind her at the time.</p>

Oh, yes: I did not know what you meant; the prosecutrix gave me 1s. to get my dinner, because she said the London cases were coming on- it was within a few minutes of five o'clock; I had had no dinner, and was going to get it, but was afraid I should be wanted; I swear it was only a shilling, and here it is - nobody said any thing to me about going to drink with the prisoner's friends.</p>

            . I live in Portland-town, Regent's-park. I am attending here on another case: while standing among the people yonder, my attention was attracted by some conversation between the watchman and prosecutrix: I heard her reprimand him for keeping company with the prisoner's friends over the way, or at least out of doors, and at the same time she gave him 3s.; I can be positive there were three sixpences, and I thought it was a crown, but am certain of 4s. 6d., at the same time saying, "If you want drink, here is money to get it, but till the trial comes on keep yourself sober?" there was something so particular about the admonition, I thought it right to mention it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You are here on another trial? A. Yes: a sheep-stealing case; I am a carman and carrier - I will swear to the money put into his hand; I only know the woman as the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know her? A. By the party standing in Court; she said, "What did you go among those out of doors for? there is a great many of them, and I don't want you to be along with them." making use of an observation; she put the money into his hands - she suited the action to the word; I am quite uninterested in the matter - I never saw any of them before.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. He came into your service four years ago? A. Yes, and was to receive 2l. or two guineas a week; I never recollect any conversation about his being allowed a commission on what he sold, nor about his receiving any thing at Christmas; I did not say I had allowed it to his predecessor, and would to him; this 6l. 4s. was not included in the monthly accounts; I recollect receiving an account from my wife - this is it; here is credit given for 6l. 4s., received from Mr. Sheldon, deducted from an annual gift of 20l. - he does account for 6l. 4s. in this way; I issued a writ against him for the money before he absconded, and then took out a warrant; I never gave him permission to go out of town after rendering the account - his brother came and brought a receipt, which I said was no account at all; Mrs. Pearson gave the prisoner a receipt- she handed an account to me, in which he had made an account for 80l. as a gratuity - his brother did not give me any account; I issued a writ against the prisoner directly.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. When he went away, you brought this forward? A. Yes - I thought the embezzlement was complete - here is the account for January 1828 - the 6l. 4s. is not down; he should have rendered an account of it the last day of the month; he used to send the account sealed up to the warehouse - not to the house.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Is there not in this account an item of 10l.? A. Yes, I made him a present of that; I swear I did not give it to him on account of a gratuity; I very often make my servants presents - it was in June 1826; I think I saw him but once after I received this account from my wife; he stayed on my premises two or three days, but evaded me in every kind of way; I called several times, and could not see him.</p>

At the time I entered Mr. Pearson's service, in 1824, I was to succeed Mr. Robinson, whom I had some knowledge of - he agreed to give me 100l. a year, but it was a verbal agreement - Mr. Robinson said he did not give commission, but he made a present of 20l. a year at Christmas - Robinson is now dead; I had repeatedly asked Mr. Pearson to settle - he said "I am in a hurry, and can't give it you now;" in June 1826, I asked him to let me take 10l. on account, which he allowed me to do; Mr. Sheldon knowing me, became a customer of Mr. Pearson's, and this sum I held back, considering myself entitled to it; on Thursday, the 22d of August, I was desired by a note to bring the book to London-wall, and Mr. Pearson found it all correct - there is a lad here, I believe, that can prove it - this is the book, and here is the account I rendered - he took the book. and said "Mr. Patrick, you received money of Mr. Dodd," and then he marked them all off in the book, and made no objection - on the Monday following, he called on Mr. Pearson - two or three persons had been inquiring if the premises were to let; when he called, I told him of it - he said I must go and tell them 300l. rent, and one thousand guineas for the lease; I went to several persons, and one of them appointed to meet Mr. Pearson, at London-wall; on the Wednesday evening, I met him at the factory, and went to London-wall with him, and when he was gone, I was ushered up stairs to Mr. Pearson, and this account lay before him; Mr. Pearson had a sale on the 26th of August, and from the 22d, I had never seen him - I wrote a note to know whether I was to shut up the shop or not - then a man applied for it to exhibit the Red Barn, and he took it for a week - on the 27th, I saw Mr. Pearson, and asked him leave to go into the country; he gave me leave, and then he asked for the receipt - I sent my brother with it the next morning, when he picked out two sums of Clementi and Frieseland, and said "I will issue a writ against your brother," and he took out a writ that every morning; my brother came back to the Strand, and I went into the country; I came back on the 9th of September, and wrote to Mr. Lacey, to say if he had any instructions to take proceedings against me to send to Austin-friars, and on the 18th of September, he took out the warrant against me; I was at Carpenters' Hall several times - I never absconded; I supposed, had he intended to take any proceedings, he would have sent to Austin-friars; here is the mark in the book against this very account, and Mr. Pearson made no objection; he says he did not see me, but he saw me on the Monday and on the Wednesday evening.</p>

               <p>SIR: - If you have instructions from Mr. Pearson to take any proceadings against me, I shall take it a favour if you will send them to Mr. Coates, Austin-friars; if any, have taken place, I will call, with two friends, and sign a bail bound. J. P.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY to MR. PEARSON. Q. Is the account in your hand-writing? A. This date is not mine; this letter is Mrs. Pearson's.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Was this letter written by you after the account given to Mrs. Pearson? A. I think I can swear it was before, to the best of my knowledge it was two days before this account was furnished to Mr. Pearson - supposing there to have been no entry of four years gratuity, it would not have been a correct account, because he had delivered a July account, in which he had omitted items which he credits in this account; he gives credit for them here: -(Letter read.)</p>

               <p>MR. PEARSON re-examined. Q. Did you compare the account with your book, as the prisoner states? A. This green book is a book of sales, not of money; it is merely of goods sold - this account is the one he delivered, sealed up, to Mrs. Pearson; this other, is the cash-book, which was rendered to me after he delivered the account - I compared it with the cash-book, and it was fabricated; the prisoner kept this book, and when I saw it, three or four days after, it was not made up - I can prove the monies are entered as paid, in August, when they were received in May, July and February; he writes them here as paid in August, and in the former leaves they are never credited.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you mean that in that green book there are not entries the same as in the account? A. Yes, of sales; I have never compared the entries in this book with the account rendered by the prisoner, and ticked them off.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's brother. On the 28th of August, I went to Mr. Pearson, to exchange a receipt of the 21st of August, signed by Mrs. Pearson; it purported to be for the balance of the account - I went to give it up to Mr. Pearson, and to have one of his own; I understood, from my brother, it was at Mr. Pearson's request, and to take some vouchers for monies paid to Mr. Pearson; Mr. Pearson was at breakfast - I sent up a note, and was asked to sit down; I had the receipt in my hand, and gave it him - he said, "As your brother is going into the country, it is necessary I should have these vouchers;" he had a stamp lying on the table, which he had commenced writing before I got there, as the ink was quite black; he finished it, and took up the receipt I gave him, and handed to me the one he had written - this is it; it purports to be for two specific sums in the account previously delivered to Mrs. Pearson; I was going to hand him a receipt for 102l. 5s. 4d, for salary, and he said, "I do not want that- there is the receipt for the two specific sums of Clementi and Frieseland, and I will arrest your brother for 80l. immediately;" I was going to make some reply, but he seemed in a great rage - I did not know what had been committed, and I came away.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. What are you? A. An accountant; I am in no particular employ at present - I recollect my brother leaving Mr. Pearson's service; I did not receive him into my house - I gave the receipt to my brother.</p>

On the 17th of November, I received one thousand for Mr. Knott, and delivered them to the prisoner, about a quarter before six o'clock; they were all in one cart, with two horses - they were Mr. Nurse's; I saw about one thousand bricks in the Alpha-road, on the 22d; Mr. Nurse has two marks on his bricks - one is W. N., and the other N.; I never authorized the prisoner to take any bricks there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. It was not light at that time? A. No - there are fifty or sixty men employed on the wharf, and about thirty carts; there are two moulds; the bricks are all marked so at that place - there are millions made there; I have sold a great many.</p>

The prisoner applied to me, on the 17th of November, to go round by the Nightingale public-house, and fetch up some bricks, and bring them to Steven's-buildings, for Mr. James - I removed them at two loads, as I had but one horse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you were taken up? A. Yes - when the Magistrate was about to commit me, I told them; there were about one thousand bricks; I showed Mr. Darke the place I took them to - I do not know that Mr. James was there when I shot them; when I took Mr. Darke there, the building was carried up - there was no building when I went.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you take any bricks out of the wall? A. Not then, but we have since, and I have them here; they have the mark on them.</p>

Yes: I cannot tell how long ago - I am not very often there; Mr. James lives in York-mews, nearly a mile from the wall - I was not there when the bricks were delivered; I was there about a fortnight before - I do not think the wall was built then; the foundation was laid, it was level with the ground; I took this brick from the wall this morning and washed it, to bring it decently to Court.</p>

            . I am a partner in the firm of Eastman and Co. - there are two other partners; Hill was employed by Baily, a carman in our neighbourhood - Hill lived at No. 31, Paul-street, Finsbury, and Sherrin at No. 85, Paul-street, exactly opposite - our employ of Hill took up the whole of his time. In consequence of something Hill told me, I went to Sherrin's on the 11th of November, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, with Roberts the officer, and my partner Mr. Mayne; Sherrin was at home - on first going in I asked him if he knew a person named Hill; he hesitated for a second or two, and I think he said No, but I will not be certain as to that - I said,"Hill, over the way, at No. 31;" he then said Yes, he did; I asked if he bought any articles of him - he said he had; I asked what articles - he said ginger, cloves, mace, pepper, allspice, and juice, which is the name in the trade for Spanish liquorice - he said all that in answer to the first question, and said he believed he was buying them in a fair way, because they were wrapped up and made up in a tradesman like manner; I asked if he had invoices - he said he believed he had had invoices; I asked him to produce one - he said he could not put his hands upon them, or they might have been destroyed; I said it was a very untradesman-like way of taking in goods, and asked if the ginger I saw in a glass in the window was what he took in of Hill - he said, part of it; I then asked how much ginger he bought of him - he said three pounds; I said I thought the top of that glass was what he bought of Hill - the top part which I distinguished was near upon three pounds I think; I then asked if that was all he bought of Hill - his reply was Yes; I looked further into the window, and saw another glass containing about four pounds of ginger, corresponding with the top part of the other glass - I then asked where he got the bottom part of the first glass; he said he bought that of some person in St. Mary Axe, but would not tell me who - I said it looked very strange; I asked if he had any objection to shew me the other spices he bought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040110"/>with the ginger, and he shewed me some cloves, mace, and pepper - I asked how much pepper he had bought of Hill; he said three pounds, but there was some in the drawer before - there was about three pounds and a half in the drawer which he shewed me; I asked if he had any more pepper - he said he had not a bit more pepper in the house; the officer then went behind the counter, and took a bag from under it, containing eleven pounds and a half of pepper - I knew the bag to be one of mine; the prisoner was very much agitated - the officer told him he had better shut up his shop, as he must go with him: he gave no account of how he got that eleven pounds and a half; I saw the cloves and mace - there was one pound of mace, one pound and three-quarters of cloves, and one pound and three-quarters of Spanish liquorice; the cloves and mace were in a drawer, the juice was in a glass - when the officer brought him out he wanted to go as far as Hoxton, but he was taken to the Compter: he said it was a bad job, and hoped I should not be hard with him, or words to that effect - I am sure that is the sense of the words he uttered; I had never in any way commissioned or authorised Hill to sell any goods for me at any time - the fair price in the market for ginger at that time was about 1s. 8d. I was selling to trademen for more than that in a wholesale way - I have stated the price of pepper at 1s. 3d., but it was worth 1s. 4d. to sell in like manner - cloves were worth 4s., mace about 8s., and juice about 1s. 2d.; Hill had one room only in the house where he lived - I cannot say whether I went up two flights of stairs or one, but there was no shop or any appearance of business; the price of nutmegs at that time was from 5s. 10d. to 6s. 2d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had you known Sherrin before? A. No. It would not be easy to identify Spanish liquorice, cloves or mace; those things which I could not have identified he produced - he stated how Hill had introduced himself to him, and said he sold things upon commission; the money was to be paid to the persons for whom he sold, and he had 1d. or 2d. in the pound, as the thing might be - that Hill had represented to him that his employers would sell the articles as good and as cheap as he could get any where; 1s. 6d. would be a fair price for the pepper, and 3s. or 4s. for the cloves; I believe I was talking of one of his dealings with Hill, and he said, that at that time he bought 3lbs. of ginger - I then asked if he had bought any more; he denied buying any more: I am not going to swear to the ginger - he said he had not bought more than 3lbs. of pepper - that he had never bought more than 3lbs. of ginger of Hill; I have not the least doubt the pepper found in the bag was mine, but I cannot swear to it - the bag is here; I can swear to that: I cannot state that it was in my possession at the time it was stolen - I do not recollect his saying it was a had job for him to be taken into custody; I never said to him, "Don't be alarmed - you shall not be hurt," nor any thing to that effect; I made him no promise of any kind: I believe I did say, "We shall deal no harder with you than the case requires" - that was in answer to what he said; we were at that time conveying him to prison.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did Sherrin tell you the name of Hill's employer? A. No; he did not state he had ever asked him - he said he had dealt with him more than once, and had bought some nutmegs of him, but we did not find any - a man in business might have 1s. 6d. per lb. for such ginger as this; no man would have given 9s. per lb. for cloves - he might have given 9s. per 1b. for mace, but if the cloves and mace had been mixed in equal quantities, the value would have been reduced; he said he never bought but 3lbs. of pepper of Hill, that in the drawer was the article, and he had no more in the house - I was present when the bag of pepper was found under the counter; It was rather a concealed place, I should think: in going to the Compter he spoke first to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Immediately before he said he had no more pepper in the house, had he said he had bought no more than 3lbs. of Hill? A. I believe he did - all our conversation, decidedly, related to what passed between him and Hill - I did not go behind the counter, but I understand there were many parcels: when this further quantity was found he did not say "I did not buy this of Hill"- I said I had no doubt it was mine; he did not say a word to that; I stated before the Magistrate that I told the prisoner I had no doubt the pepper in the bag was my property, and all the other articles.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Mansion-house. On the 11th of November I went with Mr. Eastman to Sherrin's shop; I went in with him, and Mr. Eastman asked him if he knew a person of the name of Hill-he said he did not; "What (says he) not Hill over the way?" Yes, he said, he did - Mr. Eastman then asked him if ever he bought any thing of Hill; Yes (he said) he had - Mr. Eastman said, "What might it be?" he said 3lbs. of ginger, and he pointed to a shew-glass which it was in - he then lifted the glass to the counter; it contained 9 1/2lbs. of ginger: he said, "The top part of it. 3lbs., is what I bought of Hill, and the remainder of a person in St. Maryaxe;" Mr. Eastman said "What price might you give for it?" he said, "A very good price;" Mr. Eastman said,"Did you have a bill with it?" he said Yes - Mr. Eastman said, "Could you produce the bill?" "No (he said) I cannot - I believe they are destroyed; I don't know what's become of them:" on looking round further Mr. Eastman saw another show-glass in the window, with 4lbs. of ginger in it - he said, "Halloo! there's some more of my ginger there," and then asked the prisoner if he bought any pepper - he said, "Yes, I bought 3lbs. of pepper of Hill:" we said, "Can you shew it?" "Yes (said be) I can," and produced a drawer with 3 1/2lbs. in it, and said,"There was a little before I put the 3lbs, in;" he was asked if he had any more pepper, and said, "No, I have no more in the house at all;" I then found a bag under the counter, with 11 1/2lbs. of pepper in it - there was a little bag of rice, and several other things there; I put the bag of pepper on the counter, and Mr. Eastman said,"That's my property - I can swear to it;" the prisoner made no reply whatever - some juice, mace, and cloves were produced; the prisoner said he bought the greater part of them of Hill - I told him he must shut up his shop and go with me, and I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were there any other persons in the shop? A. No - there was a young girl in the parlour adjoining, but he was the only person in the shop serving; I took him to the Compter, and he said to Mr. Eastman, "I hope, Sir, you will be as lenient as you possibly can, as I have given the best price for the goods;" Mr. Eastman said, "I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040111"/>cannot answer any question whatever - you must go before the Magistrate."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You went to search the house? A. Yes; Mr. Eastman pointed out the shew-glass with the 4lbs. of ginger - the prisoner said he had bought 3lbs; I am quite certain he did not say ginger, cloves, mace, allspice, and juice - I recollect that I am upon my oath; he first said ginger, and afterwards he went on with the other things; in answer to the first question, whether he bought any thing of Hill, he said 3lbs. of ginger, and that was produced before he mentioned the others; he never said he had bought cloves, mace, allspice, and juice, till we found the other things; he never said, in answer to Mr. Eastman's general question, whether he had bought things of Hill; that he had bought ginger, pepper, allspice, mace, and juice: when Mr. Eastman saw the bag, he said "That is my property;" that was before it was opened, and of course what he spoke of related only to what he could see; I never heard Mr. Eastman say he would be as lenient as the case would allow - he did not tell him not to be alarmed.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. As soon as the bag was produced, Mr. Eastman said "That is my property?" A. Yes, it was opened, and there was pepper in it; the prisoner did not then say it was what he bought; the pepper is here, and the ginger, and other articles; the prisoner said he bought ginger, and he then stated the other articles; I have stated all that I heard pass in going to the Compter -the prisoner and I walked arm and arm, and I think I must have heard what passed.</p>
               <p>MR. EASTMAN. This bag contains 11lbs. of pepper - it is marked H. and Co. - that is not the mark of our firm, but I believe we bought all that were sold of them at the Victualling-office, Debtford- it is an unusual bag to send pepper out in; I would not have sent pepper out in it; I had never sold any thing to the prisoner - there are many different sorts of pepper - our shop has different; I do not, for a moment, suppose this was taken at one time; I have no doubt I have pepper of these different qualities - some of the ginger is mixed, and it is difficult to separate; I have selected a few pieces from that which was in the first glass, which decidedly corresponds with that in the second glass; we have often missed goods from our stock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. The bag is not proper to carry out pepper? A. Certainly not; I bought these bags with some others which were more serviceable. but these were of very little use - I might use them for wiping a lamp, or any other dirty purpose; we might have put ginger into them; the pepper is of different qualities - other persons who deal in pepper may have the same qualities; I believe an application was made for the prisoner to be bailed.</p>
               <p>An affidavit made by the prisoner, Sherrin, for the purpose of being admitted to bail, was read, in which he deposed that he had known Hill about four months, and about two months ago he called at the deponent's shop, and represented that he had these articles to dispose of for a respectable house with whom he then lived; in consequence of which, he ordered, at different times, 3lbs. of ginger, 3lbs. of pepper, 1lb. of cloves, and 1lb. of mace, which were brought in about a week; that he paid 1s. 6d. a 1b. for the pepper, and 9s. for the cloves and mace; and that upon the prosecutor calling, he related the whole transaction to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I must evidently be to blame, because I must have been misled by the man; he came to me, and told me he was commissioned to sell goods, and was alallowed 2d. in the pound - I gave him an order, not thinking I was doing wrong, and when I received the goods, I little thought any thing of the bill, as he said he was employed by the house - I considered that I was doing a fair and upright transaction; I had no reason to suppose any thing else; if I had, I should not have done it; I have been seventeen years in the house.</p>

On the morning of the 2d of November I was on duty, and about five minutes before two o'clock I heard something - I went up against the houses which are building by Mr. Simmons, I heard a chopping of lead on the top of the house, and something falling at the back of the premises - I got some other watchmen, we surrounded the house; I proceeded to the back, where I saw three or four men standing over this lead, folding it up, some of them were stooping down - I caught Perrin, who was one of them - he staid with me a quarter of an hour, and then made a great resistance to getaway, but another watchman came up and he was secured, all the rest got away - two or three of them went inside the building; I was not able to discern who they were; I afterwards saw Johnson and Turner brought out of the house in custody; I have compared this lead with the roof, and it fitted exactly to the width of the gutter - I saw the end of the gutter the day before, but I did not go on the roof; I did not go up again till the 5th of November, and then I fitted the lead - there are five pieces of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You compared the width of the lead? A. Yes; these houses were building by Mr. Simmons or Mr. Brooks, I cannot tell which - I believe Turner has been employed in the buildings; I never saw the other two; Perrin said they were taking away the lead by Mr. Simmons' order -I had seen the prisoner at a public-house at eleven o'clock; they asked a boy, who was with me, to go in and drink.</p>

            . I have lately been building some houses on Mr. Brooks' ground; there were lead gutters upon two of them - Mr. Hancock supplied the lead, and I paid for it; the prisoners were all in my employ - I remember the Saturday night when this occurred; I have reasons for it: the men applied to me for their wages - I had just paid the money out of my pocket for the lead, and I went to Mr. Brooks for money to pay my men, according to a verbal agreement, but he refused to give it me; I told the prisoners to get down this lead, and I would make money of it on the Monday morning - they went a little too late.</p>
               <p>MR. SMITH. Q. Are you of opinion they went a little too late? A. Yes - they had a right to have gone when I ordered them, and then they might have got the money on the Saturday night; I did not know when they went till now.</p>

               <p>MR. SMITH. Q. Do you know that he could not get money? A. Yes; I was in the counting-house when he asked for it and could not get it - I could not hear what was said, there was such a noise; but I was outside when Simmons came out and said he could get no money.

             re-examined. Q. Did you say you should not have known him. but for Togg's boy? A. No; Good came to me and said "Have you not made a mistake in the person you have sworn to?" I said No; he said"Mrs. Marshall says there are two very suspicious lads in the skittle-ground, and she would be glad if you would come and look at them;" I said I should not; I was quite certain of his person - he was between two very large gas lamps that morning. and I had him in my grasp five minutes; if I were going to die I could take my oath of it.</p>

             re-examined. Q.Were you before the Magistrate? A. Yes; and Marshall, Dyke, Togg and Brown - Good was not there; I know him well - I am afraid he is a dangerous boy from his general character; I would not believe him on his oath.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Why would you not believe him? A.Because I have known him tell great untruths; I never knew him on his oath before - but Mrs. Marshall says she never sent him at all - it is from what she said that I state what I have on this occasion; I have had him once or twice at the watch-house for little rows, and there he proved himself a great story-teller, but I cannot charge my memory with one.</p>
               <p>MR. MARSHALL re-examined. Good is in my employ; I have a very bad opinion of him - if any loose characters come there he is always with them; I was going to discharge him on Saturday.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did your wife send him to Dyke, to come and look at the persons in the ground? A. No, she did not.</p>

On the 26th of October, about two o'clock in the morning, I heard a noise at my bed-room door; I sleep in the front-room, first-floor - the noise awoke me; I got up, looked towards the door, and saw a light through the key-hole - I called out Halloo! I heard a loud voice, and immediately heard persons running down stairs; I ran to my window, looked into the street, and saw three men come out, one after the other from the house-door of No. 10, as it appeared from the direction - they ran towards the turnpike; I sprang a rattle immediately, and lost sight of them - some watch-men came up when I was at the window, and my boy had just then run down stairs from No. 10, and got to the door: I went down stairs to the back-door, and found it open - the watchmen came in; I went with them into the kitchen of No. 11, examined the window, and found about half a pane of glass cut out: a man must have put his arm through there, and taken out an iron fastening - that would enable him to throw the window up; they appeared to have got in that way - the iron was fastened at night; it was afterwards found out in the yard: I have no doubt they had entered there. From the drawers in that kitchen I missed a silver tea-spoon and table-spoon; I missed all the property stated in the indictment, and among other things, a pair of shoes - I went to the watch-house, and found the prisoners there; I knew Morley before - he had lived a considerable time in my service, and left about two years ago- the tea-spoons were produced to me there; they were those I had missed from my kitchen; I saw the key of the street-door of No. 10, at the watch-house, and the kitchen poker. The house is in Shoreditch parish.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It appeared to you they came from No. 10, you cannot tell what door they came from? A. No; I was looking out of window and could not see the door - I could not distinguish the men; at the time - it was too dark to distinguish Morley; the was down and the window was very dirty.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You found the back-door of No. 11 open, and the key gone? A. Yes; I found the backdoor of No. 10 open when I came back.</p>

On the morning of the 27th of October, about a quarter, or twenty minutes past two, I heard a rattle spring; I ran into the road, and saw three persons running about fifty yards off, coming in a direction across the road, from Mr. Austin's house, and about twenty yards from the house, or not quite so much - I made the best of my way after them, and saw Mr. Austin's head out of window: in consequence of what he said I went after them round the new market, and turning the corner, I saw Kemp with Ousby in custody; I assisted in taking him to the watch-house - I cannot say whether he was one of the three I had seen running; as we were taking him to the watch-house, I felt something fall against my feet - it jingled on the ground; it was dark - there was nobody but we three, and Nixon, another watchman; I stooped down and picked up a spoon, which I gave to Berry, the officer - I afterwards went back and examined the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner OUSBY. Q. At the time I was going to the watch-house you had hold of one of my arms, and Kemp the other? A. Yes; I will not swear you dropped the spoon - I kicked it myself; I had seen three persons running before you were caught.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 27th of October, about ten minutes past two o'clock, I was in North-street, Finsbury-market; I heard a rattle spring, went towards the sound, and saw three men running towards the market - I followed them and tripped up Ousby, who was one of them, and took him; Morley got away, but I am certain he was one of them - I took Ousby into custody, and as we were taking him to the watch-house, I saw him put his right hand to his coat-pocket; I afterwards heard something fall to the ground, and the spoon was picked up - I had also seen him at work at his breeches-pocket; it dropped from him - I searched him at the watch-house, and found on him a key, a dark lantern, and 10d. or 1s. in copper; Morley was brought to me in the market, by Lovett, and on him I found 2 1/2d. - I knew him to be one of the men I had seen running; I afterwards asked Ousby where the money was, which the houseman had given him back - he said he had thrown it down the privy.</p>

On the 27th of October, about half-past two o'clock in the morning, I was in Long-alley, and in consequence of what I heard, I went to Crown-street and Clifton-street; I saw Morley coming from the new market, down Clifton-street, at a smartish pace; I cannot say he was running, nor yet walking - he was sixty or seventy yards from Austin's house - I took hold of him; he said "What do you want with me? What have I done?" I said "I don't know, you know best, you must come back with me" he said he should not - I took him back, and found Kemp taking Ousby along; I said "Kemp, do you want this man?" he said Yes - he identified him directly; I searched him, and found 2 1/2d. on him.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer of Mary-le-bone. On Saturday, the 22d of November, at a quarter-past seven o'clock in the morning, I was standing in Lisson-grove, at the end of Alpha-row, and saw Cox coming towards me - she had got a long grey cloak on; I saw her holding something very heavy under her cloak - I went up and asked what she had got there; she turned back her cloak, I opened a basket which she had got, and in it I found a leg and shoulder of mutton - it did not appear to have been cut by a butcher: I asked how she accounted for having it - she said a man had given it to her up the grove; I asked her if she knew who the man was- she said she never saw him before in her life; this was about a mile and a half, or three quarters from the field at Hampstead, where the sheep were kept. I asked her again if she did not know the man who gave it to her; she said No, she did not - I then asked her how she came there so early; she said she was going to Kilburn to work- I asked if she knew the party's name who she was going to work for; she said she did not - I asked if she had ever been there before - she said No, but a person had recommended her; I then inquired where she was taking the mutton to - she replied "Down this way," (meaning down the grove) I asked where to - she declined saying, and begged she might have her child before she went to prison; I asked where her child was - she said at her father and mother's where she lived: I asked her where it was - she said towards the Edgware-road, and she took me to the Junction-road; I asked her where she lived - she said next door to the baker's; I left her in charge of Wall and others, while I went to inquire, and at last found the child at No. 20. Junction-road, where she lived: I found the room-door locked - I returned back, and asked her for the key of her room-door; she gave it to me and said "I will take you where there is more, if you will go with me;" I went; unlocked the room-door with the key, and the first thing I found was a sheep's heart, a quantity of mutton fat in a dish, and in a handkerchief I found a quantity of mutton tied up, that did not appear to have been cut by a butcher; I also found a quantity of mutton in a brown pan - I left Wall in the house, and returned to Cox; she went with us to No. 2, Devonshire-street, Lisson-grove, where Lovell lived - I went into the second-floor front-room; Lovell was there with his wife - he got up and came towards me; I said, "I believe your name is Lovell - he said, "Yes, it is; I know nothing at all of the meat whatever, how it came here" - I then looked round, and on a chest of drawers I found a quantity of mutton that had not been cut by a butcher; there was a loin, breast, and something, it was cut so awkward I could not tell the joints, but there was nearly half a sheep; I found a leg of mutton in a flat rush basket, on the chest of drawers - that did not appear to have been cut by a butcher; he then turned his head towards me and said, in rather a soft voice, "Webster don't make the worst of this," (I suppose he knew me be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040120"/>fore) - he said, "You are not obliged to say you have seen it;" I said, "Yes, I am, as an officer I am bound to say it" - I then said, "Don't say any thing to hurt yourself, for I am bound to report every word you say in evidence;" he said no more - I then found in a chair, under the window, a pair of corded breeches, which were stained with blood; it appeared fresh - I said, "These are bloody, I must take them;" I then looked on the right side of the bed, and found this white navigator's jacket, also smeared with blood about the sleeves - it appeared of the same freshness as that on the breeches; we then tied the meat and clothes up and took them to the office, with Lovell and Cox-Eyres was taken about an hour afterwards, but I was not present; I saw the skin found in the field, and at the office saw the meat tried to the skin - in my judgment it certainly fitted it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was an entire sheep found? A. I think almost the whole of it, but I cannot say, from the way it was cut - the whole sheep was not fitted to the skin, but a joint here and there; it certainly corresponded as I thought; Lovell lives about a mile and three-quarters from the field.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended Eyres on the Saturday morning - after Webster and Hewitt were gone, I waited in the front-room secondfloor of the house where Cox lodged in the back-room, and about a quarter-past nine o'clock I saw Eyres go to the door of Cox's room - he tried the door, but could not get in; I had the key in my pocket - I went out, and at the door found a female speaking to Eyres; I said to her, "Is this Cox," (meaning Eyres) - she said, "No, it is not, it is Smith;" Eyres was going away from the house towards Edgware-road; I walked by his side, and saw there was a great deal of wool on his waistcoat, and his shoes were all over fresh clay - I went up to him, and said, "Smith, are you out of work;" he said he was - I then said, "As you have been inquiring after Cox I shall expect you will go back with me to the house;" he said, "I may as well go back and sit with you as any body else" - we went into the front-room; I had some suspicion of him and searched him there, and in his right-hand jacket-pocket I found this knife, all covered with fresh blood, and very greasy, as if it had been cutting fat meat, and in his right-hand waistcoat-pocket I found this cord wet, and covered with wool; there was no blood on it - I then told him I should detain him on suspicion of being concerned with Cox; he made no reply - I did not tell him for what; I waited there about an hour or more, expecting Cox's husband would come in, but he did no:- she is a married woman; I sent to Paddington watch-house for a constable to stop in the room, while I took Eyres to the office - I was present on the Sunday morning, with Webster and another young man, at Hampstead, where the skin was found; I saw the meat applied to the skin and it tallied - there were holes in the skin, which corresponded with the meat.</p>

            . I work for my father, who is a navigator, employed at Mr. Wright's, at Hampstead; we live about a quarter of a mile from this field. I was walking round Baker's field, where the sheep are kept, on Saturday, the 22d of November, about twelve o'clock in the morning, and saw a skin lying in the ditch; I went up to Mr. Baker and told him of it - I afterwards saw some mutton applied to the skin, and in my judgment it had come from that skin; I know the prisoners - I had not seen them about there; Eyres and Lovell worked for my father at Hampstead, but were not at work for a long time before this.</p>

I went with Billen to Mary-le-bone-office on the Monday as the sheep was stolen out of my field - I saw the skin at the office, and some of the meat applied to it, but did not take sufficient notice to see if it fitted; Lovell had mowed for me for three or four years, and Eyres I have known twelve years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you had a good opinion of him? A. Yes. There was a good deal of meat at the office; I saw them apply part of the loins - it was on the Monday.</p>

            . I am a butcher. I saw a skin, which Billen claimed, and saw some meat at the office on the Monday; I saw it applied to the skin - it was not cut as a butcher would cut it; I should think nearly the whole carcass was produced at the office - there were about twenty pieces, but it was not in joints; I saw one piece fitted - the head was taken off at the second joint, and the head left behind in the skin; I applied part of the neck to the head - it corresponded, and other parts, in my judgment, agreed with it; in my opinion, it was the meat that came from that skin; I have been a butcher from a child - my father was one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The necks of sheep are generally about a size? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It might have fitted hundreds of the same sized sheep? A. That is rather doubtful - it was cut in a particular manner; it appeared to have been killed within a day or two - it could not have been killed four or five days from the appearance of it; it is possible a man might be mistaken, but there are a great many people of the same opinion as myself - there are not many sheep of that size; it is a very large one - I will not swear there are not a thousand; it is possible to be mistaken as to the time it had been killed.</p>

On the 25th of October I lost some property out of the stables - I had seen the stables about nine o'clock in the morning, before the things were stolen; I cannot say whether they were locked - I was at the stables again in the evening, about seven, but did not go up stairs: the room I sleep in is not generally locked - I had seen the clothes a day or two before: I found the prisoners in custody on Monday morning, the 27th of October, and some clothes were produced which I thought to be mine - I had bought them old; I saw some coats, but cannot say whether there were four -I believe they were mine; I have a doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had some coats been taken from your room between the morning of the 25th of October and the time you saw them at the office? A. I should not like to swear that - I could not swear it: it was dark when I got up; I cannot swear I left any clothes there.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they there the night before, when you went to bed? A. There were very few things there when I went up at night; I lost things from the stable, because the things I had seen there and worn before were not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, I ask you whether the things you had there were gone in the morning? A. Yes - I did not understand you; I lost a box-coat, and saw a box-coat at the office - it did not look so fresh and so well as mine, when I saw it last; I thought it was mine, and swore it was mine to the best of my knowledge - I might have had it four months; it was of the same colour: it was very large, and would fit almost two of my size - it was very much tumbled about- I thought it was mine; I should not like to swear to it: I saw some breeches at the office, and supposed them to be mine - I had had them about the place for a week; I should be sorry to swear to them: I thought the boots mine, but cannot swear to them - there was a hat, which I believe to be mine, but there is no particular mark on it; there was a pair of new shoes - I had never worn them; they had no mark on them - I never fitted them on; I lost a pair, but should not like to swear to them - a piece of baize was produced; I suppose it to be mine, but should not like to swear to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SMITH. Q. Are you sure your name is not Davis? A. Yes; I have passed by the name of Davis when I was in a gentleman's service, but it is Davison.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 25th of October, about eleven o'clock at night, I was on my beat in Princes-street, Mary-le bone, about one hundred yards from these stables, and saw three men going along Princes-street; one of them was some distance in front of the other two - one of them was Ayres: I suspected they had something, as Ayres and another had bundles on their backs - when they had got about one hundred yards I went after them; they were walking very fast - I came up to them; they had just put their bundles down: I asked Ayres what he had got there - he said, "It is nothing to you, I dare say;" I said, "If it don't belong to me, most likely it belongs to some person - I should like to look at it;" he said there it was, I might look at it if I liked: I stooped to examine it, when he and the other man ran away - I sprang my rattle, called Stop theif! and Ayres was stopped; I saw him in five minutes, and was certain of him - the bundle he had contained a box-coat, three body coats, four waistcoats, a pair of breeches, a pair of drawers, a white neck-cloth, a pair of boots and shoes, a hat, and a piece of green baize; he was taken to Mary-le-bone office, and the things were produced: I saw Davison there on the Monday - Ayres told me at the watch-house that he was employed by two men, named David Evans and Richard Kenney, to carry these things, and they were to give him 6d. for his trouble; Kenney was taken the same night, for assaulting a watchman - I could not identify him as the man who dropped the other bundle, for he hung down his head; what he dropped was a box-coat; it was taken to the office, and seen by Davison.</p>

            . I am a baker. At a quarter-past eleven o'clock on Saturday night I stood at my shop-door, which is about two hundred yards from this stable, and saw the prisoners pass by me, in company - I am quite certain of them; Kenney was carrying something, which appeared to be a box-coat, over his shoulder - the watchman passed me just then; I saw Kenney in custody on Monday, and was quite certain of him - I did not a third man with them: I called the watchman directly they passed me, and he questioned them; Ayres ran away; and came just by me; the watchman sprang his rattle - I pursued them both; Kenney turned round Salisbury-street, and escaped - Ayres pulled off a hat, and threw it into a pond of water; the place is not a thoroughfare - he turned back, and I took him: I am quite certain of him.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Sunday morning, the 26th of October, I went with Davison to No. 10, Nightingale-street, Lisson-grove, as Davison<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040122"/>said he was robbed the overnight, and suspected Evans,(who had been in his service) was concerned; I took Evans - I found Kenney at the watch-house: he had been taken overnight - Evans saw both the prisoners at the watch-house; Ayres said, in the presence of both of them, that they were the persons who had employed him to carry the things - I said to Kenney, "Then I shall detain you;" he said nothing to it; he neither denied nor admitted it.</p>
               <p>Q. Ayres gave this account the moment you asked him? A. Yes; I took the two men by his description; Kenney was brought in on another charge.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor being again examined, looked singly at the articles produced, and refused to swear to any one of them.</p>
               <p>COURT. (Shewing him his deposition.) - Q. Look at this name of William Davison, is that your writing? A. Yes, I believe it is - I cannot say whether it was read over to me before I signed it; I was so frightened, so flurried, I did not know what I was doing; to the best of my knowledge what I swore was true.</p>
               <p>Q. You have sworn "The box-coat, three other coats, four waistcoats, a pair of kerseymere breeches, and other articles now produced by William Westby, are my property, and part of the articles stolen from my room;" that is what you have sworn - now you cannot swear to any one of them? A. I might say so; I beg pardon; I was so much frightened at the time, and the things were so tumbled about.</p>

Sir, I implore, that after this confession you will deal as leniant with us as possable, and not let the law take its course; that we are deserving of yours and the laws correction we well know, but we allso know that you cannot be so unfeeling has to deprive a fellow creature of liberty and reputation, for commiting a crime when urged to it by hungar and distress; under all curcumstances, we we will rely upon your humanity, and throw ourselves entirely upon your mercy -We remain, your verry humble servants, &amp;c, G.

            . I am a watchman; my beat joins Boyd's. I received information from Boyd, and went with Brand into the Almonry, where Carpenter has a back door; we went to the door, waited there about half a minute, and the two prisoners came out - they were seized directly; Brand took price, and I took the other - we took them to the watch-hosue; I found the house had been broken open - I did not go into the house; one of the prisoners said, "What are you at?" I said, "You must come with me."</p>

            . I am watchman of the Almonry. I received information from Cowley, and went to Carpenter's door - one of the prisoners shoved a bolt back, and as soon as the door was opened, we rushed in and secured them, and took them to the watch-house; we returned to the house, and the housebreaking implements were found just behind the door - I believe three or four doors were broken open; I found a lantern in the Almonry, about five yards from the door.</p>

               <p>PRICE's Defence. We had been spending the evening with a few friends, and in Tothill-street a female asked us to give her something to drink; we said we would, if she would take us where we could get it - she took us down the Almonry, and said, "If you will give me a shilling, I will fetch the drink;" we staid at the door, waiting for her, when this man came and took us - she is the woman who gave the information, I believe.</p>

               <p>Q.Could you at all conjecture the reason of these people having this resentment against you? A. I do not know, unless the prisoner mistook me for somebody else; or she never could have a spite against me; I am very much in dread of my life, for her family are outside here to-day, threatening my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this appear to you to have been done with a knife, or any hard thing that might have torn the flesh? A. It was done instantly; I cannot say what it was done with.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Have you any recollection of the surgeon saying he thought it must have been done by a blunt instrument? A. No, not exactly; he said it bled profusely, but was not a material hurt, and not dangerous at all; Pritchard is my brother - he was there before I went to Mrs. Matthews'; I found him there - I did not perceive that he was in liquor; I will not swear that he was sober - I swear I was sober myself; I had not been drinking at all, except one glass of gin in the morning; only one glass.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not a general row outside? A. There was nothing but confusion and riot, knocking at Matthews's door with stones, after I got in; there was quarrelling and confusion before I arrived.</p>

            . I am a watchman. The prisoner cried Murder! three times, and I came up - she said the man wanted to take liberties with her; he replied that she had robbed him, and he had got half a crown from her - he said she had got half a crown more, and a shilling; he picked up a sixpence from the ground - she said she had not got a halfpenny in the world.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was returning home, down Whitechapel, I met a person I had seen previously, who gave me sixpence to drink his health - it was so bad that no person could offer it - the prosecutor had treated me at a public-house before, and while I was waiting for the person who gave me the sixpence, he came up with two other persons, and said, "Old girl, can you tell me where I can get any thing to drink?" one of them said it was very cold - the prosecutor then said, "Come on, old girl, we are all on the look out;" we went to the side-door of a public-house - the prosecutor stood outside, and the other two called for half a pint of gin, or gin and peppermint; he then said to me, "I want to speak to you;" he went up a private place, and began to take very improper liberties with me - I said, "If you will go to a house I have no objection" - I never touched his pocket; he took nothing from me but the bad sixpence; if it had been a good one he would have sworn it was his - he thrust his hand into my bosom and under my clothes; I called out Murder! he said he would have every farthing of money I had,</p>
               <p>JOHN BLACKWELL re-examined. Q.Did you go to any public-house with her? A.There were two young men with her in a public-house: I went in and saw them, took a glass of peppermint, and then went out - I did not know them: we were not together.</p>

            , Q. Had the prisoner any pockets on? A. No, her pocket was in her stays; I found some duplicates there, but no money - the prosecutor was sober, and accused her of robbing him of 12s., but when they were both searched, the money found corresponded with what he stated.</p>

            . I got these jackets at Mr. Taylor's - the prisoner was then in custody; Mr. Taylor asked how he came to take them; he said he did not take them; he was coming from Chelsea, and another boy had them; and when he saw the lad follow him, he threw the jackets to him, and asked him to take them - he said he had done nothing, and did not run.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Was any one present when you gave him the sovereigns? A. There were two or three people in the room, but they are not here; I was in the hospital two months - when I sent to inquire for the prisoner, they said he was gone to Brighton; I did not know where he was - I went to the Magistrate, and got a warrant; he was taken in Exmouth-street on the 25th of November - I took the officer to inquire about him; I had been twice to his former lodging at Pentonville, and found he had moved to Whitecross-street; I have been in a gentleman's service, but I lost the use of my limbs, and am forced to get my bread as I can- I was in the service of Captain Thorpe, of the Blues, nine years ago, and I have been in business in the public line seven or eight years ago; I got this money by my industry and my friends.</p>

I had nothing to do with it - I was washing in the house she lives in at night; I told the person I was washing for I would come in the morning and wash up the place; I went to the door and the witness was going out for beer; she said, "Don't shut the door till I come in;" I said, "I will not;" I put on my pattens and went home; I went the next morning and the woman sent for the officer to take me.</p>
