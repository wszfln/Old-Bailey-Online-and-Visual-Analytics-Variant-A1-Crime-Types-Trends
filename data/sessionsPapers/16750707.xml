                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16750707007"/>Thus we have given you a brief account of the most remarkable Trials of this Sessions, which was very great, and took up much time, holding from Wensday until Saturday following 2 a clock, the last thing remaning is to give you an account of the Several Judgements and Condemnations that past upon the Malefactors. And first those that were capable of being admitted to the benefit of their Clergy were called to the bar, and some that could read desired that benefit, others prayed Transportation which was granted them as the Court saw cause; The Number of these to be transported were 6 in all 3 men and 3 women; The Number of those burned in the hand were 10 whereof six were men and 4 women, after which those who were to receive Judgement of death were set to the barre, and accordingly tyed up, which were 9 men and 2 women, eleven in all, whereof ten had judgement to be hanged, whereof several of them were for the aforementioned burglaries, one was a Pickpocket, two others for robbing upon the high-way, and the woman that stripped the Children of their cloaths. After judgment, she pleaded she was with Child, and thereupon a jury of matrons were impannelled to inspect her, who returned upon their Oaths that they did not find that she was quick with Child, so she was set by for Execution with the rest of the Condemned persons. Elizabeth Lillyman, the person that killed her husband, her crime being petty Treason, had judgment to be burned to ashes, when she came to the Bar, she did, as formerly, passionately request to see the body of her husband before she died, saying she could not else dye in peace. But <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16750707008"/>this action of hers, was suspected rather as a fit of raving, then the result of a considerate mind, from one who was so apparently proved to be his Murtheress.</p>
