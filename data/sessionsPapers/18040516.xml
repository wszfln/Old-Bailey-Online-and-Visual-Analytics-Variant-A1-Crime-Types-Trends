               <p>Q. Did you promise any thing to him before he said this? - A.

               <p>Q. Did they ever offer any of these to sell? - A. From information that I received, they did; the person is not here.</p>

            , you are come to speak in his favour? - A. No further than it is the first crime he has been guilty of, and somebody must lead him into it first.</p>
               <p>Q. Turner, you are the person that took and locked him up? - A. Yes, I took him on the poney.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was the poney? - A. A kind of a dun.</p>
               <p>Lilly. It is a brown mare, she has lately lost her coat, that makes her appear so.</p>
               <p>Turner. My son's master told me he was a good boy to him, and minded his business exceeding well; he told me if I could find him, he would take him back; on Wednesday, the 2d of May, about two o'clock, I catched him on this poney at the bottom of Horn's-alley, Liquorpond-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you where he got it? - A.He said he took the bridle from his master, and this bridle being on the poney, I asked him whose horse it was that he was upon; he made answer, that it belonged to his master; I made him dismount the poney, and hold her by the bridle; I drove him and the horse before me to the Mews; I then said, is there any body here that will run for an officer; immediately a person went, and the officers came in the course of ten minutes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the window put to, or only hasped? - A. There was no hasp at all to it, it is a small sash, it draws with a slide, I saw my husband put the sash to, it was only closed; I saw the prisoner put his head and arms in, and the moment I saw him I screamed out; I had seen him the same morning in the house, I know it to be the same face, I looked very stedfast at him, but the fright seized me much; he took nothing away from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your screaming out, what did he do? - A. He went to roll off from the tiles; he got up the shed and on the tiling, to get into my window; my husband got out of bed, and saw him roll off the tiles.</p>

             sworn. - I keep the Bear and Ragged-staff public-house, Whitecross-street: On the 7th of May, about half past eleven o'clock at night, I was in bed, my wife screamed out, Oh! Eldridge, here is a man coming in at the window; I immediately jumped out, and saw the prisoner go from the window, I knew his person before, I saw his body but not his face; I had suspicion before, and sat up on purpose on Saturday night to watch; a neighbour of mine told me, on Saturday the 5th, that he saw some persons of suspicious character about my house; I put my family to bed that night, there are two ways to my house, I shut up the house, and left the candle burning in the bar, and after shutting the front door, I went and walked in the street to see if any body went up; about half after one at night, I saw a man and a woman go up to the front of my house; I followed up, and saw the two prisoners close to the door; I said to them, what do you want here; I spoke to both of them; the man made answer, d - n it we only want a glass of gin; I said, you did not come after a glass of gin; the woman said, let us have a drop of gin; to have a better sight of them I went and unlocked the bar, and went into the bar, a misfortune happened, the candle went out; he said, governor, give me hold of the candle, I will get you a light; the prisoner Williams got me a light, and then I served them each with a glass of gin.</p>

               <p>Q. Having seen these prisoners so satisfactorily that night, can you say it was the prisoner at the bar that rolled off the tiles? - A. I saw them again on Monday morning; when the man rolled from the tiles, I put on my breeches, and went out immediately, I pursued them in the street; I saw the woman stand close by the tiles, she said, make haste, come along; the tiles broke where he rolled off, and one of the rafters gave way, and he fell; she said, get up, come along, make haste; I sleep in the front room, the house is back from the street, there is a shed on the right-hand side going up, at the front of the house, and any person getting on the tiles of that shed may easily get in, the window is not above a foot, or a foot and a half, from the top of the tiles; it is a sliding sash window, without any hasp.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came down, you saw the two prisoners at the bar run away? - A. I did; I saw the man go first, and the woman follow; a neighbour of mine was coming up the gateway, he said to me, it is a tallish man, and a shortish woman.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw this neighbour of your's, the prisoners then had got out of sight? - A. They got out of the gateway over to Gloucester-court, I was as quick as possible, I was not above two minutes; I then ran after them, I went over to them, and catched him by the collar; he resisted very much, made use of very bad language; he swore to me, and said, you b - y thief, what did I want; I said, what did you want, getting in at my window; he tried to get from me, and dragged me near twenty yards to a corner of an alley; the woman stuck close to him, I did not observe her assist him in any thing; there were some women standing at the end of the alley, they said, that is the thief; a neighbour was coming by, his name is Prince, and the watchman came up, and we secured them both that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when you went to bed, whether there was any thing on this chest of drawers? - A. There was a gilt metal watch, and a parcel of halfpence in the room; near to the drawers there was a club-box containing twenty or thirty pounds, about three or four yards off; and on the drawers there were about ten or a dozen shillings, I had not counted them; he had opened the window far enough that I could easily get in or out, or any middling sized man; I gave charge of them both that night; the watchman was negligent, and did not search either; I positively swore to the woman; the officer was reprimanded, and fined forty shillings, by the Magistrate; I took her up again on the Saturday following of the Monday.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH PRINCE sworn. - On the 7th of May, I was coming from my benefit-club about half past eleven at night, I saw Mr. Eldridge coming along with only his breeches and shirt on; we took the man up, and the woman followed us to the watch-house, the watchman took him to the watchhouse.</p>

             sworn. - I am a Police-officer: I apprehended the woman on the Saturday following.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Williams's defence. I had been hard to work that day, I mended two pair of shoes, and was not done till nine at night, and I had to take them as far as Tooley-street before I sold them; coming along I met this woman, and was going over the way to an alley to get some drink; this man came to me, and said, were not you up at my window; he went away, and brought another man to me, he tore my jacket; I said, if you are a constable do not use me bad; he called two watchmen, I laid hold of each of their arms, and went with them.</p>
               <p>Prince. He tried to make his escape before the watchmen came up; I did not tare his jacket, he tore my waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Nun's defence. Mr. Eldridge gave charge of me the same night; he told me, after my name was taken down in the book, I might go home, and come again in the morning; he said to me, what a d - d piece of nonsense this is, I cannot swear to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180405160007"/>Williams; tell him from me that I cannot swear to him, nor my wife neither. He made it his business to follow me to Playhouse-yard, and told me the same, and last Saturday he took me up on the same suit; he said at the watch-house he could swear to me, but he could not swear to the man.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I saw her in the street the next morning, and I said to her, tell me the truth, did you come after the club-box, or privately to rob me? she said she did not know what he was after, he was so drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her you were not positive to Williams? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prince.) When the prisoner at the bar tore your waistcoat, did he appear to be drunk? - A. He did not.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know that of your own knowledge? - A. I heard so; there was a very large dog that we left in the house; he was out of the house then; not seeing the dog, I immediately pulled the door to, and desired her to fetch the watchman; when the watchman came, I begged his lantern, and I found my bed-room had been entered by some person, and a pair of kerseymere breeches, a pair of pantaloons, a metal watch, and a toilenet waistcoat, had been taking from a large trunk in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the trunk locked? - A. No; I heard nothing of the things till about ten days; I was passing Golden-lane, and saw the kerseymere breeches in the shop of a salesman, his name is Parr; I gave him a deposit, and desired him to put them by; I went to a Magistrate, and traced them to the prisoner; on the same day she was apprehended; she denied having any knowledge of it; she said she never had them.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure this happened on the 15th day of April, on a Sunday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any violence used in order to get into your room? - A. The bed-room door was never fastened.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any violence used to the house? - A. Yes, the door must have been opened by a pick-lock key.</p>
               <p>Q. That was more likely to be used by a man than by a woman? - A. I should think so myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any of these articles till about ten days after? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner's house? - A. In Wentworth-street, Spitalfields.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know she is a married woman? - A. I think she said she was before the Magistrate, and that she lived with her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a person of the name of Abrahams, a witness, a Jew? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was taken up for this? - A. He was, on the same day.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are the officer that apprehended the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she live? - A. In Wentworth-street, Spitalfields; I apprehended Abrahams first.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a Jew? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she a married woman? - A. I have heard so; I understood that she lived with her husband, it is a private house; there appeared to be some lodgers in the house; there were four women and a man in the room; when I took her, I asked her whether that was her husband, and she said, no.</p>
               <p>LAZARUS ABRAHAMS sworn. - Q. Look at these breeches, (the breeches handed to him,) did you at any time receive these breeches from any body? - A. Yes, from Mrs. Patrick, the prisoner at the bar; I have dealt with her about three months; I received them of her on a Monday, I cannot recollect the day of the month; I bought them of her in her house; she sent an old man to my house; I have bought things of her before I bought those of her; I gave her nine shillings for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that what they are worth? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell - you shall tell? - A. They are worth ten shillings, or half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. You will swear that? - A. Yes, it is all a fancy; they are second hand, and the linings are dirty; they have been wore once.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear they are worth no more than<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180405160008"/>half a guinea? - A. I cannot swear it, it is all a fancy.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what the stuff cost? - A. No; I bought them of her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Perhaps, on recollection, you may remember that this woman is a married woman? - A. I did not enquire for that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that she lived with her husband? - A. I heard it up the court, I do not know it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you got these breeches in your possession? - A. I bought them on Monday, and on Thursday I sold them.</p>
               <p>Q. When you bought them, did you ask whose breeches they were? - A. I never enquired that.</p>
               <p>Court. You would be much more like an honest man if you did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you say any thing about these breeches till you were taken up - did you go to any Magistrate, or to any Police-officer, to give any information - you gave no information till you were taken up yourself? - A. I do not understand you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Vickery.) Q. Was there not something the matter with the woman when she was examined? - A. There was a scalded leg.</p>
               <p>- LEVI sworn. - Q. What do you know of this matter: On Monday morning, the 16th of April, I was coming through Wentworth-street, and saw Lazarus Abrahams come out of Mrs. Patrick's house; I cannot prove any more than what he told you.</p>
               <p>Court. I cannot hear that; I cannot believe him; a man that buys a new pair of breeches for nine shillings; I have a great scruple about believing him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I came up from Deptford from the regiment to see a mother that is in St. Luke's workhouse, to give her some small relief; in coming near the end of Finsbury-square I saw two towels, I picked them up, and there was a man and three boys with him; I asked him if they were his, he said they were; I said if they are your's take them.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prisoner.) Do you mean to say you never was in Drewett's house? - A. No, I had not been two hours in London; I never had nothing but the two towels.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Kennedy.) You saw him pick up the two towels? - A. I saw him and the boys pick up all the things.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him drop several things? - A. Yes, they dropped from him as he was running; first one, two, and three.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went in to buy a pair of trowsers, and I went in to pawn a handkerchief, I had not money enough; I looked at the trowsers, they were hanging up at the door; I heard them fall down, they were only tied with a string, I picked them up; he came out and collared me, he shook me so I let them fall.</p>
               <p>Q.(To witness.) Was the prisoner going when you laid hold of him? - A. No, he was standing still at the threshold of the door; he pulled them down with a sudden jerk, here is the piece of string he broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask any questions about the trowsers? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he pledge the handkerchief for? - A. Eight-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the price of the trowsers? - A. Five shillings.</p>

Old Lee; the young one had the bag; they were both together, the father and the son; they said they had been on the other side of the water, and were going to work at Tottenham; when I examined them I thought they were all stolen; Payne and I took them both to the watch-house; we went to Mr. Hobson's brick-field, where I thought they belonged, and there I found the staple drawn from the sand-house.</p>

            's defence.

I worked in Mr. Rhodes's fields, with my brother, and my brother and I had some words; and as I was going down Dalston-lane, I saw this bag lay, and the misfortune was I picked up the bag, and threw it across my shoulder; and walking across Hackney-downs I met my father; my father said, he was going to my brother John's; I told him he was not at home; he was gone to the Dock; he turned round, and went back; I walked just before him, about ten yards, and crossing the stiles these gentlemen stopped us; they asked what we had in the bag; I told them; they said, let us see; I said, by all means; I turned them out of the bag.</p>

               <p>Q. What day was it? - A. On the 8th of March, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the trunk was put on the back of the chaise - it was a one-horse chaise; the trunk was fastened with two broad straps, about three inches broad, and stuck on iron pins, about an inch in length, as I have travelled for twelve years before.

               <p>Q. What time of the day was it? - A. Between six and seven o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Immediately when you got to the inn, you looked and you observed the trunk was gone? - A. Yes, I immediately left the horse and chaise in care at the inn.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, you never saw the trunk since? - A. No; in about two minutes Oliver came to the King's Head, and gave me some information, and another man of the name of Woodland, he gave me some information.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are a goldsmith at Yarmouth? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. This happened momentarily - it happened<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180405160013"/>almost instantaneously? - A. Yes, it was very quick done.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no opportunity of observing any person in Smithfield in course, it was between six and seven o'clock in the evening? - A. There were very few people in Smithfield, it was in Long-lane I saw a number of people; I did not miss it till I got to the King's Head.</p>
               <p>Q. Being in danger, whether any thing had struck your attention at Long-lane? - A. Nothing more than I was in Long-lane.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the two prisoners at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you known them before? - A. I have known King for three years, and Mussard for two years.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this? - A. About a quarter before seven o'clock at night, I saw the gentleman's chaise coming along Long-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the same gentleman come along Smithfield? - A. Yes; he drove to the King's Head, and there he stopped; I saw King take a knife out of his pocket and cut the strap; I do not know whether it was a strap or a rope; then he took it up on his arms and put it on his left shoulder, and went towards the end of Long-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time, when you observed King cut the straps, whereabouts was the other prisoner? did you see the other prisoner there? - A. He was standing a few yards from where Ryland was standing.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they standing in Smithfield; Ryland and Mussard? - A. Just against the cross-way; it may be about a dozen yards from the chaise; Ryland was not half a yard from me, Muslin was standing two yards from me, and close to King.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Q. After King had taken away the box from the chaise, what did King do with the box? - A. He went towards Long-lane with the box on his shoulder; as soon as they left me, I went to the King's Head, and informed the gentleman of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing pass after at the end of Long-lane? - A. I saw them all three together, they were one on each side, and King in the middle.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who had the box? - A. King; King was in the middle, and Muslin and Ryland were on each side, that was all I saw then; I went to the King's Head, and informed the gentleman, he was gone to Mr. Scott's, the toy-shop; he came to me afterwards; I did not tell him then that I knew the prisoners, I described the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure these are the two men? - A. I am sure these are the two men, and Ryland was the third; and the next day I saw Ryland in Smithfield, he offered me a one-pound note, and I would not take it; King offered me a one-pound note, he was in company with three men, one of the men was of the name of Higgins; King put his hand in his pocket, and clapped me on the shoulder, and said, here, take this.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he offer it for? - A. He did not say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they see you were on the watch? - A. Yes, they saw me standing there.</p>
               <p>Q. I am talking of the day before - did they see you the day before? - A. I do not know whether they saw me or no, I saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. It was light enough for them to see you, if they had a mind to see you? - A. One of them stood close by me, about a yard off, and the other two yards off.</p>
               <p>Q. At the place where they were standing, could they see the chaise? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Q. Did any other thing pass? - A. On the Monday following, as I was going to my brother's in Golden-lane, I saw Ryland and Muslin standing together at a public-house door.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What time of the day? - A. It was in the evening, about eight o'clock; he asked me where I was going.</p>

               <p>Q. Who asked you? - A. Ryland; I said, to my brother's; he then said he wanted to speak to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop? - A. I did; he asked me what I meant to do in this business, those are the words he said to me; I said, to do that which was right; he said, if you do nothing in it, I will give you a couple of guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them was it that said that? - A. I do not know which.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the other man hear, whoever it might have been that said that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. At the time that you saw King doing the act that you were talking of, Muslin and Ryland were as far off as you were? - A. I was within three yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Muslin and Ryland were close to you? - A. Muslin was, and Ryland was about two yards off; I was standing at the cross way just where they cut the trunk from the back of the chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. At the second time you met Ryland and Muslin, how far distant was Muslin from Ryland? - A. The second time we met was at a public-house door.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear, that, talking to one man, that another man must hear? - A. He might if he liked.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180405160014"/>Q. Suppose he did not like, what then? - A. I think he must hear; I do not know which of them it was at the public-house door that said they would give me the two guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew both their persons? - A. Yes, they were both together; I do not know which was nearest.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you do not know who spoke to you? - A. No, they might both speak to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. How long have you known King? - A. Near three or four years.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to Mr. Alder, you did not tell their names? - A. I was afraid to tell him who they were, least I should get ill used.</p>
               <p>Q. So your courage enabled you to go and tell him that three men had been concerned in stealing his trunk, but your courage would not let you tell him who they were - did you tell him that you did not know who they were? - A. I do not know that I did, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. That is an odd way of swearing - am I to understand you, that you did not tell Mr. Alder you did not know who they were? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of any information did you go to his house, and when? - A. On Monday the 16th of April I went to his house opposite the Red-lion, Hampstead, I told him I was coming that way, as he had offered me a chimney-piece for sale I thought it was a good opportunity; he very readily shewed it me; when I saw it I knew it to be mine; I then asked him if he could let me have a wider shelf; he said if I liked the chimney-piece as it was I might make a wider shelf for it; I told him I wished to have it without any alteration, therefore if he could make me a shelf to suit my purpose I would call and treat with him; he said he had a shelf at Ship's that would do for me, and after a pause he said it would not, it was not so wide as that; on that same morning I called again, I saw a little slip of marble in Ship's presence that I knew to be mine; I caused the prisoner to be apprehended immediately; the slip was brought from Ship's the next day by the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Whether that stone you swear to, and this chimney-shelf which he readily shewed you, was not at one time or other to be made up in a chimney-piece for you? - A. At no time; the shelf is mason's work; he had no mason's work from us in Portland-road; he had then a small pedestal to make for us.</p>
               <p>Q. He was employed by other masters as well as you? - A. Certainly; the prisoner is a carver, he never was employed by us in doing any thing like a mason.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Ship? - A. He is a polisher of stones.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You went to this man's house under the idea of buying a chimney-piece? - A. Yes, I thought it was an opportunity of seeing whether it was mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does he get chimney-pieces from, he only being a carver? - A. I understood then from him he made chimney-pieces.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the flip of marble Mr. Cook saw at your house? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Is there any particular thing in this piece of marble that you should know it from any other person's? - A. I brought it from him, I had five or six pieces of marble to work for Mr. Waterman.</p>

               <p>- SHAFFIELD sworn. - I am an officer, I took the prisoner in custody; I produce a shelf brought from the prisoner's lodgings, I made the prisoner carry it himself, for fear he should run away; I have had it in my possession ever since; I produce another slab, brought from Mr. Cook's yard.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I told Waterman, that, if I had this stone brought from my yard to compare with that stone found upon him, he would see that nothing but a saw parted it; there is a shake in each; he said, he could not help it, he bought it of a man in the Curtain-road; he took the child from his wife, and in a moment threw it into her lap, and then run away across the fields; we went after him, and took him; I have since compared it, I am positive it was sawed off the piece of marble in my yard, because of the shake, and the black veins answer one with the other, and these corners taken off there; its rough part is taken from the rock. (The prosecutor identified the pieces of marble, by comparing them both with other pieces of marble they had been sawed from, which corresponded.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I purchased the marble of Nevill Edmonds, he lived in the Curtain-road, since that he let his yard to go to Norfolk, I paid him twelve shillings a foot for it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Do you remember the prisoner at the bar being at the last witness's house on the 19th of April? - A. Yes; I saw him take the flitch of bacon out of the door, and Tracey kept talking to Marr; I told Marr he had got his bacon; Marr went after him, and Tracey called him back; it was near half an hour before he was brought back, I saw the prisoner go to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Marr.) How long was it before you took the prisoner? - A. About a dozen minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he got home? - A. Yes, before I took him.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Murray.) Did you think he had bought it or stole it? - A. That he had stole it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him? - A. No, my leg was unshifted. (The witness had a wooden leg.) I called out to Marr, and told him to go after him; when we went to his room, he knocked me and Marr down stairs; I saw the bacon afterwards in Tracey's house.</p>
               <p>- MACARTY sworn. - I am a watchman; I took him in his own room, in company with two other watchmen; we searched his house, we found there was no bacon; he was quite stupidly drunk, I think he was not capable of bringing the bacon, he was quite drunk.</p>

             sworn. - I was at Marr's on the 19th of April; I do not think he could carry a flitch of bacon if it was ever so; the prisoner was ordered to go for a pot of beer, he was rather intoxicated at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take any bacon? - A. No, he did not; I stood by the prosecutor all the time, and he was in the shop all the time; I heard him perjure himself at Marlborough-street, first he swore that he saw the man carry the bacon out of the house, and then he said he did not.</p>

               <p>DAVID PIKE sworn. - Q. Were you the person that came up at the time the boys were engaged with the prisoner? - A. I was; it was on the 16th of April, between eight and nine o'clock; as soon as I entered the street, I heard the cry of murder; with that I hastened to the spot, and when I was very near the prisoner he began to cry out watch; the boy was crying out murder for a long time; finding he had the bundle belonging to the two boys, I asked him what he wanted with these two boys; he said he wanted to know what they had in the bundle; I took him by the collar, and said he should go to the watch-house, and give an account of himself; I took him to the watch-house, and delivered him to the constable.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. As I was returning from Mr. Showers, the Bull's Head, in Dean-street, where I had been drinking rather freely, coming up the street, I saw two boys; I asked them what they were about at that time of night; they made no answer for a long time; I suspected the boys had stole this bundle; I told them I would soon know; I immediately called out watchman; some persons came up to me, and asked me what I was about; I told them I suspected the boys had not come honestly by that bundle, and Mr. Pike and others, with me, went to the watch-house together; I was not collared; I believe the bundle was examined at the watch-house, and the watch-house keeper thought proper to detain me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

No; I cannot say which it was of the two; when they took them out they again ran away towards London; it was about four o'clock on the 14th of April; a butcher's boy was near enough to see them; he went and told my master, and Mr. Bindby, the younger, pursued them; I did not know the boys before.</p>

I went into this gentleman's shop last Saturday evening; my husband is on board of a man of war, and his brother allows me a small sum, so far as his pocket will allow; I had pledged all my clothes; I went to that shop to buy a gown, and the piece that I pitched upon was only six yards and a quarter; I told him there was not enough; he told me there was; I told him I did not wish to have less than seven yards; he rather urged me on the business; I immediately said, there was not sufficient; I bought a yard and a half for the child, and paid 2 s. 7 d 1/2. I was coming out of the shop, and he said, come back, and have that print; I told him, whenever I bought a piece of print I liked to have half a yard over to mend it; he then said I had robbed him; I told him I had not; he sent his man to get a constable; I told him he had no right to detain me; I had left my children in the street; the beadle came and took me to St. Martin's watch-house; I had a one-pound bill in my pocket; I declare to you all that I never took that piece of cotton; I did not see it; he might as well say it was forty yards as what he has.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he attend at the clearing-house on Friday the 13th of April? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of you had the key of the drawer? - A. We have no key to the drawer, the drawer pulls out with a slide; the drawers are pulled out by persons who are employed on purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner access to your drawer? - A. He had.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the book of the drafts to your house that you had from the clearing-house on that day? - A. Yes; I have no note of 45 l. 12 s. 7 d. I took account of every draft I took out of the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the power of the prisoner to take any out without your observation? - A. It was; but then it was his duty to have given them to me, if he had, I should have put it down in my book; I am certain no such draft came to my hands.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I understand, any other person, besides you, might have access to it? - A. Yes, before I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not put this in your drawer? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether any body else did you cannot say? - A. That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>JOHN SMITH sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am in the employ of Mr. Taddy, of Fenchurch-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet the prisoner on the 13th of April last? - A. Yes, in the yard of the foreign post-office at three o'clock; I knew him by the name of Oliver; he told me to meet a gentleman on purpose to get me a situation at three o'clock, and when he came out he asked me to go to Lombard-street to get the draft exchanged of 45 l. 12 s. and 7 d. I took it to Messrs. Sansom's and Co. and got it exchanged; I got bank-notes for it, I brought it to Mr. Oliver in the foreign post-office yard, I gave him the whole I received; he gave me a shilling for my trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you give any information? - A. As soon as I saw the hand-bill stuck up: As I was going to the house I met the prisoner, I took him by the collar, and told Mr. Downes's clerk, that was Mr. Oliver; the prisoner said stop; I immediately took him in backwards, I saw him searched at the Mansion-house.</p>

               <p>RICHARD WESTHEAD sworn. - I am induced to come here under the intreaties of Leetch's poor aged mother, merely to state a circumstance that I submit to your Lordship, whether it is admissible in this case: At Bow-street, the witness Conway swore that he was a clerk to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a man to be believed upon his oath? - A. I would not believe him; I have known him about three years off and on; he has been with me about five or six times; he is a depraved man, and has conducted himself very base.</p>
               <p>Conway. Mr. Westhead has sworn that I am a man of bad character; here is Mr. Westhead's character that he has written for me. (Produces it.)</p>

               <p>Q. That character is dated 1803 - so then, this man you recommended last year as an honest man, you now tell me he is not to be believed upon his oath? - A. He is as bad and as wild as possible; I do not think I could believe him upon oath.</p>

This man came to the house where I lodged on Monday night, to take a night's lodging there, at No. 11, Kingsland-road, and the next morning I got up to go to work, and I met him coming out of his room; I asked him what o'clock it was, and he told me; I worked at Leadenhall-market, in the leather market; I said it was far too late to go to work, I have lost a day's work; he said, if you want a job, I will give you a job, I will give you half-a-crown, and some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180405160029"/>victuals and drink, to take some goods that belong to me, about two miles distance; I asked him what it was; he said, when you come there, you will know what it is; he took me to a field, and he went into the ditch on one side of this field; I asked him if this was the place, and he said it was; with that he went into the ditch, and uncovered some stuff, and we took these two pieces of lead out of the bank; I lent him my apron, and he wrapped it up; he took one piece, and I took the other, till we got into a foot-path; then we met about half a dozen men that stopped us, and asked him where he was going; he told them it was his property, and they insisted upon knowing how he came by it.</p>
               <p>Rann's defence. Upon the 7th of May I went down to Blackwall to see an acquaintance of mine: on returning home, I was going past Bethnal-green, and this lead lay on one side, bare as it is now; I thought I had as much right to it as any other person, so I covered it up and went to Kingsland-road, where I lodged, and I employed him in the morning to take it away, about seven o'clock, and we were detected; I found the lead, and hired this man to assist me in taking it away.</p>

            ? - A. Yes, I have got the receipt for it, he wrote it in my presence; I paid it in Redcross-street, Cripplegate.</p>
               <p>JOHN DUNKIN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe you were a rectifier of spirits in December last? - A. Yes; I live in Redcross-street, Cripplegate; the prisoner was a clerk of mine in December last, that was before I had the misfortune to fail, and Mr. Edwards was a customer of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever account to you for a bank-note of 2 l. received of Mr. Edwards, on the 2d of December? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you your books here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Pray, Sir, how long has he lived in your service? - A. Ever since the year 1799; I found him in the house, and he has been there ever since I came into the business; he has been there twenty or thirty years.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time he was in your service he served you with fidelity? - A. I cannot say I had a good opinion of him long before this.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to speak from your memory, or from your books, that he never accounted to you for so small a sum as 2 l.? - A. From my memory, and from my books, I am persuaded that if I had received a single 2 l. I should have remembered it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What sum did you receive on the 2d of December last? - A. I do not recollect without I had the books; I have the prisoner's cash-book here, where he ought to enter all the sums he received; there is no entry of it in his cash-book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. In consequence of your having large failings to make up you were more pressing for money, the prisoner was going about in a more than ordinary way? - A. He ought to have kept a regular account, that was nothing to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you your books here besides that of the prisoner's? - A. No, his book was posted by another person; I have my clerk here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that clerk you have here post it? - A. No, he was not there at the time; all the money the prisoner received, if I was not in the way he accounted to another clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that clerk here? - A. I do not know that he is.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you ever received money from the prisoner that he has not put down in his book? - A. Yes, then I entered it in my books; I know I have never received this 2 l.</p>
               <p>Q. When were your affairs deranged? - A. On the 6th of March; I was distressed before, in December last my affairs were deranged.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever account to you for this bank-note? - A. I was not clerk there on the 2d of December last, I was gone six months before that; since I have been in town I have posted the cash-book.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Unless the word bank-notes are the indictment it will not do.</p>
               <p>Court. The Act of Parliament has enumerated what a man has to receive - money, bill, bond, notes, goods, banker's drafts, or other valuable securities or effects; we cannot convict a man for stealing of money when it is notes; the witness says he believes it to be bank-notes.</p>

            ? - A. She lodged in the same house; she is no relation; I took the prisoner up into the room and told her to mind the place; she had lived in the house three weeks.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you leave her in possession of your apartment? - A. I did; she herself called me up at five o'clock, I told her it was too soon to go out; I went out at six, my husband was out at harvest work, I came back about eight o'clock in the morning and she was gone; I missed all the things mentioned in the indictment.</p>

Yes, in the kitchen; I rented it of Mr. Dillon; I left my things in Mrs. Sulivan's room; I thought it was the safest part of the house; I am a single woman; I went out at six o'clock, selling milk; I did not come home till nine; when I came home I went into Mrs. Sulivan's room and found them gone; I saw them on the night before.</p>

               <p>Q. So you get drunk, and go to a house in Church-lane, Dyot-street, and there you continue drunk till the next day at noon; you were half-drunk and asleep all the time; what are you? - A. I am a shagreen case maker; I am sure this is the woman.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the watch ever found? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- NORMAN sworn. - I am a publican: about 2 o'clock this woman came into my house; she offered this watch to a Jew; the Jew came to me, and said she had a watch to sell; he asked me what he had best do; I told him to send for a constable; I took her by the hand and asked her her name (she was very drunk); she told me in the best manner she could, that her name was Kelly; I gave her and the watch to a constable; she said it was her husband's; both her eyes were black.</p>
               <p>- PERRY sworn. - I am an Officer: on the 14th of May Mr. Norman sent to me, and said a woman had offered a watch to sell; I took the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180405160032"/>woman, and he gave me the watch; she was very much intoxicated with liquor; she said it was her husband's watch, he was on board a sloop of war, and was going off; I said I did not think it was so; I took her to the office; Mr. Kinnaird desired me to put her into the watch-house till she was sober. (The watch produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) You know the other young woman very well, as you had been there so many hours - what is her name? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not give her the watch to pawn? - A. No; when I came away, I had about nine shillings in my pocket; I had had no supper, nor no breakfast.</p>
               <p>Q. You had had a little porter in the morning - you do not call that a breakfast? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went down to Billingsgate, and could buy nothing; I returned to the public-house facing of this bawdy-house, where he was; this gentleman and this woman were standing in this tap-room, where she was drinking; I asked her to give me some drink, and when I got a little tipsy, she told me to go home, and lay my head down till I was sober; this gentleman, after I went there, said, this is all the money I can afford at present, I will give it you if you can get any gin for it; I went out to get the gin, and broke the mug, I was so intoxicated with liquor; he got up on his elbow, and gave me the watch to pawn for a trifle of money; he bid me bring in half a pint of gin; I took the watch in one hand, and the bottle in the other, and as I was going down stairs, I broke the bottle.</p>

            : On Monday, the 26th of March last, the prisoners, Blew and Gooch, came to our shop, and asked to look at some calico; I shewed them several pieces, and they disputed about the quantity; one said they would take a whole piece of calico, and the other said only a yard and a half; Blew fixed upon one piece of calico, and agreed for the price of it, which was two guineas and a half; she said I was to send it home into Bedford-row, next door to Dr. Latham's house; they were going out of the shop, and the prisoner Gooch laid down three shillings, and said the remainder of the money should be paid when the goods were sent home. From their conduct, and from her saying she lived in Bedford-row, and she not appearing a person of that respectability, I suspected they had an intention of stealing; our porter was in the shop the whole time; he does not serve; I followed them to the door, and saw them turn the corner, into Featherstone-buildings; I called the porter, and sent him to watch where they went to.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180405160033"/>In the mean time I went to the counter to see if I missed any thing, and I missed the piece of muslin in question.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of the prisoners said they lived the next door to Dr. Latham's? - A. Blew; the other prisoner only gave me the three shillings, and called Mrs. Blew, mother, several times in the shop; I went after them to where I heard they were, at the Golden Lion, Warwick-steps, and found the prisoners there; I challenged the prisoner Blew with having the muslin, and she denied it; I sent for a constable, and ordered him to search her; she refused to be searched there by a man; she said she would be searched by a woman, and desired to be taken to the Office in Hatton-garden; I then left her, and he took her down, and delivered her to White, the officer, I went down to Hatton-garden, when she was examined in the evening.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - I am porter to Messrs. Francis: By order of my master I followed the two prisoners to watch where they went to, and I saw them go into the Golden Lion, Warwick-steps; I then went, and told my master; I went back to watch; they did not go away; when my master came, he told me to fetch a constable; they would not let the constable search them; I went down to the Office with them.</p>

             sworn. - I am in the East-India Company's service: On the 17th of May, 1809, I was present at a ball-room at Tottenham-court-road; it was between twelve and one when I went there; soon after I entered the room, Mr. Hobart came to me in the room, and informed me he had been very grossly insulted by Mr. O'Reilly; I had some conversation with him, he informed me of the substance of what Mr. O'Reilly had said to him; Mr. O'Reilly had used such language to him that no gentleman could put up with; I had some conversation with the friends of Mr. O'Reilly upon the subject.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner at the bar observe to you what was the cause of this quarrel? - A. I understood it was something that amounted to a challenge, I endeavoured to bring about a reconciliation of parties.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom and to whom did you understand the challenge to pass? - A. I understood the challenge to have passed from Mr. O'Reilly to Mr. Hobart; I soon after that left the room; I had seen both the parties before; I had known Mr. Hobart some years; I always understood he was studying law at the Temple.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe, Mr. Dixon, you have known Mr. Hobart some time? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. He has always conducted himself extremely well? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe that Mr. Hobart wished there should have been a settlement of the business? - A. I have reason to believe both from Mr. Hobart's conduct and from what I know of him, that he could not have acted otherways.</p>
               <p>Q. That he would have done every thing he could to avoid so serious a quarrel? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180405160034"/>Court. Q. Do not go by conjecture, was not there something done on his part at the ball-room? - A. I believe there was, but the offence of Mr. O'Reilly was of such a gross nature, that he could not put up with it, it could not be compromised.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Dixon, from what you know yourself, or from what you heard Mr. Hobart say; are you clear who it was that gave the challenge? - A. I always understood that it came from Mr. O'Reilly, from what passed before I came into the room; I learned it from Mr. O'Reilly's friends.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Was it in Mr. O'Reilly's presence? - A. It must be in the presence of Mr. O'Reilly's friends.</p>
               <p>Court. Unless you state facts, and was present when the challenge was given, I cannot hear that.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH DIXON sworn. - I live in Camden Town: On the 18th of May last, I saw some hackney-coaches go up the lane to Chalk Farm, about six in the evening; when I came within half a mile of <placeName id="t18040516-46-crimeloc263">Chalk Farm</placeName>

                        targets="t18040516-46-off261 t18040516-46-crimeloc263"/>, I saw a hackney-coach stand in the lane some distance from the house; as I drew nearer, I saw a second coach, and as I came nearer the farm, I saw some gentlemen standing, and as I drew nearer, I saw two parties, there might be five or six gentlemen in each party; I saw no coachman on the box, I thought there was a duel going forwards; I turned down the lane to the right hand to where the gentlemen were conversing; they seemed to look stedfast at me, whether they thought me an officer I know not; before I got to the end of the lane the third coach came very rapid indeed; I stopped, and saw two gentlemen come out; I went to the coachman, and asked him if he knew what was going forwards; then I observed the gentlemen go up to one of the parties in the lane, they were in three separate parties on the Hampstead side of the house; seeing them getting into the fields in two different directions, I hastened round the gate to get into the field, anxious to know what was going forwards; they got out of that field into the next, I observed them taking their ground, when I was at the hedge, then I got into the field where they were; I saw the two gentlemen placed in their situations, standing opposite to each other, back to back; they were fifteen or sixteen paces from each other, and a gentleman stood nearly in the centre between them; he gave the signal, I believe the signal was one, two; he stood wide of them, then they fired; I saw one of the gentlemen put his hand to the right hand side of his hip, then I saw them take him to the farm, he did not fall, his friends that were of the group supported him, or else he would have fallen, he seemed to totter, and the man that fired ran away; I did not take notice of their persons so as to know them again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you follow this unhappy man to the farm? - A. I did, and I saw him after the ball was extracted up stairs, he looked in a dying state as I thought.</p>
               <p>JOHN RUTHERFORD sworn. - On the 18th of May I saw two gentlemen take a position, and then fire, they were about fifteen or sixteen paces distant; they stood in a field the north side of Chalk Farm; I did not see nor hear the signal given, I heard them fire, I was about thirty yards off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them fire? - A. No, I heard them fire it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pistols did you hear fire? - A. I only heard one; I am not confident, it might be two; I only heard one report; I saw one of the gentlemen put his hand to his hip, and run towards Chalk Farm, his friend ran after him to assist him; I observed the other man run away, I believe there were two or three with him; he ran towards Haverstock-hill as if he was going to Hampstead; I saw the whole of the transaction, my father keeps the house called Chalk Farm, I saw him after the ball was extracted, he appeared in a dying state; he died on Thursday, the day after, about three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to say that the prisoner was one of the two that stood opposite to each other? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>CHARLES MONTAGUE sworn. - I am a surgeon, I was dining at Chalk Farm on the 18th of May, when this accident happened; I was called from my dinner to attend him, about five or six in the evening; I had known Mr. O'Reilly some years before in the East Indies; they were bringing him to the farm, I saw the wound, I had him carried into the house, and extracted the ball.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state did you find him? - A. I found a little wound upon the right hip, I discovered the hall upon the opposite side, and extracted it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it nearly perforated the other side so that you made no deeper incision for it? - A. It had.</p>
               <p>Q. From the direction you have described, it must have passed through the lower extremities? - A. From circumstances afterwards it certainly must, at first I did not suspect it had; I saw him on the morning the next day, I dressed him, I saw him sinking, I had little hopes then; I left him about ten o'clock, I did not go to him again, they brought me word that he died about three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you of opinion that the shot you extracted was a pistol ball? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you of opinion that that was the cause of his death? - A. I am clearly so.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not notice the persons that were engaged? - A. Not till I took hold of the deceased; I assisted in taking him to Chalk Farm, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180405160035"/>dressed his wound, I have no doubt it was the cause of his death; I saw him on the morning prior to his decease, he told me his antagonist had offered to compromise matters with him, but he had refused; he did not say his name.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Dixon.) How long have you known him? - A. Five years before I went to the East Indies, we lodged in a house together for about two months.</p>
               <p>Q. After that time you went to India, how long did you stay in India? - A. Till last year, January, 1803, since then I have met him once or twice a month at dinner, and within these last two months he has called on me, and I have called on him at his lodgings; I have seen him walking about the town, he lodged in South Moulton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand that you have at times used some endeavour to persuade him to come forward? - A. I cannot exactly say how to answer that question, I do not know the law; when he was before Sir

               <p>Q. When you gave this advice, did the prisoner deny it? - A. He never directly denied it, nor indirectly told me any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of your advice, he appeared before Sir Richard Ford? - A. He did, but not entirely in consequence of my advice.</p>

               <p>Court. As to your ill usage I do not believe.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you not been in the habit of bailing together in the Court of Westminster? - A. There were two friends of mine had a dispute, and one arrested the other, they were in the Lock-up-house; and there was a certain man in St. Giles's became bail for him, and asked me if I would become bail for him in the Lock-up-house; they brought Badden in with them, and made a third bail at the Lock-up-house, but I never bailed Badden any where, nor ever assisted to bail with him, ever since I was born but then.</p>

No such a man as me demanded twenty pounds of Mr. Carr, no such thing; I made several enquiries after Carr, I had notice from Mr. White, I found out where Carr lived after I received a letter from Mr. White, I told Mr. White where he did live, he ran away; I have seen him in the street many a time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that you were liable to pay the five hundred pounds? - A. Mr. White told me I should be in a pretty situation if I did not find him out.</p>

I asked them whether this could not be settled without their taking us away; they said, no, they must do their duty; they took me and my son-in-law to a public-house, the side of the Poultry-Compter; then they asked if we had any body to come forward on our behalf. I answered I would send to a friend, this was about ten o'clock; they said I might, and I did send to a friend; they found a person to go for me to Mr. Wells; he did not come;

               <p>Q. Did Mr. Cooper say what he wanted that twenty guineas for? - Q. Then he said he would return the papers, and keep the informer back; Mr. Shearman went away, and returned with sixteen pounds; he asked me if I had enough to make it twenty guineas; I told him I had none in my pocket; my son-in-law had three pounds, that made it nineteen pounds; Mr. Shearman rolled the nineteen pounds up, and tendered it down to Mr. Cooper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Cooper say any thing? - A.

               <p>Q. But the papers upon the witnesses table, Mr. Cooper presented to the Lord-Mayor? - A. He did; there was nothing appeared against me, on account of that paper; my Lord was pleased to fine me five pounds, which I was to pay before I was released; I did not pay the five pounds then, I went back to the Compter; my son-in-law paid that.</p>
               <p>Q. After that did you do any thing respecting this prosecution? - A. Yes, on the Friday following, I did, I was persuaded; I went to the Marshal; I saw the Lord-Mayor, and told him the same story as I have here, as near as I can recollect.</p>

               <p>JOHN BAILEY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Vaillant. Q. Are you son in-law to Mr. French, the last witness? - A. I am; Cooper and Howard came right into my father's apartment; they saw my father with a paper on the table, and some women in the room; they said they had an information against him for taking illegal insurances, and that he must go with them; they searched the women in the room, and let them go; my father asked if it could not be made up without going out of his own place; they said, no. Howard said he would be agreeable to any thing that Cooper was agreeable to; they searched me, and took two or three papers from me; I had put them in my pocket. When they came in, they took my father's papers that were lying on the table, and they took us to a public-house inside of the Compter; they brought out a book, and took our names down; they asked my father if he had any friends to come forward; my father had sent for a friend, and Mr. Shearman came; Shearman spoke to Cooper, I cannot rightly say what he said; I heard Cooper say to Mr. Shearman, twenty guineas; Mr. Shearman went out, and returned in about a quarter of an hour; he brought sixteen pounds in notes with him. When he came in, he said, French, I cannot get any more than sixteen pounds; he said, you must make it up; my father said he had none; he said to me, John, what money have you; I said I had got three pounds; I laid it on the table, and Shearman put it up with the sixteen pounds; he rolled up the sixteen pounds and the three pounds together. Cooper said, chuck them down any where; he chucked them down in the next bench to where we were sitting; Cooper went, and picked them up; then he said, let us go into the next room, there is a good fire there; and when we had been there about five minutes, he said, do not look so chearful, look as you did when you first came in. They gave all the papers back to my father but two; we went to the Mansion-house before the Lord-Mayor, and there two papers were produced; my father was fined five pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the five pounds? - A. Yes, I gave it to Cooper; Cooper said, do not give it before any body; my father said, have I occasion to go before the Lord-Mayor again; with that, I walked down the yard, and gave him the five pounds; with that, he said you are cleared, by paying the jail fees.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You and your father were fined five pounds? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>ROBERT SHEARMAN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. I live at No. 25, Belvidere-place, Borough-road: On the 4th of February last, I went, at the request of Mr. Wells, to the Poultry-Compter, there I saw Mr. French, Bailey, and Cooper, I never saw Howard before this day, they were the only persons that were in the room, to the best of my recollection, there was a girl that came in to light the fire; when I went in, I asked Mr. French what was the matter; he told me he had been taken up for insuring in the lottery; Cooper, or French, said, (I think it was French) it would be all settled for twenty guineas; I am not positive, I think it was French.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it said in Cooper's hearing? - A. I was sitting between Cooper and French; Cooper said, nothing less than twenty guineas would do; upon which I said I had no twenty guineas, I would go back and inform Mr. Wells; I went out, and returned in about a quarter of an hour; I brought with me twenty pounds, but when I came in, I thought the sum so extravagant, I said, French, I have brought from your friend sixteen pounds, this is all he will give, and I am not authorised to give it, without you will pay it by instalments; upon which French asked his son-in-law (Bailey) if he had any money; Bailey took out three pounds, and said it was all that he had; I took the three pounds, and put it to the sixteen pounds. Previous to that, Cooper said, I will not take any thing, but you may throw it down in any corner, it will answer the same purpose; I took the sixteen pounds and the three pounds, and rolled them together, and threw the whole over the partition of the boxes; there was a curtain between us and the next box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body pick it up? - A. Cooper<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180405160040"/>picked it up, and insisted on having two pounds more before I left the room, to make it up twenty guineas; I said to Cooper, if nothing else will do, I will give you the other two pounds at the Dolphin, on Ludgate-hill, if you will meet me there this evening; he met me there that evening at the public-house; I did not give him the other two pounds.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What sort of life are you in; how do you live? - A. I live as you do.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been before a Magistrate; you had the impudence to say, you lived as I did; have you ever been in gaol? - A. I have for debt and for the lottery.</p>
               <p>Q. For selling illegal policies? - A. I had the opinion of the first lawyers in the kingdom that they were legal; I have been before the Lord Mayor; I was before a Magistrate once before, and once at Hick's hall, a man took me in the street for the little-go.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you live? - A. I have had a liberal education; I have in my present employ two guineas a week, and I earn a guinea now and then, when I can; I settle matters between people.</p>
