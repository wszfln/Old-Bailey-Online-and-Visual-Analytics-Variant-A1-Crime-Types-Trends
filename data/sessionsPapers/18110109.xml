            . On the evening of the 2nd of January, after my labour was over, I went to buy a jacket in Whitechapel, I called in at the King's Arms public-house in Wentworth-street, about nine o'clock, I staid there about an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any liquor before you went there - A. I had three glasses of gin, and some small beer in the course of the day, and one pint of porter there and no more. About a quarter after nine I pulled out a dollar, one of the men in the public-house knocked it out of my hand, and put out the light.</p>
               <p>Q. What men - did you know them - A. I had seen them there that night; the prisoner was one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your dollar again - A. No; the candle was lighted again, and I made a sad noise with them about it; I made a complaint to every one there and the landlord heard me; I staid in the house till about half after ten, and then we were all turned out of the house; I was going towards home, I was knocked down; there were five of them; I cannot say who it was that knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. You were in a public street then - A. Yes. After I recovered myself they followed me about an hundred yards, they then surrounded me and put me again a dead wall, stretched my arms out, one held me by my throat, and stretched my jaws open; the prisoner was at work at my pocket, his hands were in my pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what you had in your pocket at that time - A. Yes, three dollars and three shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you counted that money after you lost the dollar in the room - A. No, but I am certain it was safe. I took the money out of my pocket, and put the remainder in, and I had not taken it out afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us that the prisoner had his hands in your pocket, had any other person his hand in your pocket - A. There was another besides him, there was one hand in each pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say any thing to you at this time - A. They said nothing, only surrounded me; the prisoner, after he had got the money from me, he said, let the b - r go; I immediately received a heavy blow on my head; the prisoner was standing at my right side, and had his hand in my pocket, where my money was; I heard the money rattle when his hand was in my pocket, and they left me with my breeches down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they search any of your other pockets - A. They searched all of them, they gave me a violent blow before they left me; I was quite senseless; when I came to myself I looked round, I found they were gone; I buttoned up my breeches and went home.</p>
               <p>Q. This was on a Wednesday night - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after the Wednesday night did you see the prisoner again - A. On the Thursday morning following.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it, dark or light - A. A lightish night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it star light or moon light - A. I did not take that notice.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you light enough in the public house to distinguish the prisoner - A. Yes; before I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came out he followed you, and they said nothing to you - A. Not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you could not know his voice so as to know him again - A. There was a lighted lamp against the dead wall where they robbed me, it was about an an hundred yards from the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us what quantity of liquor you had in the day, I now ask you whether you was drunk or sober - A. I was as sober as I am now; I was neither drunk or sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in that state now - A. No. I had the liquor in me, drunk I was not. I saw the prisoner in Norton Faldgate on the Thursday, and the officer took him on the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you take so much notice of the prisoner in the house - A. Why they were tossing up for liquor I suppose, and I, like another foolish young man, was looking on.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you partly certain that the prisoner was one of the persons in the house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your money in your breeches pocket or your jacket pocket - A. It was in my fob pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they let down your breeches before you heard the money rattle or afterwards - A. They undid my breeches at the very first start; the prisoner had his hand in my fob pocket, and after they left my pocket my breeches fell down, and when they left me all my money was gone.</p>

The prisoner made no complaint untill I called the watchman, he then told the watchman that he had dropped a dollar in the house, and somebody had picked it up, he made<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181101090004"/>no complaint of any body having used him ill.</p>

Yes, I was present when she was tried and convicted in September session 1809, she was ordered to be imprisoned in New Prison, Clerkenwell, one year and at the expiration of that time to find sureties for her good behaviour for two years more; she staid in the prison that time and found sureties and was discharged; I am positive she is the person, I know her very well.</p>
               <p>JOHN COBHAM. Q. You are a potatoe merchant - A. Yes, I live in David-street, Berkley-square. On Saturday the 15 of December about a quarter past five in the evening the prisoner asked me if I had any kidney potatoes, I told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181101090006"/>her I had, she desired two pound of the best, I weighed her two pound and there were rather more, she said never mind make it three, they came to three pence, she gave me a bad shilling, this is the shilling, I returned it to her instantly, it is a crooked shilling; I stated to her it was a bad one, I expostulated to her on putting off bad money at that time of the night, because it was an hour we often take bad money at our shop; she was about a minute and a half searching her pocket, at last she produced a sixpence very much battered saying very likely you may not approve of this, I have no other silver except a dollar which I do not like to change; which dollar afterwards upon searching her I never found.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards searched her and found that shilling upon her - A. Yes, about a quarter of an hour after I searched her in Mr. Clarke's shop and found this shilling in her hand, that she had offered to me with three others; I found another bad shilling and a sixpence in her pocket. I did not approve of the battered sixpence, I returned it her; she then left my shop desiring me to leave the potatoes in the scale she would return for them. I followed her at a distance, I saw her cross over to a public house and look in at the window, she did not go in there, I then followed her to Mr. Clarke's a butcher in Grovesnor-market, she took up a piece of meat smelled it and put it down again, she then went to Mr. Clarke's shop; I crossed opposite, it is very narrow there, I could see her, I heard Mr. Clarke ring a shilling upon a block, it sounded bad, I saw her come out of the shop and as she came out I went in, I asked Mr. Clarke if she had given him a bad shilling, she was not within hearing, Mr. Clarke went after her and brought her back, Mrs. Clarke returned the shilling to her, I seized her wrist instantly and took four shillings out of her hand, her hand was clenched, three of the shillings were wet; I asked her where is the shilling that you gave me, she said where; I said at the potatoe warehouse; she then begged for mercy, she said she was an unfortunate woman, she would give me any thing to let her go. I took her to the watchhouse, she got behind a chair, rather in the dark, she untied her pockets, I picked them up and examined them, I found five shillings and ten pence three farthings in copper, a penny bread cake, a penny plum bun, two tarts, two skains of thread, a box of salve, and this terner's cerat, I then took her to Marlborough-street. This is the money that was taken out of her hand, and this is the money that was found in her pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you to bring any thing back - A. He did not mention any thing of the kind, I was to come back.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181101090007"/>When I got to Greenwood and Cox I gave the paper to one of the clerks there, I do not know the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. After being kept there some time did you come back to the London-road - A. Some gentleman came to me, and told me to follow him after some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go back with some gentlemen to the London-road - A. Yes, in a hackney coach part of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. As you went along did either of them give you any thing - A. Yes, they gave me two papers, which they told me was two ten pound notes; I was to give them to the same person that sent me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to the coffee-house did you see the person that sent you - A. Yes, that person was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give that person those two ten pound notes - A. To the best of my remembrance I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know you did - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was that the same person that gave you the other paper, and that sent you first of the errand - A. To the best of my remembrance it was, I should not like to swear.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Have you any doubt that the person that you gave the two ten pound notes was the same person that gave you the first paper - A. I think it was the same.</p>
               <p>COURT. Why you would not have given it any other man, would you - A. No. I believe it to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that man at the coffee-house give you at first one paper or two - A. There was something wrapped up in another bit of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you something wrapped up in a bit of paper - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the paper which you took to the gentleman who afterwards came back with you in the coach - A. I took it with me where I was ordered.</p>

On the 21st of November Parker came to the office, when he came to my desk where I was writing the bill was laid down, I did not see who laid it down, he came to my desk where I was writing, I took up the bill, looked at it, and also looked at the endorsement, and asked him whether he brought that bill, he said he did, I then asked him from whence he brought it, he said, from a coffee-house in the London-road, but he could not tell me the name of it.

             is major in the Queen's regiment, and lieutenant-colonel in the army. I have been accustomed to pay money on his drafts about two years, I believe it not to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your detecting it not to be Mr. Ramsey's hand-writing did you shew it to Mr. Hume - A. I did; I gave it to Mr. Hume, and he took the other steps. There was no other person near the bill when I took it up.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Hume. Was that bill shewn you by Mr. Downes as he has represented - A. This bill was given me by Mr. Downes, I have been familiar with Mr. Ramsey's hand-writing about five years, I think it is not his hand-writing, it does not resemble it.</p>
               <p>Q. After the bill was shewn you by Mr. Downes did you send to Bow-street for two officers - A. I went for them myself, and went with Parker and them to the London-road. In my way I gave Parker two ten pound notes, I desired him to give the notes to the gentleman who had delivered him the bill. When we got near there I left Parker and the officers at the Circus; I staid behind, they went before me, and I followed them.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after them did you enter the coffee-house - A. I should think about seven or eight minutes, at that time the prisoner was with the officers in the back room, and Parker was there also, and the bill was in the room, either in my possession or in the officers. When I went in the room one of the officers was asking him from whom he got that bill, he said immediately that he had got it yesterday, from colonel Ramsey himself at the British coffee-house, he made that assertion more than once while in that room; I asked him whether he had ever been an officer in the 2d regiment, the Queen's, of which colonel Ramsey is major, he said he had. Then he was brought away to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. In point of fact you know that this unfortunate man has been an officer - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you were talking to the prisoner about the bill that you hold in your hand was it shewn to the prisoner - A. I now remember that the bill was not out of my hand untill I went to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Then at the time you were talking to the prisoner the bill was not produced - A. I cannot charge my memory with it.</p>

I do not believe I mentioned Cox and Greenwood, he admitted that he had; I then desired Parker to give the gentleman the money, he gave the prisoner the two ten pound notes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner do with them - A. I do not believe he put them in his pocket; I took them out of his hand, he had either got it in his waistcoat pocket, or was going; I then told him I had a suspicion it was a forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not told him before that you suspected any thing - A. No, he seemed confused, and said he had received it of major or colonel Ramsey at a coffee-house in Cockspur-street, and he said he had been an ensign in the regiment that major or colonel Ramsey belonged to, but at that time he was in a West India regiment; these are the bank notes I took from him.</p>

               <p>Q. You heard a noise - A. Yes, I heard a noise down in the kitchen and the kitchen door banged after her; I went with my landlord into some ruins behind my house, I found the prisoner lying down upon the top of the bundle in an alley; I took hold of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you bring in the things that she lay over A. Yes, and she together; I gave the things to the officer. The prisoner had been a servant to me once, she ran away and we missed some things.</p>

            When you brought her into the house did you examine the kitchen - A. Yes, she climbed over the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see her there, and therefore you do not know that - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the doors and windows of the kitchen - A. Yes, the windows were all fast, the back door was open, she unbolted it to get out; there are two back doors to get out into a yard, and both back doors were open.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see her unbolt it, therefore you do not know, both the back doors were open - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out of the back doors did you find them both open - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen these doors on the over night, were they both open or shut - A. They were both shut, the servant girl shut them, they were bolted on the inside, they could not be opened on the outside. The person must have come in at the parlour window, the blinds bolted inside of the window; we found the blinds put upon the leads on the outside, she had shut down the window, she had unbolted the blinds and put them on the outside on the leads; the window blinds were always bolted day and night.</p>
               <p>Q. When you brought the prisoner and the things into the house what did you do next - A. I sent for the officer,

             BOYES. On the evening of the 23th of December about a quarter past six I saw some person creeping under the wall of <placeName id="t18110109-11-crimeloc67">St. Botolph's wharf</placeName>

               <p>Q. There were some hair upon Fresh wharf - A. Yes, there were, and no where else on the Quays besides; it was about fifty yards from Fresh wharf where I stopped the prisoner, he was coming from Fresh wharf Mr. Mallough came and recognized the prisoner having been at Fresh wharf a night or two before. Mr. Mallough fetched an officer, I delivered the prisoner and the hair to the officer. I went and examined a bale on Fresh wharf, it was cut and a quantity of hair taken out.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence: I went to the Quay to see a shipmate of mine and turning back I got that on the Quay, I took it up in my arms and coming along a man asked me what I had got, I told him I believed it was hair, I threw it down.</p>

On Friday evening, the 7th of December, I was in the shop, a man came in the shop to look at some handkerchiefs, another man then came in and took a parcel of ginghams that laid on the counter without saying any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take them - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they wrapped up - A. They were laying in a pile on the top of the others, near the door; when he had taken them up he put them on his shoulder and walked out of the shop with them, without saying any thing.</p>

               <p>Q. You keep these two shops and occupy both the houses - A. Yes; the shops are the lower part of the houses.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect being in one of the shops, and being called to by your daughter - A. On Monday evening my daughter called father, and said a man has taken a bundle of ginghams from the other shop, and the moment it was mentioned, I went out at the door, I saw a man about fifteen paces from the door, he had the ginghams which we have here, he had shifted them from his shoulder to his front, he was going as fast as he conveniently could, with the bundle to the corner of Union-street, I caught him and clasped him as far as I could with the goods in my arms, I seized him and the bundle at the same time, I saw him drop the bundle, he gave me a twist and I fell, I got up again, and instantly pursued him, and at a door in Union-street, about thirty paces I caught him again; I did not lose sight of him all the time, it was a bright moonlight night.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the man that you caught again at the distance of thirty paces was the man that you first laid hold of - A. Yes, I noticed his voice and person; when I first caught him he said some man has put them in my arms; I knew him to be the same man, there was no person in the street at the time, not even of the other side of the way; I got hold of him a second time, and by a twist again, or some how or other I fell in the dirt again; I lost my hold, but I never lost sight of him; he was off immediately, I was after him in a moment, I was not three paces behind him, he passed Little Union-street into Piccadilly, and rushed up against the dead wall of St. James's church, and in my attempting to lay hold of his collar I slipped down again and caught hold of the tail of his coat, a gentleman then came up, and we carried him to St. James's watchhouse, and from there to Marlborough-street office.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear positively that the man that you carried to St. James's watchhouse was the man that you saw fifteen paces from your door with the ginghams - A. I took notice of his person and voice, I am most assuredly certain he is the person; I never lost sight of him, it was a very moonlight night.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the ginghams - A. One of my young people followed me and picked the ginghams from off the ground. I can swear to the ginghams. I pursued the man; I saw the young person take up part<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181101090014"/>of the ginghams.</p>
               <p>Q. Where she took them you do not know - A. They were taken to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she not to be here - A. I did not think her evidence to be necessary. I saw the ginghams as plain in his arms as I see your lordship.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw them in his arms could you take sufficient notice to know they were your ginghams - A. No, only from the alarm; I could not distinguish they were mine, or any one else's. St. James's is very well lighted, I could see they were ginghams; I could not see any mark upon them then.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that young person before the magistrate - A. No. I believe they informed me that it was not necessary; I asked the question.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was taken to the watchhouse did anything pass there - A. No; I was so short of breath, and hurt by the fall, I could not speak.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed the place where these ginghams were before the alarm - A. Yes, they were about a yard upon the counter, all upon one pile, and when I returned a great part of the pile were gone. When I came back I found some of my ginghams in the shop all over mud, and they were part of that pile which I had been before.</p>
               <p>- BURTON. I am an officer of Marlborough-street. The ginghams I produce were brought into the office by Mr. Brooks, and the daughter, and an officer belonging to the parish; they were put into my custody, I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. to Miss Brooks. You say you saw nothing more of the man that took the things until the next morning you saw him at the office - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not taken sufficient notice to know the man again - A. I did not see his face, by his size it was the prisoner to the best of my belief; I thought so the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay in the shop after you had given the alarm, and your father went in the pursuit - A. I staid in the shop the whole of the time.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were in the shop did you see any thing done with respect to them ginghams, or any body bring them in - A. The young person that took them up that belonged to the shop, she brought them in; she followed my father out.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after she had gone out did she bring in any thing - A. She brought them in in about eight or nine minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw her go out after your father, did you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you did not see her pick up any thing - A. No. She brought in a parcel of ginghams all over mud, they were the same ginghams that had been upon the pile.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the ginghams that lay there - A. They are; I have looked at them before, I am certain they are my father's property, there is two hundred and ninety yards and there is a mark upon them; they are of the value of eleven pounds eighteen shillings and sixpence: we put them down eleven pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Brooks. Have you looked at these ginghams - A. I have looked at them, and put my seal upon them; they have my private mark, I am sure they are mine; I have put them down at a low value, at three parts of the price.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming along Glasshouse-street, at the end of Glasshouse-street I saw a mob, Mr. Brooks was in the middle of the mob; he said he is gone, and then he saw me, he said, that is him, I will swear to him.</p>

               <p>Q. How is the entrance into the yard - A. The entrance of the large yard is by a gateway from the street. There is a communication from my house into the yard; I live upon the premises, the premises are the property of the partnership; my house is in front. The warehouse is connected with the dwelling-house but there is no communication.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your partners reside in the dwelling-house - A. Occasionally. My father resides in the country; when he comes to town he resides there as a visitor to me, I reside constantly there.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the only one that resides there - A. Yes, constantly. On Saturday evening, the 5th instant, about the hour of ten o'clock, I was alarmed by the springing of a rattle, I went down stairs into the yard, I saw the watchman employed by us; we entered the warehouse through the window; the shutter had been broken through; upon searching the premises we discovered the prisoner, she was in one corner of the warehouse, concealed under a kind of a bench.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards find that any thing had been stolen - A. No.</p>

            , a waterman, on the stand, told me he had searched the rank of hackney coaches; he could not find any coach belonging to the prisoner; I directly took hold of him on suspicion of stealing the coat; he had been offering the coat for sale. When I had got within a few yards of the watch-house, I had hold of one cuff of the coat, the prisoner gave a twist, the coat came off in my arms, he got away. I pursued him; he was stopped by a watchman; he was not out of my sight, nor two minutes from me, until I got him again. I took him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>JAMES HALE. Q. Did you apprehend this man in conjunction with Wood - A. Yes. The coat being a big one, and he a little man, he made a ruslt, and sprang out of the coat; I am sure he is the man, he was not from us above a minute and a half. We never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked that coat up in Couson-street, Mayfair, about eleven o'clock at night; I had a long way to go to my lodging in Water-lane, Blackfriers, and as I was locked out I went to get into a watering-house I told them I had a coach on the stand on purpose for them to let me in, and I had not been in a minute before the waterman asked me if I would sell the coat, I told him I did not know. I am as innocent of stealing the coat as a child unborn.</p>

I found two of the shop window shutters taken down, they had been barred on the outside, and by getting them above the hooks they might be taken down. A pane of glass was cut out of the shop window so as to put an arm in. I went to bed about eleven, the shutters were put up and fast, there was no pane of glass broke; I missed cheese, butter, and lard, but what quantity of cheese I could not tell at the time; there were a pile of cheese in the window, the whole pile was gone, and the pile stood right opposite of the glass that was broken.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any butter standing there - A. Yes; it was gone, and the lard was gone, they were all within an arms reach of that broken window. The watchman told me they had taken up a person with such articles. The next morning at ten o'clock I went to the watch-house, I saw the prisoner in custody, three cheeses, about eight or ten pound of lard, and four or five pound of butter.</p>

The watchman that I called picked up the property, and I saw the other man drop it; there were three cheeses, and four lumps of butter.

               <p>Q. Could you distinguish it was one of the three men that gave you the blow - A. Yes, it was one of the three men; that blow was given at the same instant the person took the seal; or perhaps a few seconds after, it was not before. After I perceived it I turned round, and then I had the blow, just as the other was running. I then discovered that they had robbed me. I immediately pursued the thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the man that had taken the seal, key, and ribbon - A. Yes, he ran away and I pursued him.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the man that gave you the blow - A. I did not see him. I followed the man that took the seal and key towards Finsbury-square to Providence-row, I kept him in sight all the way, at the lower end of Providence-row, he struck against a post and fell, he immediately got up again, and ran across Wilson-street, I did not catch him. Crossing Wilson-street he fell again, and I collared him; I kept my hold of him; several watchman came up, I gave him in charge of two of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you kept the man in sight all the time - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the man that you gave in charge was the same man that had taken your seal and key - A. I am positive of it. It was a fine clear frosty night. I requested two of the watchmen that were there to look after the seal; I was certain he had not dropped it before he came there; it was a clear night, I could have seen it. It was brought to me the next day. I went to the watchhouse with the prisoner Cox.</p>
               <p>Q. And that was the prisoner Cox that you so secured - A. Yes, he was searched at the watchhouse, the seal and key was not found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice at all of the man who snatched at you seal and key at the time that he did it - A. I took notice of him particularly; I know his person; I could not perceive his face; I kept him in sight, and took him to the watchhouse; I am certain Cox is the person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of the man that gave you the blow - A. No. I observed three together, I believe Botwright to be one of the three.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been along with this master a year and a half; he lost some money last Christmas. My master saw this watch; he asked me where I got that watch. I got money before I came to London. I brought this money from Ireland. It is my money. When my master saw the watch, he said, this is the way my money goes. I slept in the accompting-house. I never saw the money at all. This watch cost me four pound ten shillings. I bought the watch at Wapping. My master said, he had lost the money, and I had bought the watch with it. I said, No, I got money before I came to London. This master gave me victuals and drink, and clothes; he gave me no money.</p>
               <p>JURY. The notes are dated 4th of June, 1810. The prisoner said, he brought them to London he could not have done that.</p>

Yes, the prisoner wanted three guineas on it; Mr. Crouch's man gave him twenty-five shillings on it; as soon as I found it was gold, I went into the shop, and when I came out I gave the prisoner the money. On the Tuesday following he came to me, and wanted to sell the duplicate. On the Sunday I happened to see it advertised a watch, and chain, and seal stolen from Mr. Lewis, Aldgate, High-street, and on the Tuesday when he said he wanted to sell it, I told him I thought it was stolen; he said how came I to think of that; then I let him see the paper; I told him to go to Mr. Lewis; he said he had not got the watch; he found the seal by Aldgate church, the seal in one place and the chain in another. He said he would not go with me if he thought he should get into any trouble. I told him if he came by it honestly he need not fear; he went with me; I delivered the duplicate up to Mr.

            . On the 12th of December the prisoner brought the chain and seal up into my room about three o'clock in the afternoon. I told him my husband was at work; he said he had been down to his shop, he was not there. I then said it would not be long before he was in; he said he would go to a public-house, and me to send him in; I told my husband when he came in; he said he did not want to see him; my husband went down stairs, and the prisoner came in and asked me to lend him a shilling. I said no; he shewed me this gold chain and seal; said he found it about seven o'clock as he came out of his lodgings at Wapping. He wished my husband to pledge it for him. I told him I did not think my husband would do it; I did not think he ever had been in a pawnbroker's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181101090019"/>shop; he then asked me to take it. I said I did not like to take it; I did not think it was gold.

            . I went into Mr. Lewis's shop; he said he had lost a watch, gold seal, and the chain; here is the duplicate of the chain, and I suspect this man knows something of the watch. I took the prisoner of one side, and the first thing I pulled out was this metal seal. I took off his hat; in the lining of his hat was tied this watch, and in the corner of his handkerchief was tied up this key.</p>

               <p>Q. How could this person come into the shop - A. I had left the front shop to go backwards; on my return I never thought of the watch; during that interval somebody must have come in and stole it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On my crossing from the Minories to Houndsditch I picked the watch up; I went into this woman's house; I asked her where her husband was; she said at the shop. I told her I had a watch-chain, and asked her to pawn it; she said yes; she took the watch out and said she had given it to her husband. Two hatters came in and gave me one pound five shillings. I came up to the house; after that he shewed me the paper; I said if such a thing was lost, I would go to the house. I went to the house with him; I told him that I had found such a chain; the constable came, he gave me a black eye; if I had taken any thing wrongfully from any house, I would never go to it of my own accord.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 11th of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner and two more loaded with property; they were carrying it across the shoulder just as if taken out of the shop. I saw them come out of Somerset-street, and from there they proceeded into Gulston-street; on the other side of the way I followed them; I had suspicion that the property was stolen. The prisoner dropped some of the property off his shoulder accidentally; one of the other men said, d - n it, do not stop to pick it up; which made my suspicion stronger, I laid hold of him; he told me to let him go; I told him I would not. The property was thrown upon the pavement; he and I had a scuffle together for a long time. I got part of the property picked up, as much as I could. A mob came round, part of the property was gone; I saved as much as I could. I got him and the property to the watchhouse. Mr. M'Carthy applied the next morning, said he had been robbed; he swore to the property before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other men - A.

               <p>Q. Did her rising up in this way, and putting her coat about her raise suspicion in your mind - A. It did; I went over the counter and watched her, she had not gone above the next door to one, before she let a piece of print fall of twenty-two yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it fall by design or by accident - A. I think by accident; she picked it up and went on; I pursued the prisoner, she went into a court near Middle-row, and from there she went to a gin-shop, at the corner of Middle-row. I left the witness Lambert there while I went and fetched my hat; when I came back she was just coming out of the door of the gin-shop, the wind blew her coat of one side, I distinctly saw a piece of print; I pursued her and took her at the top of Gray's-inn-lane; I asked her for the print, she let it fall on the ground, I picked it up by her feet; I took her back to Mr. Webb's, and a constable was sent for, he took charge of the prisoner and the print.</p>

               <p>"will you come up and set in my room, I dare say your wife will be home in a few minutes?" He came up, and sat about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. He then asked me to light him down to his own door. He pushed the door open. I gave him a light. He said he believed he should go to bed. I left him in his room, and saw no more of him till about eight o'clock; I was then in the street. I saw him bring his wife from Mrs. Baldwyn's wine-vaults, in the same street - I saw him bringing her in company with Mrs. Smith, whom Mr. Bowles had denied his wife being in company with. Mr. Bowles had frequently turned Mrs. Smith out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw Bowles and his wife together, did any words pass between them. - A. Not till they came in the passage of his own house. I saw her sitting on the stairs; he was standing in the front of her. Bowles desired his wife to go up, and by her refusing he gave her a blow with his right hand on the left side of her head, I think, with his double fist He kept saying,</p>
               <p>"will you go up? if you do not, I will break your neck. I left them upon his carrying her up, and Mr. Togwell shut the door, and I went out I saw no more of them at that time. I came home in about three quarters of an hour. When I returned, I called to my husband to let me in. I was called to go up to see the deceased. When I went into the room I found the deceased laying upon the sacking of the bedstead; there was no bed. Mrs. Togwell had pulled her strait. The prisoner Bowles was in the room, and Mrs. Togwell, and I think Mrs. Tooley. I felt the deceased, she was very hot. I said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! Mr. Bowles, what have you killed your wife? He, with his hands, beat his head, and stamped his feet, and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! pray Mrs. Bland do not say so," and appeared very much agitated indeed. As she seemed so hot. I said,</p>
               <p>"for God's sake, has nobody sent for a gentleman of the faculty?" He went out himself, without his hat, and in about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, he returned with Mr. Steward. Mr. Steward called for a looking-glass. Bowles was in the room; the looking-glass was wiped clean; he put it over her face, and then he put it again, and pronounced that she was dead. The doctor asked Bowles if he had any words with his wife, or if he had struck her? He said, yes, he had, but nothing in particular, and when he laid her down, he thought she might have been in a fit. He never left the house till two o'clock in the morning, when Limbrick took him. I took up his two children into my room, and by my landlady's request, Mr. Bowles went up there, and I sat up all night with my landlady.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner sober. - A. I am sure he was not; he was better than half in liquor; he had been out all day. He is a sawyer by trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go out in anger. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. He was displeased with her in some way, because the five shillings that he had given her to buy a mattress, she had spent in gin. - A. I do not know about the mattress - Mr. Bowles said she had pawned his tools for a shilling. It was about dusk she came home; I understood for the pliers. She had gone out at one o'clock in the day, and did not come home to the children till eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he was rather forward in liquor. - A. Yes, I never saw any thing amiss of him while I knew him. I have lived in the house fifteen months.</p>
               <p>Q. Besides working at a trade as a sawyer, when at home, he made bird cages. - A. He was an industrious man, I saw nothing amiss of him.</p>

I do not remember I ever saw him before I saw him at a house in Earle-street, between seven and eight o'clock - I was going for some cheese for my supper. I was going by the prisoner's door. I heard a scream of a woman. I looked in the passage. I saw a man and a woman at the foot of the stairs; he up with his fist and struck her on the side of the head; she fell down backwards at the foot of the stairs; the landlady came out; she said,</p>
               <p>"for God's sake, Mr. Bowles, do not beat your wife so much." She said,</p>

            . I keep the house No. 17, in Earle-street. The prisoner Bowles and his wife occupied the back room two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you see the prisoner and his wife come home. - A. About eight o'clock. I had not seen Bowles all the day before that time his wife was with him. I heard a scuffling in the passage. I went to see what was the matter. He struck her in anger, but not with great violence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he strike her more than once. - A. Only once. He asked Mrs. Bowles to go up; she would not; she sat down on the stairs. Bowles asked her many times to go up stairs, she would not go. He struck her on the side of the head, I believe, with his fist. He took her in his arms before him, and carried her up stairs. He asked her several times what she had done with the five shillings? she made no answer. He appeared to be in anger. I lit him up stairs, and as soon as I came up stairs, he struck her and stamped upon her side or belly, I am not sure which it was, at the lower part of her body. He asked her where the money was; he seemed to be harping about the money. He was very angry with her for being with Mrs. Smith. I begged of him not to beat his wife any more. He gave me his finger, and promised me he would not. I went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go again to his room. - A. I did, about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after. When I got into the room, Bowles was standing up by the side of the fire-place; there was no fire; the deceased was lying upon the bed. Bowles told me that his wife had a fit. I said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Bowles, she is dead."</p>
               <p>Q. In what state of mind was Bowles at that time.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181101090022"/>A. I think he appeared to have been drinking. He appeared very much hurt upon my telling him that his wife was dead. Mr. Bowles would not believe that she was dead. Then I sent up stairs for Mrs. Bland. Mrs. Bland suggested for a doctor to be sent for, and Bowles himself went without his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon Bowles finding that his wife was dead, was he composed. - A. No, very much hurt. I was in the room; I saw him beat his head. The prisoner returned with the doctor; and the doctor, Mr. Steward, tried an experiment with the looking-glass. Mr. Steward, pronounced that she was dead, and said he could not say whether it was a fit or no. Mr. Steward left the house, and Mr. Bowles went and slept with Mr. Bland. He remained in the house till two o'clock until the officer came.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. How long did he live with you. - A. Better than two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that this woman was subject to fits. - A. I attended her in a fit once - when she was on the floor I held her down.</p>
               <p>Court. They were convulsion fits, were they. - A. Yes.</p>

            . I live in the front room in the two pair, and Bowles occupied the back room in Earl-street. On the night of the 26th, about eight o'clock, I heard a voice upon the stairs. I heard a great lumb-ring, and some one cried, and that I heard a great noise as if Bowles had throwed his wife down in the next room. I sat about five or ten minutes, and heard blows; then I went to Bowles's room; the door was open. I saw the deceased on the floor. I called,</p>
               <p>"Bowles, have done." I saw him kick her while she was on the ground, about the side of the lower part of the body. Bowles said,</p>
               <p>"what can I do, Mrs. Tooley?" Mrs. Togwell came up; he promised her that he would not beat his wife any more. The deceased said, as she laid on the ground, you and Mrs. Togwell may go. We went away. I left the deceased on the ground. I stepped into my own room. I heard many things that passed in Bowles's room. The prisoner asked his wife what she had done with the things? she said she had pawned them herself. I believe he struck her then, for the child cried out,</p>
               <p>"pray father do not beat her any more, beat her again tomorrow." He said to the child,</p>
               <p>"go and ask your mother what there is for supper." He questioned the child to know what the mother had bought for the sister out of the money? the child answered, that she did not know that the mother had bought any thing. I heard nothing else until Mrs. Togwell came up.</p>
               <p>Q. What brought Mrs. Togwell up. - A. The little child went and said her mother was in fits. Upon Mrs. Togwell's coming up, she called me, and told me Mrs. Bowles was dead. I went into Bowles's room; I found her laying upon the mattrass, with the blanket over her. Bowles was standing at the foot of the bed by the fire-place; he seemed very much hurt when Mrs. Togwell told me his wife was dead. He appeared agitated, and beat his head very much. Mrs. Bland proposed to have a doctor. Bowles was glad enough to go - he went without his hat, and when Mr. Steward came, he pronounced her dead. Bowles seemed distressed and hurt. After this Bowles remained in the house until Limbrick the officer came and took him.</p>

            Can you say whether they were comfortable together, or did they quarrel much. - A. I have heard them quarrel together, and fight. I have heard the deceased say,</p>
               <p>"pray father do not beat me."</p>
               <p>Q. On this night was Bowles sober. - A. He was very much in liquor; he was a very industrious man. His wife would get in liquor as well as him. I did not associate with them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. How long have you lived in this house. - A. Two years.</p>
               <p>Q. You were saying something about five shillings. - A. Yes, he asked her what she had done with it? he gave her five shillings to buy a mattrass for the eldest girl that was out of service.</p>

               <p>Court. Is the partition so thin between you that you must have heard the blows, if any had passed. - A. Yes, the partition is thin, I think I should have heard it if any had passed.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I live in Leicester-street, Leicester-square. I was called in by the medical gentlemen during the dissection of the body.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the gentlemen. - A. Mr. Steward, surgeon; Mr. Lonsdale, a surgeon; and a medical student, a young gentleman. When I went in, the three principal cavities of the body were laid open, but nothing removed or touched; the abdomen or belly, the chest and the head. My attention was first drawn entirely to the abdomen; there was a little blush of redness upon the stomach, and within the stomach a quantity of gin; the quantity of fluid might be about ten ounces - the smell indicated a considerable quantity. I must add, that this was done the day after the decease. Nothing preternatural in the chest; on the head marks of blows, but under the integument of the skin no mark. On the bone, that is the scull, the scalp skin was taken off, and part dry by the bruises. On opening the inside of the scull-cap no appearance of bruises; no fracture. The membrane of the brain nothing implying the effects of injury there, nor upon the upper part of the brain. On the surface and cavity a watery serous effusion on all the surface of the brain. In the cavity of the brain, on rising of the brain from the lower part of the brain-case, a large coagulum of blood appeared. I took the opportunity afterwards of examining the large vessels of the lower part of the brain, and I observed in her head, on one of the four principal arteries of the brain, a transverse rent of the artery going up into the brain.</p>
               <p>Q. From the observation that you made, what do you suppose to be the cause of this person's death. -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181101090023"/>A. The immediate fall of the quantity of blood, pressing upon the brain, that was the cause of her death, according to the best of my judgment.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the rupture of that material artery the cause of that effusion of blood. - A. Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been in Court and heard the evidence given of the violence that had been used, do you or not conceive that that external violence was the cause of the rupture of that artery. - A. There is an external difficulty here. If I had seen no marks of external violence there, I should have said it was a common case of a sanguinous apoplexy.</p>
               <p>Q. With the assistance of the external violence that you have described in this case, and the quantity of gin in the stomach, and this effusion which we know to be the effect of encreased action, do you conceive that the state of the woman approached to a state of apoplexy, so far that at that time a slight agitation or blow would produce an effect which would not take place; was not the person inebriated. - A. When I have opened the head of those that died from inebriation, the effusion was present, not the rupture.</p>
               <p>Q. The effusion of serum, could that take place instead of the coasulum of blood with such blows as you have heard described. - A. From concussion; a state of concussion of the head might produce the effect, but not at that time; the coagulum of blood from the rupture of the vessel produced death, and not the effusion of the serum.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You said, were you have opened the head of persons that died of drunkenness, you have found the serous effusion, but not the rupture. - A. I have found the serous effusion in a greater degree than here. I recollect two instances.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you found the rupture also, were persons died of drunkenness. - A. I have opened the head of a young man that drank a great quantity of whisky, so much as he was hardly able to stagger to bed - on opening this young man's head, I found this serous effusion.</p>
               <p>Q. Where persons die of intoxication, I take it for granted, apoplexy takes place in persons that die of drunkenness. - A. In persons that are sober, and persons that are inebriated.</p>
               <p>Q. And I take it for granted that drunkenness will produce it. - A. Very much so; it resembles very much the natural apoplexy.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether the rupture of the artery might have arisen from blows, of which you saw the marks. - A. I cannot say, the rupture might or might not have arisen from blows, of which I saw marks, considering the state of circulation.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing this poor woman to have fallen down in a fit, that might have contributed to it. - A. If I had not seen the marks, or heard of the blows, I should have considered it an apoplectic fit.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Supposing the vessels of a person to be filled, the circulation encreases in consequence of intoxication. With such blows as you saw upon this person, would not that have a tendency to have produced the rupture that you saw. - A. Undoubtedty - but I cannot say it did.</p>
               <p>Court. Then upon the whole, considering the intoxication, such a quantity of ardent spirits might have occasioned the bursting of the artery that you have mentioned. - A. It might.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel.</p>
               <p>Mr. STEWARD. Q. You are a surgeon. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. We understand you were called in upon this woman being discovered or supposed to be dead. - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were brought to the spot by the prisoner himself. - A. Yes. When I arrived there, I found the deceased laying upon the bed, seemingly dead. I ascertained that she was dead. There were three women in the room at the time, Mrs. Togwell, Mrs. Bland, and Mrs. Tooley.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any of these three women in a state to make correct observations of what passed. - A. Mrs. Bland appeared frantic, she was stamping about.</p>
               <p>Q. You assisted Mr. Bell in the disection of the head. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What in your judgment was the occasion of her death. - A. The rupture of the blood-vessel.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say the rupture of the blood-vessel was occasion by the blows, which you saw the marks, or by any fall. - A. It is certainly very hard to say.</p>
               <p>Q. With the quantity of spirits you found in her stomach, do you think in the state of intoxication that she was in, the state of anger she was in, or irritation, might account for the rupture of that blood-vessel. - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. How many blows were there on the head. - A. I think there were four.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say whether the blows were violent or not. - A. They were not so violent to effect the skull, only the integument.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing they were given by the fist, were they violent or not. - Q. I do not think they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the circulation of the blood being much encreased by intoxication that this woman is stated to be found in, would not the blows then have a tendency to fill the vessels. - A. One blow would have done it, there would be no occasion of repeating it; in my opinion the patient must die instantly, the rupture of the vessel would occasion instant death.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mark of any blow were the rupture was. - A. No, there could not be any; there was one upon the root of the nose, one upon the left temple, one by the right ear, and one behind her head.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the rupture such that either these blows would effect the rupture of the vessel. - A. I do not think it could.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it be produced by either of these blows. - A. It is very hard to say - it is my opinion it was not.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you ascribe it. - A. To the effect of intoxication, causing a greater action of the vessels of the head, together with struggle and passion. It is my opinion it might have been produced without blows, if there had been intoxication, struggle, and passion.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Afterwards there was a scuffle about the umbrella, between you and Sally Brown. - A. Yes; I took the umbrella from her, and hove it into the green-shop.</p>
               <p>Q. When Antonio came out, there was a scuffle between you and him, and another person. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did that scuffle take place. - A. Not long.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not until after that, that the injury complained of took place. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it upon that taking place that he ran, and it took place the injury. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was not time for him to cool, he ran after your brother, and did the injury to him. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many Portuguese. - A. I saw four come out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. And all the opportunity that you had of observing of it, was in the night. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. If the night was so dark, and the lane so badly lighted, might not another Portuguese sailor have done it as well as Antonio.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you hear the question. - A. I saw Antonio strike at my brother, I did not see any of the rest.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Do you mean to swear positively that it was Antonio and nobody else. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I will ask you again, whether you will venture to swear that it was done by him, or that it might not by done by any other. - A.

             went to fetch Antonio. Antonio came, and there were three or four more with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known Antonio before. - A. Yes, I had, he came to the public-house where I lived. I knew him well. When he came out, Sarah Brown said,</p>
               <p>"that is the man that served me this, kill the English b - r, and leave no life in him."</p>
               <p>Court. At that time did she point to any one. - A. Yes, she pointed to the deceased; the two brothers stood by the green-stall, close together.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Upon her saying this, what did Antonio do. - A. He gave the deceased a blow some where by his back part, and struck him down on the middle of the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the first thing that you saw done by Antonio. - A. Yes, that was the first thing that he did after he came out of the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were you standing to the deceased. - A. I don't think I was two yards; there was a light in the green-stall, and there was a butcher's next door to the green-stall, that was lighted, and it was a moonlight night, there was light enough altogether for me to see what passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that it was Antonio that struck the deceased. - A. It was Antonio.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that Antonio struck him, could you see whether he had any thing in his hand - A. He shook something out that glistened after he had struck him once, and then he struck him again.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he struck the deceased down. After Antonio shook something out of his hand, what did he do. - A. Antonio was at the top of him, he fell on the top of him for the purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he fall on him before or after he shook something out. - A. He was on the top of him when he shook it out; he gave him a podge.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by a podge. - A. Like a stab; he did that somewhere upon his back. Antonio kept laying on him about five minutes, as night as I can recollect. After he got up,

               <p>Q. You hoped, not withstanding what you had seen, he was not stabbed. - A. Yes; but when I heard he was dead, I knew it was no one else; in about ten minutes afterwards I heard he was a dead man, I went to the doctor's shop, I saw him lying upon the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you saw this take place, was John I'ons there, - A. Yes, that is my master; he went into the house to get some men to come to his assistance. I stopped there, and when he returned, I pointed out to my master that it was Antonio.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. So Antonio, upon the other prisoner making use of the expression, immediately came out of the public-house and went to the deceased. - A. Yes, I am certain of that, and three or four men came out with him. I did not know none of them. I did not see any of them meddle with him, but Antonio.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any scuffle with any of the other men. A. No, not as I saw.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your solemn oath, might not Antonio, by scuffling with the man, tumble down. Take your time, remember this man's life is at stake. - A. I saw no scuffle, all the scuffling was on the other side of the street, people running backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the brother of the deceased there that night when this took place - A. Yes. When Antonio was called out of the public-house, the brother and the deceased stood together</p>
               <p>Q. Did Antonio say or do any thing to the brother, or any of the men that came out with him, scuffle at all with the brother. - A. No, somebody gave the brother a blow, but who it was I cannot tell - it was not Antonio.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that blow given to the brother that is here, before Antonio struck the deceased. - A. Yes, Antonia laid hold of the deceased and threw him down; this brother was not thrown down; the brother struck the man again, and the man ran away somewhere; he did not fall.</p>
               <p>Q. That was before Antonio went up to the deceased. - A. Antonio went up to the deceased the same time.</p>
               <p>JOHN I'ONS. Q. I believe your mother keeps the Dundee Arms. - A. She does; it is in the parish of St. Botolph, without Aldgate, in Middlesex. On the 12th of December I was in my mother's house; in consequence of an alarm, I went out in the street. I saw some men and women scuffling together, who they were I cannot say. The girls were apparently fighting with the men, and the men were endeavouring to keep them off. I now recollect the person of Brown,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181101090026"/>she was one. I was giving directions to the other servant, not the one that is here, to put up the shutters. While I was doing that, a girl was pushed into the kennel; she got up again, and ran after the man, that is Brown; she began fighting with the man, when she got to him - I am pretty confident it was the deceased. The deceased laid hold of her (this was while she was clawing him), and said,</p>
               <p>"if you do not leave me alone, I must push you into the kennel again." She twisted her hands from him, and began clawing him again. He immediately pushed her down into the kennel, and came himself down also. The girl immediately cried out,</p>
               <p>"Antonio," while on the ground. - One of the girls that stood on the pavement, ran to the door of the Newcastle Arms, and called out Antonio. Three or four men came from the Newcastle Arms. I cannot say whether Antonio came or no; to the girl had got up, and got on the pavement again. In the mean time the men from the Newcastle Arms, made to the girl, and the man, which I firmly believe to be the deceased. I heard a voice say this is him. The men that came from the Newcastle Arms immediately seized the deceased, and dragged him from the pavement into the middle of the street - they knocked him down, or pulled him down, I cannot say which. I immediately ran into my own house to get assistance, for the man that was down, when I returned, I heard that the man had been stabbed, and was gone to the doctor's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your servant Pickford there. - A. I did not. I ran after the man to the surgeons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear or see Brown do or say any thing. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it. - Q. A moon-light night. There was a butcher's shop next door to my house, lighted, I believe, by a lamp; and the next to that is a greenshop, and I believe there is one candle generally used in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons came out of the Newcastle Arms. - A. Three or four persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many persons in the street. - A. When I first went from my mother's, I suppose there were six or seven, one was Mr. Staples, the others were strangers to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the place where the girl was thrown down, and the man fell down, how far is that from the Newcastle Arms. - A. Not above ten yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the noise or the scuffle at that place, so that they could hear it the Newcastle Arms. - A. I should suppose so.</p>
               <p>Q. You say they had been fighting and scuffling with the girls. - A. Yes, about one minute before the girl was pushed into the kennel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the brother of the deceased engaged in the scuffle. - A. I did not see him at all.</p>
               <p>SARAH ROWELL. I live with my mother at No. 5, Greenwood-court, Nightingale-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you, on the evening of the 12th of December, in Nightingale-lane. - A. Yes, I was going past. I heard a noise where the fire was. I saw four or five Portuguese.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any of them. - A. Yes, Antonio. I had known Antonio about two years. Antonio had hold of the young fellow; there were four or five had the young fellow down. I never saw the young fellow before, that was down; he was down in the middle of the road. He went to get up, and they knocked him down again.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them was it that knocked him down again. - A. Antonio; I was about two yards from them, on the other side of the way; I then got to the opposite side of the way. I got nearer to them. I saw the weapon in his hand. Antonio made a stab at his back, and to the best of my knowledge he struck him with what he had in his hand. The young fellow got up, and ran some yards, and cried,</p>
               <p>"Oh Lord, brother, I am killed!" and fell</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain sure that Antonio is the man that struck him with the weapon that you have described. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him standing up. - A. He was standing behind him, leaning over to stab him in the back. I saw him stab him. I did not see where he took any thing from; I saw some sort of an instrument in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the instrument. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that he had any thing in his hand, or did you only see his hand move. - A. I judged that he stabbed him in the back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any instrument. - A. I could not describe what instrument it was, I only saw his hand at his back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see whether he had any thing in his hand or not. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You so far noticed Antonio come up to the pavement and collared him, and gave a blow, could you see whether it was him that gave him the stab. - A. I cannot say whether it was the same man that collar'd him or not.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the deceased brought to your house. - A. Yes. I took papers out of his pocket. I now knew who he was. I examined him; I found a wound on his back; he had a great loss of blood. The wound was between the shoulder-blade and the spine. I have not the least doubt that his death was from the wound. He died in about two minutes; I examined the body afterwards by opening it. I found the instrument which had penetrated to touch between the ribs into the left lobe of the lungs, the wound was six inches long, and the width of half an inch; it had been done with a flat instrument, probably a knife. Bleeding internally was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the primary cause of his death the wound. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Cardosa's defence. I am not guilty, all the witnesses have sworn false against me.</p>
               <p>Brown's defence. This young woman and me, and another that is out of doors, asked me to go to the public-house; we stopped there, and had something to drink, along with a young man. When I went out I missed Mary, I had stopped to speak to a young man. I called her several times. I went in again, I asked if

I said do no strike her, strike me; I put the umbrella to him; and did not strike him; they rolled me down in the mud and kicked me, and took the umbrella out of my hand. When I got up, I said if there was an officer I would give charge of them, they then knocked me in the mud again.</p>
               <p>Rogers was not put on her defence.</p>
               <p>Cardosa called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

On Tuesday morning, about half past one, on the 11th of December, on my returning home, I was about four doors in Cursitor-street. About seven or eight men together laid hold of me, and threw me down. I felt one of their hands in my right breeches-pocket. I had a dollar, four shillings, and about five pence in my pocket. I had been drinking. I was very little the worse for liquor. I was quite alone when these persons met me, they said nothing while I was on the ground. They tried to stop my mouth with mud. One of them said something before they attacked me. I believe it to be the prisoner, said who do you want? I am not sure it was the prisoner. While I was on the ground I cried out lustily, watch. I seized hold of the prisoner with my left hand, while they were rifling my pocket, I still kept hold of the prisoner. The watchman came up to my assistance. The rest all ran away. I had still hold of the prisoner with both hands when the watchman came up.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you were on the ground did you feel any money go from you. - A. I perceived the hand in my pocket, and the taking of all the contents of the pocket out. The watchman took charge of the prisoner. While I was down, one of the parties kicked me. When I had got to the watch-house in Carey-street, I examined my pocket. I had lost a dollar, a shilling, and a few half-pence. I had three shillings and three pence half-penny left in my left pocket.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL MACDONALD. I am a watchman in Chancery-lane. About half-past one o'clock in the morning, I heard a man cry out watch, in Cursitor-street. - I ran to the spot, and sprang my rattle. I found the prosecutor had hold of the prisoner, he was crying out Oh you thief you have robbed me. The prisoner wished him to let him go for me to take him. I could see that the prosecutor had been drinking a glass or two, but he was perfectly sensible of what he was about. I took the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. What charge did the prosecutor give of the prisoner. A. That he was one of the party of seven or eight that knocked him down and robbed him. He lost a dollar, a shilling, and a few half-pence. The prisoner said he had been in Oxford-road, to see his sister. I asked him the name of the street his sister lived in; he said he did not know, he was a stranger to that part of the town, and having missed his way some where, he got into Fleet street. He came down Chancery-lane into Holborn, and passing by the end of Cursitor-street, hearing a noise, and a person calling watch, he went to see what was the matter, and when he came near the prosecutor several men ran away. He asked the prosecutor what was the matter, the prosecutor then seized him, and charged him with being one of the parties. The prisoner denied having any hand in the robbery, and proposed to be searched. I searched him, and found no property relating to this charge.</p>

               <p>Q. In the course of last year had you occasion to leave town - A I had. In some part of May I went in pursuit of my business professionally. I took my wife with me. I left my house, No. <placeName id="t18110109-33-crimeloc194">9. Commercial-road</placeName>

               <p>Q. How long have you known her. - A. Near three years. I had great confidence in her, or else I would not have placed her there. I and my wife returned to town on the 7th of December. On my arrival in town, about twelve at noon, the door of my house was opened by a person of the name of Lewis. I did not find the prisoner in the house which I expected. I immediately went up stairs, and on my opening my drawers I found the things were nearly stripped from them. The wardrobe in the passage I broke open. I found that was stripped. I found all the clothes that I had left nearly gone. Several boxes, which I had sent up from Scotland, were also nearly empty; all these things stated in the indictment were gone. I applied to Mr. Griffith's, the officer. The prisoner was taken into custody; she delivered up the duplicates to the officer. I said to her,</p>
               <p>"Kitty, what have you done with my things; are my things sold, or what is become of them?" She told me they were not sold, but they were in pledge. She cried and said,</p>
               <p>"how could she look me in the face after what she had done."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with the different duplicates to the different pawnbrokers. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these two letters, and tell me whether they are her hand-writing. - A. They are, I received them by post since she was in custody. - (The letters read.)</p>
               <p>"Honoured Sir, I hope you will pardon me for the first offence; I served you three years, which I lived with you always truly and honestly. I can safely say before God and man, that I never wronged you in my life. I own I have committed a great fault; it was distress that drove me to it; give me time, whatever I have done wrong I will gratefully return. I hope you will have a feeling to a fellow-creature. I long to see you both; my heart is almost broke; pray, for God's sake, have a little mercy. I am your's, faithfully,</p>
               <p>CATHERINE DOWSE."</p>
               <p>Directed to Mr. Crawcour, King's-place, Commercial-road. No date - Post-mark, December 7.</p>
               <p>Another Letter, dated 15, Clerkenwell prison, directed the same.</p>
               <p>"SIR - I once more solicit your pardon; if you have one grain of feeling, and recollect there is a good God that over-rules us all. The punishment you have inflicted on me at present is quite enough for a fellow-creature to suffer; what I would not wish you nor yours to suffer one hour. If you have no feeling for me, I hope you will consider an aged parent's sufferings for her child's misconduct, that never had her name called in question before I unfortunately came into your house. If you would take it into consideration, and think that you might have a child of your own, that may want forgiveness, as I do. If you do not forgive, how can you expect to be forgiven? the day may come when we all want forgiveness; then how shall we prosper if we do not forgive? I have found you to be the greatest enemy that ever I had in my life. Only have feeling for one moment.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Blair - A. He has been a clerk of ours two years, he was book keeper and collecting clerk, he collected all our debts.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing to do with your banking-book - A. It was his peculiar duty every Monday morning to check the bankers book.</p>
               <p>Q. We are told that Bruce and Co. are your bankers - A. They are. Besides keeping the ledger, it was his particular duty, every Monday morning to check the bankers book, so that every Monday morning he called at the bankers for our book, brought it home with the checks that had been drawn, and having checked the amount, he gave both to Mr. Gregg and myself the balance.</p>
               <p>Court. You mean an account of the balance - A. Yes, the statement of the balance. It was his business to point out any error that was in that book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Vaughan. Was he acquainted with your manner of drawing blank checks with the house - A. Perfectly. I am in the habit of drawing nineteen checks out of twenty, and I therefore use the printed checks, Mr. Gregg uses plain paper.</p>

               <p>Q. I beg you to look at that check; I believe you have it in your hand, tell me whether that is your signature, whether the words Gregg and Corfield is your signature - A. It is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the signature of Mr. Gregg - A. Certainly not, it is meant to resemble my hand, it resembles my hand, I am perfectly sure it is not my hand; I always fill up the body of the check myself, except in some cases, a young man who is standing here fills them up for me.</p>
               <p>Court. It is a particular clerk that fills up the body of the check - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Vaughan. Is the body of that check in his hand writing - A. It is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the body of the check in your hand writing - A. It is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me in whose hand writing the check is - A. I can form a judgment, I believe the date of the check, 15th November, and the name of the payee to be in the hand writing of the prisoner Blair, it is not his natural hand to be sure, it is disguised; I believe I hold in my hand the check by which it was made.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name of the payee - A. It was J. C. but they have added, lark, it is in the same ink it appears to be added. I always

               <p>Q. In what situation was he in Bruce and Co.'s house - A. As a clerk in various departments.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time was Gregg and Corfield customers at your house - A. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Blair - A. Yes, extremely well.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember him going from your house to Messrs. Gregg's and Corfield's - A. He did not leave our house to go there. He did go to Gregg's and Corfield's, and afterwards I saw him coming frequently to our house upon their business; sometimes he came to receive money, sometimes to pay, and sometimes for the book.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing Blair on Thursday, the 15th of November - A. I do, at the banking-house, I think between three and four in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that hour, between three and four, a particular busy hour with you - A. It is; it is very busy, except there are holidays at the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the 15th of November a holiday - A. I do not think it was; the stock brokers are very busy at that hour; it is the clearing hour.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore you are more busy at that hour, than you are at any hour in the day - A. Generally.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon his application to you for the change of twenty shillings, tell me what passed - A. I told him change was very scarce, I hardly could spare it; he pressed me very hard for it, I therefore gave it him principally in sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you give us any correct notion how long it was either previous or subsequent to it that note was presented - A. I cannot; I believe it was between three and four in the day.</p>

I have heard it mentioned, certainly, many circumstances respecting Newgate and persons therein; respecting Roberts, Hitchen, and other persons whose names I now forget, prisoners in Newgate; he has offered to take certain persons in the office, to Newgate, to see Roberts, I believe it was mere curiosity; he offered to take me to see Roberts, if I would stand a bottle of wine to treat them.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Blair - A. Yes, and the prisoner Dale; I knew Blair about a fortnight before the 14th of November, and I knew Dale about half a year before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the habit of meeting 
               <persName id="t18110109-34-person406">Blair</persName>
             that fortnight before the 14th of November - A. At Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. How often might you meet him in Newgate before the 15th of November last - A. Not above two or three times in all. I met him on the 14th in company of Hitchen and Roberts; Hitchen sent for me to go to Newgate, I went on the 14th, Hitchen told me Blair was present, he wanted me to go to get a check changed, Blair told me I must come again the next day, Thursday the 15th, at twelve o'clock; I went the next day at twelve o'clock, I found Roberts and Hitchen, a little after that Blair came in, they then were all in conversation together, Roberts, Hitchen and Blair; I was walking up and down the ward; I was ordered by either Hitchen or Blair to go out with Blair; Blair took me to the Prerogative office in Doctors Commons; Blair told me I was to get a porter to give the check to in Doctors Commons on the Wednesday, he told me I was to get a porter at the Prerogative office to get the check changed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then on the Thursday he took you to the Prerogative office, he told you to get a porter - A. Yes, on the Thursday, he told me I must not come in the hat, which I had on, which was a straw hat; he told me then to meet him a little past Doctors Commons, and St. Pauls church-yard; we went both into a public-house, he called for two slices of bread and cheese, and a pot of beer; he told me to meet him exactly at three o'clock, at the Tobit's Dog in St. Paul's church-yard; I parted with him then at twelve o'clock, he left me eating the bread and cheese. Dale came in soon after Blair went out, Blair did not see him as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you how Dale came to meet you at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181101090031"/>time - A. I had appointed him on the morning of the Thursday; I went to Westminster before I went to Newgate; I set off from Westminster about eleven o'clock along with Dale, Robinson, Hooker, and myself, all came from Westminster together, and coming home I told Dale I had got to go to Newgate to get a check changed; I understood for Mr. Hitchen, and I was to get a porter. He said he would be porter, I said you may if you like; with that, upon the top of Fleet-market, me and Dale left Hooker and Robinson, and came to Newgate just before twelve o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. You have said it was for Hitchen, were Robinson and Hooker present - A. I told Dale to himself as we were coming along. In consequence of what I told Dale, Dale came in after Blair went out, I was eating the bread and cheese; I told him I was to get a porter, he said he would be porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you whether you met Blair at three o'clock - A. I think about two or three minutes before the clock struck; I went in, and met Blair exactly at three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When Blair came in the Tobit's Dog was any body else there - A. There were two or three servant girls. Blair set down on my left side, he put the check into my hands folded up, I never opened it. He told me to send a porter to Bartholomew-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether that is the paper he put into your hand - A. I observed these small figures, he told me that was of no consequence. I never opened the check, the figures were exactly like unto these. He never put any other check into my hand, and I never put any other check than this into Dale's hand; I never had it out of this hand until I delivered it to Dale.</p>
               <p>Q. When he put it into your hand did he say any more to you than the porter was to take it to Bartholomew-lane - A. He told me I must give it to the porter in Doctors Commons, and go out myself from the Prerogative office, and also put a pen into my hand; he told me to let him see me give it to the porter the check; the pen was into this hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any use made of the pen - A. No; he directed me to hold the pen in my hand; I do not know what for no more than you. He told me I was to go to the top of Paternoster-row, and stand there till he came back. That was all that passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Now having stated what became of him, and what became of you - A. He went along St. Paul's church-yard, leading to Cheapside; I turned to go to Doctors Commons to look for Dale to give this check to.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Dale - A. Yes; I went to the Prerogative office according to his desire.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you now whether when you found Dale at the Prerogative office you delivered the check to him - A. Yes, I delivered it to him at the bottom of the street; I am quite sure that the check that I delivered to Dale was the check that I received from Blair; Blair was in the street, I saw Blair look to see whether I gave the check to Dale, he saw me do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Having given the check to Dale what became of you - what became of Dale and Blair - A Directly I gave the check to Dale he set off to Bartholomew-lane. I looked and saw the other set off.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner Blair walking in a direction to Bartholomew-lane - A. They both went there, they walked separate; I soon lost sight of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time might elapse before you saw either and which of them again - A. About twenty minutes or half an hour elapsed before I saw either of them again. I saw Blair first at the top of Paternoster-row, that was the place he appointed to meet me; Blair came all of a sweat, I then thought it was all wrong, and a bad piece of business; I was frightened; he said to me, I saw the money paid, and the check filed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you asked him any questions upon the subject - A. Not a word; he spoke to me first, he then walked fast off, I followed. After walking about fifty yards he said, have you got the money? I said no, I thought you were going for it yourself; he said, go and look after the porter. We parted. I went to Doctors Commons, I saw Dale, he was walking very fast on one side of Doctors Commons, I went to get up to him, he held his hand up, and said,</p>

               <p>Q. I believe you were apprehended upon this subject - A. Yes, I was taken up on the Tuesday following; I gave the description of every thing about it before I was taken up; directly I found it out I told it to Hooker.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You live in Young's-building - I see by the Sessions Paper you were here last October to swear an alibi - A. I know nothing of an alibi.</p>

               <p>Q. He was convicted notwithstanding your evidence - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not have been concerned in this transaction if you had known it had been a forgery - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had any suspicion it was wrong until it was all over - A. Not at all. They told me they had got thousands of money, I supposed it was right.</p>
               <p>Q. And you would not have sent the porter to get<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181101090032"/>the money if you had not thought it was all night - A. No, to be sure not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you change your hats again - A. Yes, on Friday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever in your life before lend your man your hat to go of an errand for you - A. I do not now justly recollect.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ask the reason - A. No. Dale told me to change the hat, and I did it.</p>
               <p>Q. You were taken up on the Tuesday after about this forged check - A. Yes, and I was kept in custody several days.</p>
               <p>Q. And you thought it was better to be a witness than a prisoner - A. To be sure, because I was led into the business.</p>

             - A. I did, on the 17th of November at night, in Playhouse-yard, No. 20; I searched him, I found upon him a hundred pound note, a five pound note, and two one's, this is the 100 pound note, No. 9m985. I apprehended Dale on Sunday morning, in Aldersgate-street, he was at Mr. Stevens's, a hair dresser; I asked Dale what he had done with the money he had received on the Thursday, he said that he had not received any money. I then asked him if he had not taken a check on that day to some bankers, he said that he had taken a six hundred pound check to a bankers, he had received that check from Mark Chambers by the Prerogative office in Doctors Commons, and that he was to return there, Chambers was to be waiting for him. When he got back to Doctors Commons he found Chambers was gone, he then went to a man of the name of Robinson, the same person that I have been speaking of, that I apprehended, he gave him the money, thinking it would be safer in his hand than in his own; he said, that the check did not belong to Chambers, he understood it belonged to a tall man, he should know him if he was to see him, that he was dressed in black, and had long black whiskers, and that man he was near him at the time he received the check of Chambers. I apprehended Blair on the Monday morning in his own office, at Messrs. Gregg's and Corfield's; on my taking him from there in a coach to Bow-street, I asked him if he had ever been at his late employers, meaning by that the bankers; he said he was in the habit of going there very often; I asked him when was the last time, he said, on the Thursday before he had been to the bankers; I asked him what he went for there, he said, to get a note cashed for twenty shillings worth of change, that he had been twice there on that day in the afternoon. I then asked him if he knew a man of the name of Robinson, he said he did not. I then asked him if he knew a man of the name of Chambers; he said he did, he knew him by going to see Hitchen in Newgate, he had seen him several times in the last week, he saw him on the Wednesday and on the Thursday about twelve o'clock, he met him in Newgate. He asked me what charge I had him upon; I told him upon a check of six hundred pound, that I suspected he was the person that had drawn the check, he said, that if that was the charge I had him upon he did not care about it; he thought that I meaned to arrest him for debt.</p>

             had not behaved well to him, he had brought him six hundred pound bank of England notes, and Robinson had not given him a shilling out of it. I told him he need not ask a favour of Robinson, he might help himself with the money, if it was good money. Mr. Robinson came down at the time, Robinson said, come along, to Dale; they went into Golden-lane, and they stood about ten minutes together; I was about ten yards from them. Robinson sent Dale away and came to me; I then went with Robinson to a man of the name of Brown; I saw Robinson produce at a public-house in Worship-street two notes, one was a five hundred pound note, and the other a one hundred pound note, I did not know the amount of them, only Robinson told me six hundred pound. Afterwards, at another public-house in Whitechapel, Robinson produced the notes, a five hundred pound note. The number of the five hundred pound was 8789.</p>
               <p>Q. Having got this number did you make any communication about this number - A. I did not, until I saw Chambers, and in consequence of having seen Chambers on the Saturday evening I communicated it to the house of Bruce and Co.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoners at the bar, and tell me who presented it - A. From the multiplicity of business it is impossible for me to recollect.

I do: at the time that this note were exchanged I made the entery in this book, I did not give the notes myself, that is the department of another gentleman; fifty ones for the five hundred pounds, forty fives, and twenty-five ten pound notes; the fifty ones run from No. 71351, up to 71400 bearing date the 28th of August, all of them.</p>

               <p>Dale's Defence. I would wish to speak to Chambers, he has told the truth, that he himself gave me the check; he said it belonged to a gentleman, he would give me half a crown, and when I came back he was not there; I went to St. Paul's church-yard the next morning, I met him, he gave me some rum, and told me the gentleman would not like them large notes, he said he wanted thirty pounds. I was going to justify bail, I paid him fifteen shillings for bailing one of the men for sodomy. Chambers asked Hooker if he would take any small sum. Hooker bailed one Whiffen; just after the long vocation he took his brother's house, I do not know whether he did not take his brother's name; there are gentlemen here that recollects his face very well, he engaged with one Mason to swear that a gentleman owed him a bill of ninety-five pounds, Mr. Arabin and Mr. Adolphus were on the part of Mason, he received money as long as he could, then he went on the other side, though he had been sworn at Mr. Arabin's before; he went to the coffee-house and swore for Shirley, Mr. Price the attorney gave him a pound for his trouble. He had an execution in his house, I was present when the things were sold by auction; he has not been worth a shilling for this half year.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH PIKE. Q. I believe you are a woollen-draper residing in Basinghall-street - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that man, Chambers - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. From the knowledge that you have of him would you or not believe him upon his oath - A. I would not.</p>
               <p>COURT. How long have you known him - A. From September 1809.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Vaughn. When did you see him - A. At my own house in Basinghall-street, he is a taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he in your debt - A. He is, about forty odd pounds. I have heard him examined upon oath, I know he is a very bad character.</p>

I cannot tell whether I took it out myself, I was tipsey; I went to sleep, and when I awoke I found the pocket book empty on the table, and the prisoners had all left the house; I told the landlord I had lost every farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the pocket book, or know that you had the pocket book before you went to that public-house - A. I put the notes in my pocket book at Rumford. I put it in my pocket, and I had never taken it out of my pocket, until I found it on the table.</p>

I took out the box, and they took up some ribbons to look at. The prisoner came in, he asked to look at some ribbons.

My prosecutor is a milliner by profession, with whom I lived as servant, and had a deal of property entrusted to my care; I declare I never wronged her, nor no one, to the value of a penny in my life time; the prosecutrix knows that which I am prosecuted for was swept up and throwed into a closet as useless; the seal I picked up that morning, I put it in my pocket, I meaned to return it but forgot it. I now stand before you my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, an innocent sufferer.</p>

While I was there a letter came from New Prison; this is the letter, it says, as there will be some gentleman there put the things out of the way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Do you not know that upon the oath you have taken, you are not bound to tell that - A. I do not know it; I was desired by the magistrate to mention it.</p>
               <p>COURT. There is nothing in that letter - A. I received the boots from a person of the name of Mills.</p>
               <p>- MILLS. Q. Where did you get these boots that you delivered to Read - A. I saw the boots delivered by Chivers into Mr. Hobey's son's hands; I received them again from Mr. Hobey jun. and delivered them to Read. Mr. Hobey is the maker of them boots; I am sure that I cut them to a measure of a customer of Mr. Hobey whose name is Williams.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You say that Chivers brought back that pair of boots to Mr. Hobey - A. I have swore that; I can swear to them because they have my hand-writing, it is marked over here, but upon that part it is quite plain.</p>
               <p>Q. There are clerks who do business in the shop, can you say they were not purchased and delivered - You cannot say how many pairs were delivered out of the name of Williams - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mears. Q. to Shilston. Look at them boots A. These boots are of the same description, and Williams was wrote in chalk on the bottom.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. And because you find no chalk mark now, you swear more positively to them - A. No, they were boots of that description.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you know whether these boots had ever been delivered - A. No, they had never been delivered, I had seen them on the over night, and about half after seven o'clock in the morning these boots were missing.</p>
               <p>GEORGE HOBEY. I am perfectly sensible the boots are of my own manufactory, they were made for Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181101090037"/>Williams, he was out of town, they hung up in my shop until called for, or to be sent to him when he wrote for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you after your men left work sent any boots out to Mr. Williams - A. Never. They cost me as near as I can calculate from three to four and forty shillings, I sell them for two pound fourteen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. The prisoner was a stranger to you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You keep a good many men we all know - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These men go away at various hours of the night - A. Eight o'clock is the hour for all to go excepting one man I pay to stay to see the fires all out.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing you had seen these boots at any distant part of the kingdom, should you have known they were of your manufactory - A. I should.</p>
               <p>Q. You never carry out boots yourself do you - A. Oh yes, I do, I will bring you a pair if you please.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mears. According to the routine of business, as it is kept in your warehouse, would there have been the least possibility of any person being in possession of these boots that were made for a person that never called for them - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. At the time I brought them boots to Mr. Wilson, I asked Mr. Wilson if they suited him he asked me what I asked for them, I told him thirty-five shillings; he looked at them a great while and then said, which way did you come by these boots, I told him I bought them, he said, where did you buy them, I said, I did not know, the boots might be cabbaged I could not tell, I gave thirty shillings for them, I could not tell whether they were cabbaged or what. The last pair of boots I sold to Mr. Wilson was for a one pound note, I bought them in Petticoat-lane. He asked me where I lived, I told him I kept a shop in Monmouth-street, I stopped in it three weeks, I was obliged to pay twelve shillings a week for the shop.</p>
               <p>Wilson. The prisoner never sold me any boots before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You say the prisoner never sold you any boots - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived at the corner of that place - A. Seven years, and in the neighbourhood twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Limebeer of Fleet-street - A. I do not know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray has he had any suit against you at law - A. Yes, I know what you mean.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you were you ever in this court before - A. I have three or four months ago.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you make any boots yourself - A. Sometimes I do, I served my time to the trade.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you mean by saying that sometimes you manufacture them - A. When I get a small order I manufacture them.</p>

               <p>Q. You swore that they are not worth more than thirty shillings, we all have heard an honest tradesman say that they cost him forty-four shillings - A. They can be made for less.</p>

            . I am the wife of the prosecutor; I heard the alarm, I saw the prisoner crossing the street, he had the writing-desk in his possession, the boy cried out stop thief, he chucked the desk down, I picked it up, this is the desk, it is my husband's property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I unfortunately had been out of a situation for eighteen weeks, in the course of that time I distressed myself and wife, I had parted with every thing except what I had on and my wife too, I was turned out of my lodgings, and with difficulty I procured for her a place with a friend; I was two or three nights out in the street, after that I was in an alone garret; I was taken for a small debt and put in Tothill-fields where I was released out by a benevolent society, I came out and was with my wife in a starving garret, in an unfortunate hour I took the desk, I am conscious of the impropriety of my conduct, I am unfeignedly sorry for it.</p>

No. On the 18th of December I saw him, I told the people of the yard if he came to let me see him; when I saw him I said, what makes you so long before you come to my yard, it is a month ago you took my stable; he said his master was taken ill at Woolwich, and he was going to him on the next day.

            . I am a constable of St. Martin's in the Fields. In consequence of information I went down to Mr. Hornby's stables, on Wednesday the 19th of December, about eleven o'clock at noon, we got a ladder and looked through the window, and saw the horse that was described in the hand-bills in Mr. Hornby's yard, Bedfordbury; Mr. Hornby was by at the time. When I looked in the stable and saw the horse, Clark broke open the stable door with a chisel that Mr. Hornby lent him, we found only one horse in that stable, that horse was claimed by Mr. Baxter himself, he came down and claimed the horse as his; the horse is now in Mr. Baxter's possession.</p>
               <p>Q. to Harrowsmith. Is the horse in Mr. Baxter's possession - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. to Donaldson. Did you see the prisoner - A. Not till night. In the stable I found this saddle and bridle, I have kept them ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. to Harrowsmith. Look at that saddle and bridle - A. They were taken from Mr. Baxter's stable, I am positive the bridle and saddle is the property of my employer, they were in the same stable out of which the horse was stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. to Donaldson. When did you see the prisoner after this - A. About ten minutes past five on the 19th we apprehended him coming towards the stable where the horse was in; he was about six yards from the stable; we were in another stable, we let him go past, I said I got you, and took him in custody; he was troublesome; we searched him in the public-house, we were obliged to make use of great force, we found the key of the stable upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Hornby. Is that the key of the stable that you let to him - A. I believe it is.</p>

               <p>Donaldson. After we had put him in the watch-house I and Clark went up to his lodgings, Clark told me it was his lodgings, I found his wife there. In searching his lodgings, in a pail under the dresser, I found this halter with the initials of C. B. marked upon it.</p>
               <p>Harrowsmith. I will take my oath this is the halter that I left the horse tied up with on the 17th; it is one out of the two. And the horse is a gelding.</p>

            . Q. You were with Donaldson when this man was apprehended - A. Yes; in searching him I found in his left hand pocket this key, I tried it with the lock on the stable, it both locked and unlocked it; I understood by one of Mr. Baxter's men where the prisoner's lodgings were; I found a woman there that answered to his name; I afterwards saw them together at the watchhouse where they acknowledged each other as man and wife.</p>

            , I live in High-street, Marybone. On the 2d of this month I was sent by Mr. Ballinger to fetch a bundle from Greenwich; I got my bundle of linen and brought it safe to London; it was about nine at night. When I got near Oxford-street I met the prisoner at the bar, I asked him the nearest way I could go into Marybone. I have lived five years in High-street, but was never much out of the place; the prisoner said he would direct me the nighest road, he went along with me; when we came to Marybone-street there was a cooks-shop, I proposed to have some soup, as I was tired, and to give him some for his civility, he went in with me; we staid there about a quarter of an hour, he took part of the soup. When I left the cooks-shop I went up <placeName id="t18110109-42-crimeloc255">Marybone-court</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18110109-42-crimeloc255" type="placeName" value="Marybone-court"/>

               <p>Q. After that treatment from the man were you frightened - A. I was very much frightened indeed. I saw the prisoner again at the watchhouse in an hour or an hour and a half; I am very certain he is the man that robbed me of the property; I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what the contents of the bundle was - A. Yes, I do, a black silk gown, a muslin dress, a cotton gown, two pair of stockings, a cloak; the cloak, silk gown, and the cotton gown, were worth a pound, the muslin dress, ten shillings, a shift, a coral and necklace, I do not know the value of these things, a lace cloak I dare say worth ten shillings, a silk shawl and a silk handkerchief that was the whole contents; I had these to return to Mr. Ballinger.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the bundle ever been found since - A. I have never seen it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. What time of the night was it you were going through the street - A. It was near about nine o'clock, I met this man, it was dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever said that the person that robbed you wore a soldiers coat - A. No not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the man that robbed you a soldiers great coat on or not - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you did not make observations enough to speak to that fact - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you could not make great observation of the man - A. Yes, I knew him when I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a charge for a highway robbery, forty pounds would pay for the bundle - A. I do not know. I saw the bundle at the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. We heard you swear upon your oath, distinctly, that you never saw the things - A. I saw the bundle at the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Be attentive to your answers, you are upon your oath, how long might the man be with you - A. An hour.</p>
               <p>Q. And it might be an hour before you saw him in the watchhouse - A. I cannot say, it might be half an hour, from the place that he knocked me down and took the bundle out of my hand, before I followed him to the watchhouse, and saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. This man at the time he was taken he had no great coat on - A. Not as I know off, from the fright I was in, I hardly knew who he was in the watchhouse for the mob.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you would not have known him except he had been pointed out to you - A. No, he was not pointed out to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the man, at whose house you had the soup, here to day - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say you know the contents of the bundle, had you seen the contents - A. I had a proper knowledge of the bundle when I lost it, I had seen the contents, and tied it up myself.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time that you first saw him running, had he any thing with him - A. Not as I perceived, he was the person I saw running; I pursued him and cried, stop thief; there was nobody running after him but myself; he got down the mews and returned back, and went up alongside of the dead wall.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it - A. It was not a dark night, it was the second of this month, frosty weather. When he tureed back I ran up, I was within a yard or two, I asked what he had been doing to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181101090041"/>person that cried murder. I saw him drop the bundle, he gave me no answer; I picked up the bundle, he run off; I pursued him and kept him in sight, crying out stop thief, watchman; he was stopped between the officer and me, I saw the officer stop him. I lost sight of him turning the corner of Paradise-street, I was not above seven or eight yards from him at the time that he dropped the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the man that stopped him - A. Flowerdeau.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you - A. I am a carpenter, No 4, Spring-street; when he was stopped, the constable took him to the watchhouse, I saw the constable search him, he told the constable that he lived in Green-harbour-court, in the Old Bailey, the constable asked him what he did up there, he said for a spray or for a lark.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You are a carpenter, you live in that neighbourhood, in the New-road.</p>

               <p>Q. You pursued this man, this man was the only man that was running, he ran up the Mews - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It seems rather strange to me, from the account that I heard before, did not you hear the man say that she saw him drop the bundle crossing the street - A. I do not know half what she saw, I speak the truth, the man is a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there is such a thing as a forty pound reward - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you upon your oath did you never hear it - A. I have heard that there is such a thing, I do not know what it is, for I have heard them say if a man is found guilty, there is a reward of forty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you know the fact - A. I do not want any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. All that is avoiding my question you will not be believed. Answer my question, when you came into this court, did you not expect, and believe, that you should share of the reward - A. I did not expect any such thing, only that I should receive for my loss of time.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the man dropped the bundle up by the dead wall - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that the man dropped the bundle by the wall, or whether it was not dropped in crossing the street - A. By the wall, that is where I picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found the bundle did you go back to where the cry was - A. No; I never saw the woman until the man was taken to the watchhouse, then she came crying out who has got the bundle.</p>
               <p>COURT. Could any person that was in any part of Marybone-court, see a bundle drop where it did drop - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. How was the man dressed that you pursued, that dropped the bundle, in a soldiers coat - A. I took no notice of his coat at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you pretend to say, not having taken any notice of his coat, that the prisoner at the bar is the man that dropped the bundle - A. I only missed him when he turned the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. And although you cannot swear what his coat was, you could swear to his face - A. I cannot swear to his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. But you can swear to his face - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I must own to the truth I pledged one pair of pantaloons for four shillings; my master forgave me for so doing. I left my business because he had not constant work for me. The foreman called on me and told me that my master wanted to see me. He told me that he had lost five pair of stockings; they had been lost five weeks, and I had only been to work there three weeks; and twelve pair of cotton gloves, which were lost before I came there. I have been five years at sea. I hope you will have mercy on my unfortunate situation.</p>

My house was shut up, I had a little girl with me at the time; my little girl heard something; she said it was at my bed-room door, and then she heard the prisoner's door go. I thought he was putting his candle out as he used to do. One of the lodgers went up and came down, and said my room-door was half-way open; he had taken this key out and unlocked it; the key was brought down to me. I said this is the key of my bar that I had lost. I went up into my room, opened a box, and found a gold broach taken out. I had seen it there in the morning; the gold broach might be worth two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the month was this - A. It was in December; I did not exactly notice the day. There were some halfpence and penny-pieces found in his pocket; they had been standing in a tray upon my drawer in my bed room. I had seen the copper in my bedroom as late as half after six in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss a gold ring - A. Yes, that was in the same box with the broach.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the watch taken away on this day - A. About six or seven weeks before this.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the watch ever been found - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any of this copper money taken from the prisoner - A. Yes, I saw the whole taken from him by Thomas Hill, the constable, at about half after twelve at night; he took charge of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You have a great many lodgers in your house - A. At that time only three.</p>

Yes; on Monday, I think, the 10th of December, or early on Tuesday morning, I was getting my supper with Mrs. Payne, in the bar, her daughter said, there your door goes; I went up, I saw a key in the door, and the door half open. I did not go in the room, I locked the door, and took the key down. I dare say the prisoner had been up in his room an hour. Mrs. Payne desired me to go for a constable. Mr. Hill came; two watchmen, the constable, I and Mrs. Payne, went up into the prisoner's room. Mr. Hill tried to awake him; he could not; he searched his pockets, and took out a pocket-book; he did not awake though all these people were in this room; the constable opened the pocket-book, there was some silver, the ring, and the broach in it; then the constable took him in custody; he had halfpence in every pocket to the best of my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner in your shop - A. Yes, the prisoner with two others, came into my shop; one of the party, not the prisoner, asked for a halfpenny pickled cucumber; I served him with it; the same man asked for a halfpenny-worth of pepper; I served him with that; I had other customers in the shop at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that they all three came in together as companions - A. Yes. When they had the pepper and the cucumber, they looked at the window as they were going out, the bees-wax was in the front of the shop, and seeing them look at the window gave me suspicion. I looked at the window and missed the bees-wax immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other persons serving in the shop at the time - A. My wife and shopman. In consequence of missing the bees-wax, I immediately ran round the counter, and went into the street; I saw no other in the street than the prisoner; he had the beeswax rolled up in his apron. I laid hold of the prisoner, and brought him in; he scuffled to get away from me. He threw the wax from him. I then delivered him over to Wood; he has had the wax ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the worth of the wax - A. Sixteen shillings; there was five pound and a half.</p>

            . Q. How old are you - A. Sixteen next March. On Thursday the 27th of December, about one o'clock in the day, the prisoner came in; she asked to look at some ribbons. I shewed her some, they did not suit her. I shewed her another drawer, she looked at them some time. I perceived her shawl come over the drawer, and I thought her hand was underneath, and she withdrew it immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. When she withdrew her hand, did she withdraw her shawl to - A. Yes, but I did not see any alteration in the drawer of ribbons; she looked at them a little, and then asked me to look at some narrower. I put that drawer away; I shewed her the third drawer of narrow ribbons; her shawl came over the drawer again in the same way; she withdrew her hands and looked at the ribbons. Again I suspected that she had taken some. She then asked me if I had got any narrower; I put that drawer away and got another narrower still, she took up one, asked the price and told me to cut a yard off, while I was cutting it off, her hand came in the same way. I saw a piece of ribbon. I then put the drawer away, and told my master there was a thief in the shop. While I was doubling up the ribbon, I accused her of taking some, and directly I accused her, she took them out, and laid them on the counter one at a time. I went for a constable, and she was secured.</p>
               <p>Partridge. I have got the ribbon; this is it.</p>
               <p>Williams. I saw her produce the ribbon; it is part of my master's stock.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you lose these things - A. I cannot say; I discovered it on the 7th of December that I had lost three sheets. I picked up a pawnbroker's ticket by accident. I examined it, and found it was my property. I saw Bell's name on the duplicate.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Bell - A. She lived servant with me, and Goff lived servant with me before Bell. I found other duplicates in a drawer in Bell's bed-room.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did it really for want; I must leave it to the mercy of the Court.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the two prisoners at the bar - A. I never saw them before they were charged on the 4th of December, about twenty minutes past three, I was in the bakehouse at work.</p>
               <p>Q. They were charged with stealing two watches, and two gold seals, what part of the house were they in - A. They hung over the chimney piece of the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the seals that were at the watches both gold - A. Yes. I heard an alarm by my wife, crying out,</p>
               <p>"Clay, the watches, the watches!" I ran to her immediately and pursued, but did not find neither of the prisoners, but on returning back I met a neighbour, he told me he saw two boys running, and we might see those two boys in the dock opening. This was the 4th that the watches were stolen, on the 7th me and my wife went to the dock opening, they were gambling among the Portuguese, me and my wife saw the prisoner Lewis there, I went for an officer; before I got back from fetching the officer it got dark, they all left the dock opening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your watches - A. I saw one of the watches, but none of the seals; I knew it to be one of the watches that I lost on this day.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Clay. Q. Were you at home on the 4th - A. Yes, I was in the kitchen, adjoining the parlour, on the same floor, about a quarter past three; I saw both the watches safe in the parlour, they were hanging up at the chimney-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that was it that you heard any thing that induced you to believe they were gone - A. About twenty minutes after I was in the kitchen, I saw the prisoner Lewis making way over the counter to make away with the property. I am certain he was the lad.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see whether he had any thing in his possession - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the other prisoner - A. I did not. I thought he was about taking a quartern loaf, I went directly into the shop, I did not miss any thing from the shop; I came into the parlour and looked round me, and missed the two watches immediately; one of the watches had two seals. I went out every day to the dock opening to look for them, I did not see either of them until the Friday, I pointed out the boy Lewis to my husband. I had seen him often as a customer in the shop, he had come for three weeks and purchased small bread.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not apprehended on the Friday - A. No. Q. Was any thing found upon him when he was taken in custody - A. No. The watch was found afterwards at the cooks-shop, that is one of the watches that was taken from my parlour.</p>

            Yes, I know the them both. On the 4th of December the two prisoners and another person came to my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it on the 4th - A. It was on a Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the 7th of December - A. They had something to eat, and after they ate it they came to pay for it; one of them offered me a bad shilling; the boy that is in court offered me a bad shilling, he was with them; I told them I could not take it, then they said I must trust them; I said I could not, they must leave something; they offered me a watch, I am not certain whether it was this boy or Lewis; they were both standing at the counter, they all three had something to eat, and were in company together; they offered the watch, and left it as security, and they would call and pay the reckoning. I delivered the watch to Mr. 
               <persName id="t18110109-52-person588">Gray</persName>
             the constable; Mr. Clay saw it and paid me the shilling that was left on it. They told me first they had got the boy, and then afterwards they said if the boy came to stop him. The same night Lewis came and said he wanted the watch; I told 
               <persName id="t18110109-52-person589">Lewis</persName>
             I had not got the watch. I said you are a pretty fellow, you have stolen the watch; he said it was no such thing. Directly Mr. Clay came in and and asked me if that was the boy, I said yes, and secured him. I am sure he was one of the party that left the watch and came for it.</p>

            Being about the London docks.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in his company on the evening of the 4th of December - A. I was in his company at the Hampshire Hog, Lewis joined my company there, the boy was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the other boy - A. Much about the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed then - A. Lewis told me that he had a watch; I asked him where he got it from; he said he stole it from a watch-maker, I asked him whereabouts; he did not give me a correct account so I left him for that night. I did not see him again till the 7th of December, then I went with him to the cooks-shop to have my dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to the cooks-shop, you had no money to pay for your dinner - A. I took the bad shilling of the cook-shop man, he would not take it, he said he would trust me. Lewis took the watch out of his pocket and said, what will you give me for this; the cook-shop man said a pound: Lewis said he would not take it, it was worth three or four; he told him to take care of it for him until he should call for it at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he keep it for the reckoning - A. No. The two lads paid for what they had, except myself, he left the watch with Wicks to take care for him. I went along with Lewis to the London docks, I was standing there a good while, and about dusk Gray came and took me by the collar and said, I had stolen two watches; he took me to the watchhouse, from that they took me to Lambeth-street office, there I told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181101090046"/>them all I knew.</p>

On the 16th of August the prisoner brought me a house note from the India House, and asked me if I would buy his wages; he informed me that he came home in the Nottingham, East Indiaman. I saw the note and asked him if he would let me take it to the India House to see if it was for a man that had come home, he informed me that his name was Gwillam Anthony; I went and enquired, they said there was a man of that description; I then got the bill of sale for the prisoner to execute; I got two men to be witnesses; I read the bill of sale over to him twice, and asked him if it was right.</p>
               <p>Q. What amount in money did you understand his wages to come to - A. Sixteen pound nineteen shillings and two-pence; I gave him fourteen pound and two-pence; I deducted one shilling, in the pound poundage, and fifteen shillings for the bill of sale.</p>
               <p>Q. When are these wages paid - A. Sometimes three months after, and sometimes sooner. No further passed than I gave him the money, he signed his name Gwillam Anthony.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he sign it - A. He made his mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober - A. Yes; this was on the 16th of August, as nigh as I can recollect. In November I went to the India House to receive the money, it was stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. How was this executed - A. In my parlour, before him and the witnesses.</p>
               <p>Q. Who wrote the name, Gwillam Anthony - A. I did, and read it over to him, and asked him if it was right; he said, yes; I asked him to sign it, he made his mark here; I asked him if that was his right name, he said yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did this without any man to advise him what he was about; he is a foreigner - was there any attorney present - A. No.</p>

               <p>SIMON CULLOM. I live at Stoke Newington, I am a labouring gardener; I work or Mr. Eade in Church-street. On the 29th of September I came into town, and went into Petticoat-lane to buy some sweet meats; it was then a little after eight, after I bought the sweet meats to put in my window for my wife to sell I turned to go to Brick-lane; I turned into an alley to make water, and coming out of the alley the prisoner and another woman took hold of the basket on my arm; I asked them what they meaned by it, they said they would see what I had got in my basket, and while the other woman had hold of the basket, the prisoner let go and stripped my clothes down, and opened them; she then said to the other woman, let us go. I gave no attention to the money in my pocket; I had no suspicion that they were robbing me.</p>
               <p>Q. They were using no violence to you - A No. After I came out of the alley I went on to Brick-lane, I bethought myself of the money; I felt in my pocket, my money was gone; I then pursued after them. I overtook the prisoner, I accused her of the robbery; I am sure she is the same woman; there was another woman with her when I overtook her, but whether that was the same woman I will not say. I am sure the prisoner is the same woman that stripped my coat open; the prisoner denied robbing me; they both gave me a blow and knocked me down; I got up again and ran after the prisoner; the prisoner was secured, the other woman ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you miss from your pocket - A A dollar, a half crown, and four shillings and sixpence in silver. The prisoner was searched at the watchhouse, she laid down two crown pieces, and said she would pledge the ring off her finger to make up the other money. The officer searched her and found one shilling and sixpence more upon her; there was a sixpence among the money that I had taken in Petticoat-lane to the best of my belief.</p>

No. 27, Cow Cross, he was not at home. I found a quantity of scantlings, deal ends, and joists. concealed under the coals in the cellar; I looked at these pieces. I knew them to be mine by the private marks I ordered the carpenter to put on them when taking down. The prisoner was kept out of the way I believe: I never saw the prisoner untill Mr. Harmer introduced him at Hatton Garden office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. In what capacity did you employ the prisoner - A. As master bricklayer, to superintend and carry on the work.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted in the course of the business he has done for you, he has earned a great deal of money, how many men did he employ - A. Open to the amount of six or seven, and sometimes one or two and sometimes none.</p>
               <p>Q. The consequence arises there must be a great deal of money due to him - A A great deal of money for a little work. He made no claim but what he got.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not he threatened to arrest you before you had accused him that he had robbed you - A. No, never before I got another man to do his work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he threaten to arrest you before you complained to the magistrate against him - A. He never threatened to arrest me until this moment.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by saying that he never threatened to arrest you until you had got another man to do his work - A. He threatened to serve me out in an open tap-room in public company, on a certain day.</p>
               <p>Q. And before that certain day was, you applied at Hatton Garden office and accused him before the magistrate - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a bold question to put to you - has not he accused you of altering a receipt of his from twenty pound to one hundred and twenty pounds as money paid - A He never has.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon you oath did not Mr. Harmer in my presence before the magistrate accuse you, or complain that it was altered from twenty pound to one hundred and twenty pounds, and was it not snatched out of his hand - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the paper snatched out of Mr. Harmer's, hand which was presented to the magistrate - A. Mr. Harmer snatched a paper out of Mr. Fletcher's hands, and Mr. Fletcher snatched it back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive from the prisoner a receipt for the sum of one hundred and twenty pound - A. From his wife I did. On the 31st of November I paid her a one hundred pound note, and a twenty pound note before a witness, she gave me a receipt for the one hundred and twenty pound on plain paper.</p>
               <p>Q. I will now ask you, whether true or false, did not he serve you with a bill of one hundred and thirty seven pound - A. On that day I was in the back premises, he and another man came, and the other man had a thick stick in his hand, he presented me a bill of one hundred and thirty seven pound.</p>
               <p>Q. This was the day before Christmas-day; was it not - A. No.</p>

            Then it was on the 23d of December - A. Upon my word I cannot recollect, I cannot say whether it was the day before Christmas day or not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many days after that was it you went to the police office - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath that you have taken did not you go to the police office the next day out one; and the reason that you did not go the next day was because it was Christmas day, the police office was not open - A. I went as soon as the information was given.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not suppose that you will dupe me that way, nor my lord, nor the jury - A. I tell you the truth, I did not look at the bill; I put it in my pocket.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TAITE. I am a carpenter.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you employed by the prosecutor after the prisoner had left - A. Yes, and I worked for Mr. Cummings when Fowler did, and was discharged with him, and upon the prisoner being discharged I applied to Mr. Cummings for the job; Mr. Cummings told me that I had robbed his premises; I told him that the person that told him so was the greatest thief; I told him then what I saw the prisoner take out; I had seen him take boards out of Mr. Cummings's house that he was building, and took them to the prisoner's house. After this Mr. Cummings had a search warrant. I went with the constables who had the search warrant. The wood was found in the prisoners coal cellar. I saw the private mark upon the wood, some red chalk marks.</p>

            . Q. You are the acting partner with Mr. Cook, a carpenter - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. We understand you contracted at the time with the London Dock company for putting down the piles - A. Yes. When the timber is brought into the dock it is mine; when it is put down a clerk of the company measures it, it then becomes the dock company's property. I went with the lad and found the man at work in the trench that was cutting out for the piles, and the officer took him to Cohen's house; Cohen immediately brought forward the wood, the prisoner said it was the first piece of wood that ever he took from the premises. This is the piece of wood, it is the top of the pile, and here is the mark of the engine.</p>
               <p>- COHEN. I bought the wood last Sunday was a week; there were two men, each of them had logs. That gentleman came in the early part of the morning, he asked me if I had bought a piece of wood, I told him, yes, and shewed him the piece of wood; he came afterwards with the constable and took it away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In the morning when I came to work I had no victuals to eat. I have three young children, they were distressed; I took this bit of wood and sold it to get my children a bit of bread. I leave myself to your mercy.</p>

I then made the best of my way out of the house and looked in the boot, I saw the articles were gone. I left the coach and looked round and saw the prisoner in the road; I followed him until he got in the footway, and by the light of a silversmiths shop I saw the box under his arm in the bag; the bag and box were mine; I seized hold of the prisoner by the collar, and told him the property under his arm was mine; he dropped it, and told me he had not got any thing of mine.

             came to me, he offered me some knives and forks, handles that had been broken up; I saw a crest on them, I questioned him; he said they belonged to a servant; the silver was wrapped up in a letter addressed from Mr. Phillips in Bond-street, to Mr. Lawrence. I detained the silver. The man called again in about two hours, saying, that the silver had come from Mr. Phillips, that it was found by a charwoman in a place where they considered it was of no value, and they made a perquisite of it. I told him to call on me at seven or eight o'clock in the evening; he came, and the constable took him in custody, and took the silver from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the woman - A. Not till I saw her at the office, there the prisoner said the charwoman was his wife.</p>

            . Q. You took this man in custody at the silver smiths shop - A. Yes. I asked him how he came by it, he said his wife found it where she was at work at Mr. Phillips's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the wife present at that time - A. No; she was charing at Mr. Phillips's. I then thought it right to take the prisoner and the silver to Mr. Phillips's to see if they knew the property; they claimed the property. I laid the property on the table, I asked her how she came by it; she said she found them in a dust hole, wrapped up in paper, and begged to be forgiven. I searched their lodgings; the husband and wife both told me where they lodged; I went in company with the witness Phillips, and there found the glasses and china. The woman said they were given her by a servant of Mr. Phillips's; I never could see that servant, she only came occasionally.</p>
               <p>Miss Phillips I believe it to be my brother's property. I can speak to this socket of a candlestick that we used. The silver socket is worth half a crown.</p>

I brought some poultry with me for Newgate Market; when I got to town the first thing was to unload the Poultry, meat, and other things opposite the <placeName id="t18110109-66-crimeloc396">White Hart in St. John-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was there any person in the care of the waggon - A. I do not think there was. I returned a little after seven.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came back did you miss any thing - A. Yes; we could see the space where it was taken from, in the front of the waggon. It was a portmanteau that was gone, belonging to Mr. Travers.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen it since - A. Yes, I saw it on the same day at the Swan in St. John's-lane.</p>

             I am a table keeper in Peter-street; I take in between to Smithfield market. On the 12th of November between six and seven o'clock I saw the waggon in St. John-street. I saw the prisoner standing on the shafts of the waggon with both his hands up, as if he was undoing some lines, or else endeavouring to get the portmanteau off; I knew the prisoner for several years, I turned round and looked at him; he saw me take notice of him; I have known him to work occasionally in the market as a drover; seeing me take notice of him he set himself on the shafts, folded his arms, and held his head down, as if I should not see who he was. I had a drove of beasts which I took in the market, and returned as soon as I could. I returned in about a quarter of an hour. I had information that the portmanteau was gone; I saw Kemp (the waggoner), and the beadle of the parish; they requested me to go along with them to the prisoner's lodging, we did not find the prisoner nor the property there. I did not see the prisoner for a great many weeks afterwards, until he was taken up to Hatton Garden office. I am certain he was the person that I saw on the shafts.</p>

            . I was at the corner of St. John's Lane, on the day the waggon was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I cannot swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. I did not ask you what he did - do you know him - A. I have seen him four or five times, but as to speak to him I never did; he goes by the name of Skippey. It might be between five and six in the morning; when I saw him it was not day light. I was coming from my master's house, No. 20, St. John's Lane, to go with the sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see - A. I saw a man with a portmanteau, or a parcel, what it was I cannot say. He might be about half a dozen yards from the waggon when I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. What sized man was be - A. About the same height as the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you have seen the prisoner a great many times, you have heard his name was Skippey, you will not swear it is him - A. No.</p>
               <p>JOHN WETCH. I drive a horse and cart for Mr. Taylor, a bricklayer, in St. John's-lane. On the day this robbery was committed I was in Eagle-court, I found this trunk there, at the back of my master's shed; I told our bricklayer of it, he took it to Mr. Taylor's house, the White Swan; I went with him. It was the same portmanteau I afterwards saw at the magistrates.</p>
               <p>JAMES HANCOCK. I am an officer of Hatton Garden office. I produce a portmanteau I received at the White-Swan on the 12th of November. I received an information from Mr. Taylor that there had been a robbery. I went in search of the prisoner, I did not find him; he was absent from the 12th of November till the 11th of December, I was obliged to serve Richards with a summons to bring him forward.</p>
               <p>Q. to Kemp. Is that the portmanteau that you had with the waggon - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN GOFF. I apprehended the prisoner on the 11th of December in the borough of Southwark; I told him I took him for a robbery in Smithfield; he said, I am innocent of it; it is of no use, I know I shall be done for it, he would go quietly with me; he did.</p>
               <p>Q. to Batfield When you left St. John-street to take care of the cattle did you leave the prisoner upon the shafts of the waggon - A. Yes, he was sitting on the shafts of the waggon when I left him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing about it. I am as innocent as a child.</p>

The prisoner met me about the India House, he asked me if I knew any Russian officers; I said, no; he said he had lost his master. I shewed him where I lived on Monday; I told him to call on me, I might get him a situation. On Tuesday he brought the bundle to my house, and left it in the room, where three young men slept; I thought of getting him a ship; he was taken up, and taken to the Compter. I went to the Compter and asked him what he had done, he said he had bought a soldiers shirt, and gave three shillings for it. This is the shirt. I brought this bundle down when the officer came, and the soldier claimed the shirt.</p>

And the last wife said that she has known a gentleman in the army, a lieutenant, and that if I did not support her as well as the lieutenant she would go and live with him, Since our separation she has been living with the said lieutenant.</p>

On the 8th of December, in the morning, Mr. Sapwell came to me; I went with him to the Poultry Compter, there I saw Catherine Parker in custody; from there I went in a coach to Shoreditch Church. The prisoner Wilkes was brought to me, and a quantity of meat, it was not cut like a butcher, and by comparing it to the other part of the carcase, I found it tallied.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any cloth produced to you - A. Yes. The cloth was brought into the coach, it had my name on it. The prisoner Wilkes said he bought it; I said, did you buy the cloth; he said, no, he believed that was left with it.</p>

I returned to the slaughter-house the next morning, between four and five o'clock, I found the staple had been drawn, and when I went in I found three carcases of beef cut, and the hog gone, likewise the cloth round it. I went back and informed my master. I have seen the cloth since, master's name is on it.</p>

            . I am a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of information that you received did you go in a coach with the prosecutor - A. Yes, to a house in White Bear Gardens, near Shoreditch Church; the prisoner was at work; he is a turner; Armstrong spoke to him, because I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any butcher's shop - A. No, by no means; there was a turner's shop. I went up stairs, there I found a quantity of beef and pork, in different parts of the room, some on the bed; there were two or three hundred weight; I found some cloths. In a drawer in the lower room I found an iron crow, he said he used it in his business; I saw some meat hanging backwards, and I ran up stairs, the room was literally covered with meat.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA ARMSTRONG. I am an officer: I was with Sapwell; the wife opened the door, then I saw the prisoner Wilkes, he was at work in a back shed; I told him we wanted to speak to him; he came out of the place he was working in. Sapwell went up stairs; he came down and told us to secure the prisoner, we did. After all the meat was brought down I asked the prisoner how he came by that meat, he gave me no answer. The meat was then put into the cloths and put into the coach, and he was taken to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. to Sapwell I ask you now about Parker - A. On the 8th of December, about half past eleven in the morning, I was going down Wheeler street. I met

I was not satisfied with that, I looked, and found it was meat under her arm, it was upwards of twenty pounds weight of flank beef, wrapped up in a cloth. I asked her where she got it from, and in consequence of the information she gave me I went to Wilkes.</p>

            . Q. Do you know the prisoner Wilkes - A. No, not long; there is some resemblance of him. Mr. Sapwell stopped me with some meat, I misunderstood him. I bought the meat of the prisoner. I gave the account where Wilkes lived.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. You misunderstood Sapwell - how came you to say you had got silk - A. I said I was going for silk. I was in a flurry.</p>

When the prisoner came down he put his hand, and felt about it, I could not see who it was; he had a military coat; he turned the chest on its edge; he took a bag out of his pocket, and began to fill the bag; I let him go, he filled the bag, and shook it, he turned round and faced me, and put it in his hat, and then put his hat on his head; I called out what are you doing there? I jumped down and seized him; he said, what is the matter? I said, you know what is the matter, you have plundered a chest of tea; he said, pray forgive me, I have a little tea in my hat. I told him I knew he had, I could not forgive him; I took him down into the elder's accompting-house, he then laid down his hat.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any pigs in your field on the 8th of December - A. Yes, in the Spa-field, facing the chapel; there were three of them; one of them came home rather sooner than the others did. I missed two of the sows. On that evening we made every enquiry we could, and heard nothing of them. On Monday an officer of Worship-street called at our house and gave some information; my man went to the Basing House. One was a fine sow-pig, ten weeks in the pig, the other was a young one; I saw the carcases in Worship-street, I am very certain they were my pigs. One was a black and white sow, and after they had been scalded the black marks still remained.</p>
               <p>- ADAMS. I am a servant to Mr. Ashton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know these pigs were your master's - A. I had every reason to believe they were them. I knew them by the head, and by the feet; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181101090055"/>fore-feet were not scalded, they were white feet, and a black mark down the back, it was just the same after they were scalded. I knew the breeding and the rearing of them. I missed them on the 8th of December. I had seen them on that day, between ten and eleven o'clock. These were three pigs in the field, one of them came home about twelve o'clock and seemed terrified.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the Basing-house to Mr. Kelly's. - A. Yes, and there I saw the pigs that my master had lost. I have no doubt at all about it.</p>

About four o'clock in the afternoon I was going home, Mr. Kelly's wife came after me to go into the shop; there I saw young Kelly and the prisoner. When I got into the shop the prisoner asked me to kill a couple of pigs for him that night, he would pay me any thing. I told him I would charge him five shillings and something to drink I saw the prisoner go down the yard and drive them into the slaughter-house. Kelly knocked them down, and I stuck them. They were killed and drest, one was a large black and white sow, the other was a white sow. I took their heads off, and cleaved them down.

               <p>"you have got my handkerchief in your hand," he said</p>
               <p>"no it is not your handkerchief," I said it was, I put my hand upon it, he said some other person gave it him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any person near enough to have handed to him - A. Not as I know of, I said</p>
               <p>"very well, we will settle that presently," I had only my hand on his shoulder, he slipped from me, and ran across the street and down a court, I believe White Horse Court, and as I went to cross the street, I fell over some rubbish, I heard some person say the court was no thoroughfare, Mr. Cass cried out,</p>
               <p>"stop thief," I ran down the court, and saw the prisoner in the middle of the court, I could not take him then, there were three or four people buzzing about him, he avoided me, and ran into Mr. Cass's hands. When I came to the top of the court I catched hold of his collar, we took him to the

            , Bow Street. I had taken the handkerchief out of his hand before he ran away. This is the handkerchief, it is exactly the same pattern I had in my pocket in the morning, it is worth four or five shillings. In going down Bow Street, he looked round. and two or three young men kept buzzing about, we put him in an Hackney coach, he begged that I would not appear against him. He said he was a very good young man, it was his first offence I told him, if he told me where he lived, and he had a good character, I would not take him to Bow Street.</p>
               <p>MR. CASS. I am a linen draper, I was with Mr. Cooper on this evening, we were walking arm in arm together, I observed two or three young men behind they appeared to be in company together, I turned round two or three times to let them pass, the prisoner was the only one that passed us, and after the prisoner passed us I observed the handkerchief in his hand; Mr. Cooper laid hold of his arm with one hand, and took the handkerchief with the other, he told the prisoner it was his handkerchief, I think he denied it, when Mr. Cooper took the handkerchief, he ran across the street, Mr. Cooper fell down, (I saw two or three young men running across the road, they appeared to be pursuing as well as us) I cried out stop thief, he ran into a court, I catched him as he returned back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In the afternoon of that day, I had been to see a relation, in my way home I met an old school-fellow whom I had not seen some years, and on our coming up Catherine Street in the Strand, my school-fellow put a handkerchief in my hand, and before I had time to ask him the reason of so extraordinary a circumstance, the prosecutor came up and asked me for the handkerchief, upon which I was alarmed, and had no doubt he had stolen it from the prosecutor; upon the prosecutor's attempting to take me, I ran away; I do solemnly declare my running away was not from a consciousness of guilt, but for my unfortunately happening to be with one who had so departed from moral honesty, and what adds to my affliction is the shame it has brought on my family; I hope your Lordship will extend mercy to me, which will be the study of my life to shew my gratitude.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I met Mr. Ayres and Edy in the street, we stopped in Gough Square, Mr Ayres took me of one side, and stated, Mr. Falding you need not be afraid of trusting Mr. Edy now, his uncle is dead, and left him six thousand pounds, Edy was dressed in mourning with a black crape, I made an appointment to meet that day at three or four o'clock, we did not meet on that day, the next day Mr. Edy called at my warehouse, I made my transaction in confidence of the report of Mr. Ayres, I sold my goods to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What goods were looked out. - A. A variety of Manchester goods to the amount, I think, from five to six hundred pounds. It was agreed upon that he should give bills of different dates, these bills were given</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Are these bills here. - A It is impossible for me to have the bills that are paid, the bills that are not paid are not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with Mr. Edy afterwards . A. In last August I told Mr. Edy that he had made false representations, I said, Mr. Edy was it you or Mr. Ayres that imposed upon me, is answer was, that he had nothing to do with it, it was a contrivance of Mr Ayres , that he was perfectly ignorant at the moment, I added, you are a very apt scholar, you told me you were going to a professional gentleman, for the purpose to prevent an elder brother, in case of your death within a twelvemonth, to secure the property for your wife and family; he said, as Mr Ayres stated it, he confirmed it; I reproached him for deceiving me, he said, well such a thing will take place I have an expectance.</p>

Edy replied, I have an expectance, I have a rich relation , who when he dies, will leave me all his property. The goods were all delivered before this, I kept the books at that time</p>
