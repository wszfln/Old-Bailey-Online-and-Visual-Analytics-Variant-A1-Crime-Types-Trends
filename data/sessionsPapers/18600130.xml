Mr. Stuart; also for obtaining goods of Messrs.

Between 9 and 10 on the night of 16th of this month, in consequence of information which was given to me, I went to George-court, Fox-court, Gray's-inn-laue—I first went to No. 1 in the court, where Slater lives—I found him there, and took him into custody—I told him it was for being concerned with others in</p>

I am a schoolmaster living at Bower-street, Commercial-road-east—on the night of 12th January I retired to bed about 12 o'clock—before doing so I had locked and bolted She doors, and made the house secure—I took up a newspaper to my bedroom with me, and after reading it for some time I threw it on the floor—in about an hour, or an hour and a half, as I was between asleep and awake, I heard the paper crumpling—I listened attentively, and still heard it crumpling—thinking it was the cat, I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker at 62, Cornhill—I was in my such in the evening of 19th January, about 6 o'clock—the prisoner came in and asked to look at a gold hunting-watch with a white dial to it, which was in the window—my son brought a tray of gold hunters out of the window which contained fifteen gold hunting-watches—I placed them before the prisoner—he directly picked up one with a gold dial to it, saying as preferred a gold dial to a white one—he looked at a number of the saying he and said that his brother had purchased one of me before at 28 guiness—after some time he selected oue for himself at 30 guineas, which was placed on one side for him—he then asked to look at some gold chains—my assistant got several out of the window, which I showed to him, and he selected one at 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then sat down to make out the account, and by the time I had finished it the prisoner said he should like to have his initials engraved on the seal which was on the chain—he said his initials were R.S. and that his name was Robert Somers—I told him that the engraving of the seal would take until 1 o'clock the next day, at which time he said he would come for the watch and chain—he asked me if I should require a deposit—I told him it was usual in such cases, and he put his hand in his pocket and threw down a sovereign—while I was making out the account, I saw him take up this chain (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the counter—it was one of those which he had been looking at—it is a very pliable chain—lie put it✗ the palm of his left hand, and immediately after that I saw him take up this large chain, and put that into his left hand—he held the two in that way, dangling one end of the large chain over his finger—it attracted my attention—I saw the seal of the small chain distinctly in his hand at the time he was dangling the larger one, so that I knew he had two chains in his hand—I watched his hand very closely, and I saw him afterwards drop the large chain on the counter—I am perfectly confident he only dropped the large one—he soon after that left the shop—I followed him and</p>

               <p>beckoned to my assistant to follow me, and the moment we got outside, the door I said something to my assistant, and he brought the prisoner hack—I then told him that I thought I should like to show him one or two other chains before he want and I desired young man to get a tapered wire chain out of the window to show him—that was the chain which I knew the prisoner had got in his pocket—my young man looked through the window, and told me the chain wap not there—that was said in the hearing of, the prisoner—just at that moment I saw under the prisoner's left hand something shining through the fingers—I had seen the prisoner immediately after he came back into the shop pass his left hand behind him, then bearing of the prisoner—Just at that momet I saw under the prisoner's left hand something shining through the finger—I had seen the prisoner immediately after he came and place it on the counter—I the moment I saw something shining through his fingers I went round to the side of the sounter and lifted up his hand, and there was this gold watch—I "Halloo, what watch is this?" taking it up—I looke at to satisfy myself that it was one of my yatohes, and finding that it was, I said, "This is my watch, you have stolen it; you have just now taken it out of your pocket, and you have a chain of in your pocket"—the prisoner made no reply concerning the watch, but he began to talk in rather an incoherent manner, and said, "You charge me with having one of your chains in my pocket, Mr. French; you had better see if it is not upon your counter amongst your other chains"—I said, "No; if it is not there"—but I looked again, and there I found the chain—I had looked in the tray where the chains were when the prisoner came back, and after I had told my young man to get the chain out of the window—the prisoner at that time passed his hand amongst one or two chains on the counter, just touched two or three of them, and said "No; I don't thick I shall change; I shall keep the one I have selected"—before he said that, while my young man was looking for this chain in the window, I passed my hand through all the chains on the counter to see if this one was there and it was not there—the chain is worth eight guineas, and the watch 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—my house is in the parish of St. Peter, Coruhill.</p>

               <p>that he had taken the chain, and I am quite certain of it still—I have an doubt that he placed it afterwards on the counter when he was looking over the chains—I don't know how the watch went; I did not see it go—he was in the shop the second time probably three or four minutes before I saw the watch near him—when I said, "This is my watch "the prisonor made no observation—I sent for a policeman immediately, and, as he did not produce the chain, I gave him into custody—I rather think it was before I gave him into custody that I found the chain, or else it was immediately after<lb/>wards; but I gave him into custody for stealing the watch—both the watch and the chain were prominent in my mind—after I had seen the watch and under his hand I knew that he must have stolen it, because I knew it was not there when he came back—I had handed all the watches from the counter to my young man—my assistant and I were not half-a-minute out of the shop when we went after the prisoner, and my son was left in the shop during that time—there were two other persons also at the back part of the shop, one a watchmaker, and the other an assistant, both in my employment.</p>

I am landlady of the Waggon and Horses at Brentford—on 10th September I was at home till a quarter to 11 o'clock—I then went to town, leaving everything safe—I left my bedroom door locked—it is on the first floor, and left the key with the barmaid—I left my cash-box locked in a drawer which was also locked—I had just taken out as much money as I wanted from it, and left 116<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a guinea, and a threepenny<lb/>piece—there was 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes, and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in <hi rend="italic">gold</hi>—they were rolled up in tens—the money was intended for the brewer and distiller, who would have been paid on the Monday—I returned home at a quarter to 5, and found my bedroom door burst open, tearing the lock from the wood-work; the caaly box was turned upside down on the bed, the purse turned out, and the money all gone; the door and and the drawer had both been prised open very neatly—the prisoners had come to my house with another person a the Monday before, in a light cart—this plan of my house is perfectly correct; here is one passage leading to the garden, and the other is in ascent to the bedrooms—the men ran about a great deal—I served clark with a pot of beer—they ran in and out of the tap-room—they brought a rump steak with them to be cooked, and I superintended the cooking—I do not recollect that they went into the garden that day—they eat the rump steak at the tap.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Clark. Q.</hi> Do you recollect the numbers of the notes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the silver was rolled up in pounds for the facility of giving change—the potman has worked for me five or six months—I had no character with him; but his father is well known in Richmond to be a hard-working man, and I took him on his father's credit—I have not the slightest suspicion of his honesty—there were two other chests of drawers in the same room; they were not touched—I believe you gave me a sixpence—you had only a pot of half<lb/>and-half between the three—I saw Thorpe near the stairs, but that was after the robbery was over—I had not seen him in the passage the stairs—he has a brother a respectable builder at Feltham.</p>

                  </hi>. On 16th September I was waiter at the Waggon and Horses—on the Monday before the 16th I saw the prisoners and another party—they were there two hours and a half or three hours—they brought a steak, had it cooked, and were walking about in front of the bar—I saw them go down the passage leading to the garden—they had a cart and a little cob horse—they had their refreshment in the parlour, which is near in the staircase—they walked about both before and after having it, round the garden and into the stable-yard—they went past the passage leading to the staircase several times—I was going up stairs, and was stopped by the parlour bell ringing—a commercial traveller had rung, and one or two of the men were then in front of the bar, but not all three—I went into the</p>

               <p>kitchen again; and as I went up stairs I saw the prisoners go to the door to Start—they started in a hurry; it was raining—I did not see them get into their cart—I asked the barmaid whether they had paid; she said "Yes," and when I looked out they were going nearly as fast the horse could go—I then went up stairs and saw my mistress's door ajar—I came down again and told the barmaid—I had been up stain before 1 o'clock and again between 1 and 2—the door was then closed—it was 4 o'clock when I found it open—my mistress's sister and the barmaid, and the ostler all went up—I afterwards went in and saw my mistress's cash-box broken open on the bed, and two or three shillings strewed about—that was not a minute after I saw the men go away.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, T</hi> 16). I went to make inqtriries in consequence of an anonymous letter I received—I was in charge it Brentford police-station on Monday morning, 12th December, about 10 o'clock, and Clark's wife, or some pereon who said she was Clark's wife, came to see him—I took her to where he was—he said to her I have got no one to blame but your b—father, and I shall get twelve months over the b—job; he repeated that three times.</p>

On Friday, 16th the two gentleman came to me again and asked me to go to Slough with them. I did so; stopped an hour while they did their business, and on our way home we stopped at the Waggon and Horses. I declined to pay 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to put my horse up, as it would not pay me to do so having</p>

               <p>to pay the duy; and while we were waiting there, I had conversation with the ostler respecting some corn; he led me into the back garden, which, it appears, is open morning and night. We left the house after stopping three hours. On 8th and 9th December, my father-in-law and I had a bit of a quarrel because he did not clean my cab, and I got locked up, and was then told that'I was wanted for stealing a gash-box at Brentford. I said, f I never did such a thing in my life." When the potman came to identify me, I said, "Have you nothing to say to me? he would not answer; presently in came the head ostlert, I said, "Are you the person who has come to recognise the party who stole the cash-box:" he said, "Yes;" and asked me to allow him to put his hat on my head, which I refused. When I went back to the cell the thoughts of my wife and child came into my head and filled my mind with horror, so that I hardly knew what I was doing, and when the policeman came to the cell, I might, in a moment of agitation, have expressed myself in the manner he says. There are several rooms on the landing, and only one was broken open; there were several chests of drawers in the room, and several drawers, but only one drawer was broken open, and that the right one. The prosecutrix cannot say that any one offered her money in chang to induce her to go up stairs for them to see which room she went to. I have two children in their coffins, and another not expected to live; my wife is waiting to know whether I shall be restored to liberty or not, and I can speak no more</p>

I am shopman to Mr. Dawbarne, a grocer in Broad-street, Bloomsbury—he also keeps the post-office receiving house there—the post-office adjoins the shop—there is a partition between them, but it does not go to the top—it is on the light hand side as you go in—the counter is on the left hand side—you can go from the shop into the receiving house; there is a door in the shop—I had nothing to do with the duties of the post<lb/>office—in October last the prisoner was also in the employment of Mr. Dawbarne—he was in the shop—he had nothing to do with the post-office—a person of the name of Grunson attends to the post-office, he attends to the money orders—he used to attend from 10 o'clock till 6, though the money order office closed at 4—I remember Mr. Greggins coming there with a letter on the evening of 6th October—she was desirous of registering</p>

               <p>the letter, but it was too late—she came about half-past 7—5 o'clock is the latest hour at which a letter can be registered—I told her it was too late—she then gave me the letter that she had brought; it was open—she gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and I placed it inside the letter, and then sealed the letter—I called Hartley to hold the taper for me whilst I sealed it—I sealed it with wax, and put R.O. my own initials on it, with my own seal—the prisoner stood by me while I did so—when I had sealed the letter I gave it back to Mr. Greggins—I told her to put it in at the red letters; that is the district box—before she left the shop I said to her, "You see that the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note is put in safe;" her reply was, "Yes,"—after she had gone out I told the prisoner that there was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in the letter—nothing else passed then with regard to it—the collection of letters at that office would be despatched at 9 o'clock—they would be taken from there to the West Central Office—I am not in the post-office—nobody is employed there from 7 till 9, when they make up the collection—if a person were to go into the place where the partition is he could have access to the letter-box; it was unlocked—there is a window to the street from the post-office—there are shutters put up at it—we commenced putting up the shutters on that evening at about twenty minutes to 9—they are put up on the outside, and fastened in the inside—Hartley and a boy named Sewell put them up—Hartley generally fastened them inside—after that, shortly before Christmas-day, an officer, whose name I don't know, called at Mr. Dawbarne's—a conversation passed between him and me relative to a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he wished for my name—I wrote it down on a piece of paper, and also the name of J. W. Hartley, at the officer's request also—he took away the piece of paper on which those two names were written—Grunson was in the post-office at that time—the officer went there first, and Grunson sent him over to me—after the officer was gone I told the prisoner that I had written his name down on a piece of paper, and also my own—I said that the officer had come about a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note that had been passed at a public-house in Vauxhall—the officer had told me that, and I told it to the prisoner—the prisoner said he hoped it was not the note he had passed at Vauxhall—he said that I ought to have called him, and asked him to write his own name—I had not known, before this, that he had passed a note at Vauxhall—he afterwards complained to Mr. Dawbarne about my having written his name down—I think that was on the next Sunday morning after the officer had come—it was before Christmas—I have seen the note which is produced—there is a signature, "J. W. Hartley," on it, in the prisoner's writing—on 14th January Mr. Dawbarne had some conversation with me about the note—I told him that the prisoner had passed a note at Vauxhall—on Wednesday, a few days after that, the prisoner went with me and some other persons from that house to the post-office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general merchant of 3, Leadenhall-street—I had some transactions with the prisoner on, or about, 28th July—he called on me, and said that several days ago he had written to Mr. Walker, the storekeeper of the Brighton Railway Company at Brighton, offering to make up fifty tarpaulin sheets at 57<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, less 2 1/2 discount for cash one month after delivery, and that Mr. Walker answered the application, by calling and telling him to make them up, and to let him know when they were finished—he asked me to take the order off his hands and employ him to make them up at 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a sheet—I consented to do so, believing his statement to be true, and consequently I gave an order for the canvas to be sent to his shop by Messrs. Russell—I afterwards paid 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that canvas—I was from time to time to make advances to the prisoner on account—I advanced him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 13th August, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 16th September, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 24th December, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 24th October, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 5th November—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the receipts for these sums the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., closed the transaction—the payment was made to the prisoner partly by paying for six hundred weight of oil for him at 34<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per hundred weight, for the purpose of the tarpaulin that would make up the price that made 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—about 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. October the prisoner came over to the city to tell me that he had just delivered twenty-four of the sheets at New Cross station I saw him frequently after that, and afterwards received this letter from him—(<hi rend="italic">This was signed by the prisoner, and stated that Mr. Walker was very cross that the sheets had been sent in without orders, and that if he did not take them the prisoner knew where to sell them</hi>)—I saw the prisoner after that—he told me he had since seen Mr. Walker, who had consented to take forty-nine of them, and the remaining twenty-five were to be delivered at Willow-walk, which is the goods department—that was about 8th November—he said that he had sent forty-nine because the canvas was not enough for fifty—he afterwards gave me this receipt—it is in his handwriting—he also signed this other docu<lb/>ment—(<hi rend="italic">This was a document resigning all claim against the railway company, for the forty-five sheets, in favour of the prosecutor, who had paid him for the same. Signed, J. Kimber.</hi>)—I was to take this bill and receipt to the railway company and get back in exchange their cheque—up to this time I knew nothing of Mr. Walker, or the Brighton Railway Company—I sent them a duplicate of the bill before going—I made it out in the prisoner's presence, and complained to him of the railway company not having paid the first item before—he said that he did not understand it at all; that Mr. Walker had said to</p>

               <p>him it would be paid—I sent the duplicate bill with the letter to the railway Company—on 22d December I saw Mr. Walker—I afterwards heard from the Company that they had not received the forty-nine tarpaulins, but I had written them another letter before that, and the prisoner signed it—this is his signature to it—(<hi rend="italic">This was to Mr. Walker, from the witness, stating ilwt if he did not meet certain engagements on the next day, he should be served with a writ; that it was therefore imperative that the account should be paid, or else a writ would be served on the Secretary of the Company</hi>).—I went to the accountant's office at 2 o'clock, to see Mr. Walker, but could not get a cheque for my money, and in consequence of what he said I went from him to the prisoner, and after hunting about for two hours I found him in the street, and said, "I want you to come with me to see Mr. Walker, at the London-bridge station"—he said, "I will not come till to-morrow at 10 o'clock"—I said, "That will not do; Mr. Walker lives at Brighton, and is going down this evening: have you delivered all those sheets?"—he burst out crying, and told me that he had not—I said, "What have you delivered?"—he said, "Only twenty-four," the order for which was a recent date, and that if I would not prosecute him he would work it out by making them up without charge—I said, "I cannot trust goods in your hands to make up after what has happened," and asked him what he had done with the canvas—he said he had sold some of it in a manufactured state, and some in an unmanufactured state; that he had got a fair price for some of it, and the rest he parted with for a mere nothing—I said, Had you any order, as you represented to me, at the end of July?"—he said, "I had not; neither did I deliver any of the tarpaulin at the times I specified to you"—I gave him in custody a day or two afterwards—I should not have parted with my money, or allowed him to have the canvas, unless I had believed the state<lb/>ments he made—I should not have given him the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in November unless I had believed his statement, that he had manufactured and delivered twenty-four tarpaulins.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a free vintner, and keep the canteen in the Tower of London—I was in my parlour on the afternoon of 19th January, between 4 and 5 o'clock—I might have been there a few minuses before, but I know I was there at 4 o'clock precisely—Sergeants May and O'Brien, the prisoner, and myself, were then in the room, and the waiter coming in and out—just previous to 4 o'clock I ordered him to go and get himself dressed; he went and looked at his watch, and said it was 4 o'clock—I saw the watch—he then left immediately afterwards—the prisoner did not say anything to him as he left—I stopped there till 5 o'clock—two or three minutes before the prisoner went away I was called to the shop to serve some one, and whilst serving, he went away—I should say that was about half-past 4 o'clock—I saw him go out while I was sewing—I then returned to the room—no person was there then—I had only left the prisoner there when I went out to serve—the other two had gone—Sergeant May went first—he said he should not be more than twenty minutes away, and the prisoner said, "If you are only going to be away that time I shall wait, because I want to speak to you"—he did not stop till May came back; he only stopped till I was serving the customer, and while serving he went out—it is a double door, with a top and bottom half—he did not open the top door; I saw him go out under it—May had left there perhaps about ten or fifteen minutes—I did not miss the watch until the barman missed it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, of 13, Brick-lane—on Sunday night, 8th January last, about 11 o'clock, I was going down Whitechapel—I there saw a female who owed me some money—I went up to her and asked her for it—a disturbance took place, and she was very abusive, and told me she did not owe me any—a crowd collected immediately after—she approached towards me with her fist in my face—on that I pushed her away with my umbrella—then the prisoner spoke behind me and said, "This is not a night for collecting debts"—I turned round, and said, "Mind your own business"—I then turned round to the woman again, and a policeman pushed her away, and told her to go away; and the prisoner came and gave me a violent blow on the ear, and knocked my glasses and hat off—I turned round, and he was <hi rend="italic">sparring</hi> up at me again, and I cut him down with my umbrella, and he staggered rather on one side; then he came again a third time, and my umbrella was broken with the first blow; we struggled together, and three more came on me scrambling at my watch, and I said, "Keep away, I shall give him something; keep clear," not thinking for the moment that they wanted to get at my watch; I thought they were going to see fair play—he and I were struggling, aud these three men came on me—we fell down in the road, and these three men, one at my legs; the prisoner fell just at my head, and as he got up he gave me a violent kick on the left cheek-bone; it swelled up in an instant—I got up then, and looked for my hat and glasses, and said to the policeman that was there, "Have you seen my hat and glasses? you are a fine fellow to stand here and not see any thing of this sort;" he told me he did not know where they were—he stood by just at the commencement, but he was turning away this woman while these others were on to me—after that the policeman said something to me—the prisoner was then throwing off his jacket, and running like a madman behind the rest—I cannot say whether he was near enough to hear what the policeman</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186001300053"/>
               <p>said—when he got up off the road the policeman told him to go away, and then he went behind the crowd and came round another way—he came back to me; I walked away—the policeman said to me, "You had better go straight home, or you will lose your watch;" and I buttoned up my coat, and kept my hand on my watch—I was walking home contentedly, without my hat and glasses, and they followed me up directly after—when I had gone about forty yards I heard the prisoner say, "I will have the b—'s life or his watch at the b—corner," or words to that effect—when I heard those words I ran across the road to a coffee-shop that was open—before I could get there the prisoner seized me by the arm, and gave me another blow right in the face—several more came on me just at the same time—they struggled with me all the time till I got to the coffee-shop door; and three or four came out of the coffee-shop, and some of the gang got before me and made a noise, and broke some glass—three or four came out of the coffee-shop, and pushed me off the steps with their hands; and there were several on to me then; but the prisoner held me by the hair of my head, and three or four came by the side of me and got my watch—my coat was buttoned up all the time; and I had my hand on my coat all the time, but they got it by some means—I can't tell how the watch was taken; it went—it was fastened to a gold guard—I think the guard was cut—the people all dispersed after that; they ran across out of the mob—there was a mob of more than 100 persons at least; no one interfered on my behalf—the other persons ran away directly after this man let go of my hair, and he ran away after them across the road—my foreman came down then; some one had called at my house and told them that I was ill-used in Whitechapel—I was ill for some time after; I was obliged to put some one in my shop for more than a week, in consequence of the ill-treatment—I have since been attended by Mr. Ed<lb/>munds, a surgeon—my groin was injured; it was quite well before this took place.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sailor, and live in Mile-end-road—on 8th January last, about ten minutes past 11, I was walking down Whitechapel-road—I saw the prosecutor there—he was before me, I followed behind him; I dare say I was three or four yards off him—I heard him say to a woman there that she owed him a great account—she said, "No, I don't; I paid your wife before she died"—he said, "No, you didn't"—she said, "I don't owe you a b—y farthing," and with that she came and put her fist in his face—he just shoved her away with the umbrella, when the prisoner said, "This is not a night for collecting debts"—the prosecutor did nothing, but the prisoner hit him at the side of the ear, which knocked his hat and glasses off—they were immediately picked up, and ran up Queen Anne-street with—I did not see what became of the glasses—the prisoner sparred up to Mr. Dunbar, who hit him across the face with his umbrella—he was coming the third time to him again, and he and Mr. Dunbar had a wrestle, and then a mob was all round him—they both fell into the road together—the policeman came up, and the prisoner got up and kicked Mr. Dunbar in the left eye—he asked the policeman where were his hat and glasses—the policeman said, "I do not know; do you think I have got them; you had better go on, or you might lose your watch"—there was a lady and a gentleman who said it was a shame—the policeman said, "Well, you had better go on, or you might be served the same"—then Mr. Dunbar said to the policeman, "You had better take me or the prisoner into custody"—nothing else was said—Mr. Dunbar then went on—he had got two or three yards when the prisoner and two or three more came after him first, and then a lot behind them—just before they got to the end of the workhouse,</p>

I live at 17, Wood's-buildings—I remember the Sunday night when this <hi rend="italic">row</hi> took place—I was with the woman that Mr. Dunbar accosted—I was in for my supper beer at the Star and Garter, and came out with Mr. Whitehead—Mr. Dunbar met her and asked her for some of the money that was due to him—she said that she did not owe so much as he said; with that he called her a false woman, using rather abrupt language, and hitting her with his umbrella twice, and he made aim at me, and I never saw the man in my life before—he was not sober—he was really drunk, in my opinion—he was flourishing his umbrella about—he struck Mr. White-head once across her nose, and in the side of her face—a crowd did not come round while we were there; we did not see one—I went away with my beer with this woman—I did not see any one come—we went home immediately—I do not see Mr. Wills here—I did not see him here yesterday to my knowledge.</p>

I am clerk to William Bevan, solicitor, of 6, Old Jewry, city—in consequence of information I received from Brussels I went on 29th or 30th December, with Spittal the detective, to a coffee-shop, 34, Brewer-street, Golden-square—after waiting there a little while the prisoner Gilson came in—I addressed him in French, and asked him his name—he said it was Auguste Gustave Gilson—I think he said nothing else at that time—he wrote on a small piece of paper, in the coffee-house, his address, "15, Leicester-place, Leicester-square"—Spittal asked him if he knew the name of Wastone—he denied all knowledge of the name—he was then asked his occupation—he said he was acting as commissionaire for a gentleman in the City, at a shilling a day—he was then asked to point out the office of his employer, and we got into a cab for the purpose of going to 29, St. Mary-at hill, where he said his employer had an office—he said he came to that coffee-house to receive letters addressed in the name of Wastone; that he usually called for and received them there—I don't know that he named the person who he said employed him at St. Mary-at-hill—on the way there he was asked the position of the office that his employer occupied in the house, and he described it to us; the second floor room at the back—on arriving at the door, and before going in, he gave us a description of the furniture and room—he described a writing-desk and inkstand and other things—when we went in, instead of what he had described, we found a tailor's goose and board, one or two pieces of cloth, and a lamp—we could find no indication whatever of a person named Wastone—when he was first accosted by us he denied all knowledge of the name of Wastone: when he said he called for letters he then admitted that he went by the name of Wastone—I saw Spittal take a letter and envelope from his pocket at the station-house addressed to the secretary of the General Post-office—it is merely to inform the secretary that he has changed his address to 11, Meard's-court, Soho—I received these four letters, (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) signed Wastone, from the vice-consul at Brussels—I also received two letters, dated 21st and 28th December, signed De Hatford—they were also sent by the vice-consul of Brussels—I have translated these letters, and have copies with me (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

Van Schendel—I believe it is called, "A Visit to the Infant Jesus"—Monsieur Van Schendel's name is on it—I found it in the cupboard in the bottom part of a washhand-stand—in a drawer of the washhand-stand I found this draft of a letter, or letters in pencil, marked G (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it has been translated, I believe—I believe there are two drafts of letters, but as I do not understand French I do not know—it is all on one paper—I found several papers, letters, addressed to the prisoner in the name of Auguste Gustave Gilson—on 3d January, the Tuesday following, I went to 20, Bouverie-street, in consequence of some information which I had received from different sources—I found there a painting such as I had had described—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a photograph of it—it is a very large picture, called "The General in Retreat"—I found it in the parlour of 20, Bouverie-street—it was'delivered up to me by the land<lb/>lady of the house—I went up to a small back bedroom on the third floor—in a portmanteau in that bedroom I found several foreign letters, and also a bill of lading and other documents that are in evidence—I found one paper marked H, two letters, each marked J, a bill of the Steam Navigation Company's charges, and release for freight, a paper marked K, two drafts of letters marked L and M respectively, and a number of letters directed to Anderson and Company (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

Here is a draft of a letter found in Gilson's room—it is in pencil and has no date—here is the translation of the letter sent to Monsieur Van Schendel, and Gilson's draft of the letter also—these are the identical notes from which the translation was made—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "To—In a little time my wife will come to join me; be good enough also to hand her the account of what I owe you. I will endeavour to send you something when I shall have a little recovered from the state of misery in which I now am; I am hoping to get a berth in a business house as correspondent, with a salary of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum. Ah, since I have been here, I have learnt which way the wind blows; the good and the bad quarters; companies of all sorts; the very freebooters of commerce. There are even houses of business here, who, for a commission of 5 per cent, accept bills for tottering houses, which on their bankruptcy then show an apparent <hi rend="italic">bond fide loss.</hi> This fact may serve your purpose for good or for evil in your profession to save the interests of your clients. If at any time you desire to make any inquiries here, pray command me. I shall always hold myself at your disposition to communicate them. A day will arrive when I shall be able to give you the key to this history in its full detail, for I very much regret what I have done, as they have not kept their word as they promised, but, on the contrary, have not only caused me suffering but also my wife and children, who have not dared to complain to othera than my<lb/>self. Never mind, what I did was for the future good of my children; do not speak of this to my wife when she comes to see you")—I saw Gilson write his address at the coffee-house—to the best of my belief, this letter addressed to M.

Monsieur Van Schendel—I am in possession of your favours of the 4th and 8th instant, and am charmed with the honour you do me in consenting to honour me with your confidence; believe also, Sir, that I will endeavour unceasingly to deserve your esteem. We have seen this work at the Crystal Palace, but we had some days previously purchased a picture representing a brigade taken in ambush, which is almost the same design, and it is from that that we obtained your address, and which caused us to estimate your talent. As soon then as I received your photographs, I hastened to place them in the hands of the gentleman in question, who is Monsieur de Hatford, younger son of Lord Hatford, who has communicated them to several connoisseurs of his acquaintance, and has made choice of <hi rend="italic">" Le General en Retraite et ses enfants;"</hi> of the size of 3ft. 3in., by 2ft. 5 1/2 in.; and of "The Market Piece" of which you make mention, 65 by 51 centimetres; as well as the sketch of "The Visit to the Infant Saviour." He offers you for these three pictures the sum of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 10,000 francs, payable at two days sight, or by a cheque which he will remit you on the bank, the Western Branch of this town, after advice received of the pictures having been sent off. The price which he offers you is not exactly that which you ask, but as the difference is but trifling and the sum in round figures, I believe you will accept. If your picture "The Visit to the Infant Saviour" is not entirely finished, you can send me the others, disposing of 2,500 francs, and engaging to furnish the other picture. As to my commission, be good enough to tell me in what way I am to be paid, for I should not like this gentleman to know that I am in communication with you. We can probably do busiuess as to the 9,000 franc picture; we must go one of these days to Liverpool, where we shall see of report of the inquiry respecting it; should that prove favourable I think he will like to have it. I beg you to hasten as much as possible the sending off of the pic<lb/>tures as soon as may be after the choice is confirmed, for he desires to possess them for Christmas time, the 25th instant, a day on which all families here meet. I also think this might prove advantageous to you; I await then your reply by return of post, and hope to do more business with you, Remaining &amp;c. Wastone.")—The commencement of that letter is in the draft, and is pretty nearly the same—(<hi rend="italic">Another letter read</hi>: "London, December 20th, 1859. Monsieur Van Schendel,—Having received your esteemed favour yesterday I hastened to the gentleman, whom I was able to see this morning only; I read to him such portions of your letter as concerned him, when he said it was all right, and he was going to write to you on the subject by his secretary; that he kept to his determination respecting the two days' sight, lest the pictures should have been in any way injured by scratches, &amp;c.; that he would not be at this risk himself, and that conseqnently these two days were indis<lb/>pensable as, in fact, I mentioned to you in my last letter of the 15th; as to</p>

               <p>the rest he agrees, but you must draw at two days' sight through Mr. Pid<lb/>dington. If you could send him these pictures by Christmas, it would be so much the better for you. I would counsel you, Sir, to accept these terms, for you know that these gentlemen are tenacious of their word and dis<lb/>trustful, more especially when they have travelled on the Continent; and I should say that the affair, if delayed, will come to nothing. As to the historical painting, he is waiting to see one of his Liverpool friends; I have every hope of success. With respect to my commission, I think, Sir, that as I have no banker, the most easy way would be for you to obtain a letter of credit from your banker, Monsieur De Parre, so that I can obtain the same from his London correspondent; you would do me a great kindness by sending me, as soon as possible after the shipment of the picture, say a sum of 600 francs (24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.), for here the living is very expensive, and one has frequently not too much money, especially at Christmas. In the hope then, Sir, that we shall be successful—you aiding me as well on your part, for these people are very tenacious—I have the honour to be: Wastone")—there is no draft of any part of that—(<hi rend="italic">The following letters were here read</hi>: "Mons. Van Schendel,—I yesterday received your favour of the 24th current, to which I hasten to reply. I have been to Monsieur de Hatford, but was only able to see him at midday to-day. On Saturday he received notice of the shipment oi your picture by an agent at Ostend; up to the present time, however, nothing has been received. I attribute this delay to the Christmas fetes, for no one then does any work. It is the only holiday in the year in England, and all offices are closed, as is likewise the Custom-house. As soon as Mr. de Hatford receives it, he will acknowledge the receipt of it, and there is no doubt but that it will safely arrive, and will give satisfaction, since, from what his secretary has told me, he has spoken of it to some of his friends who have seen your works at the Crystal Palace, and who have spoken highly of your talent. He is, therefore, impatiently awaiting its arrival, as also that of the two other pictures which you promised on Saturday next. I should feel much obliged to you, Sir, if in your next letter you would send me about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account, for I have already incurred some, and shall incur still further expenses in going to Liverpool with this gentleman. In the anticipation of a speedy reply, and hoping you will do me this small favour, I am, &amp;c. Wastone."—"London, 1 Dec 1859. Monsieur Schendel,—As I am doing busines here as a commission agent for the sale of pictures, I beg to ask you if you would be disposed to honour me with your confidence in finding customers for your works, having already had opportunities of appreciating them. At this very time a gentleman, who is furnishing his gallery, and who will only be satisfied with such works as are thoroughly authentic, and proved to be really the production of those whose names they may bear, has instructed me to write to many of your brother artists, in order that if we can come to terms, I may put them in communication with him. Be good enough, Sir, then, if you have any finished pictures, to let me know the price of them with frame complete, the dimensions, &amp;c: as well as a sketch of the design on paper, which you can enclose me in your letter, and the commission which you will allow me in case of effecting a sale. This gentleman is a great amateur of good pictures, and has already heard your talent spoken of. In the hope then, Sir, of a speedy reply, accept my respectful salutation,—Wastone.

I recommend you therefore to use every care in packing them, and to send off to me, as soon as you receive this letter, if not all the three pictures, at least that representing a General in Retreat. I have received the notice in the "Liverpool Journal" sent me by Mr. Wastone, and having shortly after Christmas to go and see one of my acquaintances, a great picture fancier who saw your picture at the Exhibition; I will confer with him, and let you know the result. At the same time I may observe that I find your price somewhat high, &amp;c. (Signed) De Hatford, 29, St. Mary-at-hill." "London, Dec. 28, 1859. Monsieur P. Van Schendel,—I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 22d December, as well as of the painting, the General in Retreat, which has reached me in very good condition, and with which I am much pleased. The Christmas fetes have until to-day prevented my obtaining possession of your work. I do not the less thank you for the promptitude you have used in sending it off so as to enable me to get it before Christmas. I expect every day the two other pictures, which will perhaps have been sent off by the time this reaches you. In your next please let me know what day you have drawn on me, and whether it be for the 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the first picture, or for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the price of the whole three together.

Ann Rogers said, "I have not," and used very bad language—the prisoner then called down Mary Rogers, who used very bad language, and he went up and shut his door—Mr. Rogers stood on the stair<lb/>case stamping her feet, and saying what she would do to him and his wife if they came out—when Mr. Rogers oame homo at 12 o'olock the little girl said that the prisoner had been ill-using her, but he had never touched her—he</p>

On 23d January, I was on the river in a galley at Blackwall Reach, and saw the prisoner, Spooner, in a skiff laden with old rope—I asked him where he brought the rupe from—he said, "From Victoria-dock"—I asked him what ship—he said, "The Lady Combermere"—I asked him if he had any note or receipt to show that he had brought it from that ship—he said, "Yes," and produced a receipt, signed by the captain of the Lady Combermere, for 8cwt. of old rope-there ia no complaint in reference to that, but I observed these two other coils (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the fore pait of the boat—I asked him if he had bought them also as old rope—he said, "No, a man <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> them into my boat"—I doubted it, and he said; "Yes; it was in the captain's presence"—I said, "I have a doubt, and I must certainly take the rope and you to the station, and make further inquiries"—I took the rope into my galley—he then said, "To tell you the truth, I bought it of a lighterman named Brown, for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked him where the lighterman was, or whether he knew him—he said, "Yes, he has a barge now outside the Victoria-dock entrance, and if you like I will go along with you and show you the man"—he went with me to the Victoria-dock entrance, got on to the dummy and said, "There, that is the barge he belongs to, that he came out with"—I went on board the barge and found two Custom-house officers in the cabin—it was laden with old rope from Sebastopol, and one of them was it. charge of it to see after the duty—I afterwards received information, and went with Spooner to the Bell and Anchor at Plaistow—I met Knox near Plaistow, coming out of his own door, and asked him whether he had sold, any rope to anybody that day; Spooner then was 180 yards from me—Knox said, "No, I have not"—I said, "From information and description, I have every reason to believe you have"—he said, "No, I have not, Mr. Thompson, I have sold none"—I proceeded with him to where I had left Spooner; and said, "Is this the man you bought the-rope of?"—Spooner said, "Yes"—Knox said, "Well to tell you the truth I have sold him a little bit"—I told him I should have to take him in custody for it—he said he hoped not—I asked him how he came in the possession of the rope—he said, "It was in the barge cabin, but how it came there I do not know, and I took it out and sold it to him; my two young masters, Thomas and James, threw it out of the ship's deck into the barge on Saturday last"—the 23d was Monday—I asked him the name of the vessel—he said, "John Muers,"</p>

               <p>and that she laid at the bottom of the dock—Knox worked on board one of Widow Blencoe's barges at that time, but I do not know the name of it—I can't say where the barge in question was on Saturday—the captain says this rope is worth 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I consider it is worth 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

I am barmaid at the Fox and Hounds, Sydenham—on Wednesday evening, 28th December, Moore came there between 7 and 8 o'clock with a cabman, whom he asked what he would take to drink—he said "Two pennyworth of gin," which he gave him, and said he had got his fare, and was to go—Moore then turned into the parlour, and shortly after<lb/>wards the prisoner came and went into the parlour—they came out together to the bar about 8 o'clock—they hesitated some time about what they were fco have to drink—the prisoner had previously asked me tor a pot of porter but I refused, because he wanted it on trust—he had been asking me all the week upon trust, and said he had no money—he asked Moore to lend him a shil<lb/>ling—Moore did so—the prisoner threw it down for half a pint of gin, which they all partook of—they stayed at the bar a very few minutes—Moore was a little in liquor, and I asked the prisoner to see him home, and not to make any disturbance—he said that he would—they went out together, came back again in about 5 minutes, and I scolded the prisoner for bringing Moore back—he then forced Moore into the parlour against his will—the prisoner came out not a minute afterwards leaving Moore there—he had three pennyworth of brandy, and threw down a half-crown, saying "I am not without friends"—I gave him change—he had 15 or 20 half-sovereigns—he then left the house, Moore remaining behind—Moore was a little in liquor, but I think he was sensible of what he was doing.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 15, Broad-court, Bow-street, and am a plumber—on Thursday, 8th October last, I was going along the Strand, and met the prisoner Burns—I was standing at the corner of Agar-street, looking at Punch and Judy—he came and stood alongside of me and got into conversation—he wondered how the Punch and Judy men got a living—I made a remark to him and said, "Oh, I suppose sometimes they get a good deal given them"—he then told me that he had got bis business settled in London; he had got a suit in Chancery, and he had got his other brother's share, who died in the Crimea—I had just returned from the Crimea—I left the Crimea on 23d August—he did not say exactly how long he had been in London—he said he was stopping at the Great Western Hotel, and he expected to get his business done on the Saturday following—this was on the Thursday—he said he had not been in London since the Exhibition of 1851—as soon as Punch and Judy was over he spoke to me about having a glass of ale—I told him I did not know any place about there where we could have a good glass of ale—we then went down into Hungerford-market; going along he spoke to me about an ice-house there—I said, the last time I was in Hungerford market there was something of the sort, if it was not shut up—we walked into it, looked round, and then we came out—we had nothing there—we then walked down to the bottom of the market, at the corner of the bridge, to the Dolphin; we went through the coffee-room and on to the balcony in front of the river—we had one glass of ale each, and I then went into the coffee-room to light a cigarette, and when I came back another man came, who is not in custody; he appeared something like a gamekeeper, and Burns and him commenced talking about shooting—Burns said he could put the bullet in the bull's-eye eighteen times out of twenty at a distance of forty-five yards—they tried to make several wagers about the shooting; at last they came to a conclusion to shoot for three new hats, and he induced me to be umpire—I told him I did not know of any shooting-gallery at all about there—he said he had a friend in London, it would not take long to go there, however, we would have a cab, and soon have it over—we drank up the ale, and came out—in coming along Hungerford-market Burns asked me could I give him change for a sovereign or two half-sovereigns, as he wished to tie the bet—I pulled out my purse that my money was in, and I gave him two half-sovereigns for a sovereign—there was three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, one 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and the rest in gold; making up a total of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pui'so—when I pulled out ray purse to give him the two half-sovereigns he conld see there was other money in it, because it was a kind of a pocket-book as well as a purse—there was an elastic bana on, but it got broke off—this is the purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)the half-sovereigns were in there with the notes—he then shook hands with the other man; whether ho gave him the half-sovereigns or not, I do not know, and the other man said, "I will go for a cab"—he went for a cab, aud Burns then said, "Come along, we will go and have another glass of ale while he is fetchiug the cab"—we went into another public-house there—I do not know the name of it—I pointed it out to the officer afterwards—we went in front</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186001300083"/>
               <p>of the bar, and while the ale was being drawn, I turned away to the other side of the place altogether, to light another paper, or cigarette, and when I returned the ale was drawn, and standing in front of the beer-engine on the counter—Burns was standing next to it—no one was in the public-house but us two then; the other man came running in, and said, "Come on, the cab is ready"—I drank up my ale all at once, and we all three came out together—when I came outside I began to feel myself quite stupified—I remember getting into the cab, and I became quite stupified altogether—I have drunk three glasses of ale before in the course of my life; I had only had two then—two glasses of ale never had any effect on me before—when I came, to myself I found myself in a skittle-alley, in Cross-street, Newingtou—I had my purse in my hand, and the prisoner Kinghorn was rustling me up in the corner, and took the purse out of my hand—I saw him take the contents out and hand them to another man who in not in custody—that was not the man who went for the cab; it was another one—I asked for my money, and Kinghorn put his hand over my mouth and told me to hold my noise; he called me a b—fool, and told me if I did not hold my noise I should get them all looked up—Burns then came forward and called me by my name—he had asked me my Christian name before, and I had told him—he said, "Look here, George, I have got your money,"—showing me my money in his hand—"It is all right, hold your noise; don't get us into any row"—I still kept asking for my money—Burnss said, "Throw the ball up and try and knock the skittles down"—I said, "I will have nothing to do with it; I know nothing at all about skittles; I never played a game of skittles in my life"—I then found out what company I was in, and I thought if I went to play skittles I might keep them together and get out—I went to the bottom, just got hold of the ball and threw it about half-way up the alley—Kinghorn and another man were stood sentry at the door to prevent me going out—I made one attempt and they pulled me back—the other man was quite as tail if not taller than Kinghorn—the other two, the smaller man and the other tall man, then went out, leaving Kinghorn and Burns in the ground with me—Burns wanted me to go and fetch him some brandy—I told him I would not stir till I had my money; then they both went up to the tap together—I went towards them, they seemed as if they were quarrelling the one with the other—but I did not understand their language, and I think it would puzzle anybody eke—I then went out through the front into the street to see if I could see a policeman—I had scarcely got out, looked round and could see nobody—I turned back again and found the door open that went from the back of the house to the skittle-ground—I looked through and saw Kinghorn in the act of getting over some palings at the back—I followed him, but he got into the street and I lost him—I could not see Burns—I expect they must have both got over together—the skittle alley would prevent my seeing if they both got over together—I did not find Burns when I went in—I then found an officer, went back to the public-house, and asked the landlord if he knew them—I gave a description of the men to the policeman—I next met Kinghorn about ten days or a fortnight after in the Strand—I forget the day of the month; it was on a Monday—I went up to him, he saw me and turned away—I collared him; he wanted roe to go round into King William-street with him—he called me a b—fool again, and said, "Come along round into King William-street and let us settle it," or something of that sort—the officers had just gone away, for a man had just stolen a carpet bag, so there was no officer about there—I took him up to South<lb/>ampton-street</p>

               <p>by myself before the officers came to me—I gave Kinghorn into custody then—before he said to me, "Let us settle it" I said to him, a You have got away from me once, but you will not get away this time"—I saw Burns afterwards—I met him on the Friday before Christmas day, the 22d I think it was—I had been making some inquiries about one of the notes that had been paid into the Bank—I met him in High-street, Bloomsbury, along with three other skittle sharpers; they were coming towards me—as soon as Burns saw me he ran across High-street and across Oxford-street—I ran after him and caught hold of him at the corner of Tottenham-court-road—he was very resolute and wanted to get away, but the officer was close to him, just across the street, and I called him and delivered him over to him—when we got to the police-station he wanted to persuade the inspector that I had not got the right man—the inspector said he did not think so; he thought I had got one right for he had known him a long time—while the officer was putting the handcuffs on, he said he would make me pay for it if I cost him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when I was before the Magistrate a paper was put into my hands by the attorney for the prosecution, that was on the last day; we had them there when they were committed—I had been before the Magistrate four times, and this was the last occasion—it was a paper with writing on it; it was not in my hand-writing—the last time I saw the paper, it was in the Hon. G. F. Norton's hards; that paper, whatever it was; was not in my handwriting—I do not know personally what became of it—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the document that was handed to me; it is not my writing nor did I write the signature—(<hi rend="italic">Read: "This is to certify that I have played at skittles for </hi>40<hi rend="italic">l. and lost </hi>40<hi rend="italic">l., and further I agree to play for the like sum of </hi>40<hi rend="italic">l., my opponent taking my word of honour for the like sum of </hi>40<hi rend="italic">l.

I live at 8, Denby-terrace, North Battersea, and am a collector of the lighting and sewer's rates of the parish of Battersea—I know the priwoner by sight, not as a friend, as an acquaintance—he lived near me, and I have talked to him in the garden—I have been to his house and he has been to my house—I have known him in my capacity afll collector—I have called at his house and received money for rates—I used to buy eggs from him—about Christmas time, on a Sunday of Monday, I won't be positive which, he said he had more eggs than he wanted—he did not care about hawking them about, and he would let me have an many as he had to spare at the rate of a penny apiece, if I would take all he had; and I used to give him a penny apiece for all he had to spare—I had two from him either on Christmas day or the day aftef—he said they were a Christmas box—he refused to take the money for them—I said, "No," it was a small amount certainly, and I insisted upon Joying—he refused to take it—I left the money on the wall, and said,</p>

               <p>" Give it to the child, then, if you won't take it"—he drove the child back, and said the child should not have it, and he, refused to take it, and was offended at it, and next day he said, "There is your money on the wall still, you can take it if you like; you shan't have any more eggs"—on Tuesday afternoon, 27th December, a little before three I was at home—my wife and children had gone out—I was alone in the house—the prisoner called on me—he kicked at the door to come in—he said he had first met Mr. Jones, the servant and the baby, going across the fields, and Mr. Jones had told him to call on me and have a glass of wine and make it up—I said, "Come in," and said, "Make what up? I did not know I had offended you; comein;" and then I asked him to take a seat, and said, "What will you take, port or sherry;"—he said, "Port," and I went and fetched the port down for him—we sat down and had some wine—I helped him to two glasses, and I think he helped himself to another; I had a glass of porter—after some indifferent conversation, I told him that I had a letter to write to save the afternoon post, and I asked him if he would excuse me—he was sitting smoking, as I thought—I sat down to write, and then I saw him take two or three steps past me—I thought he was going to look at something behind me till I felt a blow at the back of the neck—I was stooping—the blow will show that it could not have been given while I was upright—I grappled with him directly, and we struggled round the room—I had seen him open a knife before that to clean his pipe out—we struggled along the dresser—there was a clock at the end near the kitchen door, and he put his back against the kitchen door, to prevent me from getting out—I tore the clock weight down and struck him as hard as I could over the head and face; he has the marks I dare say—we struggled round the room, and the room has the marks of the blood all over the paper—however, I was the better man of the two—he demanded some money of me; that was after he had struck me in the neck—he did not say a word to me for about a minute or so; then the first words he said, were, "I must have money; give me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—and then he asked for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was lowering his price every time, and then after that I said, "Drop your knife," or "Let go your knife, and I will go up stairs and get the money;"—he said, "No, I will go up with you;"—then I saw it was no use, it was a struggle for life and death—I refused to do that—he said, "You had better give in, or you will soon faint from loss of blood," and then the struggle recommenced—we were struggling round all the time he was trying to stab me—I grappled him by the right hand, and he grasped my right hand, so we were both almost powerless—I had called for assistance before—I called "murder" as far as I could—after some minutes, it appeared an hour to me, it must have been two minutes after I had thrown him off, I managed to get the kitchen table between us, and then I laid, "If you don't leave the house, I will smash the window and call for assistance;" it is rather an uninhabited neighbourhood—there is a very small number of persons passing by—the parties next door had gone out, and he had seen them go out, I have no doubt—when I threatened to smash the windows and call for assistance, he closed the knife and put it in his pocket and said, "Oh, Jones, what have I done?" and then said something about hie poor wife—I forgot to state that before he asked for the money he said something about two hours, but in the excitement of the moment I could not tell what it was—I remember his saying something about giving him two hours to get away—when he closed the knife he said "Oh, Jones, what have I done? my poor wife, will you forgive me?" I said, "Go at once, or else I will smash the windows," and then he opened the kitchen door and went out—my</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had you known the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might have been twelve months; I can't say the date—I never sat down in his house in my life—he had some plants; he hag given me some; I have been to look at his, and he has been to look at mine—I don't call that visiting—I can't say how many times I have been at his house, more than once or twice, but not more than half-a-dozen times—he might have been to my house three times—I have shewn him my plants each time—he only came for that purpose—on 27th December, he said he came because he said Mr. Jones told him to come and keep me company—from the time he came into the house till the blow was struck, nothing had been said between us of an unpleasant nature—when he came in he said he was annoyed respecting the eggs, but there was not an angry word—he did not say a word about the manner in which he desired to be paid for the eggs—the did not say he wanted half a dozen kisses; not a word passed about kisses during any part of the time—he might have talked about kisses with reference to something else, but not in reference to the payment of the eggs—there was not the slightest irritation on my part towards him—he did not use an angry word at all—I was never more surprised in my life than when he stabbed me—I took up a heater and a candlestick, and struck him with both; it was the heater of an Italian iron—I took up the candlestick because I was stabbed; not in consequence of any expression of his about kissing—no such expression was used—the last words that were spoken before he struck me, were when I asked him if he would excuse me for a moment, and he said, "Certainly; I will have a smoke, have you any tobacco?" I said, "Yes," and gave him the tobacco—he filled his pipe as I thought, and then I felt the blow directly afterwards; these were the only words that passed between us—I believe he had commenced smoking, because I gave him a pipe—his pipe went out I believe—I saw him apply a light to it, but I was writing—after he had struck me he demanded money—I had not struck him when he demanded the money because I was defenceless then—I did not strike him till after he demanded the money, then I tried two or three times it might be, I can't say how many, to get my right hand disengaged—I can't tell how many times I struck him with the candlestick or heater—I struck him as often as I could—I only felt one wound in the back of my neck—he tried to strike me after I got up from my chair—I cannot tell whether he did or not, but I know I had the wounds—my hands were cut all over; you can see the wounds now; those were received after I got up from the chair—there was also one blow behind the ear—that was given either after I got up, or else as I was rising—after I got up, I grappled with the prisoner and got the knife, and got the wounds on my hands then—no one else was present—I can hardly say how soon after that it was that I saw the police—it was not many minutes; perhaps 10 minutes; it was as soon as we could fetch them—I did not see the prisoner again, till I went to the police-court, a fortnight or three weeks after, I think—I was not able to attend before—I saw him at the police-court; he ran away, and I sent a policeman after him—previous</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of 22, King's-road, Chelsea—on 27th December, I was called upon to see the prosecutor—I went to his house—I found that he had received two wounds, one on the scalp about two and a helf inches behind the the left ear; it was an incised wound through the salp—it had bled very profusely—there was another incised wound half-an<lb/>inch long, on the nape of the neck, and five or six small incised cuts on the hand—they were such wounds as might have been caused by a knife—he had lost a very great deal of blood; the bandages about his neck were quite soaked in blood—he was under my care nearly three weeks, up to 14th January, but he was not confined to his house during that period—on 14th 'January he was at my house—I considered the wounds dangerous at first, not in consequence of their actual nature, but form the probability of inflammation supervening on the wound of the scalp, which we always</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186001300092"/>
               <p>consider dangerous—it was three-quarters of an inch long, and deep—it might have brought on erysipelas—he is now, in my judgment, quite weel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did he appear before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't remember the day—it would be about the 4th—erysipelas might supervene from a very small wound—it depends very much upon the constitution of the person who receives the wound—a small wound may kill a man, a wound with a knitting needle—a slight wouud sometimes produces an immense flow of blood—the flow of blood alone, is not altogether a test of the character of the wound—I had never seen the prisoner before—I only saw him before the Magistrate, as I see him now.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you consider these slight wounds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—the scalp is more vascular than the other part of the skin—the wound behind the ear I considered the worst; that in the scalp—it would depend upon the depth of the wounds, and their position, whether they might have been fatal; one, being situated two and a-half inches behind the ear, if it had been struck with a powerful weapon, might have penetrated the skull, and the same with the one at the back of the neck; it was not near an artery—I considered it in a very dangerous place, decidedly.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, B</hi> 163). On Friday, December 30th, about a quarter past 2, I saw Maybank drawing a truck in King-street, Westminster, about twenty yards I should think, from Fludyer-street—Fludyer-street and King-street join together—I saw Fish on the pavement in Great George-street—I followed them through Birdcage-walk till they came to Arabella-row, Pimlico—I then asked Fish what he had got; he said he had got old lead in the truck—I asked him where he brought it from; he said, "I have brought it from 12, Fludyer-street, and I am going to take it to Mr. Nicholls, in the King's-road, Chelsea, to exchange it for some new"—I should think Maybank heard this; Fish was on the pavement, and Maybank was with the truck—I asked Fish under whose direction he was going to take the lead; he said, "Under Mr. Goldsmith's, the foreman"—he said that he was to take the new lead back to Fludyer-street to repair a leakage in the gutter on a roof—before I began to follow them I had seen Inspector Butt, and received instructions from him—I followed them on to Nicholls's, at King's-road, Chelsea—they knew that I did so—when they got there Maybank drew the truck into the large gates, and Fish went into the front entrance to the shop—I did not go in with either of them—after, a time Maybank came out with the truck—the new lead was in it then, I believe, under the board with which the old lead had been covered—I saw it when it was taken out—Fish came out soon after—he had a bill or invoijce of the lead in his hand—he came to where Maybank was sitting on the truck, waiting for him to come out—they went up to the corner of a street,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186001300097"/>
               <p>and said something which I could not hear; and they went from there to the Lord Nelson public-house, where Fish gave Maybank a half-crown for the hire of the truck—he said to me, "Will you have some porter?"—I ac<lb/>cepted the offer—I had a pint, and Fish and Maybank had a pint each; it was served in pint glasses—Fish then said that he was going to 12, Fludyer-street with the new lead, and that he would accompany me there, and would call at the station and speak with Mr. Butt, as he knew him from having seen him at the house in Fludyer-street—he then took up a piece of new lead, and put it on his shoulder—he went with me about a mile towards Westminster, to a place called Tyler's—he there said he wanted to ease him<lb/>self—he went into the public-house, and called for a pint of porter—he handed it to me, and I put it on the seat just where he had put the lead; and I sat down beside where he had placed the lead—he was gone out to the back yard about five or six minutes—I said something to the pot-boy, and went out to the back yard to see where he was—when I got there I could not find him—a person could have got away that way—I next saw him on the morning of Sunday, 1st January, at King-street police-station—I after<lb/>wards took him from there to Kennington-lane—as I was taking him to Kennington-lane he gave me the description of Goldsmith as the person who hired him—he said, "Goldsmith hired me to get a truck to remove this lead to Mr. Nicholls's, and said that he would pay me liberally for my trouble in taking it"—that in all I recollect.</p>

               <p>asked you in Arabella-row who sent you with the lead—I asked you what the person's name was, and you told me that it was Goldsmith—when I asked you what you had in the truck, you said "Old lead," and told me where you were going to take it, and for what purpose, and the price of old lead, and what they allowed in exchange—I asked you where Goldsmith lived, and you said, "Toronto-road, Avenue-villas, Camden-road-villas"—I saw a piece of paper in your hand—you told the Magistrate that it must have been lost either by you, or else in Mr. Nicholls's shop—it contained the dimensions of the old lead and of the new; the size that was required—you told me that you were going to take it to No. 12, Fludyer-street—I believed what you said—I did not think you were wrong until you escaped from the public-house, and left me with the new lead.</p>

               <p>to Mr. Nicholls—I met Maybank, and asked him if he wanted a job—the person that employed me gave me a piece of paper, on which was written "One piece of 51b. lead, 7 feet 9 inches long, 16 inches wide"—he told me to bring the new lead where I took the old lead from—Maybank and I went to the house and took the lead; the policeman followed us; there was an old board on the top of it—I sold the lead to Mr. Nicholls, and he gave me the money—we went into the public-house, and I gave Maybank 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for drawing the load, and for the hire of the truck; he said 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. would satisfy him. I took the new lead and brought it some distance, and then began to think I was made a dupe of, and went into a public-house, and asked to go to the closet, and went into the back yard, and got over, and got away. I heard of Maybank being taken, and I went with the intention of giving myself up. To the best of my belief, Goldsmith is the man. It was about twenty minutes past I when he spoke to me—Goldsmith says, "It is not true what Fish has said: I was put at Wapping at the time he speaks of."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Fish's Defence.</hi> On Friday, 30th December, I was standing in Parliament-street to see Mr. Trollope's foreman; Goldsmith came and asked me whether I was out on the strike; I said I had been out of work seven or eight weeks; he said he would give me a job of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I said I should be obliged; he asked me if I knew Fludyer-street; I said no, but that I could soon find it; he asked me to go to No. 12, to take some old lead away; before taking it I was to go to Mr. Nicholls, the lead merchant, and ascertain the price of old lead and what was given in exchange for it; he took out a piece of paper and wrote, "One piece of lead 7ft. 9in. long, and 1ft. 4in. wide;" he told me to bring it to No. 12; he said, "You will find an old board there which you can put on the top of it;" he told me to pay for the hire of it; he said he had just come from Wapping; I gave the paper to Mr. Nicholls, and left it there with the dimensions which Goldsmith put on it. In Arabella-row the policeman asked me what I had got; I told him, and that I was going to bring some new lead, and gave him the description of the man that sent me. I paid Maybank 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for his hire. I then put the new lead on my shoulder; the policeman said we had better get on a <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> as he should have to take me to the station-house; this was the first time that I thought I was in custody; he said, "If you had gone over the bridge to the Board of Works, my Inspector told me not to interfere with you." I then began to think that I had been made a dupe of; and effected my escape by going to the back door of the public-house. I came down when I found Maybank was apprehended, with the intention of giving myself up; the policeman came to me and told me that I was wanted; I told him that I understood it. I went with him to the station-house; the case was remanded for six days, as Goldsmith stated that he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186001300100"/>
               <p>could prove where he was at 1 o'clock, by his bricklayer and labourer that were at work at Wapping; but the bricklayer said that when Goldsmith left Wapping it was between 11 and 12 o'clock, leaving plenty of time for him to be at Parliament-street at 1 o'clock. Is it consistent with guilt that I should go to Mr. Nicholls to ascertain the price of old lead when I could have gone to another lead merchant not one fifth of the distance, and sold it at the same price? The inspector states in his evidence before the Magistrate that when Goldsmith came back to the works at the bridge, it was a little after 3 o'clock, in a very excited state, as he well might be, when he saw the policeman following the truck I was with, knowing himself to be guilty. This is the first time I was ever arraigned at a bar of justice, and I most solemnly declare I am innocent of this.</p>

On 26th December, I left my house, having locked it up—I returned home at about half-past 11 o'clock—when I came back the street door was a jar—I went to put the key in and found the door was open—I went in the house, got a light, looked round, and found the bed furniture folded up on the bed; and the white counterpane was removed from there—I turned myself and opened the top of my box—I found the box had been broken open and several articles were missing—they were all in the house when I left at 10 o'clock—I went to the police-station to give information and I saw the articles there—before I went out I had seen the prisoner about a yard from my door—that was about half an hour before I went out—this is one of my dresses, it was safe in the box locked up when I went out—this shawl is mine; it was there also.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant M</hi> 4). I was on duty in Suffolk-street, Southwark, on 26th December, between 11 and 12 o'clock; that is close to Revell-row—I was walking with Gibby—I saw the prisoner come through a court with a large bag on his back—I said to Gibby "What has he got in that bag, go and see,"—the prisoner saw him, and he dropped the bag and ran away—Gibby went down John-street, and I went down William-street, but the prisoner made his escape—I took the bag to the station, and it con<lb/>tained 3 dresses, 7 shirts, 1 set of bed-furniture, 1 counterpane, and other things—this property (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was in the bag—some of the articles have been returned to the prosecutrix; she identified them all—I have known the prisoner the last 4 or 5 years.</p>
