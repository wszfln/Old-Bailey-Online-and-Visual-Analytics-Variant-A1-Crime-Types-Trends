             and her daughter - A. Yes; and the next day, about twelve o'clock, she looked at Covington's door. She said, he was robbed as well as she, and that his property was at Wayman's, in the City-road. She said, she knew where there were a good deal of property, shirts and linen, and if I could spare six or seven pounds, I might buy a bargain, if I could keep a secret, and not tell Mr. Covington; that nothing could hurt her. I said, I had no money to spare. After that time there was no peace in the house. She was always scolding me, as she knew I knew all.</p>
               <p>Q. When Covington came to town did you tell him all you knew respecting it - A. I gave him the information I have given you. About a week after he took me up.</p>

I went out for tobacco, and eggs for my wife; when I saw these people at the corner of the court I went out for the air. I told Mrs. Phipps I was ill when she called me.</p>
               <p>Q.You were a witness here last sessions, were not you - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you never tried here - A. No.</p>

            . I live in my mother's house at Isleworth. On the 25th of July I returned home. It had gone twelve. I saw the prisoner near Brentford bridge, as I was coming over the bridge. He was coming as if from my mother's house. The bridge is about an hundred yards from my mother's house. He asked me which was the nearest way to Acton. I told him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before - A. No. I proceeded home. I found the door open. I went to my wife She said, she heard somebody in the house. She asked, if it was me. I searched the house, and missed the things from behind the door, two pelisses, a black gown, and a cloak. I pursued after the man. I overtook him about three quarters of a mile from the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the prisoner about an hundred yards from the house, did you see whether he had a bundle or not - A. Yes. I overtook him in Brentford. I asked him, if he would let me look in the bundle. I told him, I thought it was some property belonging to me, or my friends. He made no answer, but knocked me down. I got up, and followed him. He knocked me down five or six times, and kicked me when I was down. A man of the name of Smith came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Q.Before Smith came up, did he say any thing to you - A. He said, he would murder me if I did not loose him. I hung to him. I had hold of him each time he knocked me down. He extricated himself each time from me. Then I got up and pursued him again, and upon Smith coming up he was taken in custody. Smith examined the bundle he had. It contained two pelisses, a black gown and a red cloak. There was a basket and two pair of stockings thrown over the bridge. The watchman found them. These things were given to Addely, the constable, the same night.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the same man that you afterwards stopped, was the same man you spoke to when you were going home to your mother's house - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for to Mrs. Gladwin's house, at Hanwell Heath, in consequence of the robbery. From the circumstances I heard there I took the prisoner into custody. She acknowledged that she pledged the spoons at Mr. Nichols's, a pawnbroker, at Old Brentford.</p>

               <p>Q. What time in the day had you seen it - A. I saw the silver in the bag ten minutes before the prisoner went out of my house. It was in a small chest of drawers, in the bar. The drawer was not locked. The prisoner had been sitting in the bar. He came to ask me how I did. I knew him four or five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you left the prisoner alone while the prisoner was sitting in the bar - A. Yes, I went over the way once.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after the prisoner was gone was it that you missed it - A. I missed it before he went out of the house. He got up, and said, he had got three friends that had gone round to see the Tower; he would go and see the Tower with them, and he would return with them in a few minutes. As he stepped from the bar I perceived that his pocket hanged heavy I saw a glimpse of the bag in his pocket. I turned round and looked in the drawer, and the bag of silver was gone. I ran out of the house after him, to see if I could see him. I could not find him. I did not see him until the officer brought him, about seven days after I lost the silver. The bag was brought to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how much money was in the bag - A. There were seven pounds in the bag, eight dollars, about five three-shilling pieces, about six eighteen penny pieces, and six shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time when you saw him come in until the time you saw him go out, had there been any person in the bar that could have got to that drawer - A. Nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said, the prisoner said he would come back again - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever come back - A. No. The prisoner had two glasses of gin and water, and as he went out he threw down a shilling. I said no, Charles, I shall not take any thing. He was then stepping out of the bar. I saw his right hand coat pocket hang heavy. After he went out of the house I pursued him directly to a corner house; where there were several ways. I could not see him, nor which way he took. That is all I know.</p>

            . I am a storehouse-man belonging to the Tower. On Monday the 13th of July, I had been into the stone kitchen to drink a pint of porter, and between three and four o'clock, on my going out, I saw this man go behind a centry-box; he stooped down and dropped this bag. The centry-box was close by the Spur gate.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the Spur gate from the public-house that Mr. Bailey keeps - A. Not many yards. I do not know the length.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it in sight of Mr. Bailey's house, or not - No, it is not He stooped behind the centry-box, and put something down. He went out of the Spur gate, and went over the hill.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you know what it was that he put down there - A. I went immediately and picked up this bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before - A. I had seen him some years ago, when he lived at the Cross Keys, Gracechurch-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sufficient knowledge of the prisoner's person, so as to be sure it was the prisoner that put that thing behind the centry-box - A. Yes. I took the bag home to my lodging that same afternoon, and left it at home that night. The next morning I was informed that Mr. Bailey had been robbed. On Wednesday morning I carried it to Mr. Bailey, and shewed it him. He took it in his hand, and returned it to me again, and I have kept it in my possession until this present time. This is the bag; there was no money in it when I found it; it was just as it is now.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know the bag to be mine; there is a small hole at the bottom; and I know it by that opening, just as if it was a double bag.</p>

             - A. Yes. On Monday, the 17th of July, she came to our shop, she had strawberries to sell. She purchased two yards of ribbon, and at the time she was in the shop there came in a man. He bought about a yard and a half of galloon, and while we were serving it I saw her take her hands from the drawer, and put them under her coat, but there being no one but me and my sister in the shop, we suffered her to go from the door, and on looking over the drawer we found that she had taken two pieces. We sent my little boy after her to the end of the street, and the same man that was in our shop was talking to her. She had not seen the little boy before. She came back with him, and when we taxed her with it she said, she had not got it. We sent for a constable. She said, that if we would suffer her to go she would send the ribbon back; instead of which she brought some money, which we did not chuse to take. She said, the ribbon she could not get, but if we would excuse her, if it was six pounds she would pay.</p>
               <p>Q. How much ribbon was taken - A. In one piece about eighteen yards, in the other upwards of twenty. One piece was worth about fifteen shillings, and the other about twenty.</p>

After he passed me going out of the place he was detected with the watch in his hand.</p>

            . I am a fireman, of the Sun-fire office. I was in Bagnigge Wells on this Sunday evening. I was going in a small place to make water, and as I was going in I saw Cheeseman with a watch in his hand, with a red ribbon to it: he was holden it up, as if to shew Jefferies. He said it is all right; and held it towards Jefferies. He was in company with Jefferies. On my seeing a watch in his hand, and a watch in his pocket, I had suspicion. I went into this place. I saw Martin. I said to him, have you lost a watch with a red ribbon to it; if he had, I should know the people if he would come with me. I immediately ran out of Bagnigge Wells. I turned towards Gray's Inn Lane. I overtook the prisoner. I took hold of Cheeseman's coller. I said, where is the watch. He said, what watch. I took the watch out of his hand, and gave it to the constable. When we came to the watchhouse, Jefferies said, that Cheeseman came honestly by the watch, and he could prove it. Martin after that said, I will prove the contrary, here is my name at the back of the watch. He turned the watch up, there was E. M. for

             was not suspected until he was seen following me to the watchhouse. He was not charged, nor even accused. And I call God to witness, I picked the watch off the ground and went through the gardens with the watch in my hand, to see if any body would own it. If not, I intended by the advice of Jefferies to advertize it. Jefferies would not have been taken in custody had not he stood up and said I was an honest man. I firmly hope for your acquittal that I may return to honest industry.</p>
               <p>Jefferie's Defence. I became acquainted with William Cheeseman at Hull in Yorkshire, at which place<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160009"/> his character stood honourable for honesty and industry. On this Sunday he called upon me at my lodgings, and having heard of Bagnigge Wells, we took a walk there; and after walking two or three times round the garden we agreed to return home. We went to the place called the water-closet. Cheeseman stooped down and observed to me, that he was very fortunate, he had found a watch. We agreed to advertize. We walked through the gardens. Cheeseman held the watch up in his left hand. On our return out the prosecutor and witness both collared Cheese-man. When Pile took the watch out of his hand, and having maltreated him, I told them they were mistaken as to his being a thief, he had found it in the gardens. When they took him to the watch-house, Cheeseman desired me to come into the watchhouse, from a conviction of his innocence. I consented; they never accused me of being concerned with him.</p>
               <p>Cheeseman called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Jefferies called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I immediately looked round, and saw the prisoner turn down stairs with his hand in his coat. I accused him with having taken my pocket-book. He made no reply, but made all the haste he could down stairs, and ran across Mark-lane, up a gateway, nearly opposite. I cried, stop thief, and as he was returning back, down the same gateway, I met him, and took him by the collar. The pocket-book was handed to me immediately by Mr. Redman. I took the prisoner into the coffee-room, and delivered him into the custody of the officer.</p>

The warehouse is a part of the dwelling-house. On, the night of the 4th of August I was alarmed by Pearce. There is a communication from the dwelling-house to the warehouse. It is under the same roof. I was alarmed by Pearce between three and four o'clock.

I missed two girandole glass candlesticks, one earthen-ware candlestick with a gold edge. There were also two glass shades of a girandole candlestick taken out of the warehouse. They were outside. There were two glass trifle-dishes removed from a table, to a table close by the window. I did not miss any thing besides that. The next morning I went to my neighbour, Mr. Deputy King, and I ordered Hawkins to seek out the parties. I had strong reason to suspect

Howell lived in Stonecutter-street: he keeps a kind of a rag and glass-shop. Deputy King and Hawkins accompanied me. We told Howell our business. Howell said, I might look round I looked round the shop; I saw wine glasses about the shop, like mine. I saw nothing there respecting of this charge. I went up stairs. I discovered the stand of one of the girandoles that was on the mantle-piece when I found it. This is a nassal to a girandole. This wire-work, that the drops are suspended to, there were two drops with it; and this candlestick, an earthenware candlestick. They are all mine. I know they are mine by corresponding with the other pieces. I have not the least doubt whatever. These glass shades I marked them as soon as I found them. I told Howell they were mine; he said, they might, he did not know how he came by them: he afterwards varied the story, and said, if they were mine Lewis had given them to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say when he had them of Lewis - A. He said, he did not know: his daughter might buy them, perhaps; he could not tell.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. to prosecutor. I understand, what you found at Howell's were parts of a broken girandole. Did not he say, that they were given to him by Lewis; that they were found in the street - A. I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. To be kept till he called for them. I take it for granted, that the candlestick, if it was whole, it is worth something; but, in the state it is now, it is worth nothing - A. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. And the other pieces of a girandole are not worth twelve pence - A. No, not now.</p>

            . I am a watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you on duty on the night of the 4th of August - A. I was near Mr. Holwell's premises. I was going my round, calling the hour of three o'clock, there I discovered the top of the lamp off, which made me think there was something done that was not right. I looked round, and could not see any body. I picked up the top of the lamp, and carried it to my stand: not being satisfied, I returned to the spot, where I discovered two men standing under the premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who either of these two men were, or both of them - A. One of them was Lewis, the little man. I asked him the reason, why he was there at that time in the morning. I told them, they must go to the watchhouse and give an account of themselves. They condescended to go. In going along I discovered the back part of Lewis's coat, or jacket, that he had had a fall; his coat was dirty, and likewise his pantaloons, which gave me suspicion. I called to my brother watchman, Clark; at the instant<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160011"/> I called, Lewis ran towards St. Martin-le-grand, and Young ran the other way, Aldersgate-street way</p>
               <p>Q. Was a man of the name of Fowler with you - A. No, not at that time; he was afterwards. I pursued Lewis, and lost him, and returned back again; then I met the patrol, Fowler; Fowler asked me what was the matter. I told him, and the description of the men; that they had got out of my hands. We then went to Mr. Holwell's, and told Mr. Holwell what I saw, and the description of the party that I saw. I saw Lewis, the next morning, at Mr. Holwell's house. Lewis denied being in Mr. Holwell's house; but, afterwards, in the presence of Mr. King, he confessed, and said, he got in at the window after he threw the sash up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at any time, hear Young say any thing - A. He made several excuses to Mr. King. First, he said, that Lewis gave him the handkerchief, with some glasses, in order for him to keep till the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. I am asking you now, whether Young said any thing; not Howell - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you hear Howell say - A. I heard Howell say, that Lewis gave him the glasses, tied up in a handkerchief, to keep for him until the next day.</p>
               <p>="Another time he said, he or his daughter had bought them. He did not know how he came by them.</p>

             I came down Aldersgate-street, I saw two lanthorns running, and just as I came along he called out, Bill! I turned round, to look at him, to see who he was; and when I came up to Pearce, he told me he thought there was something the matter in Falcon-street. Young is the man I saw; he had an umbrella in his hand, holding over his head. I am sure he is the man. I could pretty well swear he is the man. He was a tall thin man, pitted with the small-pox; it was about a quarter or twenty minutes past three when I saw him.</p>

            . Q. You are one of the marshalmen - A. Yes; Mr. King gave me the first information. From there I went to the prosecutor, and from there I went to King-street, in the Borough, to Lewis's apartment. The first day I went, I could not find him. A little before six I took him out of bed from his wife. I told him I wanted him. I asked him where he had been after he had been at his club-house last night. I asked him, if he could tell where he was from two till four: he said, I was at home. The landlord of the house where he lodged came and asked what was the matter. I said, I am come to take this man up for robbing his master's house. The landlord said, he was not at home until four o'clock in the morning. I asked him if he could shew me what coats he had on his back. He shewed me one; I found this coat wet and dirty. His pantaloons were a little dirty. I took Lewis in custody, and took him to Mr. Holwell's house. He denied every thing. After I had heard there were two in company, the prisoner told me his club-house was the Rose and Crown, in Monkwell-street. I went there to find the other young man's name. I could not find his name for a long while. We were recommended to the prisoner, Howell, respecting of Lewis, by another person. I began to think it was very strange that he knew both the prisoners, he keeping a glass shop. I told Howell that Mr. Holwell's house had been broken open, and I understood he had bought the property. He said, No. I asked him if he knew a man of the name of Lewis, and a man of the name of Young. He said he knew them. I asked him if he could tell me where Young lived. He said, No. I told

             I had come to search the place. I pulled out my staff; he said he had no objection, I might search any where. I searched, found nothing; particularly, after we had done searching below, I thought I might as well search up stairs. His wife made a little objection. I went up stairs with Mr. Holwell; and the moment I went up stairs Mr. Holwell found them things. I asked Howell, what he could say now; he was in a pretty mess. He said, he did not know how they came there. I said, you must have bought them. He said, No. At Guildhall, he said, Lewis gave them to him at a house in Red-cross-street; he gave them to him to carry home. While I was leaving Howell's house, that instant I heard where I could find Young, if I would go to the Bun-house, in the City-road, I should find him making of buns. In Mr. King's accompting-house, I heard Young tell Mr. King, that it was Lewis got up. He said, we were all drunk; it was done in a lark; Lewis got up and handed down the things. Young pointed out one that he had not received; the other things he said he had received. After we went in the coach, Lewis said, they will hang us for this. Young shook his head, and said to Lewis, I will take care how I go out a larking with you again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Nothing was found upon the man they charge to be the receiver - A. Nothing; but these things were found at Howell's house. In the prosecutor's house some things were only moved, and some were found on the leads.</p>

            . Q. Where did you first take the transaction up - A. On Wednesday, the 5th of August, in the morning, being informed that my neighbour Holwell had been robbed, as deputy of the ward, I sent for the watchman: and when he informed me the nature of the robbery, and the description of the parties, I had no hesitation of the criminality of the prisoner Lewis. I knew him for two years. He had committed a theft on my premises. I recommended that Mr. Holwell should take steps to apprehend Lewis. He was apprehended on the Thursday morning. On the Thursday morning I saw Lewis at Mr. Holwell's.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you and Lewis - A. I interrogated him very closely on the subject, on the company that he was in at that time in the morning. He denied any knowledge of the man, except having seen him twice before.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the man you mentioned - A. The man that appears to be the other prisoner. He said, that he had only seen him twice before. I requested that he would take his shoe off his foot, and deliver it to me. He did so. I then went up stairs to Mr. Holwell's warehouse, and measured<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160012"/> the print of the foot on the counter. It exactly corresponded with the size of the shoe. I made my observations of the marks of fingers, very small, on the window. Afterwards I returned to Lewis, and requested that he would go with me into my accompting house. I pressed him, on all sides, in vain, to confess. I was led to ask him, how he became acquainted with whom he was seen. He told me that he had first seen him playing at a game of skittles. I asked him, where his recollection did not serve him. I asked him, if it was not at Plowman's, in Redcross-square. He answered in the affirmative. Mr. Plowman came, in consequence of my request, to my accompting-house. I asked him, if he knew a man of the name of Young. He said, no, he knew no man, a baker, but a man of the name of Harvey, who had lived in Redcross-street. I then sent for Lewis. Plowman said, that was one in company. I further pressed, in Lewis's presence, who the others were. He said, one was a stranger to him, but the other was a man that bought glass, meaning Howell. Howell was with Lewis on the Wednesday evening, the night after the robbery. Plowman could not recollect Howell's name. He said, he lived some where in Fleet-market. I requested that he would accompany me and the officer in the search of this man's premises, and, after some difficulty, Howell's house was found, in Stonecutter-street. I went into the house, and asked Howell, if his name was Howell, and if he was the master of the house. He answered in the affirmative. He was then told by the officer that a robbery had been committed, and that these parties were suspected. I then asked Howell if he he had seen Lewis lately. He answered, no, not for some time. Have you bought any thing of him lately? No, not for some time. Have you received any thing of him of any description? No, not for some time. Hawkins then said, you have no objection to our searching your premises? No, I have no objection, search where you like. Finding nothing that the prosecutor could identify, we proposed going up stairs. We were in the lower shop. An objection was made to our going up, as the room was in a disordered state. I do not not know by whom, whether it was the wife or Howell. I said, that we were married man, we had no idle curiosity to satisfy. We then entered the room, and found the things. Mr. Holwell challenged the nassal of the candlestick and stand, and the wire work of the girandole. I then said, Howell, what have you to say now? I know nothing about them. I will state to your lordship, that previous to my first interrogation I told Howell that it was necessary for him to be explicit that he might be upon his guard. At one time he said, he supposed his wife might have received them with broken glass. He first denied them. The wife denied, in Howell's presence, and said, the transaction was with himself. He afterwards stated, that Lewis brought them there, throwed them down, and said, take care of them for me. I left him in the custody of the officer, and returned to the accompting-house, and sent for Lewis. I told Lewis, that it required now that he should be very cautious and tell the truth. I asked him, how he came in possession of the things that were found at Howell's, namely the girandoles and the brass-work. He said, that he climbed up the water spout, and entered the window; that the fastening was not turned; that he pushed up the window, and got easy entrance. The first thing that he removed was the girandole; that he handed them off the leads, and gave them to Young. Young was not present; he was in custody then. He said, that on the Wednesday evening he had been at Plowman's with Young and with Howell; that Young returned to him part of the glass and brass-work which, with what he had in his own possession, he delivered to Howell as they came out of Plowman's house. I then had Young brought into the accompting-house. Young confessed that Lewis entered the window and handed down the things to him. He acknowledged that it was done in a bit of a lark, he being in liquor. I then had Howell in, who denied how they came in, in strong and positive terms. He said, when he arose in the morning he found them there, tied in an handkerchief, but by what means they came there, he knew not. I then put the question to him. In Lewis's presence, who had charged him with receiving them coming out of Plowman's house; to which he said, if I did I was drunk. We then proceeded to the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. It turns out that this man received these things of Lewis, but he gave nothing for them.</p>

            . Q. Does a brother of yours keep the Rose and Crown, in Markwell-street - A. He keeps the Rose.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Lewis and Young at your house on the 4th of August - A. They were. They came about half past ten, and staid till two. I knew Lewis. I never saw Young before that night. They both went out together. I never saw Howell with them.</p>
               <p>Young's Defence. I was along with Lewis so late as two o'clock. I was going home. Lewis said, stop. When I came to Mr. Howell's window, he said, he should not be a minute. He got up to the window. I did not know for what purpose. He threw these pieces of glass out. I picked it up. On the ensuing evening I gave it to him. I did not know what do with it, nor do I know what he did with it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Lewis's Defence. I cannot deny what he says. I delivered them to Howell.</p>

I saw Isaacs under the dray; he went from the dray and looked down James Street; he came back to the dray again under the box, and took five papers of halfpence, and on his running into Theobald's Road, he let one of the papers of halfpence fall, he took it up, and put it into his hat; I pursued and took him, just before he came to Green-street. I said you have been robbing this dray. He had one paper in his hat, and four papers in his bosom. I made him take them out of his bosom, and put them into his hat. I took him back to the dray. He took a spike out of his pocket, and threw it among the people. He was never out of my sight from the time he took them out of the box until I took him.</p>

               <p>JOHN SMITH. I am a servant to Messrs. Bedford and Liddiard. On the 17th of July, between five and six in the afternoon, the prisoner came to our warehouse, she asked for a person of the name of Atkins; no such person lived in the house; she was told, no, there was no such person. She returned. I saw her take the parcel and put it under her cloak; that parcel was in the warehouse. The warehouse is the lower part of the dwelling-house, and under the same roof. I went to the packing-board where it laid, and pursued the prisoner into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Then finding it was not there, you went after the prisoner immediately, did not you; how far had the prisoner gone from the door before you overtook her - A. About twelve yards. She was walking. I pulled her cloak aside, and told her she had something that she had no business with. She said she had not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you pulled her cloak off one side, did you perceive the parcel - A. I did, under her arm, I stopped her and brought her back, and examined the parcel, it contained three pieces of worked muslin, and one piece of printed cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any cambric besides - A. Yes, one piece of cambric. I took her to the warehouse and called assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. I hope you called louder than you now speak to us; who came - A. The warehouseman. The warehouseman took the things in my sight.

I fastened the window with a wooden-pin. I returned home about half after three in the afternoon, I found the window broken, and set wide open. It was a little sash that goes back, sliding in a groove.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing happening at your house - A. On last Monday, I went out on my business, selling things. There had been a grand review. The prisoner broke into my house; he took the tiles off, and broke through the ceiling. I went out between nine and ten o'clock; every thing was safe in the house then, I returned between four and five o'clock; my things were all tossed about, and the plaster and mortar was all on the floor; it appeared that somebody had come into the house at the top, by taking the tiles off, and breaking through the lath and plaster, they got into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any of your property - A. Yes, there is some part of it here. I missed a red cloak, an apron, a shawl, and an handkerchief of mine; of my husband's a small tea-spoon, two waistcoats, a pair of leather breeches, and a shirt.</p>

               <p>Q. What was your cloak worth - A. Fifteen shillings, an apron one shilling, the shawl five shillings, the handkerchief one shilling, the tea-spoon nine pence, two waistcoats five shillings, the breeches five shillings, a pair of stockings, value one shilling, and the shirt five shillings. I could not replace them for that money. I saw the property the next day, at a woman's at Brentford, where he had sold it; not all the property, only what I have got in my basket. The prisoner was present at the time I saw it in the woman's custody; her name is Crockett. The prisoner owned that he took the property before my face. They said it would be better for him, if he confessed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must not tell any thing he said after he confessed; was your husband at home - A. No, he was along with me helping to sell the things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. You do not know what terms your husband has the house upon - A. I took the house, and pay the rent for it. It is in the parish of Easton.</p>

These are the things that I took from Mrs. Crockett. I have had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160015"/> them ever since, and he said he got into the house at the back part.

               <p>Q. Did either of the other person say any thing to him - A. I cannot say; they might make a promise.</p>

I asked him, whose coat it was? he said his father sent him; he said his name was Johnson, he lived in Fore-street, Holborn. I examined the coat, and saw Mr. Simmon's ticket on the collar, I concluded it was taken from Mr. Simmon's door. I gave the prisoner into the custody of a Bow-street officer.</p>

            . I am an officer. I met the prisoner on the 15th of August; he was endeavouring to put the bacon under his coat.

            . I am a servant to Mr. Hodgson. On the 12th of August, between five and six o'clock, the prisoner came into my master's shop, she bought a pennyworth of cheese, and after that she went out of the shop, I perceived something under her clothes. I ran and stopped her. I called somebody in to hold the cheese, while I called my master down.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the cheese, and you called your master, did you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Until you saw the cheese under her cloak, had you any reason to suppose that she had taken any thing - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take it - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the seeing it under her cloak the first thing that gave you suspicion that she had stolen any thing - A. Yes, I had no suspicion until I saw it under her cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What is the value of this cheese - A. More than eight shillings; it weighs about twelve pounds. This is the cheese. I gave eight-pence per pound for it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence, I was in distress.</p>

On Tuesday, the 9th of September, I was alone in the shop; the prisoner and another man came into my shop to purchase a pair of shoes. I gave him a pair of shoes that stood in the window, to try on; he said, take out five or six pair, you have a good many in the window; I said, sir, I will take them out. I was so doing; a person came in for a pair of boots. The moment that he came in, the prisoner went away; he said you have nothing at all to fit me; when I went up to the window to put the shoes in, I missed a pair of shoes that I had made for Mr. Campbell, expecting he would want them in two or three days. My daughter found the prisoner again in about two days; he had the shoes on his feet. Salmon apprehended him. Salmon has got the shoes.</p>
               <p>JOHN SALMON. I produce the shoes. I took them off the prisoner's feet.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I can swear they are my shoes.</p>

If he was here he would give me a good character. I can have a good character from the officers of the ship. I was wounded. I was in Malta three months; how I came here, I know not. I told the man, if I had done him any harm, I would give him a five pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. to Salmon. Have you any thing with you that you found upon him - A. I had his absent ticket; it extended to the 8th of next October.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know, before hand, of her intention of going - A. She had been insolent some days before, and on the Friday, I told her she should go when her month was up. I did not know of her going on that day. I missed her on the 9th of August, about half past seven; and about 11 o'clock the same day, I missed a ten pound note, and I think three one pound notes, from the cabinet in the parlour, out of my pocketbook.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your pocket-book gone, or only the notes - A. Only the notes; the cabinet was usually kept locked; I had unlocked it two or three times in the morning, before I missed it. After I missed the notes, I saw some little splinters; then I saw that the lock had been forced, and shoved back again. I went for an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards take the prisoner - A. I did. I found her on the top of the coach at Aldgate; she was going into the country, I told her that she must come down. She delivered up to Mr. 
               <persName id="t18120916-26-person285">Jackson</persName>
             the two broaches and the ring. I asked her for the notes; she delivered me a one pound note; she said she had not got the ten pound note; she had not taken the ten pound note, it was a five pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any five pound note in your pocketbook - A. No. I am certain of that.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen that property - A.Between four and six o'clock on the Saturday. We got a coach and took her to Bow-street. I asked her how she came to do it; she said she did not know. She said she had laid out four pounds, and had got one-pound out of the five pound note, at Monmouth-street; she passed it for a five pound note. That person is not here.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160017"/> The broach and ring were in the cabinet. I had not seen them for a week or ten days. I am not positive of seeing them in the course of the week.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore, whether they were in the cabinet on the Saturday night, or whether they had been taken before, you cannot say - A. I cannot, and the great coat was certainly taken before the Saturday; she had a great coat, and this umbrella was with her on the coach. I had seen the umbrella on the Saturday night. I have got the broach and ring here, the ring is marked S. M. that is my wife's initials. I know the broach and ring to be my wife's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a character with her - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>THOMAS JACKSON. I was with Mr. Masson, I asked the prisoner about the broach and how she came to take them; she said she did not know; she said she got the place open with an old knife. She gave up to me the broach and the ring and a one pound note; she said she had not a ten pound note, it was a five, she gave it to a woman in Monmouth-street that she had bought some gowns of.</p>

               <p>Q. You lost two one pound notes and a three shilling token, did not you - A. I did, from out of my box in my bed chamber. I had seen it on Monday and I missed it on the Sunday night following; my box was locked, and when I missed my money I found it unlocked. The prisoner lodged in the same house with me, but in another room; I was not present when the prisoner confessed. I saw a one pound note and a three shilling piece he put behind the sand-tub in Mr. Morris's kitchen, he owned he put it there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say so - A. No.</p>
               <p>- PETHEW. I am the headborough of the parish; I challenged the prisoner with taking the money; he strictly denied it.</p>

            . I work for Mr. Cutling, a cheesemonger at Bow. I was coming by Mr. Anderson's house a little after nine at night, I saw two soldiers standing at the window. I saw one open the door and go in; as soon as he was got to the counter the other ran in and took hold of a small piece of bacon, put it into his cap and put it upon his head; in the course of two or three minutes he took up another piece, and put it under his arm and marched out of doors with it; when he got out of the shop he walked away, I pursued him and took him an hundred yards off from where he stole it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he ever out of your sight - A. No further than while I called for the constable, that might be about two minutes I then found him standing still in the same place where I left him; his comrade was not with him</p>
               <p>Q.Had he the bacon with him at that time or not - A. No, he had dropped it. I saw the bacon afterwards, it was on the ground, about two yards behind him. I told a young lad to give it me up. I took the prisoner back to Mr. Anderson's, and the boy followed with the bacon. I told the constable to take his cap off; he took it off himself, and the bacon fell out of his cap on the ground; the constable took charge of the bacon; his name is Starke.

               <p>Q. In what name did he tell you to book it - A. Jerry Booth. I asked him what he had to say about the horse with regard to soundness; he said he wished it to be sold to the best bidder. I put the horse up at the auction and sold it for seventeen guineas. I got a friend to buy it; after the sale was over I saw the horse was only three years old. I told my servants to be careful before they paid him to get his address. On the Thursday I saw him again; he put an address into my hand I told him that would not do, he must go and get the publican to come to me; he walked away directly, he went out of the yard; my friend took the horse home with him. The prisoner never had the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the horse that has been since claimed by Mr. Powell - A. Yes, the prisoner was at last taken up and charged by my son.</p>

The prisoner has been occasionally employed by us a year and a half; he was in out employ at the time he was detected. On the 7th of July, about a quarter before six in the evening, from suspicion, I directed the officer to search the prisoner. He found a pound of wool concealed in his trowsers. The prisoner pleaded guilty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say it would be better for him if he confessed or worse if he did not - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it your wool - A. It was in my charge, and the same sort we had remaining. I never found any thing against him until that moment.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. I went with Mrs. Arnold to the prisoner's room. On Tuesday, the 4th of August, the prisoner was at home and his wife with him. I found this quilt, it was hanging over a turn-up bedstead on which the prisoner said he slept. I took the prisoner in custody, and the quilt I brought away. I have had it ever since. This is it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It is my quilt.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am a chimney-sweeper. On Tuesday the 4th of August, I had been out the whole day; on my return home I found a man and a woman had been there. The prosecutrix went towards my bed and took off my quilt, which she threw on the floor, my wife having purchased the article at Rosemary-lane, for eighteen pence and which, if it was stolen, I am sorry as we has astonished. My room was searched and no other property found. I am an honest industrious young lad, who lives honest on the produce of my labour, and never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160021"/> did an act of dishonesty, and hope to prove the same in court. I am perfectly innocent of any felony, and hope to be restored to my wife by an acquittal.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Did the prisoner say how he got that quilt - A. He said he bought it in Rag-fair for eighteen pence.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

On Sunday evening, the 5th of July, a few minutes after ten, I was coming home in the evening, I found the street door open. I went up stairs, and when I had been sitting there a few minutes I heard a noise in the shop. I ran down stairs, and saw one man run out and shut the door after him, and shut the prisoner at the bar in. I immediately ran up stairs and gave the alarm; and the watchman came and secured the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, he might have got away. Did you leave the door open. When you came in you found the door open, walked coolly up stairs and sat down. You never looked to see if any body was there - A. No, I did not. I saw the prisoner examined at the watch-house, and a remnant of print was found in his hat. That is all I know.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know whether the prisoner was in doors when you went in first - A. I don't think he was.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they get in - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the key-hole on the outside - A. No, not the outer door. They picked the lock of the shop door to get into the shop. The street door is about two yards from the shop door.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the shop part of the house - A. Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Has Mr. Douton any partners - A. No, he has not; he keeps the house. It is in the parish of St. Andrew.</p>

            . I am a watchman. As I was coming on my duty, I met a boy running; he said come quick watchman, there are thieves in the house.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160022"/> It was a few minutes after ten. I made all the haste I could. I went up the private passage. I saw two ladies at the garret window. They cried murder, watchman break in if you can, there's thieves in the house. I forced myself in a window opposite to the area, and so got in, and found the prisoner on the stairs. I took him to the watch-house. He was there searched. There was some muslin found in his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine which way he got in - A. No, I did not.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I assisted the watchman in taking the prisoner. I stood at the door and took him down to the watch-house. The watchman got in at the window; he took the prisoner, and I assisted in taking him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FLETCHER. I was constable of the night. A few minutes after ten the two last witnesses brought the prisoner into the watch-house. On examining the prisoner, in his hat was this remnant of cotton and this silk handkerchief. I went afterwards to Mr. Douton's house. I went into the shop, and on the counter there were these two bags. The bags had been filled with property, they were filled with muslins.</p>
               <p>Q. How many yards of muslin - A. I do not know myself. After that I sent the prisoner to the compter.</p>
               <p>Q.to Patison. Look at that piece of cotton found in his hat, and the muslin - A. That is my master's property, three yards of printed cotton. The three yards of printed cotton found in his hat is worth six shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, as to the other articles found in the bags, does the bags belong to you - A. No, they did not. This muslin is a sample of what was found in the bags; it is nine yards and three quarters. Both the bags were filled with muslins. One of the bags was drawn to the shop door, the other bag was in the middle of the shop, on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen these muslins - A. The day before; they were on the shelves when we left the shop on the Saturday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of these muslins found in the bag - A. Between three and four hundred pounds. I am sure they are Mr. Douton's property.</p>
               <p>Q. When you said you had brought a sample, you meant a part of that muslin - A. Yes. These two are whole pieces, about five yards in length. The value of this part that I have brought is about five pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from my lodgings in Sun-street, Bishopsgate. I heard the cry of thieves from out of the window. A man came out of the house, and shut me in. I was called up for trial last night, my witnesses were then here, they cannot attend to night.</p>

            . I am an officer. From an information of an inhabitant that there were three shop lifters, I watched them, seeing them in Mr. Terrington's shop. Forrester was along with me. I saw the three prisoners come out of the shop, and I and Forrester watched them until we came between the five lamps at Aldgate. I stood just by Duke's-place. They all three made a stop, and had a little conversation together. We stood on the opposite side of the way looking at them. Forrester said to me, it will do. I saw Mrs. Palmer hand over to Mrs. Turner, something bulky and heavy from under her silk pelisse, and Mr. Palmer put something into Mrs. Turner's lap. Forrester secured Turner, and I secured Palmer and Swan. We then took them to the watch-house, and in Mrs. Turner's lap we found these two pieces belonging to Mr. Terrington. Nothing was found on Swan nor Palmer, except some bank-notes.</p>

            . I received information, and traced the three prisoners to Mr. Terrington's shop. Kinnersley and I stopped opposite, and saw them come out. We followed them near to the five lamps at Aldgate, where they all three stopped and had some conversation together. Mrs. Palmer put her hand under her pelisse. The two pieces of muslin hanged under her pelisse longways. Mrs. Turner stood in the front of her, held up her gown and received the two pieces of muslin. Mrs. Palmer and Mrs. Swan walked away towards Whitechapel, and Mrs. Turner went towards the city. I told Kinnersley to go and secure them while I went after the woman that had the property. Kinnersley secured Palmer and Swan, and I secured Turner with the property in her lap. I produce the property.</p>

He was in the habit of going to undress himself in the closet at the back of the stage, after he had done his work. I saw him take these two pint pots and put in his pocket one at a time; and soon after I had seen the prisoner put the pots in his pocket, I followed him down stairs, when he returned upon the stage on the opposite side. I thought he had been gone, not seeing him when I came down. I went out of doors, and soon after the prisoner came out. He went up the yard, and I followed him. A coach at that time was passing the yard. I lost sight of him. Soon after I saw the prisoner coming out of the door again. There was another person with me. I told him that Hayward was coming up; we waited to see whether he was going towards the Clown, knowing that he had the pots in his pocket. He went past the Clown. I saw him pass the door. A witness and I followed him. The witness that is here with me felt at his pockets, and found that he had got two pint pots, one in each pocket. We took him, one on each side, after he had got some distance from the Clown, and asked him to go with us to Mr. Graves, he keeps the Clown, and said he wanted us as well. He asked what we all wanted with him. We told him we would tell him when we got to the Clown. When we came to the door he made great resistance. We were forced to call out Graves, and a gentleman that was in the house at the time, came to our assistance; by that means we got him into the house. We took into the bar. We told Graves that we had got a man that had got pots in his pocket. The prisoner said he had no pots in his pocket. We had suspected him a long time, and I had marked each of the pots.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. Was not I in the act of crossing to the Clown - A. No, you had passed by the Clown.</p>

            . I am the master carpenter at the Theatre. M young man watched the prisoner. When I saw the prisoner go past the Clown, I went and seized him. I had previously before that rubbed him down, and found something hard in his pockets. We forced him into the Clown. A gentleman in the bar took a pint pot out of his left-hand pocket, and another out of his right-hand pocket. These are the pots.</p>
               <p>MR. GRAVES. These pots are mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I trust, with the indulgence of the court, I can explain in a satisfactory manner the circumstance which seems to involve me in an act of shame. I am a labourer in the East India Company's service, and also a scene-shifter at the Theatre, which brought me eight shillings a week. I told the girl, I would bring the pots home as soon as the Theatre closed. I have ever maintained an unblemished character, and with honesty alone endeavoured to maintain a large family.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I crossed the road, and laid hold of the deceased. They struck at each other, while I held the deceased; I parted them. I said what are you fighting about. A woman made answer, that man has been ill used, speaking of the deceased. I went up to the prisoner, and said, what do you mean by kicking up a row, you rascal; you are an officer, instead of making peace you break it. I gave him a shove, and when he recovered himself, he started and run from the deceased. I laid hold of the deceased; I said, you go this way, the contrary way, this is your way home; he said, no, this is my way, that man has ill used me; and if I can overtake him, I will give him a wapping. I held him until the prisoner had got fifty yards, and then he went after the prisoner, and he turned the corner; they were both out of my sight. I heard a noise. I walked on until I came to the corner, and then I heard a great noise near the Globe; when I came within twenty yards of the mob, there was the deceased. I found the deceased falling against some pales. I went up to him, knowing him to be the person that caused this row; I said, it is of no use your shamming drunk, I have seen enough of your sort. I laid hold of him, and put him on his back.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did this man die - A. About a quarter of an hour, or half an hour after, he dropped. We carried him from that place to the Globe public-house, and there the surgeon came. I was not five yards from him until the surgeon came.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were there, did you see the prisoner that night - A. I saw the prisoner come to the Globe steps. After we had taken the deceased to the Globe steps, the prisoner came up; he said, I have got into a pretty rig. I said, it serves you right, if you have done this; the man is dead. I had got hold of the captain then.</p>

On the 29th of August last, about half after eight in the morning, Mrs. Guthrie, who lives in the one pair of stairs, in Mrs. Wildsmith's house, came for me to attend the prisoner. I went immediately. I found her in the garret, sitting up in the bed; I desired her to lay down. Mrs. Wildsmith was in the room. She said, Mrs. Bailey, the child is here.</p>
               <p>Q.Recollect, and tell me whether before she said there was the child, you perceived any thing - A. No. I searched for the child, and found it as she was sitting up, rather below her knees.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the child separated from the mother - A. No, it was not, it was alive. I separated the child. I took it out, and laid it on the bed; then I observed to her, that she had been using the child ill. I said you good-for-nothing creature, you have been using this child ill. I said, what is this you have done. I observed that the child was bruised very much; it was black and blue all over the chest, the lips were swelled very much, and a kind of bladder on the top lip, and it bled violently at the nose and mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been a midwife, how long - A. Twenty-five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that the bruises that you saw were occasioned by impression at the time of its birth - A. I never saw such marks before in my life. I examined the inside of the mouth; I was not satisfied. I went to Dr. Reynolds.</p>
               <p>Q. What appearances were there on it - A. I could not tell any thing The blood came; so it was a full time child. A very fine child indeed; a female child.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any child that had been delivered without assistance - A. Many, without any person being present at the time of its birth.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the birth to be difficult, can you say whether the marks were such as the child might have by the mother attempting to deliver herself - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>CORNWALL REYNOLDS. I am a surgeon; I reside at Hackney.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you examined before the coroner - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember being called upon by Mrs. Bailey, on the 29th of August - A. Mrs. Bailey brought an infant to my house on the Saturday morning. I looked at the child. I perceived the child very much bruised upon the chest, and a lacerated wound under the tongue; blood issuing copiously from that wound as well as from the nostrils. The general conformation of the child seemed to be healthy and vigorous; a female child. It appeared to me to have attained its full maturity; but from its appearance, I could perceive ample ground for the cause of the child's death.</p>
               <p>Q. To what do you attribute the child's death - A. I believe it to be from the injury it had received, and which I have already stated.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of these injuries - A. That under the tongue mostly contributed to its death.</p>
               <p>Court. It occasioned the death - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Do you apprehend it to be caused by the laceration under the tongue, or from the consequence of that wound - A. By the effusion of blood. The wound under the tongue was sufficient to effect the child's life.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been much used in cases of this sort to attend upon women - A. If you mean in cases of midwifery, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other appearance about the child that could have occasioned the child's death except that - A. I should think not.</p>
               <p>Court. But the laceration - A. My lord, I conceive the laceration contributed to it.</p>
               <p>Q. You should have thought that there was nothing that could occasion the child's death but the laceration - A. Yes, from he laceration.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You have heard that this woman was delivered when she was alone - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I now ask you, whether from the delivery of the child under the present unfortunate circumstances, those appearances, the laceration, and the issuing of blood therefrom; whether that could be attributable to natural causes, supposing a woman to be delivering herself. And from the appearances that you describe could it have proceeded from violence - A. To answer that question particularly, I should like to go into a detail, if I may be suffered; - there is a term in midwifery called face-presentation, in which case the mouth of the child might have presented itself. And if the woman from pain and anxiety to draw the child, might have put her fingers into the mouth of the child, she might have produced in haste such a laceration. I mention the case as a possibility.</p>
               <p>Q. In such a possible case, how would the child be with respect to its face - A. The face would present itself first.</p>
               <p>Court. And then in the anxiety, from pain to deliver herself, it is sometimes done - A. It is sometimes done.</p>
               <p>DOCTOR FORD. If I am allowed to speak, I have seen three cases similar.</p>
               <p>Court. When you are called upon, then is your time.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether the landlady went up stairs before you went for the midwife - A. I went up with her. The landlady accused her of the child being born.</p>
               <p>Court. That is Mrs. Wildsmith - A. Yes, the prisoner said, no I immediately went for the midwife, that was all that past at that time. I left the landlady in the room with her when I went for the midwife.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you the landlady of the house in which the prisoner lodged - A. Yes. On Saturday, the 29th of August, Mrs. Guthrie called me up stairs. I went up to the prisoner; I said Sally your child is born. She said it is not. I said, Sally, how can you do so. The child cried, when I answered the second time. I said nothing else to her. I stopped in the room the whole of the time until the midwife came.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you administer any thing to the child - A. Yes, I tried it with a little gruel; it swallowed about a tea-spoon full. The child was in a feeble state; the extremities were cold, and every appearance of death fast approaching.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any blood. - A. Not at the time. The gruel that the child returned was a little streaked with blood.</p>

            . Q.You are a surgeon and apothecary - A. Yes, I was sent for, on Monday the 20th of July, between six and seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state did you find her - A. She was sitting in a chair, conversing with two women in her own room. She got up and told me her name was Heath, and that her husband had used her very. She shewed me the bruises; there was one on the left breast, one on the arm, and one on the lower part of the loins.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you upon examination of these bruises, that they were likely to produce her death - A. No. I bled her that evening, and saw her the following day. On the next day she was up, and doing her domestic work. I did not see her after that. She died on the Wednesday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw her on the Tuesday, was there any thing about her that indicated a speedy dissolution - A. No indication of danger on the Tuesday.</p>

               <p>MR. SPRY. Q. Had you seen the deceased, Mrs. Heath, before she died - A. I had not. I saw her on the Thursday. I examined her; there were no outward marks sufficient to produce her death. I opened the body; I found within the ventricle of the brain a quantity of serum.</p>
               <p>Q. In an healthy subject, Sir, that would not have been the case - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. In your judgment was that sufficient cause to produce death - A Quite sufficient.</p>
               <p>Q.If you could by any possibility know that any such cause existed, you would be certain that death would follow - A. Certainly there were several marks of violence on her body, on her left breast, but of no importance. I examined the body very carefully; I found no cause of death, but what I have described.</p>
               <p>Q. You can say that these outward marks of violence did not produce any effect to cause her death - A. They certainly did not.</p>
               <p>Q. The effusion of blood upon the brain could not have been produced by any of this violence - A. Certainly not, we should have had other appearances.</p>

               <p>Q. You lost some of your property last month, did not you - A. Yes, out of my house On Thursday, the 9th of August, between nine and ten o'clock, I went to bed. I left my wife by the fire; in a short time, she began to cry and make a noise and said, that somebody had stolen the box out of the place.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your property kept - A. In a box.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160027"/> The box was locked; the box was kept in the back kitchen. I rose up in the bed, and there I sat, amazed, that any body could take the box while I was in bed. My wife ran into the street, and said she was robbed and ruined. Directly

I said, I think so; it will be the ruin of me. Straitway my wife came in with the box, it was broken open and empty. All the property had been taken out. She went into the street again, to see if she could find the property. I jumped out of bed, and

             left me, and went up stairs, I went into the passage, and there I stood facing of the street. My wife was inquiring for the rest of the property. In the mean time the watchman came, and my wife, to search in my own rooms.</p>
               <p>Q. Why should he search the rooms - A. There was a suspicion, that some in my house had done the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lived in your rooms -

            , Perkins, and Mary Lipscomb, they all lodged with us in different rooms. They went up to search the room, and when they went into the second floor the patrol called me; he asked me if I knew that pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the patrol's name - A. Oram. He called me up, and produced a pocket-book to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that pocket-book your property - A. Yes, I lost it from the bottom of the box; it contained two one pound notes and some silver, for the rent that my wife had put in it. I saw my wife put it in two one pound notes, and four pounds worth of silver. I asked Mary Lipscomb, what made her and her men do such things to me. She denied it. I went up into the three pair.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lodged there - A. Roberts. I charged them all to the watch-house. Me and my wife and the patrol took them to the watch-house; and then I and my wife went to bed. The patrol came the next morning at four o'clock; me and my wife jumped out of bed; he asked me to go and look into the yard. I went and looked into another person's yard through the boards; I saw a boot-top lay, and a great bundle besides. The patrol and me fetched the bundle, and examined it.</p>
               <p>Q.What was in it - A. My property and my wife's, both. I found in it a pair of boot tops, a waistcoat, a hat, and a handkerchief; the other things belonged to my wife.</p>
               <p>Q.Could any person take it out of your room, and put it into the yard - A. From the top window of the house from Roberts's window.</p>
               <p>MRS. Q. Are you the wife of the last witness - A. Yes. I was in the back kitchen; my husband was in bed I was sitting by the fire about ten o'clock I heard the watchman go past ten. I went and shut the outer door, and locked it with a spring-lock. I went to the back kitchen, shut the door, but did not lock it, and I saw a candle, burning, upon the box, go to bed directly, and before I happened to go to bed, I fell asleep and when I awoke, the place was in darkness. The candle was out. I put my hand out. I could not feel the box or the candlestick. I alarmed my husband. The kitchen door was wide open, and the street-door wide open. I ran out, and found the patrol; he was enquiring for the owner of the box. I told him I had lost a box; the box was mine. Oram and me and another watchman made a search in several rooms of lodgers in neighbours houses; we found nothing there. We came to our own rooms next. I was present when the patrol found the pocket-book in the second pair, Perkins's lodging. He had lodged in the house eight months. I went immediately up into Roberts's room, at the top of the house; when I came there, the window was wide open, and Perkins was sitting by Roberts's fire. Seeing the window open, I went up to it.

             seemed to be fast asleep when I went into the room; he jumped up, and put the table by the window. When Roberts came in, we searched round the room; we could not find any thing. When Roberts was out of the window, I saw him put his arm out. I saw nothing in his hand. I saw him put his arm out towards where the bundle was found the next morning. The patrol took Roberts, Perkins, and Lipscomb, to the watch-house; and on the next morning the patrol came and knocked at the door. He said get up, here is something in the yard. I saw the things in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. What property did you observe of yours - A. One gown, three pair of mitts, a spencer, a child's frock, and a habit shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put any money in this box - A. I put the money into the pocket-book in the box, four pounds in silver, and two one pound Bank notes.</p>
               <p>- ORAM. On the 31st of August, I was going through Charles-street, patroling I saw a large deal box standing in a coach-yard. The box appeared to have been broken open; it was empty. I made inquiry about the box. The prosecutrix came and said she had lost her box. She owned the box immediately. I then searched the lodgers apartments. In the second floor was a pocket-book laying by the bed side of Perkins and Lipscomb. The watchman attempted to pick it up. I said, it should not be picked up until Bates came there and owned it. I went upstairs into Robert's room Perkins and Roberts seemed to be in a great confusion; the window appeared just shut to, and by Perkins pushing the table, they seemed to be in confusion about it. On the next morning, I saw something in Mr. Glover's yard, the next yard. I gave notice to Bates. I went up stairs and got out of the window. Bates owned the bundle.</p>
               <p>JOHN BAXTER. I was constable of the night at the watch-house; that night Oram brought this pocketbook to the watch house. It is the same; I have kept it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q.to Prosecutrix. Do you know that pocket book - A. Yes, and this is all my property; but it is not all that was lost. The pocket book was found in Perkins's room. He and

               <p>Perkins's Defence. I know nothing about it, nor how it came there.</p>
               <p>Roberts's Defence. On Monday night, about half after ten, Mrs. Bates came into my apartment; she said Roberts, for God's sake, come down, I am robbed I said, is it true. I went to her apartment, where her husband was in bed. I staid there until her husband dressed himself. She went out in the street, and when I heard the box was found, I went up to my apartment and smoked a pipe. The watchman came in, he said he would insist upon taking me and Perkins to the watch-house. They searched all the apartments in the house, and found nothing. This good lady's door, a child of three years old can open her lock any hour of the day or night; it pulls open with a string.</p>

I was speaking to a young woman; I had missed my road I wanted to know the name of the street, and the nearest way to Drury-lane; and while the young woman and me were talking together, Griffiths and his companion came up to me. Griffiths said, you must not answer, if you do you will be served; so he pushed me against the wall, and put his hand into my waistcoat pocket, and took from thence a snuff-box; there was nothing in it but a little snuff.</p>
               <p>Q. What might it be worth - A. Six-pence; it was a tin-japanned box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Griffiths before - A. Never; when he got away the box, he turned from me. I said you have robbed me of my box. He said, no, he had not. I replied you have; and if you do not deliver it up, I shall call the watch. He turned round, and threw the snuff-box away under a gate-way. He said to his companion, strike him; his companion directly up with his fist, and knocked me down. Griffiths struck me six or seven times after I was down I called watch, and his companion ran down the street, and Griffiths ran under a gate-way. The watchman came up; I told him I had been knocked down and robbed. I described the prisoner. The watchman found the prisoner up the gate way; up the same gate-way he had chucked the snuff-box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him run up the gate way - A. Yes, and told the watchman. I saw he was lame as he ran away. He was without hat or coat.</p>

            . I am watchman in George-street. I heard the call of watch; I ran immediately, I saw Hill; he said he was robbed of a snuff-box. He said the man that robbed him was lame. I went into the Phoenix yard. I found the prisoner there; he had no coat or hat on. He is lame, and I found the snuffbox just under the gate-way. I afterwards took the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence The prosecutor states of my having assaulted and robbed him; whereas I was only passing by near where this unfortunate accident happened. I wish to ask the watchman, whether he has not known me as a quiet inhabitant of that place.</p>
               <p>Lane I have known the prisoner two or three years; I never heard any thing against him until this time.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner on the 21st of July - A. Yes, he came to my shop on the 21st of July. I was washing myself in the kitchen; there were several customers in the shop. The prisoner stood by the horse of shoes; he looked very earnest, as if he wanted to be served; and seeing him go out of the shop with his hat to his face, I went after him; and when I came up to him, I said, my friend you have got something I believe of mine. He said, I have got none of your shoes; he threw the shoes down, and said d - n your shoes. I said, if you do not want them, I do; and I will have you as sure as ever you have got a head on your shoulders.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would wish to know, whether any one else sells shoes in his shop during his absence.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Yes, my wife and daughter. These are the shoes; I saw him throw them down. I was close by the side of him: I picked them up. They were given into the custody of Read, the officer. I marked them before I gave them to Read. I am sure they are my property. And they are the shoes the prisoner threw down. I marked them on the bottom, at my first appearance at Hatton-garden, just before I gave them up to the officer.</p>

On Thursday, the 23rd of July, about noon, my apprentice gave me information that a man was taking some mahogany from my back door. I went to the back door, and found the man tieing up two pieces of mahogany. I asked him, what he was going to do with it. He pointed to a man, and said, that man told him to tie them up, and follow him. While he was telling me that I looked at the rest of the mahogany, and found that some had been gone before. I asked him, where he had carried what he had taken away before. He said, he had not been there before. He saw that man sell two pieces of mahogany for bed posts. He took them to the place where they were sold, which was Mr. Mullett's shop in Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mr. Mullett - A. A broker. I went and looked in Mr. Mullett's shop, and saw the two pieces of mahogany stand. I told Mr. Mullett that he had goods that were stolen from me. While I was talking to Mr. Mullett my lad came and informed me, that they had got the other man. I asked Mr. Mullett to go with me, and see if that was the man that he had bought them of. Mr. Mullett came and saw the man. He said, he gave him a pound note for the mahogany.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH HUGHES. Q. On the night of Saturday, the 29th of August, were you at the Crown public house, in the Minories, the night that this transaction took place - A. Yes; I was, having a pint of beer about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner there - Yes; he was quarrelling with two men when I went in; one was a shopmate of his, his name was Scott; the other man's name I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the ground of his quarrelling with Scott - A. Scott said, that the prisoner's wife borrowed things and pawned them. There were many words; but I do not recollect all Evans said to Scott; have you any more to tell me, for I will have revenge. Evans then said, the first time that ever I catch your wife in my room, I will push her down stairs. I happened to go out and assist; as I came in Evans went out.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state did he appear to go out in; cool and calm, or how - A. He did not seem to go out in a passion, as I saw. When he went out, a man went out with him. He came in again; he said nothing more at that time.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear any blows take place - A. I cannot say I did. She said, how can you believe what every one says, and come home and ill use me for it. She said, I have not borrowed any money of any one. He said, she was a liar. I heard her scream again, and something fell to the floor. In about a moment she shrieked again. I heard no more.

               <p>Q. To do what - A. Not to jump out. She got up in the window; first with one knee and then with the other, and turned her feet outwards. She extended her arms three times, and came down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the extension of the arms three times before she quitted the window - A. The third extension of her arms she came down.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lords, and gentlemen of the jury, trembling under the awful situation in which I am now charged with a crime of the most brutal enormity, appearing before this Honourable Court with all the mischievous consequences created against me by public prints/, &amp;c. I most humbly appeal; confident, however popular clamour may condemn me, a conviction of my innocence, to which I call God to witness, and of your humane and impartial hearing, that you will permit me to submit to your consideration those matters irresistibly attached to the case, which will convey to the Court the impossibility of my guilt. On the contrary, satisfactorily convince you, that so far from committing the horrid act with which I now stand accused, I have uniformly endeavoured by every pacific persuasion to calm the perturbed state of mind under which my late unfortunate wife laboured, and to convey to her feelings, notwithstanding her innumerable faults, attachment to her person. Permit to represent, since my infancy, I have pursued a life of honesty and industry; the former part of which was devoted to the service of my country, in his Majesty's ship, Ville de Paris; since which I have pursued every means of procuring an honest livelihood. With solemn grief do I state, I unfortunately married the deceased eight years back, and, for a period, lived happy, enjoying an uninterrupted means by my honesty, confining myself to the humble following of a sawyer; of providing every comfort any well disposed couple might expect, for which I feel grateful to my Maker; when, unfortunately, my wife launched into extravagances impossible for me by my labour to support, continually pledging what few articles I had worked hard for, and contracting debts in every quarter unknown to me, which, however distressing to my feelings, I have, by the most pacific persuasion, painted out the inevitable destruction awaiting such conduct, which, however, only tended to kindle the flame of disaffection, and produced in her new inventions to plunder. Upon various occasions, after having pledged every thing she could move, she has, under various false pretexts, borrowed articles of my neighbours, which she has systematically consigned to the same fate; and, to avoid public detection, she has left her home, and, at the moment when we were entrusted with an infant to nurse, she has carried with her the child's apparel, which she had likely taken from its person a few minutes before, on putting it to bed, when staying out sometimes until one, two, and three o'clock in the mornings, intoxicated, after rolling about the streets, completely disfigured with mud and dirt, she would return; not withstanding all which, I have silently submitted to the same, and afforded her admittance, when she has declared she has lost her pockets, with their contents, amounting sometimes to twenty or thirty shillings; a wilful pretext to enable her to redeem part of the property borrowed of the neighbours, and pledged; a glaring instance of which will be satisfactorily proved by an industrious woman, the mother of the child, who upon some occasions she has actually called from her bed, and persuaded her to accompany her home, to plead in her behalf; who cannot deny, instead of my maltreating her, I have kindly signified my distress of mind at her staying out, and kindly invited her to my polluted bed. Detection upon detection of her infamy followed When at a moment of self-conviction she has absconded, plundering me of every article, not leaving me any thing except the clothes on my back. While at work, instances of which I shall prove by a work-mate of mine, and who unfortunately gave her to me in marriage eight years ago, at Christ Church, Newgate-street, of whom she has repeatedly borrowed money, under various pretexts, to whom, after roving about in a state of whoredom, for a week or so, she has applied to ask forgiveness, and persuade me to receive her; which, upon all occasions, I have, be it known to my weakness, readily complied with, and by other industrious and respectable persons, who have commisserated my fate, to whom she has boasted her finesse in deceiving me about her pockets, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160032"/> acknowledged her pleasure in my weakness, in believing her. These desertions, with other acts of profligacy, reduced me to a state of wretchedness beyond human conception. My humble home repeatedly deserted, applications upon applications for money she owed, and articles she had pledged unknown to me; incapable of supporting it, although I worked like a horse to support an honest character, in which assertion, thank God, every one that knows me will gladly bear me out; imprisoned, as it were, on the Sunday, by her; as often as I might redeem them, pledging my decent clothes, and often deprived of but one shirt for weeks, I was compelled to form a resolution to restrict her from purchasing our necessary food, &amp;c. by performing such offices myself. This added to her fury; and incapable, by her repeated falsehoods, to deceive her neighbours or acquaintances, as heresofore, she gave way to immoderate passions, and became ungovernable, as often when no person was in her room as otherwise, and I absent at work all day. She would indulge such flagrant passions, often screaming and tearing herself, as one would suppose, to pieces. She would open the window of the room, when she has been known to alarm the neighbours, fearful she might throw herself out. One instance of the latter act can be proved by my landlord and landlady, on which occasion they were induced to rush up and persuade her to descend to her parlour. Sorry am I to repeat these instances of ungovernable passions, but my situation imperiously demands it; and I hope, as my miserable life depends upon your decision, you will humanely forgive me.</p>

               <p>Suspecting her, a few weeks before this fatal catastrophe happened, of having spent the trifle I had given her to pay the rent, I, on Saturday, made known my intention of paying my rent that evening myself, and went down stairs to my landlord accordingly, when in lieu of having six shillings to pay, which I conceived was this due, which he himself supposed was my opinion, he informed me, in lieu of my wife having paid him the money he knew I had given her, that she had spent it in inebriety and debauchery, and that he had a claim upon me for twenty-four shillings, when, on my return, I discovered she had decamped with every moveable, however trifling they were; upon which occasion she secreted herself from me from Saturday to the ensuing Friday, when she again returned, nearly naked, when I again, with the most kind intention towards her, received her, although I detected her. During such absence she applied to a Mr. Smith, in Charterhouse-street, in an apparent state of agony, and informed him, that I had that moment been brought home, by two persons, in a dying state, shewing him an old out-patients ticket for the hospital; under pretext of just having obtained such, and to buy me indispensible and immediate nourishment, borrowed six shillings, and of

            , a one-pound note. To guard against her organized schemes of deception was impossible; to repeat her actions for the last two years would astonish the most profligate, while it would claim from the dispassionate and philanthropist the tear of compassion and pity. On Saturday, the 24th of August last, as was my invariable custom, I returned home at four o'clock in the afternoon, when my deceased wife being out, I commenced shaving myself. I had scarce finished doing so when she returned, and as if pleased to see her, as I supposed, thoroughly collected, I addressed her by saying, my dear girl, if you continue this way we shall soon overcome our difficulties, and still live happy, when she informed me she had been taken ill in the street, and had reached in her apron, shewing it me at the same time; upon which I expressed my regret, and in as tender a tone as I was capable of, requested her to lay down on the bed, which she did, and to the best of my belief, fell asleep; upon which, having a lock and key to purchase at a neighbouring ironmonger's, for a box I was then having made by my workmate, and also to attend for my wages, I left her three shillings in silver and in halfpence, and went quietly out of the room, fearful of disturbing her.</p>
               <p>I purchased the lock and key, and on going to the sign of the Crown public-house, at which house the sawyers who worked for master regularly met on a Saturday, to make out their bills for the week's work, I called on Mr. Strachan, butcher, in in the Minories, and agreed for the aitch-bone of beef for our Sunday's dinner. At the Crown public-house I met my fellow-sawyer's mate, to whom I gave the lock and key, who, as he regularly did, made out our joint week's bill for work, which bill I took to my employer, who, about half past eight o'clock, paid me, when I returned to the Crown, and paid my mate his portion of the said work-bill. A few minutes conversation passed, when my shop-mates enquired how my wife conducted herself; upon which I informed them we agreed very well, and that I was in hopes, if she continued as she now behaved, I should, I flattered myself, I should by hard-work, be enabled ere long, to relieve myself from difficulties created by her improprieties. Upon which, one and all expressed their conviction. I did not know half she owed. She had borrowed money of every one she could. Amongst the number was my workmate, of whom, during her flight, and about the same time she borrowed six shillings. Of Mr. Smith, she had persuaded him, to lend her one pound, begging him not to acquaint me of the same for a time, intimating, she had pledged my Sunday clothes unknown to me; she wanted to redeem them, and replace them the next day, (Sunday); the whole of which she squandered away during her exile from home, from the Saturday to the following Friday before mentioned. Inclined to be home by my regular hour; called at the butchers, and paid for the aitchbone of beef, which I immediately took home, it being then near ten o'clock. On my going home, to my utter astonishment I beheld my wife intoxicated, and discovered, notwithstanding I had left her three shillings, she had taken the gown off her back, and had put on an old bed gown, which, upon enquiry, she acknowledged she had pledged. Disappointed in my hopes of any reformation, I, as well as I could, with a sorry heart, expostulated with her of her innumerable acts of treachery, and the difficulties she had plunged me into; besides acquainted her of the information afforded me by my shop-mates,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160033"/> and very likely chided her in a harsh manner for obtaining the one pound of my mate. Chagrined at my unexpected dectection, she first began to cry, and deny the whole, which hurt me the more. I call God to witness I never struck her. She permitted her passion to overcome her, and most completely terrified me by her screaming, jumping, and knocking about, exclaiming, dear Frank, don't believe them. Upon which she made a desperate attack upon the room door, no doubt to fly out to avoid further animadversions, which I prevented by placing myself before it, in which I believe a scuffle might ensue for two or three minutes, in which I let fall on the floor the aitchbone of beef, having been from the moment of my entrance into the room, and missing the gown off her back, struck, as as it were, senseless. Observing her in such a violent rage, and persuaded my continuing speaking to her would only add to it, I silently set myself on a chair, with my back to the window, at the opposite side of the room, reflecting with silent grief, at my wretched situation; still determined not to let her go out of the room, especially as I was convinced she had been drinking. After screaming and jumping about the room, as if mad, she, unknown to me, flew to the window, which unfortunately was opened, and raised herself upon the sill of the window, and precipitated herself into the yard, paved with sharp pointed stones. Casting my eyes round I first saw her flying down out of the window. Distracted, I rushed down stairs; how, I know not; but, when collected, I found myself assisting my unfortunate victim of self-destruction, from the fatal spot where she alighted, to the step of our street-door. When I discovered blood gushing out of her head or face, suffice it to say, I was completely senseless for a few moments. When she held out her hand to me I embraced it for the last time. She wished me to accompany her up stairs, but Scott, the constable, denied me so doing and took me in custody.</p>
               <p>My Lords, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I once more appeal to God that I have set forth the truth, and nothing but the truth, and hope, when you consider the case fully, which I rest satisfied you will, you will easily convince yourselves of the improbability of my being her murderer. God forbid. Were I so, the sooner I quit this earthly career the better. Pardon me. I must disclose one more act to prove how bent to every species of advantage she was, even during the short time I left her to buy the lock and key, and obtain my wages. She had not only pledged her gown, but had actually borrowed a pair of flat irons of the landlady, and pledged them also: and more wonderful, after she had jumped out of the window in a state, dreadful as may be expected, told her of the same, gave her the duplicate, and requested her to keep this act from my knowledge, and privately gave a number of duplicates to Mr. Smith to keep for her unknown to me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called twelve witnesses, who gave him the character of a tender, humane, and kind husband.</p>

At the time I was told my handkerchief was gone; was on the Middlesex side of Temple Bar. I followed him and stopped him. That man was the prisoner. I recollected his person, that he had been near me. I asked him for my handkerchief. He said he had not got it. I opened his coat, and took out the handkerchief from under his left arm pit, stuffed in very close. I took the prisoner to the watchhouse, and gave the handkerchief to the officer. I saw the prisoner pick up something, and when I went home I found three amlets in my pocket. I saw them lay on the ground. They made a noise. The prisoner picked them up, and when I went home I found them in my pocket. I am not conscious how they got in. This is the handkerchief. I have had it ever since. It is worth seven or eight shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. How long before you missed the seal and key had you seen it safe - A. A few minutes before I saw the prisoner I was passing through Smithfield. Miles's caravan was coming in with the wild beasts. The caravan was drawn by eight grey horses. The caravan stopped, and I stopped to look at the caravan.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner near you - A. No. I had my hand on my watch, in my fob. I felt a little tug at my watch. I cast my eyes down. I saw the prisoner's hand pass from my fob, and I missed my seal and key. The prisoner turned round to make off. I seized him. I saw the prisoner throw the seal, key, and scissars on the ground. A witness here picked them up. In the mean time an officer took the prisoner out of my hands. It was a family seal. I valued it at seven shillings, and the key sixpence.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the last witness pick up the seal and key and scissars. In taking the prisoner to the Compter, the prisoner threw a scissar-sheath away. I picked it up. It fits the scissars; and the ribbon which remains on the prosecutor's watch corresponds with that cut off. I produce the seal and key.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my seal and key.</p>

A tall man passed me, and made a rush, which almost knocked me down, and then these things were found.</p>

               <p>Q. Do customers come in at the back door - A. Yes; that drew my attention. I went back to my bar, and missed my till; in it was about thirty shillings in copper money. The back door goes into a passage that leads into Thames-street, and the passage comes round to the corner of my house, in Tower-street. I ran out of the front door, and saw the prisoner with my till, and when he got as far as Barking-alley he threw the till down with the money in it. I ran after him, and laid hold of him. This is the till and halfpence. They are mine.</p>

They could come to the stable without coming to the house, by getting over a pair of gates. I also missed a sheet, old shoes, and old boots.

I saw the prisoner shut the door. I immediately went to look for the spoons I saw they were gone. I followed the prisoner and brought him back into the kitchen. I searched him, and found the spoons in his waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How does that kitchen door open - A. With a bolt; it was only shut; it was not bolted, it was latched.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you tried the door yourself in the course of the morning to see whether it was latched or not - A. I had just shut the door about ten minutes before that I tried the door, and the latch had caught.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you continued in the kitchen from the time you shut the door to the time that the prisoner came - A. No; there was nobody in the kitchen; the three maids were in the washhouse. I was sufficiently near to see that none of them had been to the door. The prisoner could not come in without the latch being lifted up by him.</p>

I came down, and saw a square of glass had been taken out of the parlour window. The square was big enough for a middling sized man to get through, by which they had made their entrance; and they had broken the parlour door and made their entrance into the shop. I missed a dozen silk handkerchiefs, a waistcoat, a jacket, and a pair of pantaloons. There was about four pounds of cash in the till; that was also taken; that is not in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the jacket - A. Six or seven shillings; the dozen handkerchiefs, two pounds ten shillings; the shoes, six shillings; the waistcoat, five shillings; and I lost a spotted handkercheif.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended Marks, and from Marks's information I apprehended the prisoner. The first thing I found on the prisoner was chisel, concealed inside of his trowsers. This was on the 7th of July. And this spotted handkerchief was round the prisoner's neck. I also found a knife upon him, and a pocketbook.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160037"/> Q. Do you know what countryman he is - A. A Portuguese. After that I went to his lodgings in St. Catherine's-lane: there I found a new shirt, and a pair of check trowsers.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that they were his lodgings - A. The prisoner told me they were his lodgings. He spoke tolerable English then. I had been there in the course of the day before, and the girl that he lived with told me that he lodged there, but he was not at home. I went there again after I confined the prisoner, and found a new shirt, and a pair of trowsers. I produce them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That shirt and trowsers belonged to my son. I had seen them in the shop two days before they were taken away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am quite innocent. That handkerchief and the waistcoat I bought of a lad. I came from Madeira as a sailor, and I was going away again.</p>

She said, she had just taken it of a butcher in Newport-market. She said, she had no more money, and asked the other woman if she had any money to pay for it. She said, she had not enough, only a one-pound note. The prisoner then said, she would go and change the shilling at the bu. They both went out for that purpose. I knew the prisoner, Rogers, before; that gave me suspicion. I followed her. She went to the window of Mr. Cole, a linen-draper, in the same street. They stood some time at the window. They went in. I went and got Creswell, the constable. I returned to see if they were there. I saw them there. I left the constable there. I told the constable what to do. I went home.

I opened her hand, and got the shilling from her, not knowing that she had any more; but finding her right hand clenched, I insisted upon opening that. She wanted to get towards the door, which I prevented. In the struggle she threw a parcel of money in the window. I saw her do it. I believe the money was done up in a bit of paper. I distinctly saw her throw it. The shillings she threw in the window were picked up by Smith, Mr. Cole's shopman. He gave them to me. They have been in my possession ever since. I produce them. In all, eleven.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Cole. On Thursday the prisoner and another woman came into Mr. Cole's shop. I shewed them a large medallion, with a border round it. The prisoner said, she had one like that at the door, but it had not a border. She should like to have a border. I shewed her a remnant, and I agreed to take eightpence for it, for which she gave me a shilling. I told her, I thought it was a bad one. They wished to persuade me that it was good, which gave me suspicion. I took my scissars, and marked it before them. I then threw it back, and told them, I was positive it was bad. The prisoner took it up. She offered me no other. I saw some halfpence as her hand. I asked her if she would leave that in part of payment, and call again in the morning. She refused; and while I was discoursing with her Creswell came in, and as she was leaving the shop Cresswell seized hold of her hand, and told her he wished to see what she had in her possession. A struggle ensued. He had hard work to search her. He took a shilling from her hand. She threw from her other hand a number of other shillings, among the goods in the window. After she was secured I got into the window. I picked up all I found. I think, eight shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. Had there been any shillings in the window before she throwed them - A. None; that I am positive there was not. The shillings that I took out of the window I gave to Cresswell. I gave him eight that time, and two I found the next morning. I gave him them also.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the shilling that was taken from her hand - A. That was the one I marked with an S. I saw it again directly; Cresswell took it out of her hand. I know the shilling. This is it.</p>

He tried to get my watch out, and then they shoved me against the wall. Then I found somebody's hand in my pocket. I could not tell which it was. When they got my pocket-book out they left me.

               <p>Q. You sung out, you had lost your pocket-book - A. Yes, and this man ran across the street, and ran straight up. A woman cried, stop thief.</p>

               <p>Q. You heard a bustle, and you were attentive - A. Yes.</p>

I had a little girl, who was inside of the wall, who was walking backwards and forwards. She told me, that she heard something jink like money. The child found the pocket-book. She pointed out the place to me where she stood when something came over her head. I saw her pick up the pocket-book in the garden. The child delivered it to me, and I delivered it to Hope, the officer, and the child picked up three three-shilling: pieces. They were given to the officer.</p>

            . Q. Did you, on the 5th of August, see any thing happen about the wall of the saltpetre warehouse - A. I did. I saw the prisoner walk up and down the wall of the saltpetre warehouse, with two or three others. Before they made the end of the wall they were met by three sailors. The middle sailor stopped. He was pushed against the wall by the party. In the space of five minutes his pocket-book was drawn. They released him. I afterwards heard the cry of stop thief, and the prisoner was stopped by Cormack. He delivered him into my hands. I took him to Shadwell office.</p>

He is sick a-bed. On my going out I saw the prisoner, Buzar, I asked him, what o'clock it was; he said, twenty minutes after five. It was quite light then. I returned home about nine the same morning. I lost two sheets, two shirts, an handkerchief, an apron, and a gown; some were in a basket and some were in a box. I had seen them all before I went out in the morning. The property is here but the gown. I know they are my property.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he bring any thing with him - A. Not that time. Afterwards he came down, and asked me to lend him three halfpence. In about a quarter of an hour afterwards he came in with a bag, and had the three halfpence. He went out of my house with a bag. He returned very shortly, and went up stairs. I said, is that you, John. He replied, yes, softly. I went out to the bottom of the court to get a dram for me and my wife. I met him at the bottom of the court. He said, I have been into your room to borrow a halfpenny. He said, make it up sixpence. I lent him the fourpence halfpenny. He did not return until between four and five in the afternoon. He said, take the key of my door. There was an alarm that Mrs. Kenney had been robbed. I went in his room, and found two handkerchiefs and an apron.

In consequence of suspicion I searched the prisoner. I found tea in his hat. I took out the tea. It was underneath the lining of his hat, in an handkerchief. He said, that was all. I found in his hand a glove full of tea. I desired him to unbutton his breeches, and I found a pound of tea between the lining of his breeches and his shirt. I put my hand in and found some more tea between his thighs. Altogether I found about a pound and a half. This is the tea. It is the same upon which he was at work in Cutler-street, in the city of London. It is worth about three shillings.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. What was taken first - A. One of the shawls; next, the other shawl, and then the two shirts. I missed the first about ten o'clock in the morning, and the next about half after three in the afternoon. I caught the prisoner with the two shirts about five o'clock in the afternoon, about an hundred yards from my house. I pursued him. I pulled part of a shirt out of his breeches, and Mrs. Lloyd pulled the other.</p>

Reece took up one piece of marble, and brought it to the sawyer's box, where he worked upon; he put it down. Reece took the tub and the pail, that he had water in. He took up another piece of marble, and took it to the box. Reece and Sturges met again, then Reece took the marble to put in the tub; it would not go in. He broke it and threw it in the tub. Hudson, one of my sawyers, was coming in at the gate. Sturges walked up the yard with Hudson. Reece took up the tub with the marble. I immediately ran down stairs, and desired my men to pursue him; and they caught him about an hundred yards off. He was brought back with the tub, with the two pieces of marble in; they were my marble. Reece said, he hoped I would forgive him. I told Sturges, I had been watching them for some time.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner in custody. I searched her box; I found one duplicate in her box; the other Mrs. Downes gave me.

The duplicate I found is for the napkin and pillow-cases, two shillings and sixpence, Pearts, Whitechapel. Drake is the apprentice.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any thing said to Holwell, about these salt-cellars - A.There was; I did not hear what. Mr. Holwell said, it was another case, it did not belong to the robbery of that night.</p>

            . Q. In consequence of a burglary being committed in the house of Mr. Holwell, you were led to an enquiry - A. I was, and that enquiry led me to the house of Howell; he deals in old rags, iron, and glass.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find there any saltcellars - A. I found the saltcellars in the one pair of stairs in Howell's bed-room. I found nothing in the lower part that could be identified.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went up stairs, was there any obstacle made by the wife or Howell - A. Howell or his wife, stated, that the room was not fit for us to go into. I replied, that we were married men; we had no idle curiosity to gratify. And in the one pair bedroom, these salt cellars were found. Mr. Holwell exclaimed; Oh! dear; these are the saltcellars that we have lost so long. Howell said he bought them of 
               <persName id="t18120916-76-person628">Lewis</persName>
             some months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you spoken to Howell before about Lewis - A. I had. I told him to be very cautious what answers he gave, as Lewis and Young had been suspected of a burglary. I asked, if he had seen them lately; he answered, no. Have you bought any thing of them lately? No. Have you received any thing of them lately? No. Then he stated, that he had bought them of Lewis.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he state any thing of the price he had given for them - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards inquire of Lewis about these saltcellars - A. I did; I asked him where he got the saltcellars that he had sold to Howell. He said he had taken them from Mr. Holwell's, while in his service.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said by him in the presence of Howell about them - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Howell's Defence. I purchased the salts. I gave a fair price for them. I kept these salts for my own use; on my own mantle-piece</p>

I felt some one at my pocket, which induced me to turn round; when I saw the prisoner with his hands behind his back, and on his approaching me to pass, I discovered a pocket-handkerchief in his hand. I seized the pocket-handkerchief; I thought it was mine. The prisoner gave me a blow on my head, and ran away up Chancery-lane. Mr. Bruce pursued him.</p>

            . Q. Were you walking in Chancery-lane with Metcalfe this evening - A. I was; upon his being struck by the prisoner, the prisoner ran away. He ran into Star-yard. I gave him into the hands of Mr. Dawson. Mr. Metcalfe shortly joined us, and the prisoner was taken to the watch-house. Mr. Metcalfe produced the handkerchief, which was my property. This is the handkerchief; it is my property. I never lost sight of the prisoner. He confessed the theft.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon after did you see the man - A. I saw him once before; he watched me into my uncle's shop, 21, Butcher-hall-lane; and after I lost the boots, I saw him at Hatton-garden office, before the justice. I am sure he is the same man.</p>
               <p>GOODMAN SOLOMON. I am an officer. I live in Field-lane, Holborn. I was informed that the prisoner and another were coming constantly in our neighbourhood, offering stolen goods. I saw the prisoner stand in Union-court, with this bundle under his arm. Union-court leads towards Field-lane. I went towards the prisoner, and they halloed out, run. The prisoner took to running; I followed him into Charles-street. He ran across Charles-street to the neighbourhood where his father resides, to Bull-head-court. I then lost sight of him; he chucked these boots, and upper leathers, and handkerchief, down. I knew the prisoner, and he knew me; and I know his father and mother. I picked the handkerchief up containing the boots and upper leathers. These are them.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this - A. The 17th of June, about five o'clock in the afternoon. On the 4th of August, I went to the House of Correction, and identified the prisoner. He had leave then to go to sea. I am sure he is the man that dropped the boots. I advertised to get the owner for the boots.</p>

            . I am one of the city constable. On the 22d of August, in the evening, I saw the prisoner in company with another, sounding peoples pockets. I did not see him take any thing out. I took him in custody to prevent him committing any depredations that night. On the following morning, I took him to Hatton-garden office. He was sent to the House of Correction, as being a known thief, for a month. The next day, I was passing the house of the last witness; he asked me if I had not taken two boys in custody. I told him I had; we went to the House of Correction together directly. He saw this one. Goodman Solomon said, that is the boy; I know him well. We then went after the prosecutor. The child came to the office, with his father and mother. Directly he saw the prisoner, he said, he was the boy that throwed him down, and took the boots.</p>

I told him, I wanted him to go along with me. He got up directly. I asked him to bring his bundle with him; he said it did not belong to him. I told him, he should have known that an hour and a half ago. I brought him home to my father, and fetched Mr. Fletcher, the officer, to him. The prisoner was rather intoxicated at the time.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM AUSTIN. Q. You carry fish for the fishmongers - A. Yes; the salmon was put in my cart by Mr. Stickley. I got into the cart, and moved these kits. I got out of my cart again. I had not been out of my cart five minutes. They said, a man had been caught for thieving a kit of salmon. I ran back to my cart. I saw it was the kit belonging to Mr. Stickley.</p>

            . On the 24th of August, I saw the prisoner take the kit from Mr. Austin's cart. I thought it was not his own property. I pursued him, and took him back to the cart, and a constable was sent for. The prisoner said, that Mr. Martin had sent him for the kit. This is the kit.</p>

He said, if I would carry that kit of salmon on in his cart, he would give me sixpence. Mr. Rogers followed me; he said, where are you going with that. I said, I am going to Mr. Martin; he said, it does not belong to you or Martin; directly I took it back. He did not give me time to stop and find the man. I have been led into this very innocently.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was in Smithfield on Saturday, the 5th of September; Martin, my brother officer, and I were in the fair. We saw the prisoner coming towards Long-lane. Martin said, there goes a pick-pocket. I immediately said, what, is it that old man; he said, yes. I proceeded after him from the time I first saw him to the time we took him. He walked about fifty yards; I saw him put his left hand into the gentleman's pocket, and take this glove out, which he threw down. I immediately stooped, and picked it up. I saw his hand in the same gentleman's pocket; he took out an handkerchief. I immediately seized the arm with the handkerchief in his hand, which he threw down. I immediately stooped, and picked it up. On my stooping for the handkerchief, I lost sight of the gentleman.

On<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160046"/> the 30th of July, in the afternoon, the prisoner applied three times to me for nails. On the 31st, it struck me as extraordinary, that he should want so many nails. I went to his box to see whether he had the nails, and there were none in his box, and he was not at that sort of work that he could have used them. I communicated my suspicions to Mr. Hall. Before I told Mr. Hall, I placed myself in a situation to observe the prisoner. I heard him rattle the nails in his box, and put them in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the nails then - A. In his nail-box. I walked by him; he then came out of the place where he was taking these nails I then took the opportunity of looking in his box; there were no nails left, but a few old ones, I then told Mr. Hall.</p>

            . I am foreman of the carpenters in the ordnance employ. I followed the prisoner outside of the spur-gate. I called to him, and asked him if he had heard my body or seen any body taking any nails out of the boxes from the work; he answered, he had not heard any thing of it, he was sure he had not got any. He repeated it two or three times. The last thing I asked him, if he had taken any; he said, no. I put my hand into his pocket, and took out forty or fifty. I asked him, how he could tell me that wilful lie so many times, He said, I know I told you a lie, what of that; it was only for a job he had got to do. I then took him to the clerk of the work's office, in the Tower; there I made him turn the nails out, and he turned out about five hundred. These are them; they are nails furnished by the ordnance. There are seven different sorts.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. With regard to what they swore against me; I was at work at a public-house in Princes-street, Westminster, doing a job for myself two or three days before this happened. I had occasion to buy nails for the job; and when I had completed the job, I put the remainder on his bar. He said, take them, they may be of service to you; you have got a large family. I put the nails he gave me in my basket. I went to work at the Tower, and these nails I took there, they being with my tools; some I made use, and some of those nails, the nails I had in my pocket, I found among some old sail-cloth. I certainly did put some in my pocket; I was wrong in so doing.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to the office, and get the bill - A. I did.</p>

             is an officer in that division - A. He is.</p>
               <p>Q. During your acquaintance with Breedon, have you seen his hand-writing - A. I have not seen him write often; I knew him from his birth.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Sir, is that or not the hand-writing of lieutenant Breedon - A. I do not believe this is his hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q.Take that letter in your hand - A. I think he writes a straiter character.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Lord. From your recollection of the prisoner's hand-writing, and also the hand-writing of the other clerk in the office, have you a conviction it is the prisoner's hand writing - A. I should rather take it to be the prisoner's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any doubt in your mind - A. There is a little doubt; they resemble so much alike.</p>

               <p>HENRY DORSON. I am a silversmith, not a working silversmith.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you reside in the City-road - A. About a twelvemonth ago I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I do. He is a <rs id="t18120916-85-deflabel486" type="occupation">polisher</rs>

               <p>Q. How many did he produce - A. I think three; but two I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. Cream jugs - A. Yes; I purchased two. I paid him for silver, fashion; and duty; the two came to 2 l. 6 s. I marked them, and put them in my window. I afterwards sold one to Mr. Davis, Crown-street. Finsbury-square, about eleven or twelve months ago; the other one is in my window. I purchased the lease of No. 30,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160049"/> and in consequence of the removal, I sent most of my plate to be coloured up at Mr. Field's, of Hoxton Mr. Field found out the fraud; and in consequence of his information, I got the cream jug I sold to Davis. This was the cream jug I sent to Mr. Field to be coloured up; and on my breathing on it, I discovered the stamp let in. I believe it is one genuine stamp of a smaller piece. When the prisoner sold it me, I believe he said it was of his own manufactory. I have no doubt about it.</p>

               <p>ALEXANDER FIELD. I am a working-silversmith.</p>

            . Q. Do you hold any situation in Goldsmith's-hall - A. Yes. I am the person appointed to mark and draw plates.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner or his son bring plate to your office to be essayed - A. The prisoner's son; he lives in North-street, City-road.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner frequently come to the hall - A. He has been there.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, look at that cream jug sold to Davis, has that been essayed and marked at the hall - A. It never has.</p>
               <p>Q. How many stamps do you observe upon that cream jug - A. Three; the king's head, the lion, and the letter of the year, four years ago being the letter P, for 1810; that is a genuine stamp of a bottle label. If it had been stamped at Goldsmith's hall in the shape of a cream jug, the stamp on it would have been the lion, the leopard's head, the variable letter, and the king's head.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there is not only one more in number, but the order of the line is varied; does it appear to you that the stamp has been transposed from another plate to that - A. It does. I am confident of it, and from a bottle ticket. The duty of a bottle ticket would be two or three pence, subject to the weight; and the duty upon a cream jug, would be somewhere about five or six shillings. I have seen this essayed; it is not standard fineness: it is about two penny-weights worse in the pound. There is a stamp W H, corresponding to the mark I have here.</p>
               <p>COURT. You have a plate before you, how do you get that mark - A. At the time that a workman comes to enter his mark at Goldsmith's-hall, he shews his punch to denote his work. We take an impression of it. He writes his name and place of residence; and we have a copy of the punch.</p>

               <p>Q. How far do you live from North-street - A About an hundred yards I live at Haberdasher's Alm houses. The prisoner worked for me; I employed him as a polisher.</p>

               <p>Q. Could any person perform the act of polishing without seeing this was let in - A. The prisoner might, for this reason, he is a hard working man; he will do as much work as two men; he hardly gives himself time to look; he drives away. I know that he is the most bustling man in London. I have heard that character from every body where he worked.</p>

            . Q. Did you at any time execute a search warrant against the prisoner - A. I did, at No. 14, North-street, City-road. The prisoner was just out of bed when I went into the house, there I found him. I have always understood it to be his house; I searched his house. Perks and Taunton were with me. This is the punch I found at his house. I marked it before I gave it the solicitor. I think the son was not out of bed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. Q. Do you know that he, the father and the son, lived there - A. So I understood, that the son lived with him. He told me that his son was the maker, and he was the polisher. I have always understood, that he could not make a milk-pot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am in the habit of selling goods in the silversmith line for many silversmiths. It is so long ago, I cannot call to mind any thing of the transaction; and if I had known there was any thing wrong in it, I should not have taken it to Mr. Dobson. He knew my residence; and when Mr. Dobson informed me, I told him, I knew nothing of it. It was a month before I was taken up, that he informed me of the danger. I did not go away; I staid with my family.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 15th of June, did you learn any thing afterwards - A. I understood the box was not delivered. I went to the George, on Tower-hill; and on Monday the 13th, when I came to the George, I found the box in the street, at the door of the George; two men were heaving it on another man's back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Vizer there - A. Yes; he was in the tap-room.

He told he me, had got the box now; it was all right. I went away then.</p>

On Friday I sent a man to Chamber-street, to let the man know the box was there. In about a quarter of an hour afterwards, on the Friday, I saw the prisoner; I shewed him the box; he acknowledged it was directed to him; he said he had got no advice of it. Then, on the Saturday evening, a person of the name of Griffin came, and called for a plot of ale. On the Monday following, about a quarter after ten, the prisoner called again with a letter. I delivered him the box in consequence of the letter. I delivered it to Vizer, and the soldier he got to carry it.</p>

When I went into Mr. Vizer's room, I told him I wanted him, and I asked him where the box was that he had from Tower-hill, with the gun-barrels? he put his head out of the door into the passage and said, there they are in the yard. I asked him if he dealt in them? and what he had given for them? he said he had not bought them. Miller and a gentleman came; they took him in custody.</p>
               <p>MR. STOKES. Q. You belong to the ordnance. Are them gun-barrels the property of the ordnance - A They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the ordnance sell rejected barrels - A. Not unless they sell them at public sales. These are not rejected; they are good barrels.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew Griffin - A. Yes; he had been master of the proof-house about eight months. These barrels are the property of the king; they are worth 5 s. each.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, and gentlemen of the jury, on the 13th of June I received a letter from Mr. Finch, stating, that a box was left at his house, supposed to contain some gun-barrels. I said to the person that brought the letter, that I had not ordered any of any body, not had I received any advice. I said the same to Mr. Finch as I did to the messenger. I received a letter from Griffin, saying, that he had sent thirty-seven gun-barrels; he would call on the Saturday night to know if I would have them. He did call. I told him, no; I did not want them. I saw no more of Griffin. After Griffin left my house, my wife informed me, that when I went out to be shaved he returned, and wished me to fetch the box, as Mr. Finch wanted it out of the way. I went, and had the box pitched in my yard. The letter I received from Griffin, I gave to the officer as a proof of their being sent not to my order.</p>
               <p>COOMBES. This is the letter the prisoner gave me voluntarily. The letter read:</p>
               <p>="Sir, you may receive a box, containing seventeen India muskets, and plenty of short ones, by going to the George, Tower-hill; and if you do not want them send me word; if you do not send to me I shall call on the Saturday night. I am, sir. Direct, to Wm. Griffin, Proof-house master, Lewisham. Addressed to Mr. Vizer, Chamber-street, Whitechapel.="</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I told him that his wife had pledged a watch, and it was the watch that was lost. I sent for an officer; the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160051"/> ran away. I called, stop thief; he ran about two hundred yards before he was taken. I have kept the watch from that time till now.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is the watch I lost; it is mine. I am not sure where I lost it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found the watch in the open road, Bromley. I took it home, saying, I had been fortunate by finding a watch. Being a poor man, my wife pledged it for one pound. I am innocent of any felony. The prosecutor knows me; I had not seen him for more than a week before he lost the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know the prisoner; he bears a very honest character.</p>

He could not find any thing to answer the description; and then he went round the shop door; and said, Sir, there is a gown gone from the door. I had never left the shop at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was that after the prisoner had left the shop - A. About seven or eight minutes; I immediately sent him in search at a neighbouring pawnbroker's. He found it at Mr. Bradley's. I am sure it was within the door,</p>
               <p>MR. BRADLEY. I live about twenty doors from Mr. Hulme. About two o'clock in the afternoon, on the 4th instant, the prisoner pledged this gown for five shillings. I am positive to the prisoner's person. I produce the gown.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were you at that time - A. I was in my room; it was near twelve o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in your bed-room - A. Yes; at the Fox. First I heard a noise at the door. I had been a-bed three quarters of an hour. The master gave me orders to let a man sleep with me, that he had given leave; the prisoners forced themselves in after I had let the man in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your master gone when the prisoners forced themselves in - A. My master was in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the man to sleep with you - A. A coachman. When the prisoners came in the coachman flung himself on my bed; and Mackdonald flung himself upon me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mackdonald before - A. Yes; he had slept in the room above me four months or better.</p>

               <p>Q. Mackdonald threw himself upon you - A. Yes; and Smith himself upon him. They put the bolster near my face, and they used me ill.</p>
               <p>Q. In what respect - A. With their hands, beating me on my side. I took a stick to defend myself; they took it away from me the second time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they take any thing away from you - A. My watch, and my purse.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your watch - A. Under my head under the bolster. My purse was in my left hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not any of your clothes on I suppose - A. No; only my shirt. They turned out the room the minute I missed the watch. I felt for it; I could not find it. I got a light, and could not find it then. I dressed myself and went into the street, and got the officer of the night; they came in and searched. My purse was found in Mackdonald's hat, and the watch was found in the yard, hid under an ale-barrel. I was present when the purse was found in Mackdonald's hat.</p>
               <p>Q. What money was there in your purse - A. There was no money in it. I had no money about me that night.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew Smith and Mackdonald before very well, did you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When they came into your room, was there a light with them or not - A. They brought a light with them.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you had a full opportunity of seeing who they were - A. Yes; they lodged in the room over me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any quarrel between you and them - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember somebody knocking at the door - A. Yes; Brown opened the door after the master ordered it.

            . I keep the Fox public-house, Islington. On Sunday night, the 30th of August, I lit one of the prisoners and the man Brown, out in the yard to go to bed. The stairs that leads to their apartment has no concern with the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You lit Mackdonald and the coachman out into the yard, that they might go into their apartment - A. Yes; Smith went out before. In about half an hour I bolted the passage door; I and my wife and family we went to bed. We had not been in bed half an hour; we heard three going up stairs, and in about five minutes they returned down stairs. Mackdonald, Smith, and Stockings, (it is a nick name) they returned down stairs; saying, that Brown would not open the door to let him sleep with him. I saw Smith and Mackdonald on the stairs. I called to Brown twice, to open the door, from the landing place; he opened the door. I said to Smith and Mackdonald, whatever you do, do not go into his room. I said, that is the reason he would not open the door for the man that was to sleep with him; because you were near the door. Mackdonald was in the habit of using Brown ill; I had seen him do it frequently. I then went to bed, and bolted the passage door. In the course of an hour I went to sleep; I was awoke again by a knocking at the door. I got out of bed and opened the passage door; there I saw the constable of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160053"/> the night, and patrol, and watchman, standing with Brown on the staircase. I asked them, what was the matter. Brown said, they have now taken my watch from me. The prisoners were in bed at that time. We went up and searched the premises; we found the purse in Mackdonald's hat. I put on my things, and went up stairs. I said, Mackdonald, rise yourself, what have you been about; he said, nothing. I said, you have, and you are sensible of it. I asked Mackdonald, where was Brown's watch. He said, he knew nothing of it. Then said I, how came Brown's purse in your hat. He said, he knew nothing about the purse. I then said, how came you in his room, after I so strictly told you not to go; directly upon that, Brown came into the room with Mackdonald's hat. Mackdonald said, what do you want with my hat; you shall not have my hat. Directly the officer came up stairs, and secured him; and then called Smith. Smith got up without any abuse; the constable, patrol, and watchman, took them to the watch-house. They returned back again to search for the watch. I stopped on the stairs until they returned, to see that nobody went down stairs until they returned. We then proceeded up stairs, four of us, we searched all the rooms; we found nothing. In the yard, I saw the watch shine under an ale-barrel, which stood in the yard; the officer picked it up. Brown said, it was his watch.</p>

               <p>Mr. Arabin. Mackdonald had been accustomed to larking with Brown - A. Yes, and beating him.</p>
               <p>Q. Mackdonald was taken in custody in his room - A. On the landing place He was following Brown down stairs. His clothes were brought him; he was dressed on the stairs, and then taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>THOMAS IZZARD. I am a patrol, belonging to Bow-street office When I came into the room, Mackdonald and Smith were asleep. I awoke both of them. I told Mackdonald, Brown had lost his watch, and I insisted on having it. He made use of very profane language; saying, that he knew nothing about it; I might o to hell: he laid down again. I proceeded to search the soom; I said to Mackdonald, how came Brown purse in your hat. He said, he knew nothing of the bag, nor how it came there. Brown had not been near the hat before I found the bag. We took the two prisoners in custody. I went down stairs along with the constable of the night; we made Mackdonald dress himself on the landing place. He swore, d - n his eyes, if we took him to the watch-house; and if he did go, the first time he came out, he would murder Brown. After we had taken him to the watch-house, we came back again. We made a search. We afterwards found the watch. I have had the watch in my possession ever since. The prisoner, Smith, was very willing to go to the watch house; he never said a word. Mackdonald was very much out of humour.</p>

            . I am a constable. I and Izzard were together. I have heard his account, it is correct. I have nothing to add to it.</p>
               <p>Mackdonald's Defence. On the 30th of August, I was acting as waterman, at Seaman's house; there came a gentleman, he called for a dozen bottles of wine between some gentlemen, Smith, and me. Thomas Stockings, the post boy, came and asked to sleep there that night. Mrs. Seamen said, he might sleep with Brown. Mrs. Seaman said, as you are going up stairs, you can shew Stockings the way up. I went over to the Pied-bull; there Smith and me had two or three glasses of peppermint. Smith and I, when we came back, found Stockings standing on the stairs. I went down to Mr. Seaman; I said, he will not let the man in. Mr. Seaman called to Brown, to open the door. Brown opened the door, he had a mop-stick in his hand. He said, you shall not come in here. I said, I do not want. Stockings shoved my face against Brown's face; he threw himself on the bed. I said, give me my handkerchief; he picked up my handkerchief, and put it in my hat. I was charged to go to the watch-house. Brown came up stairs, he had my hat; I said, what do you want with my hat; they said, if I did not like to go to the watch-house dressed, I should go naked.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. I was in bed asleep. I was intoxicated.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. to White. Brown opened the door for the coachman to come in - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a broom stick in his hand - A. No, he had not. The door was fastened with a stick; he put the stick by his bed-side. He did not hold it up to Mackdonald, and tell him he should not come in.</p>
               <p>Mackdonald called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

They desired me to shew them some cambric muslin. I shewed them some; they bought a quarter of a yard. A lady came in while they were looking at the muslin; she desired me to shew her some flannel, and while I was shewing the lady the flannel, I saw Williams, as if she was drawing something up under her dress. I suspected that she had taken something. They bought a quarter of a yard of cambric muslin. Smith paid for it. They went about two doors from our shop; I followed them, and desired them to come back, and when they came in the shop, Williams dropped a piece from under her dress. An officer came in, and they were taken in custody. This is the piece, it is five yards, worth about eight shillings. It is my master's property.</p>

               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that the prisoner was in liquor or not - A. I could not perceive that he was in liquor; the time the prosecutor got up to go home, he said, Windham, I am going home, are you. I said, yes; directly the prisoner got up, he made a great racket with the table; a rummer stood on the table, and two or three pots; the prosecutor said, do not do any mischief at this time of night. The prisoner put his left arm against the breast of the prosecutor, and with his right hand the prisoner took the watch out of Eagleton's pocket; then he tried to conceal it by grappling it up between his sleeve. The prosecutor caught him by the collar. Then he threw the watch down on the stones, and the glass was broken.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. It is my watch, and it is the watch that the prisoner took from me.</p>
               <p>Q. He offered no violence to you - A. No; he put his left arm against me, and instantly drew my watch out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at this house, and this young man, and six or seven came in, and played at domino's. I got up and was going out; I bid them good-night. That young man said, he had lost his watch. I said, they should search me, and under the table they found the watch. They said, I put it there.</p>

I keep the wheat-sheaf public-house; on the 14th Lyons came in with Kennett's wife, he was with her about two or three hours; Kennet came in and they had a quarrel about Lyons being with Kennet's wife. On the 15th, Lyons came in and asked for a glass of gin and peppermint; I served it him, he had it and went to sleep; he slept until a quarter past three. Kennet came in about half past one, he called for a pint of porter, he drank that and called for another; he said, Who is that lying on the bench asleep? Kennet went out directly he came back again; he had a knife in his hand when he returned; I did not see him stab it until I saw the blood come from Kennet's hand.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Sunday night, the 23d of August between nine and ten, I saw the prisoner at the bottom of Holborn, he appeared to be alone; I watched him. I saw him sounding peoples' pockets; he went up Holborn; when he got near Leather-lane he put his hand in Mr. Tipper's pocket, and drawed the handkerchief out; he then put the handkerchief into his right-hand pocket; I then catched hold of him, and called to Mr. Tipper, told him he had been robbed. I took the prisoner into the porter's lodge. Furnival's Inn, and searched him, and found this handkerchief in his right-hand pocket. I have kept the handkerchief ever since.</p>

I then saw him return back after Mr. Crossland; he was coming towards the city. The prosecutor on the middle of London-bridge was looking through at the shipping, and the prisoner drawed part of the handkerchief out. He then followed the prosecutor to the corner of Monument-yard; the pipes being up, and a crowd to pass, made some little obstruction. The prisoner there

               <p>Q. Did you occasionally sleep in the house - A.Either me or my servent hardly ever missed sleeping there, for protection to the house. I now reside in Edward-street, Cavendish-square. This house, in Upper Berkley-street, I generally let furnished. It was uninhabited at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. On what night was the house robbed - A. On the 7th of November, 1810. On the morning of the 8th we discovered it.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night of the 7th did you sleep in it - A. No, nor my servant. I intended to sleep there again, but on that night it did not suit my convenience, and it was left without protection. I believe the other man that was tried for this burglary was Thomas Robinson, he was capitally convicted.</p>
               <p>Q. On what time, on the 7th, were you at the house - A. About half after eight in the evening; it was then dark.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time did you leave the house secure - A. I did. I double-locked the door. My house was then safe. On the next morning I went to my house at half after seven. I received information that it had been robbed. I went and found the door a jar, and the people that surrounded the door went in with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Altogether, what did you lose - A. A carpet, four feather beds, seven blankets, two counterpanes, and six window curtains.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value - A. The value to me, altogether, was seventy pounds.</p>
               <p>JOHN FARR. I am a watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning of the 8th of November did you apprehend the prisoner - A. I did, just at seven o'clock in the morning. It was day-light then. It had been day-light about half an hour then. I apprehended him in Short's-gardens, near Drury-lane. He had a bed upon him very carelessly tied up in a blanket, and seeing it was a new bed, and a new blanket, and he not a porter, it gave me suspicion. I asked him, where he came from. He said, he brought it from No. 5, Wardour-street. Where are you going to take it? To No. 6, King-street, Drury-lane, to Mrs. Glover. I said, you will not take it to Mrs. Glover this morning. I do not think you came honestly by it. I guarded him to the watchhouse. The watchhouse was very full, and the watch were relieving. He laid the bed down on the table. He was sent out with me to go and enquire of Mrs. Glover. He took to his heels, and away he ran. I could not catch him. I never saw him since that morning, until I saw him in Marlborough-street office. I am positive he is the man. I know his father and mother. They live opposite of me, and I had known the prisoner some time.</p>

These things were claimed by Mr. Wilkins the next day, and they were delivered up in this court, on the trial of Robinson, the other man. He was brought to our watchhouse a fortnight afterwards. I am sure the prisoner is the same person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would wish to ask Mr. Baxter if he has not been convicted of perjury since - A. No. I have never been convicted of any crime.</p>
               <p>Q.to prosecutor. Were the bed and the blanket delivered up to you here - A. Yes. I am sure they were my property. The bed was worth ten pounds, and the blanket, found on the prisoner, five shillings.</p>

               <p>JAMES HANNAM. I am a porter in Messrs. Pickford's yard. On the 23d of July I was placed in the loft, in the warehouse, to watch the prisoner. I saw the prisoner break open a chest of soap. He took a cake of soap out of the chest. His wife came with his breakfast. She kept watch while he was doing it. She said, Thomas, make haste, you will have somebody come. He said, do not be in a hurry, He knocked the tin plate off a hogshead of sugar, and took out, as near as I can guess, twelve or fourteen pounds weight of sugar. He came to his wife with it. He asked her, whether she had brought a basket: she answered, no. He seemed quite hurt because she had not brought the basket. He went so some lump sugar that we had tied up in the accompting-house: he untied one of them and broke a great lump off it; he delivered the soap and sugar to his wife, and she went away with it. He went to the accompting-house and got some nails out of the desk: he took up one of the small weights and nailed the chest of soap up again. He went to the hogshead of sugar and nailed the tin plate on again: he put the weight down in its place again; he tied up the lump of sugar again, what he had broke a piece off; then he sat down and began his breakfast.</p>

             HAWKINS. On the 23d of July,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160058"/> Mr. Holbrook came at an early hour for an officer. The prisoner lodged in Fleet-court, Fleet-lane. I went there in company of one of Mr. Pickford's men. I searched his room. I found two quantities of moist sugar, and a little bit of lump sugar, and about three or four pounds weight of soap, and a quantity of allspice and ginger that is not in the indictment. I left the prisoner in the custody of Prestow.</p>
               <p>- PRESTOW. I am an officer. On the 23d of July I went, in company with Hawkins, to Pickford's warehouse. I took the prisoner to the Compter while Hawkins searched his apartment. After Hawkins came back it was said to me, that they missed a great quantity of earthenware. I went to the prisoner's lodging. I found twenty-two dishes. I took an inventory of them: thirteen small ditto, thirteen large ditto, three white dishes, seventeen coffee-cups, and fifteen saucers, a large bowl, and four jugs. They are all here.</p>
               <p>Q. to Holbrook. Had you any sugar in your warehouse - A. Yes, and soap. I have a sample of the soap, and of the sugar. I believe the soap produced, and the sugar, to be my master's property, and all the earthern ware. We have two crates of this ware. Half of one crate is gone, of the same pattern with these now produced.</p>

            , Union-row, in the city of London. On the 8th of June the prisoner brought two pieces of dimity. I bought them of him. I gave him ten-pence a yard for them. I afterwards sold them to a person at High Wickham. On the 15th of June, Armstrong and Norbury called at our house. I produced to Armstrong the dimity that I had bought of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were acquainted, for the first time, that the dimities had been stolen - A. Yes: and in consequence of directions I stopped the prisoner on the 15th of July; he came with a piece of calico, as a sample of twelve or thirteen pieces more. I desired the prisoner to bring the remainder by three o'clock. He came about half past three, and I gave him into Armstrong's custody. He told him that the two pieces I had bought of him were stolen, and I gave the two pieces of dimity into Armstrong's possession. I am sure that the two pieces of dimity I gave to Armstrong were the pieces I bought of the prisoner.</p>

            . I am an officer. In consequence of information from Stevens, I went to Mr. Pedley's, in company with Norbury.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the last witness deliver to you two pieces of dimity - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the delivery of the pieces, how long after did the prisoner come in - A. About three quarters of an hour. I told the prisoner that they were the two pieces that he had sold to Mr. Stevens; they were stolen. I asked him, how he came by them. The pieces were then laying on a drawer. He said, he had bought them of a man of the name of O'Hara. I asked him, if he had any bill of them. He said, no; and if he knew where to find O'Hara. He said, no. I then told him, as the things were stolen we must take him to Worship-street office. I took him there, and the two pieces. I took the thirteen pieces I have now in court. I produce the two pieces of dimity.</p>
               <p>- NORBURY. I can swear to one of the pieces of dimity, having my mark on it, and the other to the best of my belief. I am sure one of the pieces of dimity I sold to go to Mr. Emson. It is worth about three pounds.</p>

               <p>JAMES SHEWSBRIDGE. I am a journeyman smith. I work for my brother. On the 5th of June last I went to the prisoner's house. I went there between five and six in the afternoon. My brother had an order to make him two racks, a trivet, and a spit. I carried the things to Doland's house. I found the prisoner in the front parlour. I presented the things to him. I fitted them. He said, sit down. I gave him the bill. The amount was three shillings and sixpence. This is the bill. He took a pipe and some porter. He asked me to take a pipe. I remained with him until eleven o'clock. He was not out of my sight five minutes.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 24th of March last did you carry any parcel to the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes. The parcel contained to the amount of two hundred guineas, in guineas, half-guineas, and seven-shilling pieces. I weighed them myself, and put them in four paper parcels, fifty in each. I delivered them to Hitchinson. They were directed to John Silvester, 33, Goswell-street, London. I saw the prisoner by the Broad gate. I there delivered them to him, the parcel, so directed. I told him, if that person did not satisfy him for his trouble, my father would. That is all I said to him. He said, very well; that is all right. I went away, leaving the parcel with him. He was standing in the street.</p>
               <p>JOHN SILVESTER. I am a butcher. I live in Goswell-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, very well. Towards the latter end of March I received a letter. I saw the prisoner pass the door on a coach. I called him. He came into my shop, and asked me if I expected a parcel from Mr. Wicks, of Coventry. I told him, no; I had no advice whatever to expect any. He said, he had some recollection of receiving a parcel, but he was not certain. He was rather malty. I told him to enquire of Mr. Wicks, whether he had or not. He said, he would. In two days time I saw him again. He said, he had been to Mr. Wicks. I am not certain whether he said they were not at home, or Mr. Wicks was not at home. Two days following the coach stopped at the Maidenhead, Goswell-street. He put a passenger down. I asked him, whether he had made another enquiry. He said, he thought it must be nothing but a letter, or else he must have heard of it, I understood.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Do not tell us what you understood, tell what he said - A. I cannot. He gave me sixty guineas in a bag. I gave him bank-notes for them. I bought them by weight. Some were light, and two or three that were heavy. I am not able to recollect the conversation between him and me.</p>
               <p>Q. I will endeavour to remind you what he said. Did not he tell you, when he first got down, that a passenger got in the coach at Highgate. He saw the packet was safe at Daintry, that he had taken up a stranger at Highgate, and put him down at the Three Cups. He searched for the parcel, and could not find it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160060"/> Q. How long was it after he brought you the sixty guineas - A. That must be the latter end of March, or the beginning of April.</p>

The chaise was sold publicly at the cross-roads. I then came to Paddington, the White Lion; and after riding the mare up and down the road, I sold the mare to Mr. Jenkins, for fourteen pounds, and gave him the receipt, that I had just bought the mare. I am deprived of putting my trial off. I had lived with my master from fifteen to eighteen months.</p>

             lives next door to where I do. He has the house there himself; and I have seen Humphreys pass.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 15th of September did you lose any property from your lodgings - A. Yes. I lost a black bombazeen bag, containing a purse, with two three-shilling bank-tokens, and ten one-pound notes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Price to be in the room with you - A. He came about half past nine in the morning. Humprhreys was with him. He came to remove a sofa-bedstead, and during the time that he was with me, he told me that he had two shillings<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160061"/> to pay the porter, to carry the bedstead. I told my daughter to fetch my purse. She did, and I asked him to change me a one-pound note. He said, he could not. I said, I remember I have some silver. I gave him a three-shilling bank-token. He was to send me a shilling in by Humphreys. I then laid my bag down. I asked him if he would remove the drawers into the place where the sofa was. I left my bag in the room, on the table. I went out of the room. Price came out and assisted the man in removing the drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. The drawers were not in that room, were they - A. No, not in which I then was.</p>
               <p>Q. You then all went out of that room - A. Yes. Price might be about a minute in that room after I left it. Humphreys went out first, I followed, and then Price followed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you went into this room where the chest of drawers were - A. Yes. Humphreys went first, and I followed. Price entered into a conversation with me, respecting the drawers, and during this time Humphreys had not time to take the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first miss your purse - A. After the men left the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss it before Humphreys returned with the shilling - A. No. He did not come in. He gave it to my daughter. After that, a person called for a small bill, about five minutes after the prisoners had left my apartment a person called for a small bill. I then called for this bag. The mistress of the house with whom I lodge, she locked in every part of the room, and could not find it I then went immediately to Worship-street office for an officer. There I gave my evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. You say Humphreys brought back this shilling and gave it your daughter - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you remained after they went out - A. In the same room where the sofa had been, and where I laid down my purse. Humphreys returned with the shilling, and took the remaining part of the sofa, but he did not go into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been while Humphreys was away the last time - A. I had been in the same room. I did not quit the room any more than a minute. I was in sight of the room the whole time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any one gone into the room - A. No. My little daughter was remaining in it the whole time.</p>
               <p>Q. Price and Humphreys came to you upon some business you sent your daughter for the bag, in which bag was a purse - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Price wanted two shillings to pay the porter, you took your purse and laid it on the table in that room, where you got in conversation with him about a pair of drawers in that room; you went out of the room, and Price followed. You are quite confident that you left the purse on the table - - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Were the drawers immediately removed into the room - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did it take - A. Not more than half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. But during the time that the drawers were removing, where were you - A. In the other room, in the front room.</p>
               <p>Q.Could any one during that time go into the room where the sofa was, without your seeing them - A. No person could go into the room, I am confident.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you he sure that no one went in the room - A. The person with whom I lodged can prove that she was in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not any person go up stairs, and go in without your seeing them - A. No. There is no servant there, only the mistress of the house. A person called for a a small bill, which was the occasion of my missing the bag. I went to Worship-street immediately.</p>
               <p>Q.Was any thing found upon the prisoners - A.Not any thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. You knew the prisoner, Price - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You took out your bag to pay him the two shillings for carrying the sofa - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was the room where the drawers were to be removed - A. One door is opposite of the other. Price and myself were together in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, whether you can at all times command a view of that room from where the sofa was taken out - A.Before the drawers were removed, and the drawers were put where the sofa was, my daughter was in the room the whole time.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Humphreys and Price were in the room half an hour, how much of that time had gone when you paid the two shillings - A. Price had scarcely finished taking the sofa to pieces when I put the three shillings down.</p>
               <p>Q. He remained a full quarter of an hour taking the sofa to pieces - A. No. Humphreys came back the second time, and took the remaining part of the sofa, and he brought me a shilling. When Price went away, he said, Humpreys, I shall not return again, you can bring the rest away, and bring the shilling back.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you asked him to remove the drawers you had paid him - A. Yes. I had the bag on the table. I took out a three-shilling piece. Humphreys went first, and I and Price followed. Knowing the man, I felt no hesitation in leaving him in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is your daughter - A. My daughter is five years old. I left her in the room.</p>

               <p>Q. Might not she have played with it, or have throwed it out of the window - A. My child, if she had seen any thing belonging to me, she would have taken care of it. She would not have played with it, or have throwed it out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get the ten one-pound notes - A. I received them in change at a linen-drapers, the corner of Chiswell-street.</p>

               <p>Q. At that time she had not missed the bag - A. No; she was in the front room then, not in the room with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before she came into the room with you after they both were gone - A. She came in after he went from returning with the shilling, then she came into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. You had done washing up the tea-things before Price and Humphreys went away - A. No, I did not. When I had done washing the tea-things up I took them into the pantry.</p>

               <p>Q. Who came to ask for any money - A. A girl came for a little money; she told me to go and take it off the table. I went and missed the bag.</p>
               <p>COURT. You first was sent by your mamma to get the bag, which was in the drawer; you got it. - You saw her give the three-shilling piece to Price - A. Yes; she put it on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. She put it on the table. How large is the room - A. A good sized room.</p>
               <p>Q. After this time you were washing the tea-things, you observed the bag laying on the table - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice whether the purse was there or not after Humphreys, your mother, and Price, went out of the room - A. No, I took no notice.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, when you had done washing up the tea-things you carried the tea-things into the pantry - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went with the tea-things into the front room - A. No, I took the tray into the pantry; then I came back into the back room before my mother came to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You were in the front room when the person came for a small bill - A. Yes; I was then shaking the cloth in the pantry; and then my mother sent me into the front room for the purse. I told her, it was not there.</p>

            . I keep an upholsterer and broker's shop in Crown-street, Finsbury-square. I have known Mr. Price near three years. This last three years I have trusted him with three hundred pounds, and would trust him with five hundred. His general character is honest and industrious. About three weeks ago, Mrs. Greatwood said, Mr. Price has lent me an old sofa which was buggy; my husband could not die upon it. She put her hands together and said, I will never forgive him so long as I live. I will have revenge. Her little girl, over and over, said, Oh, how can you say so.</p>

That is not true. I told her I was extremely angry. I said, I did not think I could forgive him; that is all I said. I owned him no spite. I thought no more of it afterwards. My little daughter is here; she could say, whether I felt angry. I never said I would be revenged.</p>

I was returning homewards about a quarter after ten, in the morning part, I met the prisoner coming out of my shop, carrying away my pot before him. This is the pot. The pot was within the shop, under a table; it was within the shop for sale. After he had gone one hundred and fifty yards from the shop, I called to my wife, and, from her information, I pursued him. I asked him, what he was going to do with the pot? he said, it was his. I told him, it was mine, and I would take him to Marlborough-street. The prisoner said, do not keep me here among a mob of people; take me away somewhere. I gave him in charge of Cobham, the officer, and I delivered the pot to the officer.</p>

               <p>MR. BEALE. Q. I believe you are cashier in the house of Meux, Reid, and Company - A. I am. They are brewers in Liquorpond-street. The prisoner was a clerk in their employ.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it part of his duty to receive money on their account - A. It was. He was the principal clerk in that department; to receive money he was.</p>
               <p>Q. When he received the money in what mode was he to make the entry - A. In the money journal.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that money journal, 14th of February, in the present year. Is there any entry of the receipt of fifty-five pounds four shillings and sixpence, of Captain Smith - A. No, none on that day, nor on any one day there is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the book in which he should have made the entry - A. Certainly. If the entry had been there it was his duty to pay the money to me, and I should have put my initials in that money journal, and then the entry would be transferred to the ledger.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever received that sum of money of the prisoner - A. No, I am quite sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this was the prisoner sent for from Portsmouth - A. He was, about three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that occasion was he charged with having received sums that he had not accounted for - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, upon being so charged, tick a list of sums of money he had so received - A. This is the list he gave to me, a list that he had by him, of his own hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that list include the sum in question - A. It does include the sum of one hundred and seventeen pounds seven shillings and sixpence, of Captain Smith. The sum in question in this and other indictments.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the partners in your firm - A. I do. There are nineteen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did not you communicate to him, that if he would let you know the sums that he had received he might pay it when he could - A. Certainly not.</p>

             was a servant to Mr. Willan, at Whetstone. He was in the habit of coming for oats that he wanted for Mr. Willan's horses, at Whetstone; and on that day he came for some oats. I measured for him twenty-four sacks of oats. The sacks were produced by him.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of oats were they - A. Black and white oats. I delivered them to Dutton, for the purpose of giving them to the horses belonging to Mr. Willan. The cart was brought back the same night. There was four sacks deficient.</p>

            . I am a printing-ink maker, living in Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday, the 25th of January last, did you see a cart loaded with sacks, containing something, in Smith-street, Clerkenwell - A. Yes. I supposed the sacks to be loaded with corn. The cart was driven by a man of the name of Dutton. I saw a small jockey-cart drawn up by the side of it. That jockey-cart, I believe, was driven by the prisoner. I was some distance at the time. I believe the prisoner to be the young man.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see then done - A. Dutton immediately got out of his cart, and took four or five sacks, (four sacks I am sure of), and put them in the cart, driven by the prisoner. Dutton delivered them from his cart to the prisoner's cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon this your suspicions were rouzed - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the name on the cart - A. I did not. I went out for the purpose of taking the name. I could not do it without being noticed. I went to the Turnpike gate, and gave notice to the toll collector. He told me the first cart coming was Mr. Willan's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You do not mean to say now, that you are sure that the prisoner was the man that drove the jockey-cart - A. I believe he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is this ago - A. Last January.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it from the time that you saw him in the cart to the time you saw him in custody - A. I think I saw the prisoner before he was in custody. The prisoner came to my house in company with two others, to know the description of himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he go and ask you, whether you thought he was like the person that took the oats, hearing that you had an imputation upon him, and you said, no - A. No. The question that was put to me was, they wished to know the description of young Crane. They knew where he was. They knew where he was working; and if I knew Crane they would go and take him. I told them, I had nothing at all to do in it; it was Mr. Willan's concern, and if I could give the description of young Crane, they could take him that night, as they knew where he was at work. I told them, they should go and enquire of Mr. Willan. I had nothing to do with the business.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after Crane had been reported to be the receiver. Again I ask you, whether you did not say, that the person who spoke to you was not the person that you supposed to be Crane, he was some inches taller - A. I said, he was about his height. The prisoner had a drab great coat on, and held his head down.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that to be the prisoner - A. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160065"/> believe it to be so, by the manner of his conducting himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did they come to you - A. At my own house in Goswell-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you were under any alarm at that time - A. It did not look well for three men to come up; one of them with a thick stick. If I had interfered I dare say I should have had my head broken. I believed him to be the man, but I did not intend to run any risk.</p>
               <p>- HEATH. I was the toll-collector in Goswell-street in January last.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember being applied to by Mr. Colvill for looking at the names of two carts - A. I do. They were coming towards my gate. One of the carts belonged to Mr. Willan, loaded with corn, and another small jockey cart of the name of Crane upon it, Hampstead-road, drawn by a poney.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was driving that cart - A. The prisoner. I believe the prisoner to be the man, but he is very much altered in his dress. He had a velveteen jacket on at that time.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Willan.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go by the direction of Mr. Willan, after the cart drove by Dutton - A. Yes. I overtook it at Finchley, by the Bald Faced Stag. I brought Dutton and the cart back to the Bull and Mouth. The cart then contained twenty sacks of oats, and one sack of bran. On the next day I went into Crane's premises, Camden Town, Hampstead-road. I found in Crane's stable about two bushels of oats, which is now here, and there was some in the manger, which the horse was then eating of. I believe them to be the same oats, as near as I can tell oats. I compared the sample of oats with those in the granary, and they answer to the sample exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Dutton was in the service of your master - A. He was. He was in the habit of coming to town for the oats that he wanted for the horses at Whetstone and Barnet.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Smith-street, Clerkenwell - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>JOHN CLARK. I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 14th of September, between twelve and one at night. He was coming out of the Bedford Arms. I catched hold of Crane by the collar, and Hale, the constable's son, knocked me down, and I pulled Crane; and when Hale found he could not extricate Crane from me another man came up. I never had so much trouble in taking any man. The prisoner made all the resistance he could. He said, nobody would have taken him but me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you, on the 1st of April, purchase a bale of the Company's raw Bengal silk, for Messrs. Phillips and Co. at Leek, in Staffordshire - A. I did. The weight of the silk was one hundred and forty-eight pounds. I paid for it two hundred and thirty-eight pounds and eight-pence. I ordered my man to take it to the White Bear, in Basinghall-street. Messrs. Pickfords sent to me several days afterwards. I then found it was lost. I went to Messrs. Pickfords. My correspondents told me that the bale had not arrived. It was to go to Messrs. Phillips and Company, Leek, in Staffordshire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Mackray's lodging in Maiden-lane, Wood-street - A. I did. I was there shewn a parcel of silk in a bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the sort of silk that you had packed up to go by Pickford's waggon - A. Exactly similar to what I had bought for Phillips and Company, marked C. L. signifying the city of London; and under that is a dot, 1207, there is M, then a stroke under that 12, and under it the letter E, in capital. I believe that is the East India Company's mark. All silks that come from Bengal must be sold by the Company's candle. I could not swear that the silk produced to day was a part of that silk.</p>
               <p>- PORTER. I went with the last witness. I cleared two bales of silk from the India-house, and afterwards I took them to the White Bear, Basinghall-street. The bales were directed to Phillips and Co. Leek, Staffordshire. This is the receipt. (The receipt read.)</p>
               <p>- GROSVENOR. I am book-keeper and porter at the White Bear, Basinghall-street. I signed that book for an acknowledgment of the receipt of these bales.</p>

            . I am a silk-weaver. On the 5th of April I lived in Maiden-lane. On the 18th of April last the prisoner brought me a sample of silk. He told me he was very much distressed for money. He wished me, if it suited me, to purchase it, or to lend him twenty pounds. I went that evening to the prisoner's house with twenty pounds, and agreed to take forty pounds worth of silk. I went on Monday, and took twenty pounds worth of silk from his house in Montague-street, Spitalfields, and on the next day I took twenty pounds worth more. I gave him twenty shillings a pound; forty pounds for the whole. I afterwards sold the silk to Mackray for fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you a bill of parcels given you by the prisoner - A. I took the first away without. Finding it would not answer the purpose, I asked him for a bill of parcels, as I should have to sell it. He said, as you have got to sell in you ought to get something by it. The bill of parcels is made out at thirty-two shillings a pound, but twenty shillings was the price.</p>

            . I am a silk-broker. I met Mr. Mackray, I think, on the Saturday this took place. He shewed me a skein of silk. He said, he could not afford to sell it for less than thirty-two shillings, which I thought cheap. I immediately took it to Daintry and Rye, the first in our line, and they only offered me thirty shillings for it. I took the skein away, and going up Trump-street I saw the advertisement of this felony. I was persuaded it was the same silk, but no man can swear to silk. I went and shewed it to Mr. Beardmore. I told him I had got some silk that would suit him exceeding well, but I had some doubt how it was come by; I must look into that first. I went to Mackray in Maiden-lane, and desired to know how he came by it, as I had some suspicion of it being stolen. He told me he bought it of Hammersley. In the evening I saw Hammersley. He told me he bought it of the prisoner; he either gave twenty-four or twenty-eight shillings, I cannot say which; one or the other, upon my oath. I then told him, the prisoner must be seen. I sent for Mr. Nalder. Mr. Nalder, and a constable, Mackray, and myself, went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160067"/> to the prisoner's house. I went up stairs, and he came to me I went up stairs. There are looms in his manufactory. He is a narrow weaver. The prisoner seemed much agitated in seeing me. I took that agitation to arise from this, because I appeared against him before. I then said, I am afraid you are again in a bad thing. He said he was not. I said, I have seen some silk at Hammersley's, which he says he bought of you Does he, said he, and what price did he say he gave for it. I said, either four or eight-and-twenty, I did not know which. His answer was, he only gave twenty. I told him, I had the City marshall with me. He said, you know I have been true to my word once, and I will be so now. I hope you will not take me up. I said, be honest, and I will not. I then advised him to let the whole of it fail upon the right shoulder. I did not see him from that day until I saw him in custody.</p>

How it was taken I cannot say. On the 27th of July the prisoner brought a forty-pound note to our shop, and bought some cloth. I gave him the difference. I wrote upon the note myself. I know he offered that note in payment for three pounds fifteen shillings. I saw the note afterwards. I knew it was the same note.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know whether you lost it or he took it. You did not see him hearing the preaching, did you - A. No.</p>

               <p>Allen and Moreing's Defence. We beg leave to trouble the court with this written statement, and submit to his lordship, and the gentlemen of the Jury, that we are charged with a robbery. If false witnesses come in a court of justice, who can stand against them. On that day we had been to Bow-fair. We got in company with two girls of the town. We went with them, and laid ourselves down to sleep. Shortly after the door of the room was broken open, which much alarmed us, Allen having been absent from the regiment that day, was fearful of being taken to the guard-room. Finding this was not the case we ran down stairs. The prosecutor and his wife are of the most disgraceful stamp. Smith and his wife keeps a house for the prostitution of women, and Bilby is the same description.</p>

Mrs. Castle opened a cupboard, and in that cupboard I found these thirteen copy-books. I apprehended the prisoner on the same night, as he was coming across Hackney fields. I told him he was charged with taking paper belonging to the East India Company. He said, he had taken the books there, and they were perquisites. They were outside sheets.</p>
               <p>MRS. CASTLE. Q. You keep this school at Finchley - A. No. I attend there occasionally. These books were there, in the cupboard. I gave them to the officer. Who took them there I do not know.</p>

I met them at the foot of the stairs. I said to them, you told me that you were going to stop all night. They made answer, they were going to fetch their bedding; they should not be long. They never returned; I lost a pair of sheets, two gowns, two shirts, two shifts, and two shawls. They took the things away on the Thursday night. We missed the things on the Saturday morning.

            . I was the person that helped Mrs. Clarke to put these things in the cupboard, on the 13th of August, at night. I wanted to go up stairs to see who was in the room; my husband would not let me. I saw the man prisoner come down stairs with a bundle. I saw both the prisoners go dow stairs; and I am sure I saw the man with a bundle. The things were not missed till Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>- I am an officer. I apprehended the man prisoner. I searched him; I found a duplicate on him, and this knife. I went and took the woman prisoner. I knew her of old. The man said, it was not him, it was his wife. The woman said, her husband did not do it, it was her.</p>

They came in the passage; there is only one passage to both dwelling houses. The door of my parlour leads into my shop. That door had a padlock on.</p>
               <p>Q. If I understand you right, they came into your passage, and broke open the door that leads into your shop - A. Yes, that door was fastened with a padlock. I found the staple drawn.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you leave the shop - A. Between eight and nine. I did not find it out until the morning, at seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, from between eight and nine at night until seven in the morning, you cannot tell when it was done - A. No; when I came at seven in the morning, I found the staple drawn. I went to Bow-street, and got an officer. We searched the house I live in; we found none of the effects there. I lost eight pair of boots, seven pair of shoes, and some leather.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 4th of August, I apprehended the prisoner Bull. Limbrick and I searched him, and found a duplicate of one boot, pawned at Mr. Lamb's, Stanhope-street, Clare-market. Mumford was in company with Bull. He said, that Bull had sold him a duplicate of a pair of shoes. Bull was present when he said that. I took him in custody, and went to the office, that is all I know respecting Bull. On the 7th of August, I apprehended Mackdonald. He ran away from us; we got him afterwards. I took him to the office, and searched him. In his pocket I found this centre-bit, and the model for making it; and a gimlet in his pocket. At his lodging I found the stock for it. The centre-bit is so high tempered, it will cut through iron. He had a new pair of shoes on his feet; I took them off. I went to find out his lodging. A little girl came out of the door; she said, I know whose shoes they are. They are my uncle's. I said, I wanted to know where he lived, for we wanted an old pair of shoes for him. That little girl went and shewed me his lodging. I searched his lodging; I found one boot hanging up, and another in a basket; they were both new boots. The one that is in pawn is the fellow to this one. They sent a one legged man to pawn it.</p>

I searched him; in his pocket I found this duplicate of a boot, pawned for a shilling at Mr. Lamb's, Stanhope-street, Clare-market. On the 8th of June, he told me it was a duplicate of a waistcoat; I and Mantz and Mumford was there at the time. Mumford said, he had given him a pair of shoes to pledge on the 7th of June. I and Mantz went in pursuit of Mackdonald; we were sitting in a public-house waiting for him. When he came in I laid hold of him; he struck me a violent blow in my mouth. He escaped for that time, and ran from the house; we pursued him. He was stopped in Exeter-change; we brought him to the Brown-bear in Bow-street.

I asked him how much I was to give for it. He said, six shillings. I gave him one shilling, and part of a pint of porter towards it. The next time he met me, he asked me for the remainder of the money. I told him, I had not got it. He said, he must have the boot, he could make more money of it.

            . I am a porter. In June I was at a public-house with Bull; he told me that he had a ticket of a pair of shoes, pawned for four shillings. He told me, if they fitted me, and I gave four shillings more, I should have them. I went with him to the pawnbroker's. I tried the shoes on; they were too little for me. I paid the interest, and left the shoes behind.</p>
               <p>Mantz. I produce the boots and shoes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These are my shoes; I can swear to them. This single boot is part of the property I was robbed of, and so are the boots found in Mackdonald's room.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of all the things you found - A. Sixteen pounds. Bull told Mumford that he had taken a sack of boots, shoes, and leather.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mumford. What did Bull say to you - A. Bull said, if he had known that I wanted a pair of shoes, he could help me to a pair, he had plenty. He did not say where he got them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Do you sleep in the house - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Bull's Defence. I will say no further than the truth The tickets of the shoes and boot I had on purpose for these men. The man whom I got them from, I did not know where he got them.</p>
               <p>Macdonald's Defence. To this hour I never had the misfortune to be brought to a bar of justice; for this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160071"/> reason, I never deserved it. Where the boots were found was not my lodging, I only called there to have a little washing done. I am acquainted with a number of men in the coach making trade.

The next morning, between seven and eight, my servant awoke me, and inquired whether I had removed the portfolio? I said, no, and told him to inquire of the waiter, and the chamber-maid. The portfolio was not to be found by that inquiry. It was found afterwards, but not by me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner lived with you - A. Ever since last Christmas. When I left the Indies he came to England with me.</p>
               <p>MRS. SMITH. My husband is a hair-dresser. The prisoner came to our house on Monday week. I was going to get this man to a charity-school, to learn him to read. I went with him; and as I was going with him, he took a note out of his pocket. He asked me if it was one pound? I said, no, it was a ten pound note; he folded it up. He said he had it of his master to buy some things: we returned to our house. He came again, about half after eight o'clock in the evening; he brought a portfolio, requesting it to be taken care of until the morning. We took care of it, not having any suspicion. The next morning, when I had heard what had happened, I delivered it into Mr. Beretto's hands.</p>
               <p>MARGRET SMITH. I received the portfolio of the prisoner: I locked it up. He desired me to take care of it. It is the same portfolio that my mother delivered into Mr. Beretto's hands.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any nankeen - A. I did not. I afterwards made another search with Captain

            , the two prisoners, and Bushel; this was between eleven and one. We searched in the hold, and in the hawl-up-deck. I told the prisoners I had found the papers that wrapped up the nankeens. We found the papers in the gun-room.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoners - A. White was an officer of the excise, and Best is an officer of the customs. They were sent there to take charge of the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. You found nothing on that day - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, how much nankeen ought to be on board - A. I cannot say. There ought to have been seventeen chests in that ship, and there was one missing.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the contents of nankeen - A. Generally an hundred pieces. On Monday we searched again, Captain Saunders, Mr. Harwood, and Brown and Bell. I only searched on the gun-deck. I was present when two pieces were hauled out from under the half-quarter, on the starboard side; they were in a bag, and the bag appeared to be a birth-bag; it had a broad arrow mark upon it, and two letters. It was concealed behind the pinnacle, in some ballast which had been knocked down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that spot where the nankeens were found any body's birth - A. No; but abast Best's, the custom-house officer's birth. The prisoners were both there when it was found.</p>

               <p>Q.Where was that part which he described he had nailed a piece across - A. In the hawl-up-deck.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it known to White what the subject of that search was - A. Undoubtedly it must. We searched in the hawl-up deck, and in the hold. We searched the aft part of the hawl-up-deck, in the gun-room, which is part of the hawl-up-deck.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the hold completely searched - A. No; by no means completely searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether you searched between the main-mast and the pump-well - A. Not particularly; it was superficially searched on the Saturday. Nothing was found on that day, except the packages; there were a great deal of lumber and no people to move any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did White make any observation during the time - A. There was a hole through the bulk-head into the gun-room, which had been stopped by a board, and nailed over.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any person have access to where the nankeens had been deposited, through that hole - A. No; there was no regular way through; they might have got through that way. It was stopped at another part; there was no communication. The nankeens were in the hold; this was on the deck. They said they had nailed it up themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend the search on the Monday - A. I did; both the prisoners were present while the search was making that day. There was a pretty good search on that day; and, before the search began, it was known that the seventy-two pieces were in their possession. I did not hear it first from them. I asked them both if they had found the seventy-two pieces. They said they had found it near the pump-well; that they had taken the opportunity of the people being at breakfast to hand them up the hatch-way, and conveyed them to their cabins, as a seizure, on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160073"/> Monday. Clark reported it to me. I went to the spot and saw them taken out; when they were taken out, White and Best were present. It was at a place close to the bulk-head; at a place where the seventy-two had been deposited. I asked them where they found it, and where the remainder could be. They told me they had got them up the hatch-way; no one saw them take them up.</p>
               <p>MES CLARK. I am in the employ of the East India Company; I was present when the nankeen was found. I found it, as described, in the cabin that Best lodged in; both the prisoners were there before I hauled them out. When we came on board, Best asked me what we were come to do? I said, to look for the nankeens, He said, he had seventy-two in his possession, and he hoped they would be all found.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any more pieces found - A. There were four pieces found afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 14th instant, in what parish were you - A. In the parish of Harrow.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Kempton in the parish of Harrow - A. Yes; I left home at one o'clock in the day. I went across the fields.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had you got from home before you were overtaken by any body - A. I had walked about two miles, therefore it must be about half past one.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you overtaken by any person - A. By this person.</p>
               <p>Q. What person do you mean - A. The prisoner; I am quite sure he is the man. When I was just going out of the field, I saw a man entering the field; as I went through the gate of the field I held the gate with my hand, seeing him so near. I did not turn round to look at him. I had not gone many steps from the gate before he caught hold of my arm; he did not speak. He dragged me down; I begged he would not hurt me. I said I had money about me; I would give it to him. He told me to hold my tongue. I screamed out. He said, blast you, I will murder you. He kneeled on my stomach, and with one hand he held my throat; I pulled the hand away from my throat. Then he put that hand into my mouth to prevent my screaming. Several times I dragged his hand from my mouth and throat. I bled at the mouth a great deal. He tore my gown to get at my pocket. He took a silk knitted purse, containing a two pound note; a dollar; a three shilling piece; and one shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. When he had got them what did he do - A. He then dragged me round upon my face, and left me instantly. I never saw him leave me.</p>
               <p>Q. You were a good deal overpowered and overcome with this - A. Very much; I could not speak. I walked back to the gate, but fearing he might be gone that way, I went towards Edgeware.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see the prisoner - A. Not till last Saturday. I have not the smallest doubt he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you - A. I am the daughter of a farmer; my father lives at Kempton.</p>
               <p>Q. It is about two miles from Kempton to Edgeware, and you had got about half way - A. I had got rather better than half way.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS CHAPMAN. I am a constable of Stanmore. I apprehended the prisoner in a stable, at the Crown in Stanmore, last Friday evening. On the next day he was taken to Miss Sims, and as soon as she saw him, she exclaimed, you are the man.</p>

He inquired for Mrs. Butler, a woman he formerly lodged with; he owed her a few shillings, he was to pay her. He said he had some boots he left there when he left his lodging. Mrs. Butler is my wife's sister; she came into the shop. He said, I ran after you to pay you. She said, I am going home; they both went out. He came into the shop a little after one.

            . I am a carpenter at Mill-hill. I saw the prisoner twice on the 14th of September. I saw him twice from a quarter before two, to half-past two. The last time I saw him he was asleep in Upper-lane; I awoke him. Two mile from Hendon church, I passed him with my wheel-barrow. The first time I saw him was before two. I ascertained the time by Mr. Justice Le Blanc's carriage passing. I asked the coachman the time, he told me.</p>

                  Richard

             - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Gegg and the prisoner come to your house on the morning of the 17th of September - A. They did. About seven o'clock in the morning, one of my men servants let them in, and I gave them the key of the warehouse, and I went into King-street. I returned in about ten minutes there, with a customer, and on my going into the warehouse, I observed Rogers skewering a wrapper which I supposed contained straw.</p>
               <p>Q. Is straw one of the perquisites that you allow to your porters - A. It is; I let him finish what he was about; after he had skewered it up, he threw it on a pack of calico. I thought then it was straw only. He went down stairs about his work; and when he was gone, suspicion came across my mind. I looked into it. I took it from where he put it, and trod upon it; and heard the sound of paper. I opened it, and found a piece of worsted cord wrapped up in paper in the centre of the straw.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the length of it - A. Twenty-eight yards three quarters, the value of it is 6 l. The prisoner was not there when I opened it. I put the goods where it was before, upon the pack of calico. I called him, and told him to call Gegg, the other porter. They both came up. I then asked the prisoner what there was in that straw. I then called the other porter, Gegg, to look at the straw in the prisoner's presence, from whence he pulled the piece of worsted cord. The prisoner seeing it, he then asked for mercy. He said, it was the first piece that ever he had stolen. I told him it was the first piece that ever we had found, and asked him, how many more he had taken. He said, it was the first, and asked for mercy. I told him he must be punished, and placed the other porter between him and the door, to prevent him from going out until I had served a customer; and then I sent Gegg for an officer, to whom I gave the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose dwelling-house is it - A. It is my dwelling-house; the other partners do not reside in the house.</p>

            . I am foreman to Messrs. Baldy and Watson, coal-merchants, Bell-alley, Coleman-street. On the 5th of August, I was at 24, in the Poultry. I saw the prisoner and another person with him go into Mr. Butler's shop. I saw the lad handle a parcel of black stockings on the counter to shew them to the prisoner; and the other man went to the window where there were some white silk stockings: and during the time he was at the window, the lad had his back to the prisoner. The prisoner took a pair of black stockings from off the counter, and put them into his hat before the lad could turn round. He put his hat on his head. I went to the Compter to get some person to take him; I saw nobody. I waited until the prisoner came out; I then went into the shop, and asked the youth, whether they had bought any property.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were in the shop when you went in - A. Only the youth. I told him what I had seen. I went and stopped the two men. The prisoner made use of terrible language, and offered to knock me down. He said, d - n your eyes, I have no property. The two men separated, and the one that I had no suspicion of, he delivered up a pair of white stockings to the shop-boy. I knew the other had black ones. I had not seen the other man take the white ones. I suppose he got them while I was gone to the Compter. They both went away into Grocer's-hall-court, and then into Grocer's-hall-yard. I knew the place, and then I thought they were secure. I bolted them in the yard. The beadle came to assist me; the other man made his escape after being let out. I traced the prisoner for ten minutes after that, and when I got into Basinghall-court, I saw a ticket porter. I knocked the prisoner's hat off. The stockings were in the hat; I gave them to Ward, the constable.</p>

            . I am shop-boy to Mr. Butler. On the 5th of August, the prisoner and another man came into my master's shop; he asked to look at some black and white stockings. I opened them several parcels, and while I was shewing them black stockings on the counter, he desired to look at some white stockings in the window. I went to the window to get them to shew him them. They looked out two pair of stockings; but when I told them the price, they said, they were too dear. They went out of the shop without buying any thing. They had scarce left the shop, when

            . I live at No. 2, White-horse-alley, Cow-cross; I am a silversmith. On the 14th of May last. I went to the house where the prisoner lodged, in Fleet lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner - A. A coiner. I found him at home, and his wife. I asked him, if he had got any paper, which I had spoke to him about before. Paper, forged Bank notes. He said, the party would be in town soon. I asked him, when he would let me have a pound's worth of shillings; he promised to meet me on the 19th of May, at the Red-lion, the corner of Plum-tree-court, Shoe-lane On the 19th of May, I went to the Red-lion, according to appointment. When he came in, he said, he should have been there before, but he had been busy finishing some money for people that attended the market soon in the morning. He and his wife, he said, in fact. He pulled a dirty rag from his breeches pocket, and gave me thirty-one shillings and six sixpences in paper; and I gave him a two pound note. He went and got change, and gave me twenty shillings in good silver. We drank a little gin together, and we left the house together.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the silver after you received it of him - A. I gave it to Hancock, the officer. I gave the very same thirty-one shillings and the six sixpences, that he gave me for one pound, I gave to Hancock, the officer. The other twenty shillings I kept myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner afterwards - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other acquaintance with the prisoner than for that purpose you have been speaking of - A. No; only for notes and money.</p>

             the thirty-one shillings and six sixpences. I have had them ever since. He delivered them to me on the 19th of May. This is the parcel. I apprehended the prisoner after that. I think, on the 15th of July. There was an appointment made to meet him in the county at my desire. I met the prisoner at the Red-lion, Red-lion-street, Clerkenwell. I cannot exactly say the hour me and Herbert had agreed. I received information that he was gone out of the house. I followed him, and overtook him in the confines of the city. I told him, that his wife had fell down, and sprained her ancle; on purpose to get him in the county. I then searched him, and found the money I had given Herbert upon other occasions; and I found upon him a great quantity of bad money, shillings, sixpences, some three shilling pieces. I found twenty-seven counterfeit shillings, a cast pewter dollar, one metal Spanish dollar, cast. I also found upon him a stick, it had been described to me before; there was a little black grease stuffed in a hole in it. I also found a little quill that he picked it out with. He admitted the transaction of the 19th of May; he could not deny it.</p>

I saw them on the examination; they were much brighter then than they are now. They were new coloured, as if they had not been in circulation before; and I saw the stick on the examination. I firmly believe, that it had the composition which is used by coiners, on purpose to take off the freshness of the silver colour, to make it look as if circulated; and I saw all the unfinished money that Hancock produced on the examination.</p>

            . On the 25th, I went to the prisoner's mother's room, No. 12, Parker's-lane, and at the back of the grate, the brick had been broken away, or had burnt away. I found some coals had been put on there. I looked behind the fire, and found these seventeen dollars. Mrs. Dawson said, she should know one of the dollars, it was marked with a jackasses foot, or a T. This is that dollar. I think it was the mother that induced the poor young creature to do this action. I said to the mother, are not you ashamed to bring your daughter into this. She then said, she must suffer for it.</p>

When the prisoner had been with me about ten or eleven days, I missed some of my property, a piece of lace. Some days afterwards, in the night, I heard a noise. I rang the bell; she came and said, she heard somebody over head, getting in at the trap-door. We had the watchman in. She had been up the ladder, and in coming down she fell; she seemed very much hurt. I sent for a surgeon; he attended her four days, and she kept her bed; and after a few days, she got up early in the morning, ran away, and left the door of the house open. In about a fortnight after, she sent me a letter; desiring her wages, and her box. I should have paid her her wages, if she had come herself. In about three weeks, I learned she lived with Mrs. Barton. I went to Mrs. Barton's, and a servant that lives with me now. The prisoner opened the door to me; she appeared to be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160078"/> agitated, and Mrs. Barton hearing me, called me up stairs. I went up stairs to Mrs. Barton. I observed a cap and handkerchief of mine on the prisoner. I charged her with taking them; she replied, she wondered at my taking the liberty of coming after her. I told Mrs. Barton, in the presence of the prisoner, that I suspected her of taking my things. Mrs. Barton said, she had seen several things about the girl, that she suspected did not belong to her. Mrs. Barton went into an adjoining room, and brought out some caps and handkerchiefs that had been made out of my dress. I knew the muslin. I went into the room where Mrs. Barton went, and out of a drawer, I took out a shirt; it was one that I had given to my sister. I asked the prisoner, whether she would give me up the other things, before I sent for an officer. She denied that she knew any thing about it. An officer was sent for; he made a search in my presence. The prisoner wished to go up stairs; he followed her. I did not go up stairs.</p>

I took the duplicates from her, and the money, and two keys, from her pocket. She said, one of the keys belonged to a box she had in Homer-street, Paddington.

I asked her what she had got. I observed a large stone bottle in the basket, and the liquor in it was rum; I am sure of that. She said she had nothing at all. I told her I was an officer, and with violence I took the bottle from her, and I put it down on my right side; she came round my left side and gave the bottle a kick, and broke it all to pieces. I afterwards picked up the pieces of the bottle. I produce two pieces of that bottle; Northumberland-street, Strand is one of the pieces. I made inquiry, and that inquiry led me to Mr. Morris. I searched the prisoner, and took her before a magistrate. I took some duplicates from her; she said her name was O'Donnel. I looked at the duplicates, and said, it is Pullen.

Going along, he said, he had got the copper out of the brickwork; he wanted to take it to the braziers to have it tinned; he helped me over the wall into the house, in the dark.</p>

She had been out of place: she brought them for an acknowledgment. The prosecutor took my husband up and confined him. Me and my husband kept a booth at the fair, and these knives were publicly used in the booth.</p>

I found the prisoner Newton there; I asked him who the timber belonged to; Evans was with me; he asked him for the master of the premises; he said it was him he supposed we wanted, he was the master sawyer, his name was Newton, and the planks he said came there a day or two back.

I drawed them close to the saw-pit. About twelve o'clock he employed me to take twelve planks to London.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe twelve planks are two pieces cut up - A. Yes. I delivered them in a yard in Hatton-garden.

            . Q. What day was it you went to Hatton-garden - A. On Saturday, the 24th, in company with Mr. Brockelbank, about eleven o'clock in the day. When I went into the yard, I asked for the master of the yard; the prisoner said he was up stairs, pointing to a little loft; he was called by some person, and as he was coming down the prisoner said, perhaps it is me you want.</p>

               <p>COURT. Had he heard you say before upon what business you came - A. No; he said, perhaps it is me you want; I am the master sawyer. I then pointed to this timber, laying on the saw-pit; it was cut into twelve planks. I asked him to whom that belonged; he said to him. I asked him who he got it of; he said he did not know the person. I then told him that the timber had been stolen, that I was a police officer, and he must consider himself in my custody. He then said he had it of a man of the name of Flowers, who was a sawyer.</p>

I don't recollect that he did; and asked him to sell some timber for him; Flowers said the timber belonged to a man in distressed circumstances, a little timber merchant in the Deptford-road. On the twelve pieces of timber I found on the premises in the saw-pit, they had the mark there a T upon it, and a P. I think it has an entire mark, which I cut off on purpose of producing on the former trial.</p>

He told me that he had a friend that had a large quantity of it in the Deptford road; he could not get a customer for it, therefore he must go to the King's Bench in a short time. I asked him if any of it was fit for Venetian blinds; he said some was, and some was not. I then told him I was in the habit of working for a person that used a great deal, if he would call on him he lived in Gray's inn lane, perhaps he would buy some of it. He asked me to buy it. I asked him the price; he said he could not tell then, he should see a friend of the owner of the timber, and he would call and let me know. He called the next day and said, his friend said the timber cost twelve pound a load; he told his friend I kept a yard. His friend said, if I could make it convenent he would satisfy me for the room, and for the selling of it. He then told me, that his friend would come along with it, and set a price to the timber himself, if I would consent to it; I consented. The next day, as I was coming from Greathead's yard, I met this Flowers at the corner of Baldwin's-gardens; he told me the timber was at the bottom of Holborn-hill. I told him we should be at the yard by the time the timber got there. As soon as the carman brought the timber to my house, Flowers said, here is my master<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160082"/> with it. The carman, Hoads and I, unloaded the timber and got it in the yard. I then asked him how many feet there were of this timber: he said, eighty-three; I set it down on a piece of paper. He said he had made a mistake, there was eighty-four feet; then I altered the figure. The lowest, he said, was ten pound a load, and sixpence a foot superficial. He then told me he would send the remainder to make it up three load the next day: and, if I could sell it, he should be glad: he wanted money very bad, and he expected to be arrested as soon as he went back. The carman, and he, and I, and Flowers, went and drank two pots of porter, and they went away. The next day, about three o'clock, the carman, Mr. Brockelbank, and the officer, came; I was sharpening my saw before they got to the saw-pit; there were four of them. The carman asked me if Mr. Norden was in the shop. I called Norden to come down; he answered me. I asked the officer whether he wanted Newton or Norden. I told him I was the master sawyer. He said, he hoped Mr. Newton and Mr. Norden would behave like gentlemen; I said by all means. He then asked me whether I had not some timber come in yesterday; I pointed to the timber, and shewed him where it was. He said that timber is stolen; I told him I did not know it. He asked me where I got it, or whether it was mine; I told him I did not know the proprietor of the timber; I knew the man who solicited me for yard room for the timber, his name was

He then asked who this man was that I called the proprietor of the timber; I told him a jolly faced man, with sandy whiskers. Mr. Brockelbank made answer, we have got him. They sent for a cart, and I helped to load it; I went with them to the Thames Police. I never saw the man but when he brought the timber, and before the magistrate, in my life.</p>

On the 16th of September I came to town very late, after the men had left their work; I brought home a strange horse, that had never been in the stable before; and in the manger, among some horse-cloths, I found a bag of flour concealed in the manger; I throwed it into an adjoining wash-house. I wrote upon a bit of paper:

             was watching at the window; he saw the prisoner come in; he went into the stable; saw a strange horse there; he went down to the bottom of our premises, and looked found to see if any body was up; he went into the wash-house, and brought that bag of flour which I have described; he took it into the stable; and, from that time to this, we never could find it. When the officer came, he acknowledged to having taken it out of the wash-house into the stable. I am confident he took it out of the wash-house; we kept a constant watch at our windows to see that nobody went out. I asked the prisoner, what he had done with the flour that he had concealed in the stable. He told me that he had taken it for fig-dust to Colonel<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160083"/> Ponaonby's house at Hampstead, and finding his error, he had brought it home and concealed it in the stable; and, the morning we apprehended him, he had taken it and emptied it in the big drawer in the shop. We searched for the paper I had wrote upon, and did not find it; he said he took the bit of paper and tore it in pieces on the horse dung.</p>

I went to pay the money if he would change a pound note. I took my book out of my pocket; there were no women in the room; there were two men there, one was a blind man.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to accuse this woman of taking the notes, when there was no women in the room - A. I do not say that she has robbed me of them. I have traced the 20 l. and 10 l. note to her. I asked her how she came by them, she said a strange man came in and bought fifty pounds worth of goods, and gave her the notes; he brought his own cart and took the goods away. I am sure she was never in the room; she never stole them from me.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 25th of July, I was going down Saffron-hill. I saw the prisoner and another man with a large bundle. They were in Field-lane; I was in Saffron-hill. I saw them go into a house, where they bought things of this kind; I followed them. It was about half-past two o'clock. I went into the back room; I there saw the woman of the house looking at the coats. I asked her who brought the coats; she said she did not know. I told the men, I knew they had brought them there. They said they did not. I took hold of the two men; one of them tore out of my arms. I kept the prisoner. I saw him with the coats before he went into the house.</p>

               <p>Q. What day of the week was it - A. I rather think it was the seventh; it was on the Monday. In September I was in <placeName id="t18120916-168-crimeloc905">Bartholomew-fair</placeName>

When I went into the fair I had a bill of exchange of twenty-one pound, ten shillings and four pence, and an eighteen-penny stamp paper, in my pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that you had it when you set off from your own home - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in the fair, when any thing happened to you which induced you to suspect your pocket had been picked - A. About an hour. When I got out of the mob, I felt in my pocket and found my pocket-book was gone. There was a great mob by Bartholomew coffee-house, just by the Hospital. I was very much crowded there, and when I got to Long-lane, the end next to Smithfield, I felt in my pocket and missed my pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, being in the crowd, were you able to distinguish the person of the prisoner. - A No; I do not recollect seeing him.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you ever see your pocket-book again - A. No; I saw the bill of exchange and stamp paper since, in the hands of the constable; his name is Hutchins. I knew the bill of exchange when I saw it again.</p>
               <p>- HUTCHINS. I am a constable of St Luke's, Middlesex. I took the prisoner to custody for stealing a watch on the 12th of September. I found in the room that he lodged this bill of exchange, and the eighteen-penny stamp paper. I took him out of bed; in that room there were two young women, one was in bed. I knew it was his lodging; the landlady said it was. I rent the bottom part of that house. I knew that was his room; I have seen him there all hours in the day, and night likewise. I found the bill of exchange and the stamp paper under a tumbler-glass on the mantle-piece. One of the young women constantly lived with him there, and has done for three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other young woman, who was in the room, lodge in the house - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing, to him about these papers - A. I asked him whether they belonged to him, he said, they did. I asked him what he called them; he said, waste paper. I then took him in custody. I was not in the fair at the time he was there. I afterwards shewed them to Mr. Green; he claimed them.</p>
               <p>JAMES MILLER. I am an officer of St. Luke's. I was present when the prisoner was apprehended. I was with Hutchins. We took him in bed. I was present when Hutchins found the papers in the same room, under the glass on the mantle-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know his person before - A. I cannot say I did.</p>

             before at all - A. I have heard of him, my husband being in the trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know his person at all, until you had heard Featherday represent him as her husband - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You made the bargain with her for four shillings and sixpence a week - A. Yes; and the next day they came into the place as man and wife together, between nine and ten o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you mention to him the terms that you had let the room to his wife for - A. No; no further than respecting the rent that I expected.

               <p>Q. Where was it that you made the agreement - A. In their own room, in the two pair room; they paid me regular, and kept good hours.</p>
               <p>Q. If any other men came to the room to sleep there, was it unknown to you - A. It was unknown to me; I would not have permitted it; for I had no benefit in it.

               <p>Q. Did you hear or see him coming home pretty often - A. I dont't know that he had any meal at home, except a breakfast or a supper, to the best of my knowledge, together.</p>
               <p>Q. Except the time he was out at work, did you ever know him to be absent a week together - A. I could almost take an oath, that he was not absent a night out of my house. I was in the habit of going into the room to borrow a pair of bellows, mine being at the mender's, therefore I was a true judge that he was there.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160089"/> Q. Do you think if the room had been a resort of different men, you must have known it - A. I must I can take an oath that it was not suffered, nor would have been suffered by her husband. I am very confident that different men did not come.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolplus. The woman took a lodging of you - A. Yes; but the next day I went and saw her husband. I related the circumstance to him myself: the circumstance of the agreement; and I did see Collard the next day in his own room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the only time that you bargained about the lodging - A. That was not the only time; I had to go up to him about the rent; chiefly he paid me.</p>

His wife was a little distance from him; a man came up and pushed his wife against the wall; and pushed against Goodwin, and almost knocked him down; and another man was behind me; he drove against me, and almost drove me down. He made a pull at Goodwin's small-clothes, which I supposed to be at his watch.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see whether he drew his watch or not, did you - A. No; I saw no face, but an arm, that passed. I said to Goodwin, good God; where is your watch; he says, in my pocket I said, be so good to feel; he felt down his small-clothes, and missed his watch immediately. I said, there are the two men, run down the court. One had a brown coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you should know either of these two men - A. No, I could not swear to their faces; one had a brown coat on. I saw none of their faces. On the next day, a person brought another watch to Goodwin.</p>
               <p>ISABELLA GOODWIN. Q. What did you see of this transaction - A. It was on a Friday night; Mr. Goodwin, and I, and Sarah Holmes, were coming home; I saw two men in Grub-street, in a chandler's shop, and I saw two men behind us in White-cross-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing happen after you got into Checquer-alley - A. Yes; after we got into Checquer-alley, one shoved me against the wall, the other pressed me against my husband and Mrs. Holmes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after a man had pressed against your husband and Mrs. Holmes, that you heard that your husband had lost his watch - A.Not a moment.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of the men - A. Yes; the next morning I saw the prisoner at the watch house, about eight o'clock; I pointed him out; I said, that is the man that made a snatch at my husband's pocket; there were more people with him at the watch-house, and I singled him out. I saw him snatch at my husband's pocket; I did not see him take any thing out; I am positive he snatched at something; I am positive he is the man; I cannot swear that he stole the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. This woman, that was to sleep at the house with you, says, that some person brought another watch to your husband; did they - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the prisoner - A. No, the prisoner was not there.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160090"/> Q.Was he alone, or in company, when you saw him - A. He was first of two men, one was about two yards behind the other; he was the first coming out of Checquer-alley. I was against the alley, with the light in my lanthorn. I saw both their features, as they came out of the alley. I stood there and Goodwin came up to me; he said that he had been robbed of his watch. The men had got nearly out of my sight then. I did not pursue them; I was sure it was useless.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you present when the prisoner was apprehended - A. Yes; I took him out of his bed in Checquer-alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Out of this Chequer-alley where Goodwin said he had been robbed - A. Yes; and the other man used mostly to sleep in a house in the alley, close to where the prisoner lodged. I did not find the other; we searched the house, he was not there. I was present when the prisoner was under examination. Mrs. Goodwin saw him when he was under examination; she said she knew he was the man; she was positive then.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw the prisoner immediately after Goodwin had been robbed - A. Yes, immediately; Mr. Goodwin had been gone down the alley about two minutes before these men ran up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the other man - A. No; I have not been after him. I have not power to take him.</p>

            . Q. Do you live in Checquer-alley - A. I do; I am servant to Mrs. Thornton, No. 3, Checquer-alley; she keeps the house. At the time of this robbery I was in White-cross-street. The first I saw was in White-cross-street. I saw the two women and the man opposite Playhouse-yard, and they being so tipsy, the watchman asked to see them home; he held the lanthorn up to the woman's face. The woman said, do you know me full well. Yes, he said. I returned down to my own door; I stood a few minutes; they came down. They asked me if it was Checquer-alley; I said, yes. They stood against the wall in the alley. They were so tipsy they could not support themselves scarcely. The wife said something to her husband; he seemed angry. He said he would strike her. I had not stood there many minutes, before there came a man with a light coat and a stripped waistcoat; he took something from the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see a second man - A. No, there was only one man. He went up the court, running into White-cross-street; up came another man, with his coat buttoned and his hands in his coat pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same man that robbed him - A. No, another man.</p>
               <p>Q. That was five minutes after the robbery - A. Yes; they had not called the watch till after that man passed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you call, watch - A. No; I did not know until the man said he had lost something.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see him take something - A. Yes, but I did not know what it was. The woman asked him if he had his watch. He said, no, that man that passed me has taken my watch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Have you been in court while this trial has been going on - A. I have been out of court; I have not heard a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Then another man came up the court, the wife said to her husband, have you got your watch? Did this man that came last run - A. No, he did not run at all; he walked by him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, when this man came by with his coat buttoned, they said they lost the watch - A. Yes, they did; it was as much as five minutes, a minute over or under.</p>
               <p>Q. Did two men, at any time, come into the court together? Did two men ever go out of the court together - A. No, they did not. The man that took the watch from him had a light coat on; the other man had a brown coat on. The man with the white coat did run.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, what house do you live in - A. A lodging-house.</p>
               <p>Q. For such ladies and gentlemen as frequently come in Chequer-alley - A. The price of a room in that house is from a shilling to three shillings; I have lived there six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at all - A, I know him by passing and repassing through the alley. I have spoke to him once or twice, that is all. I never ate or drank with him, or sat in his company.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the woman that was here just now, Fetherday - A. No, I know nothing of her; I never kept company with her.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160091"/> Q. Have you any sort of connection, either direct or indirect, with the prisoner - A. Never, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw two persons in the alley together, during the time you were there - A. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Could any two persons, together, have gone by you, from the time the man was robbed, until the second man made his appearance - A. No two persons could have gone by without my seeing them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him to live in the alley - A. About a month.</p>

               <p>Q. You thought him an inhabitant in the alley, did not you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him come home regularly - A. Yes, some evenings, and then it would be two or three evenings, and sometimes a week. He used to go down the alley to a lewd girl; that was not a constant home for him; he used to go with other women. I am perfectly sure he did not live there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you know this lad was in custody - A. The next morning after the watch was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you applied to to come here - A. I have not told any body.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to know it - A. I went to the top of the alley; the watchman asked me if I knew them both. I said, I did not know the first that robbed the man, he was an utter stranger to me; the other young man that came out about five minutes after, I knew his name; his name was

               <p>SAMUEL HERRINGHAM. I live at No. 41, Booth-street; I was in charge of this house. There was a quantity of brass, and a brass cock, affixed to the building; the most part of it belonged to the steam-engine that belonged to the premises. On the 3d of September, I saw it all safe; on the 4th I found it out, about five o'clock in the morning. It appeared they got in through the sky-light. I found all the brass taken from the engine, and a large brass cock; they were in a bag, and the bag was close to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Finding it there, did you keep watch to see who came for it - A. I was back wards and forwards all the day watching, and about half after six, in the evening, I got a friend to go in with me; we found the prisoner in the stoke-hole.</p>

            . I live in Booth-street. I assisted in this search; I found the prisoner in the stoke-hole. I saw the brass in the bag. When I took him, he told me he came in by the sky-light, and here is a small cock I found upon his person; it belongs to the lead pipe to let the foul air out of the engine.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you lost any lead from any building of yours - A. Yes; on the 15th of July I was informed that there were two men taken up for stealing of lead. It is a stable on the east side of <placeName id="t18120916-175-crimeloc946">Grays-in-lane-road</placeName>

               <p>Q. What quantity of lead was there lost - A. I should think as much as three hundred pound weight; it cost me about 15 l. I went to Hatton Garden; in looking over the lead, I found one piece was marked with blood, as if the party who had cut it had met with an accident.</p>

            . I am a gardener. I work for Mr. Smith, at Dalston. On the 15th of July, between four and five in the afternoon, I saw the prisoners; they came to a place where I was loading dung. The lead was discovered to be in the dung.</p>
               <p>Q. What place was it in - A. In Grays-inn-lane. One of the prisoners went round the cart where I was loading the dung; he kicked the stuff over the lead.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you perceive that there was lead lying there - A. Yes; I found the lead among the dung as I was loading the cart; he was kicking the dung over the lead, as if to hide it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they stay there till you had loaded the cart - A Yes, I left them there. I acquainted the head groom of it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HAMDEN. I am a groom, close to the light-horse volunteers. I received information respect- the lead. In consequence of that I spoke to Mr. Woolger; he keeps the gate of the light-horse volunteers stables. I saw the prisoner very near the spot. I went to Hatton Garden, and got an officer. Woolger watched the place, to see that nobody took the lead. I returned with Read the officer; the prisoners were then down in a field, behind the Welch-school.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is this dunghill from the prosecutor's stables - A. About a hundred and fifty yards, close to the spot.</p>
               <p>LUKE WOOLGER. I am gate-man to the horse volunteers. On the 15th of July, Hamden informed me that there were two suspicious characters. I saw the two prisoners sitting down upon a bank, near where the lead was. I saw one of the prisoners tossing the dung, as if to cover the lead, and before Read, the officer came, the prisoners removed from the dunghill, and went behind the Welch-school.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the two prisoners in custody; I knew Manning before. I saw the lead before I saw the prisoners, just by the light-horse livery-stables, covered over with some dung. I found the prisoners behind the stables, in a field that runs down by Bagnigge-wells; they were lying under the brow of the hill. I took them to the place where the lead lay. I asked them if they knew any thing of the lead; they said, they did not. I searched them; I took a knife from one of them. There was some blood upon the lead; the prisoner, Brown's, small-clothes were tore, and his thigh was cut.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I went to the stable, and found the part that was not cut off, it matched with that which was cut off. I believe the lead to be mine.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence. I met Manning; we walked down Grays-inn-lane. I sat myself down on a bank; he said, did you ever make hay. I said, no. He tossed the dung about. I went away in the fields and sat down.</p>
               <p>Manning's Defence. I was with Brown. I went and laid down in the fields. I knew nothing of the lead. I was taken upon suspicion only.</p>
               <p>Brown called one witness, who gave him a good character</p>
               <p>Manning called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

I crossed the yard, and saw the prisoner ripping the copper over the accompting-house. My fellow-servant came out of the bed-room, over the accompting-house, and the prisoner made his escape into an empty house. I went and met him coming out of the empty house.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DAVIS. Between four and five in the morning I heard a knocking. I got on the gutter, and saw the prisoner ripping the copper up. I said, halloo, governour, what are you at there. He got into the window of an empty house; my fellow servant and I went and catched him coming out of the empty house. We found this knife about him, and this hammer. This is the copper; he had rippid it up.</p>

            . I am a saddle and harness-maker, in Tothill-street, Westminster. The prisoner came to me on Thursday, the 23th of August, in the evening, between seven and eight o'clock, he asked me if I bought harness. I told him, I did. On Saturday morning, at three o'clock, he came again, and knocked me up. He brought the harness, and saddle, and brown Holland, in a sack, altogether. He made an appointment to call for the money, between one and two. I appointed for him to come at eight o'clock. He never came. I had an officer to take him. There was a man came with him on the Thursday; that same man came on the Saturday night. I gained some information from him, and the prisoner was apprehended on the Monday. This is the harness and the other property.</p>

He said, he wanted something of his; instead of that he took nine shillings, a pair of breeches, a pair of stockings, and a shirt. He left the lodging for about a fortnight, and then I found him with the things on his carcase. I took him up.</p>
               <p>MRS. HERBERT. The prisoner came to me at the Market. He asked me for the key. I gave him the key. He left his lodgings for a fortnight.</p>
               <p>- COOK. I am an officer. I saw the clothes on his back. He went to the jail in the clothes. I cannot find them now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the breeches of the prosecutor; I gave him sixpence for them, and the stockings he gave me. I drank a pint of porter with the prosecutor. He rifled my pocket with force. A gentleman passing liberated me. He has been twice to Newgate, and agreed to compound felony for twelve shillings.</p>

On the 16th of August, about half after twelve, I met the prisoner with a sack of oats on his back, just by the Bell, at Paddington. He said, he brought them from Chelsea-reach; he gave thirty shillings for them. I put him in the watchhouse, and sent a man to the wharf, and there was a sack of oats missing at the wharf; and when the prisoner came to the office he confessed that he took the oats from Mr. Billing's wharf.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to his character.</p>

               <p>JOHN SUNSHINE. I am a watchman in Whitechapel. On Sunday, the 28th of July, I came up to the prisoner in Golston-street, Whitechapel. There were two other men before him. Smith crossed to me. I was immediately knocked down. I got up again, and found the prisoner behind me. He had an empty sack in his hand. I picked up the beeswax as soon as I got another to assist me. I asked the prisoner where he was going. He said, to Spitalfields-market, to buy cabbages. This was Sunday, morning, two o'clock.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PATRIDOR. I am a beadle of Whitechapel. I saw the bees-wax by the side of the prisoner. I asked him, whose property the bees-wax was. I said, Mr. Splidt dealt in articles of that sort. He said, it might be his master's for what he knew.</p>

               <p>Mr. Day. The prisoner never accounted for that money. He left our service in 1805. I have not known where he was since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. Did not you know this young man had a house in Russell-street, Bloomsbury - A. His wife lived there. I did not know where he lived. I understood he was an nsher at a school.</p>

            . I live at No. 23, Devereaux-court, in the strand. Mr. Stancliff came to Mr. Mackenzie's chambers, in the Temple, he was not at home. I am a servant to Mr. Mackenzie, No. 2, Brick-court. The prisoner asked, if Mr. Mackenzie was at home; I told him, no, he was out of town. He asked me, whether he could write a note, I told him, yes; I showed him into Mr. Mackenzie's sitting room to do that. I left him by himself; he sat about two or three minutes. While he was writing, he asked me if I could get him a glass of water; I went and got the water, and gave it to him. He was sitting in the chamber, he drank the water, and when he was going out of door, I asked him whether he had left the letter on the table; he was going away with the note in his hand. I asked him to leave it; he gave me the letter then. When he had got down I opened the letter, if was not sealed; I found there was nothing in the letter. I ran after him, and detected him in New-court, in the Temple. I told him there was nothing in the letter, and he said there was, it was done in pencil. I told him, I should be glad if he would come back and see; and going up stairs one of the books fell from him. I knew the book; I said it belonged to my master, he said it did. He was going down stairs again; I told him I must have him searched before he went any farther. He then walked down with me into Devereaux-court, from the Temple. I got Smith to get a constable. There were found nine books, a pocket-book, and a number of other things on him.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the other man - A. Yes; he continues to lodge with me now.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went out first - A. The other man went out about eight o'clock; I was up. In about a quarter of an hour after, the prisoner came down. I saw him leave the house. I observed nothing particular about him. I sent up my servant to see that all was safe; she came down and said the sheets were gone. I pursued the prisoner, and took him in Bear-street; he had the sheets in his breeches. These are the sheets; they are mine. He stripped the sheets off him, while I sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to his character.</p>

               <p>Q. Had she any blankets, a pair of sheets, and a coffee-pot for her use in the lodging - A. Yes; she left the lodging in the beginning of September. About five weeks after she came, I went up stairs and missed the sheets. I asked her what had become of the sheets; she said she had been in a little trouble, and had been obliged to part with them; she would get them in a week or two. I overlooked that, and she continued in the lodging. About a fortnight afterwards, I went and missed a blanket. I asked her where that was; she said, if God gave her strength, I should have every thing in my place soon. I went up another time and missed my pillow. I gave her warning several times. The things are still with the pawnbroker.</p>

On last Saturday night, a child came into my shop. I said, you have got on my cap, I could swear to it. It is particularly worked; the young lady that worked it is in court. I value the cap at 18 s. she sold it for 9 s.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any parcel of lead stolen from your house at any time - A On Monday last, between four and five in the morning, I was in bed. I was alarmed by a knocking; I thought they were breaking into my house. I got out of bed, and saw the prisoners coming out of my shed. I knew them. I had seen them before. I dressed myself and went down to see what was gone. I perceived some leaden pipe cut off from the shed; it was affixed over all the water buts; it was taken away. The next morning, between eight and nine, I saw the lead again, and the prisoners were in custody.</p>

About half past five I saw the prisoners in Hare-street-fields; I saw them with a bundle under their arms; I suspected them, and stopped them; I conveyed them to Whitechapel watchhouse I asked them what they had got; they said, they found the parcel. I examined the bundle at the watchhouse; it contained brass cocks and leaden pipe.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any wood from your carpenter's yard any time - A. Yes, on the 21st of September. The yard is fenced in, and part of it with pales. I lost eight pieces of wood. I saw the prisoner take them at one o'clock in the morning. I saw the prisoner before he went into the yard; and I saw him gather them together, and I saw him take them away. And I found the pieces of wood on his premises afterwards. This is the wood; it is mine.</p>

In my left hand coat pocket I had a pair of leather gloves, a bunch of keys, and some halfpence: I believe about two-pence; and, in the inside pocket, was my pocket-book. On my passing Bride's passage. I was surrounded by four women and by four men. The prisoner was passing my left hand; he put his right hand into my coat-pocket: finding his hand in my pocket, I turned sharp round, and in turning sharp round, he was unable to get his hand out. I seized him with my right hand; and, at the time of my seizing him, his hand was in my pocket; he could not get it out. I then charged the watchman with him, whose box is at the end of Bride's passage, and he took him immediately to the watchhouse in Fleet-market.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any attempt made to your choice for assignees - A. A very strong attempt. There was a gentleman I never saw before in my life, I understood his name was Brooks. Mr. Brooks was started for one, and Mr. Crouch, the petitioning creditor, for the other. These were the two persons that were started against me and the others. Mr. Crouch, I believe, married the bankrupt's sister.</p>
               <p>Q. As soon as you were chosen assignees, did you and the other assignees go to the bankrupt's house the same evening - A. We did not. On the next morning, the 18th, we went to the bankrupt's house in Great Surry-street, Black Friars-Road; Mr. Hemmings met me there. We took possession of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took possession of the house, did you find the servant boy in possession of the business - A. We did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the maid-servant of the house - A. We did not. None of the servants of the bankrupt were left; they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the books - A. We did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply to the bankrupt, John, for his books - A. I had no opportunity of seeing the bankrupt till the third examination.</p>
               <p>Q. The third examination was the 28th of February, eleven days after, did you then apply to him for his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160101"/> books - A. When he appeared at Guildhall he appeared without his books. We asked him, where his books were. He said, they were in the neighbourhood; he himself had not the possession of them; that he had only possession of them a few days past. He had pawned them. He had five pounds lent upon them by a man of the name of Byerley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say at what time he had lodged them with Byerley - A. I do not recollect. I think he said he had got them that morning. He was ordered by the commissioner to fetch them. Mr. Mayhew (Mr. Price's partner) accompanied him. He came back with the books. The books are here.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, in consequence of any suspicion you entertained, had you, before that, gone to the house of Mr. Bond, in Fleet-lane - A. I do not think I saw him until the third meeting. I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish you would recollect - A. On the first private meeting, the 26th of February, Mr. Hemmings and I went to Bond's, in Fleet-lane. I am not satisfied as to the day. It was before the third meeting.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go for the purpose of making enquiries respecting Bond and his debt - A. It happened that me and my brother assignee went together to Bond's, in Fleet-lane, to make enquiry respecting the debt, and to enquire how it arose.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that occasion did you see a woman in the room whom you now know by the name of the Baroness Minkwitz - A. I did. At that time I did not know who she was. Nothing at that time past with her.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you had seen her at Bond's did she come to you and make a discovery - A. About two days after, she came to me and made some communication. I was alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, take into your hands the books of the bankrupt, and tell me whether you find certain names I am going to ask you about debitted for goods. Do you find Count Holmar debitted for any goods - A. Yes, I do. In folio 141, debitted three hundred and eleven pounds twelve shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you find the Baroness Minkwitz debitted for any goods - A. I find her debitted for one hundred and forty-one pounds sixteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. On what articles is she debitted - A. Pearls, two gold watches. The whole debt is one hundred and forty one pounds sixteen shillings, and they give her a credit of eighty-two pounds, leaving a balance of fifty-nine pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, do you find Signora Moranda - A find her debitted for sixty pounds, and credited at - , leaving a balance of forty-nine pounds.

               <p>Q. Did you ask him what the Count was - A. Yes; he gave me his address, Sloane-street; that she and her husband had removed from there; he did not know what had become of them; he believed they were gone out of the country. He was gone to take possession of an estate, or some property abroad. It was a very safe debt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enquire who the Baroness Minkwitz was - A. He said, he had known her for a length of time, but did not know what had become of her. Her debt appears to have been the day before the commission. On the 10th of January appears her debt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enquire who she was - A.

             was a wine and brandy merchant in Smithfield. He came to my shop for the goods. He is now in the Fleet. The account of Count Holmar is a true and correct account. The goods sold in November last. I delivered them to him myself. The bullion consisted of doubloons, some India pieces, and some coin. The bullion was sold at different times. Halliday became a bankrupt in the Fleet. The goods were sold to Halliday when he lived in Bell Savage-yard, in the city. The eleventh leaf is written by the boy. The baroness is written by my brother, James.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mr. Powis. You have examined the books carefully - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him any questions about certain goods that he had charged, which you thought he had not rightly charged - A. I have asked him questions upon all these accompts which I suspected. I pointed out two accounts to him, and particular; Halliday was one, the other Shehey. I pointed out the absurdity, to shew him, that he could have credited such a man as Halliday; he must know his real situation in life. I remonstrated with him how he could have trusted such a man as that. At that time he trusted him he had been recently liberated from the Rules of the Fleet. At the time the bankrupt credited him, Halliday had no means of living. Speaking to him one time upon that, he said, you are the only man who knows any thing respecting Halliday or Shehey; if you remain quiet you shall have nothing to complain of. I told him, it would be better for him to tell the truth. After that he said, he believed the account of Halliday and Shehey to be fabricated, but said he, it was all his, William and Nugent's doing: he was ill at the time. He then told me, if I would remain his friend, and would not oppose his certificate, that he should have at command, in a short time, five or six thousand pounds. I said, why, you have not done the trick to deep as that, and asked him to explain himself. He said, he had it in his power to marry a woman of that property.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to the enquiry of Bond; you have examined the books - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any articles charged to these persons, which by these books you find to have come in afterwards - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. State the articles - A. It is in the account of James. The articles are two trunks booked to him in November last charged three pounds eight shillings. He said, he had them of Mr. Briant, Ludgate-hill. I pointed out to him the absurdity that he had not them in his possession until the 26th of that month. He said, it might be a mistake in the date. He was conscious the account of James was correct, although it was not his own making. He was ill a bed at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I ask you, sir, what is the deficiency upon the estate - A. The deficiency, admitting these debts to be just, amounts to between two and three thousand pounds, and if they are not just they amount to five.</p>

Some enemies of Mr. Folkard had struck a docket against him. I said, have they? He said, yes; we want to get over, on Monday, a trifle of business.

Mr. Grick was in the room before Nugent and Folkard came. Nugent said, do you think the young man will go. That was Grick, to go and prove under the commission. I said, I did not know. Mr. Nugent then said, do you think the man of the house will do it; I said, I did not know; you had better ask him; you had better ask him yourself. Nugent then explained the business to Grick. Grick said he would do it if there was no harm in it. I went down and asked Mrs. Bond. Mr. Nugent said, he would have a dinner and a one-pound note. Mrs. Bond said, if it was to hail any body her husband should not go. The way it was to be done Mr. Folkard was to give bills.</p>

               <p>Q. What were you to have - A. I was to have a one-pound note and a black set of ornaments, and I was to persuade Grick and Bond to do this, and get any body else I could persuade to go and swear a debt.</p>

               <p>Q. Well, he said that Nugent and he would call and arrange it. Did Nugent afterwards call with William - A. Yes. He mentioned the Countess Holmar. I told him, she was gone abroad. He sold me he would be much obliged to me if I would find out when she went abroad, and when her husband went abroad.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had her husband been before she went abroad - A. In the King's Bench prison, and he would give half-a-crown to enquire when the Count left the King's Bench prison, to find out the exact day, and how he spelt his name. I sent Mr. Bond over. When Bond returned he gave me a bit of paper with something on it. I gave it to Nugent and

               <p>Q. Was any enquiry made where the Count lived - A. Yes. I told him she lived in Sloane-street, and the last time in Downing-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you acquainted with Madam Moranda - Yes, she was an opera singer. Nugent asked me what her name was. She had lodged with me when I lived in St. James's. Nugent had seen her there. I told him I did not know where she lived now. Folkard said, he would book her down some things that she owed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean owing him - A. No, his brother, John. I said, he might do it. I said, before you have been making fictitious bills, and now you are making debts. William said, they must make their accounts up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him why this was - A. Yes. I said, first you make people say you are indebted to them, and now you want people that do not owe you any thing, to put down that they do. He said, they must balance the accounts. After that, William came on a Monday. I said to William, are you going to think of me? What are you going to book me down. He said, I must book you down a handsome necklace, and other things. He said, if I wanted to go to the Opera, and wanted a necklace, I should have it lent me.</p>

Nugent wished me to take a bill, to go to Guildhall with, to prove under the bankruptcy, to get him through. He said he would pay me for my trouble. At last I agreed to do it.

I went backwards, into the yard, and when I returned I found the spoons gone off the table. I found one of my spoons at Mr. Cotton's, a pawnbroker. I told him, if the woman came to take out the spoon, to stop her, and send for me. He did, and I took her in custody. This is the spoon. It is mine.</p>

She said, she had lost a time-piece. I gave the alarm of, stop thief. They both went into a garden, and from there into a privy. I went into the privy, and took Davis into custody.

The prisoner lived up two pair of stairs in my house. She came to us as a married woman. She cohabited with a man we supposed to be her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the man the same access to the house as the woman - A. Just the same. On the 6th of July I saw the prisoner going out with a bundle, between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. How lately before had you seen the sheets - A. At ten o'clock the sheets were safe. One pair of sheets were in the next room to where the prisoner lodged. She lodged in a two pair of stairs room. The other pair were in the club room. The door was locked, but I had left the key in the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of these sheets - A. Two pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did the man go out to work - A. At five o'clock in the morning. He was not at home that day after I saw her go out with the parcel.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw her go out with a parcel - A. Yes, I did. She stopped, and had a glass of gin at the bar . I did not suspect her then. It was large enough to have contained these articles. It was covered over with an apron. About twelve o'clock that day I went up stairs and missed the sheets. She did not return to my house. On the next morning she was apprehended.</p>
