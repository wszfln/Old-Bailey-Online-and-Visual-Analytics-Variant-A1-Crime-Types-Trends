               <p>I attend Mr. Walker's office; on Friday morning, I was at a publick-house next to the office; and one Barnet asked me to lend him a guinea; the prisoner was with him; and the jew, Barnet, pulled out a table-spoon, and a three pronged fork with a crest; I laid, these are the things I want; the prisoner said they were his, and could bring proof; I put them into the prisoner's box, and took him to Justice Wilmot; and found the prosecutor, who owned them; the prisoner told me while I was with him; at last; he said, the other things, a spoon and a fork, were at a pawnbroker's in Shoreditch; there I found a spoon and a fork; the pawnbroker is here; his name is Francis.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner; I saw him on Thursday, the 22d; he came in the forenoon, and asked me if I bought old silver? I said I did; he immediately pulled out a spoon and a fork; he said they were his own? I told him they were not; he said they were, positively; he was a post-chaise boy, but had been out of employ for a year and a half; and only drove for one person at Dunstable, whose name was Palmer; I told him, I suppose you have taken these from Mr. Palmer, or some other place; the spoon is marked with R. H. and numbered; I told him he had better tell the truth, as I must stop them: and I believed I would stop him; he begged I would not; he had a wife and two children; and had been out of employ; says he, I will go and bring the person to prove the property; on that account, I let him go; in the afternoon, as he did not come, I wrote out an advertisement, and sent it to the daily advertiser; this is the draft of the advertisement that was at the daily advertiser on the same day; so far from my wishing to keep any such thing, I have a person in court, that carried it to the office of the daily advertiser; I went round the counter to the man; I thought he had not the appearance of an old thief; and I knew he would certainly be committed; and he might learn what he might not know before; and I thought if I got the property, it might be a means of saving him; these are the things.</p>

               <p>How long might all this employ? - very nigh ten minutes, as nigh as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Did no one come in sight all that time? - No; there is a centry at the bottom of the hill: I was just opposite the pond; when I came as far as the pond, I turned back; the water frightened me more than the men: and a man came up.</p>
               <p>When you was upon the ground, how far might you be from the centry? - I take it, about six or seven hundred yards from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280016"/>the centry of the queen's kitchen; that was the nearest centry to me: as I returned from pursuing them, I picked up this hat, and my own hat: I did not overtake them that night; they were taken about five weeks after, as nigh as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen them before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>And can you then be positive, having seen them at no one time, but during such a transaction; can you be positive to their persons? - I carefully considered; I have not swore so positive to them yet, but I could with a clear conscience.</p>
               <p>Do you swear positively to them now? - I think them to be the men.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear positively, that they are the two men; or do you doubt whether they are the men? - I do not doubt but they are the men, in the least; I carefully considered a long while before I spoke: there were several men taken up on suspicion of the same robbery; and I had no knowledge of them: but I knew these again, as soon as I saw them; I was very careful after the circumstance.</p>
               <p>Has the watch been found again? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am serjeant of the same company the prisoners belong to; on the 30th of August, I was on duty, on guard at Kensington: the prisoner Daniels was on duty; and with the rest of the men, he took his watch out to see what it was o'clock; I observed it, and desired to look at it; he gave it into my hand; I had it half a minute; I saw the watch after, which I gave to the prisoner Daniels again.</p>
               <p>Should you know it again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Shew him the watch; (looks at it); I believe that to be the watch.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing that makes you recollect it? - Only the minutes of it, I observed then; and I have since taken notice; I have seen the watch since then.</p>
               <p>Was there any conversation passed between you, respecting it? - No.</p>
               <p>PRISONER LLOYD's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>About five or six days after we were in the barracks, Daniels said he found a watch; he gave it to me to sell or pawn, and I gave it to Hodges; and his wife pawned it; I am innocent of the robbery.</p>
               <p>PRISONER DANIEL's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>On the 21st of last August, in the morning, going in the park, by the canal, I saw this watch lay, and I picked it up, and put into my pocket; I shewed it to all my comrades at the barracks; I could not come out of the barracks; I shewed it all round; I know nothing of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Lloyd. I wish to call serjeant Rhodes to my character.</p>
               <p>Court. Well serjeant, we leave it to you? - My lord, I cannot say any thing to his character.</p>

               <p>Does the person who lets out the lodgings, live in the house? - No, he keeps a shop at the end of the court; he lets out the house in tenements.</p>

               <p>Any body might see he had a bundle? - Yes; I had undoubtedly a strong suspicion of him, seeing him lay in the passage; when I came out in the morning, at half past three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did you speak to him then? - No; sometimes people are locked out.</p>
               <p>Did you tell any body that you saw this man there? - Yes, I told my husband, before I knew the things were gone; I said, that young man will not hurt us, he is some young man locked out of his apartment.</p>

               <p>Is there any pretence in the trade, for such perquisites? - I have been a printer for twenty years; I never heard of such a thing; but I should think the very appearance of them would prove it; I have stated them considerably under the value at thirty shillings and eighteen shillings.</p>

               <p>I went to carry home a waistcoat; going along, there was this child; I could get nothing out of him, but that his name was Tommy; I brought the child into Mr. Jones's; I went round the tap-room with the child in my arms; from thence I went to the Duke's Head, and to Petticoat-lane; and into Bell-lane, where the prosecutrix lived, not knowing her to be the mother of the child; I went to the corner of Bell-lane, and asked for a halfpenny worth of bread; and desired them to enquire about the child; the prosecutrix found the child in my lap, eating a bit of bread, and drinking beer; I took nothing off the child's back; I cannot say whether she lost any thing.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. Prisoner at the bar, you have been convicted on very satisfactory evidence, of stealing the articles mentioned in the indictment; and under circumstances the most aggravating. One should conceive, that the tenderness of your sex would have prevented you from committing a crime of so horrid and atrocious a nature. I do not know whether you have ever been the mother of children; but if you have, your offence is aggravated beyond measure: for, if you have ever had the feelings of a mother yourself, your mind must be depraved beyond the possibility of conception, to induce you for so trifling an article as this, to have put parents into a situation which might have made them miserable to the end of their lives. For, the death of a child in a natural way, is not so dreadful as losing them thus. It is necessary, therefore, to inflict an exemplary punishment on persons of your description, by way of example to others more than of punishment to you: for I conceive your mind to be so depraved, that no sentence of the Court can make any impression on you. The severest sentence I can pass on you, is to send you abroad, where you will be at such a distance, (although I am not enabled, which I sincerely lament, to transport you for life,) that you will not be able, in all probability, to return; but if you should, I hope you will come back with a tenderer heart, and a mind of some feeling and sensibility. The sentence of the Court upon you, is that you be</p>

               <p>The indictment opened by Mr. Knapp: and the case by Mr. Garrow, as follows:</p>
               <p>May it please your lordship.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the jury; I cannot help wishing for your being permitted to hear what I have to state; because this is a prosecution which, whether you consider the effect to the prisoner, or the importance of it to the public; in all the views, I say, in which it can be considered, it is a prosecution that requires your best attention: I believe there will not be any great difficulty in it, when the circumstances come to be understood, and to be considered with that attention, and with that discretion, which it becomes you to exercise, and which you bring to all subjects, certainly to consider them with. The prisoners, one of them, Partington, was coachman to Mr. Anderson: and it will appear to you that this offence has been committed, by him, in the company of another coachman out of place, of the name of Cave; and the third person, Lasceter, who had lived in the capacity of postillion and groom; both these persons had quitted the service before this robbery was committed; but it will appear without any possibility of doubt, that while Partington was in service he had meditated this robbery, considered the mode by which it could best be effected, had examined the weak parts of the house; and that in short, that which has ended in taking from Mr. Anderson by burglary, a very large part of his property, was formed while this man was in the capacity of a servant: Gentlemen, upon the 21st of September the house was made secure, by a servant who will be called; on the next morning, when that servant came down she found that the house was broke open, that Mr. Anderson's own room had been entered, that his writing desk had been plundered, and that the drawers in the room, and every thing else where any thing of value had been contained, were all of them rifled: from some circumstances in the character of Partington, the alderman entertained suspicions, and also of Lasceter; in consequence of which that man was taken into custody: on the 26th of September a man of the name of Piddington, a constable, went to a house called the Two Chairmen, and to which I will beg you to keep your attention, in the course of what I have to say; and in bed he found the other prisoner Cave; he told him he must get up and dress himself, and go with him; he enquired on what occasion; the constable told him no matter, he must go with him, and that he wanted the key of the stable: the key of what stable? the constable, in consequence of the information he had received, said, why, of the stable in which Mr. Anderson's plate is hid; he at first gave no answer; but at last he said, well let us go back, and in a chair covered with some hair, he produced the key of a stable; he directed the constable to that stable, that it was the next stable to the pump, in a certain mews, which he described, and that in a particular part of that stable he would find the things he was in search of; in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280033"/>consequence of which, he, with other assistance, went to the stable and found a great number of articles: on the person of Cave, he likewise found a silver watch, five guineas, two half guineas, a quantity of silver, and several other things, which he confessed he had received as his share of a fifty pound bank note, which had been stolen from Mr. Anderson; and he likewise, I think, I am not sure, stated that a draft of forty-two pound ten shillings, which had likewise been stolen, at the time these other things were taken, had been burned: Gentlemen this is abundant evidence, one would think, to connect Cave with this burglary: I avoid for the present stating to you the evidence of Lasceter, because I wish you to consider this case as you go along, always remembering that you are not to attend to any thing that is stated to you from the bar, unless it comes out upon proof; but I wish you to bear upon your minds the different degrees of guilt which attach to these prisoners, in the different stages, always remembering how much of that guilt has attached before the evidence of the accomplice comes to be considered. The evidence against Partington is this, after Lasceter was in custody, he of course had given information, which led to enquire into the transaction; and Partington was pursued into the country; Partington was gone down to Liverpool; he was taken at Preston; and upon his person there were found some things which are extremely material for your consideration and attention; and in the lining of his breeches, next to his skin, I believe, one of those things, which you have seen lately, probably, one of those phosphorous bottles, with matches, by which you may procure light without flint and steel; this will be an extremely important circumstance in the course of this enquiry; there was likewise found upon him two keys, which he acknowledged to be his property, and which he stated to belong to him; there was a pocket book, and in that a receipt from the book-keeper of the Axe inn, in Aldermanbury, for two boxes which had been delivered, as will be proved by the person who had that receipt: Gentlemen, these things the prisoner Partington stated to be his own; the key will be found to open one of the boxes at the inn in Aldermanbury; the receipt will be found to apply to both the boxes found in Aldermanbury, therefore it becomes extremely material for you to consider the contents of those boxes; they contained among many other things, articles of Mr. Anderson's, taken by the persons who committed the burglary in question: when Partington was brought to town he was shewn these different articles, and among the rest a brass ink stand was produced to him; it was not at that time stated where that had come from; but he said it was his property. Gentlemen, it will be proved to you that the brass ink-stand was taken out of the box at the Axe inn, in Aldermanbury; this is to shew you that these boxes were the property of Partington; that the contents of them therefore, are to be presumed to have been conveyed there by him, and therefore it becomes expedient for him to account to you how he came by such articles. Gentlemen, in addition to this it will be proved to you, that the two prisoners, together with Lasceter, had for some nights preceding the 21st of September passed their evenings, and slept at the Two Chairmen, in David's-street, Berkley-square, where I told you Cave had been found in bed: so far we connect the three: but it will be material for you to remember that upon the very night of the burglary neither of these persons, who had for some nights before slept at that house, slept there; where they slept perhaps they will inform you by witnesses; I am afraid I shall be able to give you a very satisfactory account, that they did not sleep at all, but that when the rest of mankind were enjoying that necessary refreshment they were employed in this robbery. Gentlemen, I might pause here, and ask you, whether in a question which is to be made up of circumstances; and where a Jury are to find their way by circumstances; I have not stated enough, if I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280034"/>can prove it, to intitle the crown to convict these two unfortunate men. Gentlemen, in all iniquities of this sort, at human tribunals, we are not to expect that men who set about to prey on their fellow subjects, and commit depredations on the publick, should call witnesses to their guilt. I cannot prove that such and such witnesses saw the fact committed. All that in general Juries can expect, is that by circumstances, they may be satisfied of the guilt of the persons accused. God forbid, that in such a case as this, I should press it one hair's breadth beyond its due bounds; it is not my duty, and I hope I am not disgraced by the inclination. Gentlemen, there is another circumstance which I proceed to state to you, before I open the evidence of the accomplice; I told you these people would be shewn to have had connections together, at the Two Chairmen, after Partington went out of town; and after Lasceter and Cave were in custody. It was expected, that probably there would be some correspondence between these two persons; and therefore, very properly, directions were given, that any letters coming to Cave, so suspected, might be carried to Sir Sampson Wright's. I shall read to you a letter, which I shall prove to be the hand-writing of the prisoner Partington; it is addressed to the other prisoner, Cave; and before I read it, I wish you to understand, that you are not to consider that as evidence against Cave, to whom it is addressed, further than as it may be a corrobation of the evidence of the accomplice; and strengthen the evidence of the crime imputed. If you, or any of you, can understand it to refer to any honest transaction; if you think it does not bear on the point; if you think it is too obscure, to conclude any thing against the prisoners from it, for God's sake, reject it totally: but if you think that from the phrase of it, it can relate to no other subject, than that on which I have had the misfortune (as far as these people are concerned) to address you, it will confirm the evidence of the accomplice: it is addressed to Cave, at the Two Chairmen.</p>

               <p>"Friend, I would have one of you to</p>
               <p>"come down to me; and set off from</p>
               <p>"London on Monday next, for I have</p>
               <p>"got all ready; and stop at the inn at</p>
               <p>"Liverpool; if not, leave word where I</p>
               <p>"shall find you." And this is addressed from Liverpool; it comes, manifestly, by the post mark, from that place. Gentlemen, the only circumstance I bring it for, is to shew that the accomplice is confirmed, when he says these two persons were concerned in the burglary, and partook of the guilt. Probably, in the course of this session, you may have learned from the highest authority, that the evidence of an accomplice, though such as a Jury receive with caution; and though by the law of this country, it is admissible and competent evidence; yet no Jury is advised by the Court, nor do they at all feel disposed, if so advised, to find a person guilty on his single evidence; because, he comes here, confessing himself to be a bad man; and it is not safe solely to rely upon him: but in a case where without an accomplice, there are circumstances, very strong circumstances, to go to a Jury, where the accomplice appears to have discovered his own guilt, and the guilt of those concerned with him, in the earliest instance; where he is confirmed even in the smallest circumstances, he is a fit witness, whose evidence is to be taken into consideration; and on whose evidence a Jury may safely rely. Gentlemen, this man, Lasceter, will be called; he will tell you he had been postillion to Mr. Anderson, and became acquainted with the coachman, Partington; that Partington had planned the robbery; and he carried the other two persons to the place; and that they perpetrated the robbery in the manner he will describe. Gentlemen, it is fitter, and more safe you should hear it for yourselves; so much of it as is not confirmed, you will not very much rely on; but if his main story should derive confirmation from witnesses of undoubted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280035"/>credit; from intrinsic circumstances, certainly then you will receive his testimony, with allowance for his situation. Gentlemen, in circumstantial evidence, the smallest circumstances now and then turn out to be extremely strong; and there is one, which it is fit I should draw your attention to. There was an ink stand taken from the writing desk of Mr. Anderson; it will be stated to you by Lasceter, that when they got out into the stable of the Alderman's, to divide the property, Partington said, this d - d ink stand had spilt in his pocket, and had inked him; upon which, he took it out, and emptied the rest of the ink on the hay; now you would expect that confirmation, and you will have it; because, in the pocket of the coat he had on when he was taken into custody, there are the manifest marks of the ink, which had in some manner stained that pocket; it will be for you, therefore, to judge whether this, though a single circumstance, does not confirm the accomplice. Gentlemen, this is a case in which I took the liberty to say, the lives of the prisoners were concerned; and therefore, it calls for your attention. It is a case in which one servant has induced another servant, and another person, not connected in the service of the Alderman, to perpetrate a burglary in his house; and it aims at the best securities under which we live. If servants will betray their trust; if they will meditate while in our service, how to accomplish their depredations on the peaceful dwellings of their masters, God knows by what tenure any of us can hold things dear to us. Gentlemen, the atrocity of the crime ought not to induce you to form a wish for the conviction of the prisoners, without the fullest evidence of their guilt: but if I can satisfy you by a strong unanswerable and unanswered chain of circumstances; if I add the evidence of the accomplice, who comes to make the only retribution in his power, to the laws of his country, that these two men are the perpetrators of this guilt; it will be your duty to the publick; it will be your duty in that sacred character of Jurymen, on your oaths, to pronounce them guilty. If you should have any conscious doubt, I am sure the prosecutor who sends me here, is one of the first men in the court, who will desire you to pronounce them not guilty.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was servant to Mr. Alderman Anderson; on the 21st of September last, I locked up the house, and made it secure; I was the only person in the house; I got up in the morning of the 22d, between seven and eight.</p>
               <p>In the morning of the 22d, was the house in the same state of security, as it was on the 21st, when you went to bed at night? - No.</p>
               <p>Describe how you found the house, at coming down in the morning? - The first place that I came to, was my master's dressing room, which I had double locked, I found open, and the key on the outward side; I went down stairs, and there I found the back area door open, and the candle standing on the bench in the area, in a common kitchen candlestick, which I left on the mantle-piece in the kitchen; there was half, or more, of the candle left; in the morning, it was nearly burnt to the socket; it was standing then on the bench in the passage, leading to the area; then I saw the footman's pantry door open, with the lock hanging by one screw; then I went up stairs, and went into my master's dressing room; there I could see the papers all of a litter on the carpet; I threw open the window; there I found the desk cut across; the top part thrown back; the papers all in confusion; rings, cases, purses, likewise the wardrobe; there was every drawer, every door open.</p>
               <p>In short, every thing was rifled? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you see in the butler's pantry? - There I missed the plate, a considerable quantity of plate; all the things mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know Partington? - No, Sir, I do not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280036"/>Prisoner's Counsel. It was between seven and eight, when you got up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Broad day light? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was the only person in the house? - Yes; the area door was wrenched; one of the bolts was off; the door was cut, and the purchases down it, which had wrenched the door; I likewise heard a noise in the night.</p>
               <p>What time do you think? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was it dark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN PIDDINGTON sworn.</p>
               <p>I was a constable at the time the prisoner was taken into custody; on Saturday, the 26th of September, I took the prisoner Cave into custody, at the house of one Clarke, the sign of the two Chairmen, in David-street, Berkley-square.</p>
               <p>Did you find the prisoner in bed, or up? - As to stand charged upon oath, it is rather hard to say; he was getting into bed partly, and partly up.</p>
               <p>Did you find this man in his bed room? - Yes, Sir, I did.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to you, to be a person who had slept in that room that night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now tell us what passed between you and him, when you came into the room? - I asked him if his name was not John Cave? he said, yes; I told him if his name was Cave, he must put his clothes on, and go with me; he made very little, or no answer; he put on his clothes, and then he changed them, and put on cleaner clothes; there was but very trifling passed at that time, hardly worth observation; then he asked me where I was going to take him to; I told him to the watch-house at present; and I asked him for the key.</p>
               <p>How did you ask him for the key? - I asked him where the key was.</p>
               <p>What were your own words? - I asked him for the key where the things were; I asked him for the key of the stables, where the things were, that they had robbed from Mr. Anderson.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him, that you wanted him respecting that robbery? - Yes, Sir, I believe I did; I could not recollect at that time the examination was taken, so perfectly; and I have made a memorandum since.</p>
               <p>What did Cave say to you? - Why, he seemed to say but little about the key at first, till we came down stairs; and nearly about the bottom of the stairs, I seized him by the collar, and called Mr. Clarke to aid and assist in the king's name; and he desired me not to lead him; I told him the laws of my country protected me to lead him, and lead him I must; and I put him into the parlour; we had some words there; I think, that I would not shew him lenity, without he would behave well to me; he desired to go up stairs; when we came up stairs; I followed him up as sharp as I could; when he came up stairs, he went to a chair in the room I had found him in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. What had you said to him? now, before you went up stairs; had not you told him that it would be better for him? - I do not know but I might; very possibly I might.</p>
               <p>You told him it would be better for him to confess, and tell you where the key was? - Possibly I might.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you mean that you did say so? - Did say what.</p>
               <p>Why, what the gentleman asked you? - I do not know, as I stand charged upon oath, but I might.</p>
               <p>That nobody should hurt him? - No, not that.</p>
               <p>Then, after that, I do not ask what he said, I ask a fact? - He went up stairs, and went to the elbow chair, apparently; and the bottom of the canvas was broke; and in the horse hair of the seat of the chair, was this key hid; and when he brought the key out, he said, there is the key of the stable; and where is the stable? says I.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. What he said, is certainly not evidence, after this promise, only that he gave him the key.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you mean to say,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280037"/>that upon your recollection, you said any thing to this man, that coaxed him? - No further, than it might be better for him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then, do not tell me any thing he said? - I went to some stables in Reeve's mews; the stable next to the cistern.</p>
               <p>Did you find that the key which the prisoner gave you, opened the stable door next the cistern? - Yes, it did; then I went to the upper end of the stable, under a manger; there I found first some loose straw, apparently to me, left at the bottom carelessly; then I found some bricks laid over, as if it was almost intirely paved; for even the chinks of the bricks were filled full of dirt and rubbish; I took up some bricks, and scratched a little, and there I found a bit of the plate first; and there I found four snuff boxes, some medals, a silver pint pot; I have not had the things; Mr. Hougham and the Alderman, I believe, took them away; they were sealed though; I searched his person at the watch-house, after I had been at the stable; there I found five guineas in gold, two half guineas, eleven shillings and six-pence, and a half crown piece.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. I believe you went down somewhere in the country, to apprehend one of the prisoners? - I went by the request of Alderman Anderson together with Sir Sampson Wright, to apprehend Partington; I got down there on the Thursday morning; I think it was in this month; it was after Cave was taken into custody; there was a warrant sent down from the office, to the mayor of Liverpool, before I went off; and that got down there a day or two before I got there; I got down on the Thursday morning, and went to the mayor, to know if any thing had been done with respect to the warrant that was sent down; and I found that it was agreed by the constable and coachman, to have him in custody that very afternoon; and I waited about a mile and a half from Liverpool, where I found him in a coach; I conveyed him to the watch-house; in the watch-house I perceived something in his breeches; and I thought the coachman had not searched him very strictly; I searched him myself; and I found this phosphorous box; I found it in the inside of his breeches; we went the next day before the mayor; and in the mayor's presence, the money, forty-four guineas and a half, and a pocket book, were delivered up to me in the presence of the prisoner; and the mayor asked him in my presence, whether that pocket book, together with two keys, and the forty-four guineas and a half in a purse, were all his property? and he there, before the mayor, voluntarily said, they were all his; the pocket book was opened at Liverpool; I saw the contents; there was a card which was wrote upon; this is the pocket book; it is now in the state it was delivered to me; Mr. Hougham had it; I then brought him to London; and at the examination before Sir Sampson Wright -</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Were his examinations taken in writing? - I fancy not.</p>
               <p>Was that which was said before the magistrate at Liverpool, taken down in writing? - Certainly not; at the last examination before Sir Sampson, Sir Sampson ordered that the keys might be tried to the boxes; and I tried them; and these two keys that were found on the prisoner, one of them opens the box exactly; the blue box which was before the magistrate; I heard Partington confess it was his box; he was asked if it was his box? and he said it was his; and he said, with all the contents in it; that box is here with it's contents; the other box we could not open, because there was a key broke in the lock.</p>
               <p>Did you see his coat taken off at any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280038"/>time? - I searched his coat; and I pulled out the very pocket where the ink was; that coat is here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Is the coachman here, that took the man? - No.</p>
               <p>Then all you know, is that you found Partington at Liverpool, in custody of a coachman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you found two keys upon him, one of which opened the box? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I went to the Axe inn, Aldermanbury, to examine the boxes, on the 26th of September; they were produced to me by the last witness; I opened them in his presence.</p>
               <p>Were the things that are now in them, all in them then? - Yes, and more things.</p>
               <p>What things were in them then, that are not in them now? - Several articles of wearing apparel, for the prisoner's own use.</p>
               <p>How came he to take those things? - He said he was in distress for them, and wished to have them, and I asked Sir Sampson Wright, and he desired by all means to let him have what he wanted; there were things in both the boxes, and he claimed both the boxes as his; they were delivered to him by me.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any brass ink stand, being found in any of these boxes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you got that? - Yes, I forgot to put it into its place, and the gentleman who was with me, said you have left this out; well, says I, I will keep this, and he shall have it; I shewed that ink stand to him, and he said it was his; in the blue box I found a parcel sealed up.</p>
               <p>Court. I think as these boxes were allowed to be his, it does not signify which of them? - In the blue box there is a ticket; the key was broke in this lock, and I took and broke it open by the hinges; at the bottom of this box, after going through all the wearing apparel, I found a pair of silver tea tongs, close to that was a pair of new silk stockings, and close to that was a pair of plain cotton stockings, rolled up, as if they came from a washer-woman; I undid them, and at the bottom of one of the feet of these stockings, I found a ring; I was told it was a diamond ring, it is in this bundle; this bundle is in the same state in which I delivered it; all the things in this bundle were found in the blue box.</p>
               <p>Was you present when the prisoner was examined, and when his coat was taken off? - Yes, I took it off myself; I saw the pocket with the ink mark; the coat is here.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Counsel. The prisoner Partington was not present when you searched the boxes? - No.</p>

               <p>Did they sleep at your house about the 20th of September? - Cave did, but Partington did not.</p>

               <p>You do not know exactly, I suppose, every day they lay out of your house? - I do not, indeed.</p>
               <p>And you observed nothing particular the next day, when you saw Cave? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>You do not make their beds? - No.</p>

               <p>Sometimes your lodgers get up before you? - Sometimes before, and sometimes after.</p>

             and Partington were at my lodgings; then we went to the publick-house in Old-street, the Rodney's-head, they were both together, and one of them told me they had tried to get into the Alderman's house that night; Cave went down into the yard first, intending to get into the stable, and Mr. Lathwick disturbed him, and asked him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280040"/>what he wanted there, and he told him he was doing his business, and Mr. Lathwick came out and shut the gate; then they asked me if I would do it the next night; I said I was going into the country, I was not willing; then the coachman pulled out of his pocket a little brown box with a candle and some matches, such a box as that; he pulled the cork out of the bottle, and blew into the bottle, and lighted the match, and then his candle: (the box shewn him) I believe this is the box; they asked me again to go with them; we drank together, and I agreed to go with them to rob the Alderman's house; and we parted from there that night; I do not know what time we parted; I was to meet Partington again next morning, at the first publick-house, the right hand side in Oxford-road; I went and met him, and we went from there to Clarke's house, to find Cave, and when we came there he was not there: we went to the stable; we knew where to find him; we went to the publick-house, and had two pints of beer; he came over to us; then we went to the cooks-shop and dined; and we went to another publick-house, and had some beer; and we were to meet at the Two Chairmen in David-street again in the evening; I am not sure what time it was; I think about five in the evening, there we met; we went to cards there some time, with a baker; then Partington went up stairs to the bed room, and took a plumbers hammer; and we came away from there between six and seven, right into Aldersgate-street; the hammer was to break open the doors; we went by the gates once or twice, and then Partington went in; the gates were shut to, they were not fastened, that is the gate of the yard; it belonged to some butchers and coachmen; that must be about eight in the evening; then he went down and broke a pane of glass of the window, and opened the stable window, put down the bar, and opened the window, and got in; and sometime afterwards he let us in at the Alderman's coach house door; then we went from there up into the hay loft, and we abided there till near one in the morning; then we went from there on the leads, a kind of summer house, and got the ladder, and got down off the leads into the garden, then we put down the ladder into the area, out of the garden, and they two got down and got a light from Partington's little box, then they screwed away with a chissel, where the bolt was, and a plumbers hammer into the area door, that was the door that comes out of the kitchen into the area, and got into the passage of the kitchen; I continued above at that time; then they opened the door, and I went down; then they went to the Alderman's dressing room, and shut the door, and told me to abide in the passage; they bought a candle before they went to the house, but I am not sure whether they used that, or whether they got one of the Alderman's candles; they left me in the passage and told me to abide there; when they got to the Alderman's dressing room, they continued there about an hour; then they came out again; then they went from there down into the butler's pantry and shut the door, and told me to abide in the passage again; and they were there near about an hour longer; then they came out and put out the candle, and I went-up the ladder first, and Cave came up afterwards, then Partington came up last, and gave me two candlesticks; we had some small beer in the house; I asked Partington what he had taken those two candlesticks for; and he said he had taken all he could find; I did not mean any thing by the question, only I asked him; I thought they were silver candlesticks; then we went from there; and Cave told me they had got a fifty pound bank note, and a ring, and he shewed me the ring; and I told him I believed it was my master's picture upon it; it was a gold ring, and stones round the edge of it; the picture was like a man's head.</p>

Then we went up the ladder again, Cave first, and Partington went up, and he let the great silver waiter tumble; and I took it up, and asked him what do you take this for, you had better take this back, I said; and he said no he would not, for that was worth all the rest; then we went into the hay loft, and they pulled some of the things out of their pockets, and Partington put his hand into his pocket, and said the ink was run out of the ink stand into his pocket; and he pulled out the ink stand and emptied it on some hay, and said it had run in his pocket; I did not see the ink stand; it was dark; then they told me to go to my lodging, and I was to call upon them the next morning, or else at five in the afternoon; I followed them, instead of going home; then I overtook them on Holborn Hill, and got along side of them; then they got into a hackney coach, somewhere by Holborn, and bid me a good night; and I went to my lodging; I did not take any thing with me; the next morning I went about eleven to the mews, and I asked for

               <p>Prisoners Counsel. Well, Mr. Lasceter, so having lived seventeen months with the Alderman, you was the person that committed this robbery? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The coachman had not lived with him so long by a great deal, as you had? - No.</p>
               <p>So you made shift to make your escape, when you was apprehended? - Yes; I thought I was not wanted any more.</p>
               <p>You never thought of telling it, till you was apprehended? - No; I should have done it.</p>
               <p>You should have given evidence of it, without being apprehended at all? - Yes; they asked me about it, and then I told them.</p>
               <p>It is not usual for you to rob your masters in this manner? - It was not my fault.</p>
               <p>How long have you been a servant? - Six or seven years.</p>
               <p>You never saw the ring, before Partington shewed it to you? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. After you had been once taken, you was at large? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you go voluntarily afterwards, and make the confession? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Not in custody, but voluntarily? - I was not in custody.</p>

               <p>You have at some time, probably, heard these several articles which are in the indictment, enumerated? - I have.</p>
               <p>Did you lose all these articles at the time of the burglary? - All these, and more; that ring is mine; I am very positive to it; I have had it ten or twelve years.</p>
               <p>Have you the smallest doubt of its being yours? - None in the world; I cannot swear so positively to the tea-tongs; but a servant of mine can; this waiter is mine, and this toast rack; this large waiter has my arms upon it; all the things that are in that box are my property, and were lost at this time.</p>
               <p>Court. I will ask you Mr. Alderman, for form sake, the value of the whole? - Three hundred pounds, including the bank note, and the draft; there are a couple of gold boxes, which are very valuable; they cost, perhaps, a hundred and forty, or a hundred and thirty guineas.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Your coachman used to sign his bills? - Yes; and his receipt for his wages; and several weekly bills for brooms, and other things; he has written some of them in my presence; and added to them, he has signed a receipt for his wages.</p>
               <p>Because, in this letter, there is no name? - Oh, I do not go from the name, but from the hand writing, I believe it verily to be his.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, I told you, if you wished to have other witnesses examined, I would call them; this is a matter of very great consideration: nine tenths of the people that are tried here, must escape, if you expect that some person should see the crime committed; because, thieves and people capable of committing crimes, commit them in the absence of witnesses; and if property is lost, and afterwards recently found in the possession of another; that is in law, a presumptive evidence of the theft, unless the persons charged with the robbery, can prove how they came by the property; but I will call another witness.</p>

               <p>Jury. We cannot alter our verdict.</p>
               <p>Court. You will let all the thieves in London escape.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Look at these things? - They are mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They were all in one parcel when I picked them up; I never opened them; I found them in the street, at the bottom of the stone steps.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I found them in his apartment, about an hour after I lost them.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, it is my duty to tell you what the law is, and then you will discharge your consciences upon it. The rule of law is, that if property is lost, and recently afterwards found in possession of another, who cannot give a satisfactory account of it; that is in presumption of law, an evidence of theft; now the prosecutor put these things in a coat pocket; and he saw the prisoner, who is a <rs id="t17891028-39-deflabel191" type="occupation">porter</rs>

Gentlemen, you will consider whether you are satisfied by this account.</p>

               <p>Jury. My lord, we wish to know whether there was not other people passing in the passage? -</p>
               <p>Court It does not depend on this man's being in the passage, but he was in the passage, and an hour afterwards, part of the things were found in his possession; and he sells part as his own.</p>
               <p>Jury. It is our opinion, that he is not guilty.</p>

            ; when we came into Hyde Park, the prisoner bid them go farther; and as soon as they were gone, he knocked me down; and he said, give me your money? I said, I have no money; he put his right hand before my mouth, and put his left hand into my pocket; and took out four shillings and a pocket handkerchief; afterwards, when he took his hand from my mouth, I cried murder; and he said, if I cried murder any more, he would run his knife through me; I called murder several times, and he ran away; he was going to take my bonnet; he had it in his hand, but he threw it down; and when assistance came, he ran away.</p>
               <p>Who came? - The patrol came over the wall; they took the other man; I have spoke the truth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. Where was you married? - I was married at Stratford upon Avon, in Warwickshire, three years, come next Christmas; I have been an unfortunate girl of the town three months.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280052"/>Was not it dark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many persons were there by you, at the time when he came up to you? - Only this girl, and the other soldier; the other soldier came with him.</p>

               <p>Then, you agreed together to go into Hyde Park? - Yes; he gave me no shilling.</p>
               <p>You agreed to go with him, on consideration of his giving you a shilling? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the other man come to your assistance, when you cried murder? - No; they neither of them came, till such times as the patroll came over the wall; he took my bonnet from my head, and threw it down again; he took my four shillings, and my old pocket handkerchief; I had no more money in the world.</p>
               <p>How late did you know what money you had in your pocket? - I had it from another gentlemen not half an hour before; I had the money, and put it into my pocket, as soon as I left the other gentleman.</p>
               <p>This money was loose in your pocket? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was down on the ground? - Yes, because he knocked me down.</p>
               <p>How often did you cry out murder? - I cannot tell whether it was five or six times.</p>
               <p>And though there was a man and woman in your company, that had gone a few yards from you, nobody heard you, or came to your assistance? - No one came, till the patrolls came.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you receive from that man a shilling, which he promised to give you? - No, Sir, I had not a farthing from him, or any body else, but the gentleman I had been with, from whom I had four shillings.</p>
               <p>At the time this man came up, how came you to be so positive in knowing what money you had in your pocket? - Because I had it from the other gentleman, four shillings.</p>
               <p>It was dark, I suppose? - Yes; it was after night, before ever I saw the other gentleman.</p>
               <p>How long was you crying out murder? - I cannot tell you how many minutes; we were but just a quarter or an hour in the park.</p>
               <p>Did you ever recover your money again? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>How long afterwards did you charge this man? - He was not taken till the next morning; the other man that was in company with him, told of him at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Court. Could you know the man again? - Yes, Sir; that is the man; I knew him the next day at the Justice's; he was dressed in the same clothes he has on now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was not you told now, before you went to the office, that there was a person in custody, that it was supposed had robbed you? - No, Sir, I was not.</p>
               <p>Was not you told in your way, going to the office, what you was going for? - No, Sir, we were not; we were going to appear against the other man; I did not know this man was there, till I saw him at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>What became of the other man? - He was taken to the watch-house with us; he was kept in the watch-house all night.</p>
               <p>It was perfectly dark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen this man before? - No; but I can swear to the same man.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you mean by being taken up? - We were all taken together in the Park.</p>

               <p>Did she appear to be ill used? - She seemed to be very much frightened.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body run away? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you observe whether she had a bonnet on or no, at that time? - No, not then; but at the toll-house, I saw her have a bonnet.</p>
               <p>Did her clothes appear rumpled and disturbed? - No; she was standing upright.</p>
               <p>Had she any marks of violence upon her? - When I took her to the toll-house, she shewed me her arm, which was very black; I saw no other mark of violence about her.</p>
               <p>Did her head dress appear much tumbled? - No; I did not take any notice of her hair being rumpled, or her her clothes rumpled, only she shewed her arm; she said she had been knocked down; they were all together; and the woman, Smith, was saying, why did not you come to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Who was the man that you saw with this woman at that time? - He is at the door, belonging to the same company and barracks as the prisoner.</p>

             at all, did she complain of having been treated ill, and robbed? - I immediately asked them, and she made me that reply, that she had been very ill used by a man that was run away, and robbed her of four shillings and her pocket handkerchief.</p>
               <p>What sort of an appearance had these bruises on her arm? - Why, it appeared that some person had clinched her round; she said she had a mark on her breast, but I did not ask her to shew me that, because there were many people in the turnpike-house.</p>
               <p>She seemed to be much agitated? - She did indeed; she was very much terrified.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prosecutrix before? - No; I never saw either of the girls, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>They appeared to you to be common prostitutes? - I knew that by their own discourse; I asked them what business they had in the Park at that time? and they said they went with the men; the next morning, I went and fetched this prisoner out of the barracks.</p>
               <p>Did the women themselves, give you any account of the man at that time? - They said he was a very tall man, and appeared to them as a gentleman.</p>
               <p>You got your intelligence from the other soldier? - Yes.</p>

            , his jacket and apron, and every thing correspond: I saw one take a hammer and wrench some of the lead off the gutter, and sold it upon the parapet wall; they appeared to me to put it into the garret window; I saw no more at that time: about five minutes after I saw him on the ground, in the Circus, and in about half after six I saw one at the watch-house.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280058"/>Court. Are you sure Lucas was one of them? - I can only speak as to his dress; he had a kind of flannel like jacket, white, and a canvass apron, like, and a round hat; I knew his person again when I saw him; he had the same dress on.</p>
               <p>Did you know him to be the same man, when you saw him at the watch-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know whose house this was? - One Mr. Esquire Tapps, so named.</p>
               <p>Do you know of your own knowledge? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoners Counsel. You from a window saw a man behind a parapet wall doing something to the roof? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That man had the appearance of a workman, in a flannel jacket, and apron on? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There were many workmen about that building, at that time? - Yes, there were several.</p>
               <p>Therefore of course some of them might be very lawfully employed about that building? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You afterwards saw the prisoner with such a jacket on, and apron, like a workman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He is a workman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Afterwards the prisoner was at the magistrates? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And he was admitted to bail? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And he surrendered here to take his trial? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now I do not understand you to swear to this man positively, behind the parapet wall? - This person was on the back front of the house, doing something to the garret windows; he went from that house.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear more to Lucas, than by the circumstance you set out with fairly and honestly, that he had the same sort of dress with the man ripping the lead? - That is all I can say.</p>
               <p>Was you in the coach the next day, going to the magistrates? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you say then, that Lucas was not the man you had seen behind the parapet, or that if he was he had changed his dress? - I did not say any such thing.</p>

               <p>I let lodgings, a ready furnished room, at two shillings and six-pence a week, to the prisoner and her husband, as they said; when I charged them with the watchmen, they gave their names in different; then I found he was not her husband; she was but one night in the lodging; I missed one pair of linen sheets the next night; the prisoner was out of the room when I found the sheets were gone, and the man too; they came back the second day, and she begged the watchman not to take her to the watch-house and she would produce them the next day; I told her if she would tell me where they were it would be better for her, but I never saw the sheets since; I let the lodging to her as a married woman; and she said her husband was to live with her.</p>

               <p>Were any promises made to him, or threats? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Was not he told that if you recovered your property, you would not hurt him? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes, I am positive; he confessed to the eight pieces of cambrick then missing, and five or six pieces of Irish, and three or four quantities of muslin handkerchiefs; after he confessed that these goods were at his father's and mother's house, I immediately went with two friends, and made the mother acquainted with what I came about; I requested she should give me the goods which her son confessed she had got, the mother lives in James-street, Hay-market; she asked me what I wanted? I told her the whole of my goods; she requested to know how many pieces of Irish? I told her I did not mention any number, but requested to have the whole; she went up stairs, and brought down eleven pieces of Irish; I asked her whether that was the whole? and she said it was; I told her I thought it was not, for there was a quantity of cambrick which I knew she had; she expressed herself a good deal astonished that she had not brought it down, for she said she intended it; she fetched it down; I asked her if she had any thing else? she answered no; I asked her if she had any more goods? and she said not; and on taking down the bed, I found several pieces of cambrick, Irish cloth, and some muslins; they were in the bed; it was a turn-up bed; there were some trunks, and I requested to know what there was in the trunks? and she said there was not any thing in the trunks, that the trunks belonged to her; I requested to have the keys of the trunks; and when they were opened, I found Irish cloths, cambricks, and muslins: on examining, I found they were quite full of goods; by this time, Atkins the constable arrived; and we searched the whole house, but we did not to my recollection, find any thing else besides what I have now mentioned.</p>
               <p>She keeps a cook's shop I believe? - A kind of cook's shop or eating house.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether her husband lives with her? - I believe he sleeps there; he is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280065"/>a coachman I believe; we brought home the goods on Sunday, the 4th of October; and the following day we appeared in Bow-street; and there it came out from the confession of the young man.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the mother present? - No.</p>
               <p>Then that is not evidence against her? - In consequence of that, Atkins and we went down to the father's house, requesting her to give up the duplicates; and to the best of my recollection, she said she had none; on searching, we found I think four duplicates in number, in one of the rooms; Mr. Atkins then thought it was necessary to take the mother-in-law into custody; and we brought her up into Bow-street; and I requested to see the duplicates, and the amount of them; I found the amount to be only thirteen pounds; I said it was not the whole of them; on which Mr. Atkins, and Mrs. Tucker, and myself, went down to James-street: and she immediately got on a chair, and took down a teapot, where there were thirty duplicates; I saw her do it; there were from twenty-six to thirty duplicates; we then went back to Bow-street, where they remained to be re-examined,

               <p>Were the things found in the trunk and boxes, your property? - The greatest part of them; there is my own writing on several.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. I believe this young man came to you from Mr. Mann's? - The last place he lived in before he came to me, he had lived there seven or eight months; I heard a very good character of him from Mr. Mann; I had a very good opinion of him, as good an opinion as I had of the rest of the young men in the house.</p>
               <p>You thought him an honest man? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you observe that several of these pieces were in the same manner you kept them tied up in your shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In the same manner in which if any body had purchased of you fairly, they would have had them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This young man was in the habit of carrying out goods? - Yes, he was; but I do not know that he ever waited on three customers of his own; I believe to one; not more than one.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether on any of these occasions, either to customers of your's or his own, he represented to you, that the lady wished to have the goods left till the next morning? - I cannot call that to recollection.</p>
               <p>Was he about to leave you? - He was.</p>
               <p>Did you understand whether he proposed to go into business for himself? - I never understood any thing of that kind.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was it, when he was first taken into custody? - I believe it was Saturday night or Sunday morning, about half past twelve.</p>
               <p>The mother was not taken into custody till Monday? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect her coming first to the watch-house, and afterwards to your house to see the young man? - Yes; that was on Sunday morning, about nine, ten, or eleven.</p>
               <p>She was, I believe, twice at your house? - No, I believe not.</p>
               <p>She was then apprized, I suppose, of the charge against her son? - That he was at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>On some suspicion of his dishonesty? - Yes, I believe it was.</p>
               <p>When did you go to her house? - Three or four hours after.</p>
               <p>Then, she had time enough to have destroyed the duplicates, if she chose it? - She certainly had.</p>
               <p>Was not there a bank note found upon him? - There was; he said he generally received the money for them what was pawned.</p>
               <p>There was a quantity of gold found upon him? - There were four guineas and a few shillings, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Did he say that in the hearing of his mother? - I do not know for a certainty.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280066"/>Were any of these articles altered, or played any tricks with? - Some of the cambricks; the marks had been, in a great measure, put out, and others put into their place.</p>
               <p>That could not be the work of a woman? - That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did this young man represent himself to be buying goods in the city, on credit, by which he would lay in a stock, to get some money among the customers, and to set up bye and bye? - I never understood it, any further than from the mother.</p>
               <p>Was that in his presence? - I cannot say; I never understood it, either from the mother or any other person.</p>
               <p>Journeymen in these trades, do sell a little on their own account? - I believe it is never allowed; the woman told me that her son-in-law had brought them there, and that he had once or twice represented it to her, that that was the mode by which he came by them.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect her ever saying that in the presence of the young man, and whether he did not admit that to be the consequence? - I do not recollect that he did confess it before her.</p>
               <p>Did he at any other time, when she was not present? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>It was not likely his mother in law, whom he was not plundering, should suspect him any more than you? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What was found in the house, to what value? - About one hundred and fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>And what is the value of the cambrick? - About thirty or forty pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. This woman was once admitted to go about her business and come back again? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did not she come voluntarily to the office at five o'clock on the Monday? - I believe she was in custody at that time.</p>

               <p>On the 4th of October, on Sunday, a gentleman came to the office for an officer; I went down to James-street, to Mr. Tucker's house, a cook's shop, there; one gentleman was at the door, and two up stairs; they had some things on the bed, and there was a box, which was full of things: we took away the things, and down stairs we found a coverlid; there was a bed, and the father very voluntarily said they were all the things; and the gentleman let him stay; and I took his word till the next morning; and I met him in Chandos-street, coming to the office on Monday; I fetched the woman into custody, by order of the magistrates; the magistrates were gone, and I let her go till the evening.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. She was left at home on the Sunday, and on the Monday you let her go again? - Yes, and in the evening I went to her house; I asked her for the keys, and she gave them to me; I went into the room with her, there I found four duplicates; she said there were some tickets; and I found three in the box, and one in her pocket; I asked her if they were all; and she said, yes, they were of the things in pawn for thirteen pounds odd; then I went to Mr. Priestman's, the pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>What did she say? - She said; says she, what could a parent do? and says she, immediately, if you will go along with me, I will shew you; then we went to her house, and she got on a chair, and in a tea pot I found almost thirty duplicates, some were for her own things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. On the Sunday she was left intirely at home? - Yes, on the Monday she was admitted to go, and come back again.</p>
               <p>Therefore she had obtained time to burn all these, if she thought it necessary? - No doubt of that.</p>
               <p>At the time you stated the amount of these, there was no charge against her, but against her son? - No.</p>
               <p>And then she immediately said, good God, what could a parent do? - Yes; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280067"/>father came an hour before his time to Mr. Jeremy's house.</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Fisher, a linen draper, at Holborn Bridge; on the 23d of September the prisoner came into the shop, about six in the evening, to look at some sprigged muslin; I shewed her several pieces one of which she fixed on, another that laid handy she swept off the counter with her elbow, she stood over that piece, and desired me to cut off a quarter of a yard of the other; while that was cutting off, with the heel of her shoe she

             the other under her petticoat.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it a pretty large piece? - Nine yards and three quarters; I saw all this doing; she then desired me to cut off a nail of plain muslin; the things came to two shillings and two-pence; she put her hand into her pocket for the money, at the same time I saw her lift the muslin higher up, under her stays; I suffered her to go out of the shop, and I followed her close; I stopped her, and desired her to come back, and asked her for the muslin she had concealed; when she came to the middle of the shop she seemed surprized, and denied it, and at the same time let the muslin<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280069"/>fall; as she dropped it she endeavoured to step from it, but the heel of her shoe hung in it, and she made a stumble; she still contined to deny it; I delivered her to the constable: the muslin is here; I am sure of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. You was standing on one side the counter, I take it for granted, and she on the other? - We were.</p>
               <p>Because you seem to say you saw the whole process? - I saw her sweep it off the counter.</p>
               <p>Were there other persons in the shop? - There were three or four other persons in the shop.</p>
               <p>How many might there be? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Your shop was full of customers? - No, it was not full.</p>
               <p>Perhaps in this very place there were other customers? - No, not one near me at the same counter.</p>
               <p>You did not desire her to pick it up? - No, I did not; I let her sweep it off the counter, and do what she would with it, to see whether she was a thief or not.</p>
               <p>All this seems to me to be almost impossible? - It may seem so to you, but it is true.</p>

I said, yes; says he, it is a pity you have a big belly; I said, it is no matter, I have a good father for it; says he, I wish I was the father of it; and what he has said against me, is as false as God is true.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow Prisoner's Counsel. What sort of nails are they? - Flooring brads.</p>
               <p>How long had this man been in your service? - Oh! a great while, seven or eight years.</p>
               <p>What may be the value of these things? - Five or six shillings.</p>
               <p>How much could he earn a week in your service? - His wages was eleven shillings a week.</p>
               <p>How many thousand nails do you think since he has lived with you, he has delivered out to your workmen? - In the course of these last six months I have put great confidence in him, and trusted him with five hundred pounds worth.</p>
               <p>You have one Wells, a workman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you never said that you would press against this man, if he ventured to have counsel, to ask you questions? - I only said this, I considered the man as injuring himself to have a counsel, when I mean to state nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>You thought he was injuring himself by having counsel? - I thought so.</p>
               <p>You told him, I believe, that he would? - No, I did not tell him so; this morning about half an hour ago, I told a man, Wells, what are you doing here? but I appeal to his lordship, whether I have a right to be insulted by you.</p>
               <p>Court. You seem very much to mistake your situation, you are certainly bound to answer every question the counsel puts to you, any thing that can in any way relate to this business; and the Court will stop him if he puts any improper question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now master Silk stand up; now you see you have not been yet insulted; I know you very well, and I know you understand this subject very well; what conversation had you with the witness attending to prove the defendant's cause to day? - About an hour and a half ago; I saw him and said to him, what are you doing here? I did not know then he was a witness for the defendant? says he, I am come in the cause of Jones; says I, what for; says he, I cannot say; I said, you cannot be an evidence, you was not present; says I, I think he is throwing away his money, if he means to have a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280076"/>councellor, because I shall state only the truth.</p>
               <p>That was all you said? - Yes; his brother came to me several times; I said, I shall be obliged to speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Have you never said to any body (and I desire you to be cautious in your answer) that if this man employed counsel or lawyer, you would press the more against him? - No, I did not, upon my oath, I never said I would press the more; I said, I thought I should be obliged to speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Did not you say it would be the worse for him? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Then if there was no counsel you would not speak the truth? - Since the man lias been in this unhappy situation, several stories have been told me.</p>
               <p>In the course then of the last six months he has had a most unlimited confidence placed in him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And has delivered out to your workmen numbers of things? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you have a man of the name of Wells? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where does Wells live? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Not what part of the town? - I do not concern myself.</p>
               <p>But I do concern myself? - I do not know on my word.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that he lives in a court in White-cross-street, into which street this man was going? - Upon my oath I do not know; I will take my oath I do not know where the man lived; I never heard it till you informed me.</p>
               <p>Did that man work any over hours, can you tell me? - Not that night.</p>
               <p>Had he that week? - I have no right to take notice.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that Wells was to do over-work the very next day? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Have you never heard it? - I never heard it; his master passed by at the very time I detected this man.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath do not you know that Wells, your own workman, wanted those nails for your own business? - I never heard so, never since, nor before, nor have no reason to believe it.</p>
               <p>Were they the sort of nails that Wells used in that work? - I cannot recollect; I think he was fixing up escutcheons, and then he would not want these nails.</p>

I told him, it would be but a few words, and the truth should accompany them; Mr. Silk is not my master; he employed a taskmaster to finish four small houses; he offered me a guinea a week? and I said, if he would let me have a share of the profits<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280077"/>that arose from it, and I would take it; Mr. Silk had spoke many times in the course of that week and the week before; he said, he would advance no money till his work was finished; therefore we were forced to work morning and evening, and particularly of mornings, that no accidents might ensue; we had proposed and fully intended, me and three more, to get up the next morning, and we asked the prisoner for nails; he said, he would bring some to me; I applied to him again; and he said, he would bring some; but he brought none; I did expect that he would have brought them that night; not but that there was other work, but these nails were necessary and wanting in the morning.</p>
               <p>Were these the sort of nails that you wanted? - The gentleman knows himself that these are proper nails for the business that we had to do; he had repeatedly, over and over, two or three times a day spoke these words.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the work that was to be done? - Flooring, chimney, ground-skirting.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to the constable. Are these proper nails? - They are fit most for laying of floors; they are fit for the purpose of laying floors, nothing else.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wells. Mr. Jones was not asked for them sort of nails in particular.</p>
               <p>Constable. When I was going to the Compter with him, he said, I am very sorry such a thing should happen; I do not know that I ever robbed my master of a farthing; I wish you would let me go.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; on Saturday the 26th of September, I was informed the clerk of the market's office was broke open; I went in and found the lock broke off the door, and two desks were broke open; the office is by the water side, not joining to any house, it is at Billingsgate-market; I found a man in sleep, he was not the man; but on Saturday I saw the prisoner going in and out of the publick-houses, in liquor, and spending his money very free; I took the prisoner into custody, and searched him, it was on Sunday morning about two o'clock; I found upon him half a guinea, four shillings, and some half-pence; I have kept the money ever since; Mr. Peatt came on Monday morning, and I told him, and shewed him the money; there was only one shilling remarkable, which he said he could swear to, and which he returned me again; this is the shilling; it is a crooked shilling with two sixes, or two nines each side; he could swear to it by that before my lord mayor; the lord mayor's clerk asked the prisoner whether any body was with him? he said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280078"/>no; he acknowledged the robbery to several people; I heard him say that he was by himself when he committed the robbery, that there was nobody with him; I had not said a word to him, nor did I hear any body say any thing to him to induce him, or threaten him, there or any where else.</p>
               <p>(The shilling deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>I know it by making a particular remark of the person I took it of, on the Monday morning, and putting it into the wooden bowl when the money was all out; the moment the constable shewed me the money, I took it out, and told him who I took it of.</p>

               <p>When I came from my master's house, about eight o'clock, I went out with a piece of victuals; there were two men at the door, they asked me to take a load for them to such a place, and they would reward me with a shilling? I said, I would; I asked them what it was? they said, it was some lead in a bag; I was to take it into Petticoat-lane, the corner of Cox's-square, to one Thomas's; I was to go through Spittle-square, there the patrols met me; I pitched the lead, and told them; and they took me into custody.</p>
               <p>Court to Lockwood. Did the prisoner tell you at the time you apprehended him, that he was carrying it for two men? - He did not say he was to meet any man; he said, he was carrying lead for two men, and was to deliver it there; after we taxed him with it, he said, he came from an empty house with it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Court. Who do you mean by they? - The mob; there was a great number of them.</p>
               <p>How many people do you think were assembled round the house? - I cannot exactly tell; there was a great many women at first.</p>
               <p>Was it a very large mob? - A very large one; a good deal more than a hundred people; when they rushed in upon me, (there were stairs going up to the fore door into the cellar); I ran up these stairs to the front door; I ran to go to some of our people that were guarding other houses; there were about four or five rushed in; I was glad to get off; but one man laid hold of the keg, and I ran up the stairs; and then I was pursued by all the mob; they heaved stones, and glass bottles, and every thing they could lay hold of, at me; one struck me on the leg; I could not walk for half a year; he struck me with a slint stone about two pounds weight; I observed the prisoner after the goods were taken away; he was the man that laid hold of me, and said he would have me away, that I might as well deliver myself up to him, for that I should never go home to Plymouth alive; I took out my pistol to defend myself; I threatened them, and I swore I would shoot them; the prisoner and two more enclosed me; they came nearer to me, and kept in a round circle; the stones were coming every way; I am sure the prisoner laid hold of me, and caught me by the collar; and after some time, he brought me down; when more assistance came down, they brought me down to the house of Jones; Thomas Bradley, and Ellerton, and Kay, came up; they got me away into Jones's house; and they followed me, continuing heaving stones and glass bottles; and when we got into the fore parlour, they hove stones, and broke all the windows.</p>
               <p>How many people were assembled at that time? - I could not see, but there were a great many.</p>
               <p>Was there a hundred? - Above two hundred at that time; they hove several stones in the tap-room; we were between two fires; there were some stones hove from the street, and some from the tap-room; we got in there between two and three o'clock; and it was after candle light when we got out; we were there four or five hours; we were released by the captain's officers belonging to the cutter, who rescued me, and took me on board a ship.</p>
               <p>Was you able to make any seizure on the other houses? - No; we could not make any seizure or search in the other houses.</p>
               <p>When you were in the house, did you see any thing of the prisoner? - Yes; I saw him now and then by the window, swearing what he would do to me; and that they would have me out by and by; some said they would cut me down with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280085"/>a cutlass, like a bullock; and this prisoner was the same as the rest, saying what he would do.</p>

               indicted for a conspiracy
            </rs>.</p>
               <p>Before the Jury were sworn, Mr. Shepherd, of counsel for the defendants, observed that such indictments were instituted for the purpose of preventing combinations, very dreadful in their nature and consequence. If that object could be attained without putting the unfortunate defendants in a situation of being without any resource, either for their own support, or that of their families, the ends of public justice would be answered. He thought that the object attained in this case, though there were unlawful combinations existing, and very many persons were then languishing, for similar offences, in different gaols, in the most miserable situation; he therefore threw the defendants on the mercy of the prosecutors, and the Court, undertaking they should plead guilty; and should they at any time be guilty of any sort of offence or combination, or avow any thing against the interest of their masters, then they might be brought up to receive that punishment which they would deserve; and then the hand of the law would fall upon them with all its weight. He wished to avoid the consequences of a conviction, which must inevitably be ruin, misery, and distress, to the defendants.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, for the masters, observed, that the ends of these prosecutions were attained, if the defendants were convinced that what they had done was wrong; that the masters had no wish to injure, nor any animosity against any one of the men. It was the alarming combination they wanted to suppress; and the punishment of these men must be exceedingly severe, if the masters proceeded to convict them. It was not their wish to tear them from their familles, and send them for two or three years to a loathsome gaol. He therefore said, if these men were sincere, would come into Court with that contrition which was expected from them, plead guilty, and throw themselves on the mercy of the prosecutors, those prosecutors had no wish to pursue them to a severe punishment, unless they should offend again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow said, it will be well for these men to remember, that this is not the conclusion of the business, it is only the evil day postponed. It is only punishment remitted; if they behave as good members of society, this offence will not be included in the catalogue of their sins; but if they do not, it will increase the score of their offences. These men are to understand, that if they do not offend again, they will not be brought up for punishment; but it is also to be understood, that this favour is extended to them on condition that they shall not enter into any new conspiracies themselves, but on the contrary, that they will do their utmost, by their influence and example, to prevent the like in others. In short, he added, it is a sincere repentance that we ask for, and that repentance to be shewn by their good conduct, for the benefit of the trade in general.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. - The counsel for the defendants seems to have taken a part which certainly does his feelings much honour, and I hope may be of essential service to the public. If we impose a severe punishment on the parties, when the combination is at an end, we, in fact, do an injury to the public, because we are depriving them of the advantage of a great many honest sober citizens, of men who, having once done<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280087"/>wrong, are disposed to do right. The law knows no resentment against the persons of individuals; it is the crime alone which the law seeks to punish; but if these prosecutions were to take effect, and were to punish these men, the only way would be to send them to a gaol, where, in all probability, they would form very bad connections, and the public would be very materially injured by the enforcement of these kind of prosecutions.</p>
               <p>The conduct of counsel for the masters does them equal honour, and the prosecutors have shewn lenity to these men; but at the same time that they have shewn that lenity on those grounds upon which a public man ought always to act as to individuals, they have abandoned any private resentments that might have existed in their minds against these men. In short, public advantage seems to be the only motive of these prosecutions; and the masters are now ready to shew the defendants every favour they can, upon condition of their behaving better in future. It is necessary something should be held over the heads of these people, by way of terror; and after what has been said by the Counsel for the prisoners, I should hope there will be no occasion on the part of the masters, to bring forward against them the Judgment of the Court.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280099"/>Mr. HODGSON</p>
               <p>RESPECTFULLY returns his most grateful Thanks to his Employers and Pupils, for the Preference they have thought proper to give to his Mode of teaching and writing SHORT-HAND, which he flatters himself is at once as concise and correct as any other System; he continues teaching in four Hours, by four Lessons, the whole necessary instructions in this much approved Art. He also takes Trials and Arguments with the utmost Care, which are copied so expeditiously as to be sent home the same Evening, if required.</p>

               <p>A new Edition of HODGSON'S TREATISE ON SHORT-HAND is just reprinted, Price Eighteen pence; also</p>
               <p>"SHORT-HAND CONTRACTIONS, adapted to every System;</p>
               <p>"to which are added, a Comparative Table of Alphabets, and two Extracts by way of</p>
               <p>"Specimen, with two Copper-plates annexed," Price 2 s. 6 d. Sold by J. Walmsley, Chancery-lane, and also by Bladon, Matthews, Bell, Brown, Clarke, Egerton, Fourdrinier, and all the Booksellers.</p>
               <p>Letters (post paid) from Purchasers of either of his Books, directed to Mr. Hodgson, No. 14, White-lion-street, Islington, or No. 35, Chancery-Lane, will receive immediate Answers; and all Orders from Gentlemen in the Profession of the Law, and others, immediately attended to.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen who send in haste to Islington, are requested to send a Porter, and not trust to the Stage or Penny-post.</p>
               <p>The numerous and particular Trials which have been much enquired after, Mr. Hodgson has reprinted for the Accommodation of his Customers.</p>
               <p>N. B. As many Gentlemen who have taught themselves Systems of Short-hand, not formed on this Plan, and wishing to exchange them, have found the Attempt too embarrassing; Mr. Hodgson has recently succeeded in introducing the peculiar Brevities of his System into others, without altering the Alphabets, and has found the Practice (though novel) perfectly easy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hodgson has a compleat Set of Sessions Papers, for the last thirty-three Years, to dispose of at the usual Price; or any person wanting any particular Trial, may have a Copy of it at Six-pence per Folio.</p>
