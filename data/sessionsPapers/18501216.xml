                  </hi>. I live at 40, Hercules-buildings, Lambeth. On Monday afternoon, 9th Dec, between four and five o'clock, I got into an omnibus at Charing-cross, to go into the City—the prisoner got into the same omnibus, near the Bank or Cornhill, with a man and another woman, who was dressed exactly in the same way as the prisoner—the other woman took her seat exactly opposite me, and the prisoner sat next me on my left side—I sat next the door of the omnibus—the man sat next the prisoner, on her left side—I felt the prisoner's hand in my pocket, in I should say two minutes after she had entered the omnibus—it was a pocket in my cloak, on the left side—the prisoner then leaned across, and spoke to the female who was opposite me—the prisoner had seen me put my purse into my packet after paying the conductor—when I felt her hand in my pocket, I moved, and she suddenly withdrew it—she then made a second attempt, and I distinctly saw her put her hand in and take out the purse, and she then leaned over me, looking out at the door of the omnibus—I trembled so dreadfully at the moment that I could not speak, but I touched the conductor's hand, and bid him stop the bus—I allowed her to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185012160002"/>
               <p>take the purse when she made the second attempt; there were three shil<lb/>lings in it—the conductor stopped the <hi rend="italic">bus,</hi> and I got out directly—before I got out I laid my hand on the prisoner, and said, "You have robbed me; conductor, take this woman in charge; she has stolen my purse"—she was then sitting in the omnibus, and I was standing on the step—the conductor found my purse on the floor of the omnibus, between where the prisoner and the man sat—I decidedly acquit the man of taking it, because I distinctly saw the prisoner take it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—a policeman was passing at the time, and took her into custody—the purse was found empty—the omnibus drove on with the man and the other woman.</p>

                  </hi>. I was conductor of this omnibus on the day in question. I was called by Miss Byron to stop the omnibus against St. Mary-Axe—she said she had been robbed of a purse, and wished to give the prisoner in charge—a police-sergeant being handy, I called to him, and she was given in charge—I looked into the omnibus directly the prisoner got out, and picked up this purse, and gave it to the constable—it might have been two feet and a half inside the omnibus, right in the middle of the <hi rend="italic">bus,</hi> between Miss Byron's and the prisoner's feet.</p>

               <p>—I then asked the conductor to hold the prisoner while I searched the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—he rather hesitated—I then asked the prosecutrix and her sister to hold him—the conductor made an attempt to go to the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—I told him to wait, that that was my duty; but while I turned round to ask the ladies to hold the prisoner, he reached himself in the <hi rend="italic">bus,</hi> and I saw him take the purse from where the prisoner had got up and shook herself before she got out—he gave the purse to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bookseller, of York-street, Covent-garden. The prisoner was my town traveller—his duties were to take samples round to the trade, to get orders, to enter the orders when he returned, and to bring back the samples—he was never to leave his sample-box or books at his own lodging, but to bring them back, however late—I received information, and on 25th Nov. went with a police-sergeant to Ravenscroft-street, near Shoreditch Church—I went into the prisoner's room—he was not there—I found a vast quantity of books lying about, some of them packed in brown paper, ready for carrying away; others stood in a large cupboard, half-open; and there were, I think, thirty or forty in a box—most of those in the cupboard were the "Standard Library," the "Scientific Library," and the "Illustrated Library," duplicate and triplicate copies—I am the publisher of those—I found altogether 169 books, which cost me at least 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—some of them had not been published a fortnight; they were that month's volumes, such as "Kitto's Sacred Lands," of which here are six copies; "Cicero's</p>

               <p>Offices," of which there are four copies; three of "Sewell's Horace" and "Plato"—none of these are cut—he had no business with them at his place—I had not sold them to him—he could never want back samples, or more than one copy, to show to the trade, which we call subscribing—when he has dune with them at night it was his duty to deposit them in the stock—I had not the slightest idea that he took them home—these books are mine(<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. After I had been to Taylor's house I went next morning, Nov. 26, with the sergeant to Millard's in Newgate-street—we waited till the shop was open, at nine o'clock—we went in—he was not there—I saw a great many of my books distributed in different parts, some of which had been recently delivered to the trade—I made myself acquainted with their position and went out—(it is a small crowded shop, very full of books; he sells new and old books, but virtually I should call it a second-hand book-shop)—I returned, saw Millard, and stated that Taylor had robbed me to a considerable extent; that I had creditable information that two parcels had been delivered to him the day before, about half-past one, and asked him to be so good as to produce them—he said some of them had been taken down to Clapham, and he produced one or two, which he said were part of that parcel—I think the first he produced was "Briant's Dictionary of Painters"—that was in the first parcel—I do not know the exact number he produced—I told him that that was only a small proportion of what was contained in the parcel, and I mentioned the names of some he had not produced, among others the "Book of Gems" which is in three volumes, in morocco—I cannot say that that was the first I mentioned—he then brought a few more forward—I think he said that about taking some to Clapham when he had shown me the first parcel, and I pressed him for more books—I do not know whether I had then mentioned the "Book of Gems"—I had taken a list of the books, a copy of which I have with me—I have got the original list in a little memorandum-book—this is not a list of all the books, only of a portion—when he said he had taken them down to Clapham I said, "No, I see them on the shelf"—he then preduced them, and said, "Oh I recollect, I did not take them"—I do not quite recollect what those par<lb/>ticular books were; they are here—he produced these nineteen volumes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he did not produce them all at once; I think he produced these thirteen first—I think he produced eight or ten when I first asked him about the parcels: he produced them by degrees—I cannot tell in what order they were produced—we were both very much excited, and I, not wishing to press anything hardly against him, did not notice accurately—I kept myself aloof as much as possible—I did not like to meddle with it—I know that these were the books which were contained in the first lot, which he produced by degrees—the morocco-bound books were in the second lot—I said, "Mr. Millard, these are not all; I have a list of others, which I must call on you to produce"—before that I had seen three volumes of the "Book of Gems," among others, formally fixed on the shelf, with books on each side of them; some were not—the trade price of this work is 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—a bookseller would have to pay that for them, to sell them again—he brought them forward, and said there they were, but he thought they belonged to a former parcel—they are quite new, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185012160009"/>
               <p>bound in morocco—I asked him whether he kept any account of his purchases of books in the shop—he said, "No"—I asked him what he gave for the books—he told me at first 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and afterwards, seeing I stared at the price, because they are worth more than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he said he had made a mistake, it was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that he did not know there was anything wrong; he thought Mr. Taylor was a respectable young man—I cannot say the precise order in which these things were said—in a very early part of the conversation Mr. Millard said that the books he had bought were second-hand, and he had been employed the best part of the day in cleaning them up and putting them in order—he did not speak of any particular books; he said, the books he bought of Mr. Taylor—I cannot say the precise time at which that was said; we were both excited—I cannot recollect whether it was said before the books were produced or after; I should say before, because the production of the books would have shown that they were new—none of the books he produced were second-hand—the trade value of the books he produced, as bought of Taylor, was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but the lowest possible value that could be put upon them would be 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the nineteen volumes—the price of these three volumes of "Walpole's Painters" is 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the trade.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You remember being before Mr. Jardine, at Bow-street, at the second examination, when Mr. Millard was charged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I do not recollect Mr. Jardine asking me what I could put my finger on to show any guilty knowledge on the part of Mr. Millard—I dare say he did—I do not think Mr. Jardine was about to discharge him—he was allowed to go on his own recognizances—I had not, up to that time, stated anything about Mr. Millard saying the books were second-hand, and that he had spent part of the day in cleaning them—I did not know it was of any consequence—I said that he prevaricated and I thought that comprehended all these things—when I did state it I believe Mr. Jardine said it was important, and would not allow it to be added to my deposition—our conversation lasted an hour or more, and there are many things even now which I have not mentioned—scarcely any of these works that are produced are sent to the reviewers, I do not think six—the "Book of Gems" is one of my publishing; it has not my name on it—the paper is not bad, nor are the plates very much worn—it is property that cost me thousands of pounds—Sanders and Ottley were the original publishers of two volumes, and Whittaker of the third—mine is a reprint, the paper is beautiful—I do not think this is the first time I have stated that Mr. Millard said he gave something about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the books—I stated at the first examination that he prevaricated—I had been into the shop and examined it before he came in, in the presence of his servant, who offered no objection—I went out for a few minutes, and when I returned he was there—the books were on shelves behind the counter in different places—the shelves were all behind a screen—it is an open shop—they were placed in such a position as any one walking round the counter, which any one has a right to do in a bookseller's shop, might see them—I never knew it to be the habit for persons who go out with samples or parcels of books to sell on their own account: I should not employ any one that did so—I believe that reviewers do sometimes sell the copies sent to them to review, at a less price than they are pub<lb/>lished at; I should be sorry to say it was a habit with reviewers—I</p>

               <p>should not send books again to any reviewer that did so—I have trade sales myself once a year—my books are then sold at prices considerably below the price marked to a private purchaser—a work of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., value might sell from 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to a guinea—if a work is regularly sold off it is sold for whatever it will fetch—if I have bought books at one-tenth of the original price I have sold them at the same rate—I bought "Priestley" at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a volume from Mr. Millard, and had them done up in boards, which cost me 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and sold them at half-a-crown a volume—I do not know the original published price of that work; it was printed before I was born—they were old books—there was no established price to them—there is an established price to the books which I sell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you not know that your own works are to be found in the hands of second-hand booksellers at one-third, or little more than one third of their price? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, unless they are stolen they cannot be—every tradesman knows the price of my books to a penny—it may seem to you that nothing is so uncertain as the price of books, but it is not so in the trade; it is so certain, that if you go into any bookseller's he will tell you within 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. what my books may be supplied at.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not Mr. Millard, finding that he had omitted one book which you had desired him to get back for you, go to the man to whom he had sold it, and repurchase it, and inclose it to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> After his second examination he came to me: no, I produced the book at the second examination; it must have been after the first examination—it happened in this way, I knew of that book being out of my stock unfairly; he knew it, and got it back again, and brought it to me—that was "Pugin's Floriated Ornaments"—I do not know that it is the practice with second-hand booksellers to keep no account of books bought over the counter; I have very great doubt about it; I should not like to do such a thing; I do not think any respectable man in the trade would buy books in his shop casually without keeping an account of them, and I always considered Mr. Millard a respectable man during the whole time I have known him—I think he said to me, when the books were taken down from the shelves, "Don't you consider it a little hard on me, Mr. Bohn, that I am to lose the price which I have paid to Taylor for these books?"—there is no private mark of mine on these books—my trade is very large in all the best literature of the age, from works of 500 guineas down to 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not know that works which I sell for three or six half-crowns are to be found in the smaller shops for half-a-crown; some may be got for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I charge the trade 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and they sell for the odd 2 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they purchase them in quantities, and you may buy my books for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which, if they bought only a single volume, would be 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each to the trade—a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. book of mine is 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the trade—these works fetch 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at the book sales; they are not sold at a farthing less; but if a man buys twelve volumes, he has one thrown in to make 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; that is my rule; it is not the universal rule, some give twenty-five for twenty-four—I believed Taylor to be a respectable man, or I should not have employed him—Bulwer's works are usually published at a guinea and a half the three volumes—new novels do not rank as established books—I do not sell them; but Bulwer's novels sell at a guinea and a half in large numbers, till they become printed in a cheaper form—they are sold off when he prints his shilling edition—the object of a reprint is to sell cheaper—the</p>

               <p>morocco copies of the "Book of Gems" would have cost six guineas at the first price—it is my particular province to make the books as cheap as possible, but when they have got to my cheapest price they cannot get any lower—I am not aware that the books which at the publisher's sell for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. are constantly to be met with at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—my books second-hand would fetch 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the price of new, but they must be cut open, and be second-hand—a book is second-hand if the leaves are cut—books sent to reviewers are not returned; they dispose of them as they like—there are not large quantities of those in the market, not many hundreds—the best reviewers keep them for their own libraries—I send out from fifty to eighty copies to reviewers; it varies very much; that includes newspapers, town and provincial; it is not more than that—sometimes with very valuable books we do not send out so many—I have not found in many houses in the trade, books of mine which I have not sold; I have in two or three, that have bought books of Taylor—I have not been to those persons—they have told me that they bought a few copies of Taylor, but they were gone—one bought eight volumes, which he said were second-hand, cut up—two have told me so, but one I know who perhaps ought to be in the dock.</p>

I always thought him to be a respectable young man, I did buy some books of him yesterday; they were second-hand books, and very much soiled, and it took me very nearly the whole of the day to clean them"—Mr. Bohn said, "It is no use your denying it; I have seen them here, and you had better bring them forward"—Millard then brought forward these thirteen books, and said, "That is all; I gave him two guineas for them"—I am sure he said, "That is all"—Mr. Bohn said, "No, it is not all," and mentioned the title of some other book, which I do not remember—Millard said he had taken them home with him last night to Clapham—Mr. Bohn said he had not, for he had seen them there this morning—Millard then brought forward from the back-part of his shop three books, called the "Book of Gems;" this is one of them, and again said, "That is all"—Mr. Bohn said it was not all, and gave him into my custody—Millard then went with me to the back-part of the shop, and took three other books from the table; they were "Walpole's Anecdotes of Painters"—he said, "I did not pay for them (I do not know whether he meant for the three he produced or not) I did receive two parcels from Taylor yesterday, and placed them on the table at the back of the shop, but did not untie them till just before I went home last night and left them there"—I then took him to the station with the nineteen volumes—I now produce those volumes—I took Taylor in custody at Mr. Bohn's, the night previous.</p>

Bruce—there is not, to my knowledge, any firm in Philpot-lane of the name of Bright and Green—I know Philpot-lane well—I have a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Castle Lackland's</hi> articles, which contain the names of the seamen—I do not of my own knowledge know their names—the original articles are gone to sea with the captain—I know of no such person as Henry Cook being on board the vessel—I was on board the ship nearly every morning for a fortnight before her departure, and saw nearly all the crew—they do not all generally join before the ship gets into the locks, going into the river.</p>

I was in the shop—there was a coat hanging in the door-way, strongly pinned on a brass bar—the prisoner put his hand inside, and snatched the coat from the bar—it was so pinned, that it could not slip off without it was done with force—he ran off; I followed him to Philpot-lane; he turned down there, and had got about ten yards, when I came up to him—a gentleman took hold of him before me, took the coat from him, and gave it to me—this is it; it is worth 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carrier, of Giltspur-street. On Saturday, 30th Nov., I believe the prisoner brought a couple of chests of tea to my place, but I did not see him—I went to the police-station, and saw him in custody, and a basket which I had seen in my premises about a quarter of an hour before the robbery—I suppose it had been there an hour and a half—it was directed to Mr. Bell, plumber, Leicester—when I saw it last, it was inside my premises, on the top of some packages—there is a gas-light inside the window, within four inches from where the basket was, and there is a street-lamp outside, four or five yards off—persons bringing in a parcel would pass by where this basket was—it was about a yard from the outside gate.</p>

I am in the employ of George Harker, merchant, of Upper Thames-street—the prisoner was a porter there, and had the care of the upper floor, where the pepper is kept in two bins. On 28th Nov. I went to one of the bins which he had charge of, and beside the bin I saw two bags; I did not open them—I went again on the Thursday afternoon, and one bag was gone—I went on the Friday morning, 29th, at half-past eight or nine, and there were two—I went again at twenty minutes past twelve, and the two were there still—at half-past twelve the prisoner came down to dinner—I then went up again, and there was only this one bag(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw it opened at the Mansion-house—it contained pepper—the other bag was similar ta this, and about as full.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bedstead-maker, and live at 2, Pedley-street, Bethnal-green. I knew George Smith, the deceased, he kept a beer-shop at the corner of Pedley-street, on Fleet-street-hill. On the evening of the 21st Oct. I was going home, and passing Mr. Smith's beer-shop I saw him at his own door—I know the prisoner; he is a beer-shop keeper directly opposite Smith's—Wells was with Smith, and Mrs. Smith was standing at her door—Smith said he wanted to know what became of the money that they had from the <hi rend="italic">"lead"</hi>—I do not know what a <hi rend="italic">"lead"</hi> is—he said that to Cousins—Cousins said, "I will let you know what becomes of the money;" and he up with his fist and struck him—young Cousins crossed over with his father—it was the prisoner who struck Smith—they had a very few words before the blow was struck—they had a few words after that concerning this <hi rend="italic">lead</hi> money, and Mr. Cousins there and then <hi rend="italic">butted</hi> him on the left-side, and parties that stood by said, "Cowardly, cowardly that!"—Cousens was close to him at the time he <hi rend="italic">butted</hi> him—his head touched his body as soon as he leant it down—there were other persons round; no one that I knew—when there was a cry of "Cowardly!" Cousins said it was a mistake, his foot slipped—Smith made no answer—that was all I observed—the deceased went in-doors after that, and I went home—I was standing close to Mr. Smith's door at the time this took place: I live next door to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engine-driver, and live at 10, Silver-street, Stepney-green. On Monday evening, 21st Oct., I was at Mr. Smith's beer-shop, from seven or eight o'clock till about twelve—Mr. Smith was serving and attending there—about a quarter or twenty minutes past twelve he and I went out, and went to the Seven Stars public-house, and had half a gill of gin between us; and on our return home we met with Stockings, and he asked Smith where all the money went to of the friendly; <hi rend="italic">leads;</hi> to which Smith replied, "I should like to know"—the prisoner, who was standing at his own door at the time, came into the middle of the road, and said, if Mr. Smith wished for any information he had better go to the secretary and see—Smith turned round, and said, "I am not addressing myself to you, Sir"—then the prisoner, with his son-in-law, came over to Smith's door, and while I was standing there I received a blow in the face from the son-in-law, who instantly made off—with that the prisoner's son took Smith by the neckcloth, and pinned him against</p>

               <p>the wall of his own house—directly after that the prisoner went at Smith, head-foremost, and <hi rend="italic">butted</hi> him twice in the left side, while he was held by the prisoner's son—the second time he <hi rend="italic">butted</hi> him he said his foot slipped—Smith said, "Your foot could not have slipped the second time, if it did the first"—I then released the deceased from the son's hold, and one of the constables, who was standing by, threatened to take me into custody for interfering—the constables must have seen Cousins <hi rend="italic">butt</hi> Smith as I have described—there were two policemen there, one on each side of the deceased—I did not strike the prisoner's son; I only dragged him off—I then went in to Smith's, and he came in a few minutes after—no complaint was made that night—Mrs. Smith was standing by at the time—there might be eight persons there altogether.</p>
               <p>

I knew the deceased upwards of ten years—he was not given to drink—I have been in his company a great deal, and never saw him the worse for liquor—he was in good health up to 21st Oct.—I have walked upwards of twenty miles with him on several occasions, and he has come home quite fresh and well, not the least fatigued—he was a strong, healthy man, of a good constitution—I called on him on 25th Oct., and saw a very great difference in him—he was sitting by the fire with some linseed-tea, and appeared very bad—I saw him in bed about three days before his death, but he was too ill to converse with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the College of Surgeons, and have been in practice twenty-five years. I saw the deceased on 31st Oct.—he complained of pain in the left side of his chest—I examined him—he was suffering from inflammatory action of the chest—I wished him to be bled; he objected—I proposed leeches, but he wished to try medicine first—I gave him some, and cautioned him to come to me if he was not better—on 3rd Nov. I was called to him about four o'clock in the morning—he complained of the same pain in an aggravated degree—his breathing was very difficult indeed, he was unable to lie down in bed—I bled him freely, which very much relieved him for the time, and applied a blister to his side—he was much better next day—I attended him every day—he had a relapse, and was cupped in the side on 5th Nov.; but the vital powers were going then—I was not present at his death—I did not suggest that his body should be opened—I made the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> exami<lb/>nation—death was caused by extensive inflammation of the pleura—a large effusion of water and matter had taken place, three pints and a half or four pints, which occupied the whole cavity of the left side as much as could be, the lung being compressed and displaced by it—that effusion might have been produced by a man <hi rend="italic">butting</hi> against his left side with his bead, on 21st Oct.—if he had submitted to be bled, when I first saw him, he would have had a rather better chance, but I think it would have been too late.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Inflammation of the pleura may proceed from a thousand other causes than external violence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From other causes—his constitution did not appear to be injured by intemperance—there was functional derangement of the stomach and digestive organs, when I first saw him—I then thought that phlebotomy would do much for him, but I do not now—he was a strong hale man of about forty-six—catching cold in a man who had had two fits in two and a half, or three years, in one of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185012160046"/>
               <p>which he had broken or dislocated his ribs, would predispose him to inflam<lb/>mation, which if not timely attended to, and the suggestions of the medi<lb/>cal man complied with, might end in death—the main cause of pleurisy is cold, it often produces death—he was a moderately full subject; not of a plethoric habit, but one upon which inflammation would take hold readily enough—there was no inflammation of the right lung—its being confined to the left, indicated mechanical violence—inflammation from violence it limited to the part injured, but it is not usually so when it arises from cold—if the death was caused by inflammation arising from cold, I should have expected to have seen both lungs inflamed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it an inflammation of the lungs, or of the pleura? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Of the pleura, and a small portion of the left lung—when the left side of the thorax is inflamed from cold, I should as a general rule expect the right side to be inflamed—if it arose from a draught, it would be more strongly developed on one side than the other—it might reach the other side in four or five days, but that would not be the case from a blow, it would cause mischief in the part where it was directed to—I do not mean to say that pleurisy on the left side could not happen without the right being affected; not even from cold—where the inflammation is very acute and virulent it will extend to the other side—the deceased had suffered from inflammation of the right lung at some distant period—it was carni<lb/>fied, and had adhered to the chest, but it performed its functions—he de<lb/>pended entirely on that lung, while the inflammation was going on on the left side of his chest—the left lung ceased to be useful perhaps the day previous to his death—it had gradually been approaching that state for several days—I cannot tell when the effusion began, but when it did it encroached upon the lung—inflammation might be caused by a blow, with<lb/>out any extravasation under the skin—I think there ought to have been some external mark of the blow in the early days, but I did not strip him; I felt his chest and ribs to ascertain whether there was any fracture, but found none—I did not lift his shirt—that was so long after the 21st Oct., that any external mark might have disappeared—it must have been a very violent blow—the room was dark when I examined him, and I did not particularly look for an injury—I went to treat him for acute symptoms under which he was suffering—inflammation might exist from a fortnight to a month without such an effusion of matter as I saw; I cannot say as to two months; inflammation sometimes proceeds very slowly—I cannot judge accurately—it depends on the temperament and habit of body—a man who lives incautiously is more liable to inflammation—I found all the organs of the abdomen healthy; I did not examine the head; I should have done so if he had died from a fit, but I considered I had found the cause of death, and went no further—that was my nephew's opinion also—besides cold, pleurisy may arise from intemperance, or inhaling bad air.</p>

I am in partnership with Mr. Blake, as brewers, at Baker-street, Enfield—there is an entrance-gate in Baker-street, and it was possible for a person acquainted with the premises to enter them from a field at the back—there is a counting-house in the yard with a large counting-house desk in it, with a lock and key, in which was kept a cash-box and some papers and memorandums—on Sunday, about four o'clock or half-past four I went to the desk and locked the cash-box, which contained four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, thirty-five sovereigns, and some silver, up in the desk, locked the counting-house door and took the key with me—about ten at night I went to the counting-house again, and found the door and the desk broken open and the box and money gone—I had placed the notes there on Friday, Nov. 1—I had received them from Mr. Finch, Jun.—there were marks on the door and desk—the prisoner had been in my employ as groom for two years and six months; he left on 17th Aug.—I had occasionally paid him his wages in the counting-house, and taken the money out of the cash-box in that desk.</p>

I took charge of the prisoner while Collins searched—I searched a shed at the back of the house next day, a few yards from the back-door, and found this iron crow-bar(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I compared it with the marks on Mr. Blake's door, and have no doubt they were made with it, and also those on the desk, where the impression was stronger—I returned to the station, and told the prisoner I had found an iron chisel in his shed, and it corresponded with the marks on the desk and door—he said it belonged to his mother-in-law—I said there were two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes found, and, I think I said, traced to his sister-in-law—he said, "I changed those two notes at Mrs. Edmunds' beer-shop, and I found them in Mr. Edinboro's field—that was on the 19th—Mr. Edinboro's field is about 200 yards from Mr. Blake's; it joins the road which passes in front of the prisoner's house—as you leave Mr. Blake's to go to the fields, you pass the prisoner's house first—he did not say which field; Mr. Edinboro has two or three—the fields at the back of Mr. Blake's are in a different direction, at the back of another road.</p>

I am a carpenter.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, A</hi> 227). On Saturday morning, 30th Nov., I was stationed in the Northumberland Hotel, oppo<lb/>site the shop of Mr. Cooper. About a quarter before seven o'clock I saw Turnbull leave the side-door with a basket—the front-door was closed—I followed him into Hungerford-market, and then into Scotland-yard—he went into a public-house, came out again, and went into the Horse Guards Canteen—he then went to Mr. Painter's, a butcher, in Hungerford-market—he left four half-quartern loaves there on a bench, and spoke to a person in the shop—he came out again, and went home to his master's—I kept my watch, and about half-past eight o'clock I saw him come out again with a basket—he went to Hungerford-market, stopped at Mr. Punter's shop, and took the four half-quartern loaves and put them into his basket—he then went and delivered some bread in Hungerford-market, at Long staff's public-house—he then went to the Strand, and to King William-street—he was joined by M'Donald—they went to a public-house in King William-street—M'Donald then carried the basket—they went down the Strand, and to Cecil-street, and delivered bread at several places—they then went into James-street, Adelphi—Turnbull was then carrying the basket, and he put it on the ground, and took out two loaves and gave them to M'Donald, who took them, and walked towards the Strand—I followed, and asked what he had—he said he had two loaves, which were given him by a young man he knew—I said, "Are you certain they are the young man's property?"—he said, "I don't know"—I took him into custody, and handed him over to Harris—I went to Mr. Cooper's shop, found Turnbull there, told him I was an officer of police, and asked him who the young man was that I saw with him in the Strand—he said his name was Donald; he did not know his other name—I asked him if he left any loaves at the butcher's shop—he said, yes, he left two—I told him I should take him into custody, and I did—I said I saw him give two loaves to the man in the Strand—(I did not know his name at that time)—he made no reply—while I was taking him to the station, he said, "I will confess; I have been led into it"—he said, "Is he up?"—I told him he was—he said, "That is right"—I produce these two loaves, which I got from M'Donald, when I took him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live at No. 12, Northumber-land-street, in the Strand. Turnbull was in my employ on 30th Nov., and had been so for six or eight months—it was part of his duty to take bread out for me to the Horse Guards, and other places—he had to go to the Horse Guards at half-past six or a quarter before seven o'clock in the morning, because the men had to go to stable—he had no right to employ any one else, and he had no necessity for it—he had never made any com<lb/>plaint to me of having more than he could do—he had no right to give my bread away—these loaves are mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You have not the shadow of a doubt about these loaves? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not the slightest—Turnbull has not been in the habit of selling bread to strangers, and accounting for it; I never remember his doing so—he takes a quantity of bread out, but I know all the customers—if he were to sell a loaf or two he might account to me for the money if he could not make up the number which he took out—when he came back that morning, I borrowed a shilling of him to make up change—his wages were as much bread and flour as be could consume, his lodging and 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I never reckoned how many quartern loaves he consumed; I never looked so closely after him—I do not think I returned the shilling I borrowed of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am learning the business of a brass-finisher. I worked in the house in which Shaw lived, 4, Great Charlotte-street, Black-friars-road, Mr. Burnham's—I have seen Badcock and Shaw together several times—I was outside the door where Shaw lived, in Oct., three or four days before the robbery (he did not work at that place, he occupied a room there)—I heard Badcock tell Mr. Shaw he had seen <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi>, who told him the robbery would come off on the Saturday night, and <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi> had told him he had taken the impression of the key, and had given it to the men; that <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi> had told him to meet him on Saturday night, and he would give him something, or let him have something, I do not know which, to which Mrs. Shaw made some observation, I do not know what—I know Clinton—I have several times seen him in the company of Badcock and Shaw, I cannot say how lately; it might be three weeks or a month before the robbery—I have seen Clinton come to the place where Shaw lived.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, S</hi> 296). On 2nd Dec. I was on duty in Acre-lane, near King's Cross—I saw Goodman come out of the dust-yard at twenty minutes past eleven o'clock—he bad these two pieces of timber—I watched him to a beer-shop kept by Hiron—I saw him go into the house, and be returned in half a minute, with Hiron—Hiron took up this large piece of timber—he said, "This is a fine piece of wood, I shall give you a pot for this"—Goodman said, "Here is another piece"—Hiron said, "I shall give you a pint for that"—Hiron took the large piece, and carried it to the wash-house, and Goodman took the other, and followed him; both the pieces were thrown into the wash-house—the two prisoners then went into the beer-shop—I stood in the road, and saw Goodman drinking from a pint-pot, in front of the bar—he then came into the road, and I said, "What was it you took to the beer-shop?"—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "I know better than that"—he then said, "If the truth must be told, I have taken two pieces of timber"—I said, "Whose is it?"—he said, "My master's; I am watchman to Mr. Jay"—I told him he must go with me—he said, "What for?"—I said, "You know what for, these two pieces of timber"—he said, "Let me go back to fasten up the shed, where the tools are"—I took him to the wash-house, and showed him the two pieces of timber—he then said, "Here is a bottle of beer that I had for it"—I took the bottle from him, this is it, I then went to the front-door, and saw Hiron—I said to him, "I have taken this man for stealing two pieces of timber belonging to his master"—he said, "I gave a pot of beer for it"—I said, "You gave three pints"—he said, "Drink the beer, and have some more to it"—I said that was not the way I did my business—I took Goodman, and went next morning to Hiron, and told him to go before the Magistrate, as a witness; and then, by the Magistrate's order, he was placed at the bar.</p>

                  </hi>. I am errand-boy to Mr. Miller. The prisoner left there about two months ago—he was pressman, and used to work at the cases and presses sometimes—on a Monday morning, about five weeks ago, since he has left, when I came to the premises at half-past seven o'clock, I found him there—he showed me where the key was, and then left—he had come to me on the Sunday, and said, Jane, who is the mother of Mary Ann, had sent him for the key—I was present when the foreman locked up the premises on the Saturday night, about half-past eight, and he then gave me the key—my master came home on the Monday, between twelve and one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Pearce, at 203, Holborn; we are opticians and dealers in pictures.

               <p>named Jocelyn, which he offered to deposit with me as security—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced by Walker</hi>)—he said he had taken it for pictures, and he had not parted with it, because he would not pay discount for it, that he might have the whole of the money to receive when it came to maturity—he said I might apply about it, and gave me a written direction, "Mr. Newnham, Bomshen, near Macclesfield, Cheshire," as the acceptor of the bill, and the name of a manager of the London and County Joint-Stock Bank at Worthing, who would answer any questions as to respectability—he had before that written his own address, in my presence, "28, Great Pulteney-street"—I did not on that occasion ask him where he lived, because I took it for granted that was right—he said he occupied the ground and first-floors, and that the furniture was his own—I was to write into the country about the bill of exchange, and he then left me—on the 11th he came again, and wished to take the picture in question, by Backhayser—he wished to show it to a young nobleman—I told him I had not received any answer from Cheshire or Worthing; and he said it was strange I had not—this memorandum (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was then drawn up; it was dated 11th, but altered on the following day to 12th—he expressed a desire, in the event of the young nobleman requiring the picture to be left beyond the night, to retain it; and I said, "Certainly not"—he said there was not time to get a decision: he left without it—it was the middle of the day—he called again, earlier, on the 12th, for the picture, and signed the memorandum I had drawn up on the 11th, and the 11th was altered to 12th—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "Heceived of Messrs.

               <p>towards Marlborough-street office, to give information, and as I came to the corner I saw the prisoner—he bad evidently seen me before, and was all but into a public-house—I could just see it was him, but could hardly be certain till I got into the public-house, where I collared him, and said, "You are a swindler, and I will give you in charge to the first policeman I meet"—he begged me not to do so, and said if I would go to St. Martin's-lane he would give me the picture—I walked with him, looking about, but did not see a policeman—just as we got through St. Martin's-court, he rang the bell of an attorney, Mr. Columbine—a person opened the door, and he or the prisoner beckoned me in—I refused to enter, and, seeing a police-inspector passing, I beg ged him to come—he came in—we went up-stairs—I saw the prisoner and a clerk there, and I said, "This person has brought me here for the purpose of giving me a picture"—the clerk said, "We have no picture; we do not know him;" and I gave him into custody—this is the picture(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—believe it cost me 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should not have parted with it had I not believed what he represented was true.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, King-street-terrace, New North-road, Islington. I am not out of employment—I have been convicted of felony two years ago, and suffered six months' imprisonment, which expired on 28th Feb., 1849—about two months after I came out of the House of Correction, I went into the prisoner Newham's service—he knew I had been suffering imprisonment—he worked at the same place as I did—he left before me, and I took his place—in consequence of something I saw at Newham's, I wrote a letter to the prosecutor on 15th Oct.—this is it (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>)—about the latter end of Nov. I saw Knight the officer—I afterwards had an interview with Newham—I told him that an officer had stopped me on the way from Mr. Elliott's and told me he wanted a word of confidence with me; it was at the corner of Bishopsgate-street; that he told me he could not ask me in the street, but must take me into a parlour or coffee-house, or wherever I liked to go, and I told Newham I thought it was not all right; some one had written a letter, and he had shown it to me to ask if I knew anything about it—Newham said he believed it to be <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> Channon, another young man who used to work there previous, and wished me to go there and see if he knew anything about it—he said he had only got a few things at his house, what few he had got he would put on one side—when I came in the morning he asked me whether I had been up to Channon—I told him I had, and he knew nothing at all about it—Newham said he had taken what few things he had away, in case there was anybody watching him—he said he did not feel at all satisfied about it, he could not get on with his work for thinking about it, that he had taken the duplicate of the cutting gauge, and the parcel he had taken the night previous—about nine months ago I heard Jones ask Newham if he could do anything with a cutting gauge (it is for cutting leather)—New<lb/>ham said he was in want of a thing of the sort, and he would give 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I saw it at Newham's about a week afterwards, and heard Jones tell Newham he had better keep it in the house in case Mr. Lane (Mr. Elliott's foreman), or any one from the house, should come down and see it—I have seen that gauge used, and on one occasion I pledged it at Mr. Atten<lb/>borough's, at the corner of Long-alley, by Mrs. Newham's directions, and she has pledged it herself—I know Mr. Kite—he is a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> proprietor—Newham told me about five or six months ago that he had an order for harness from Mr. Kite, and Jones came down and told him in my presence he had got an order for a set of brass <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> harness—he asked Jones if he could get him the furniture—that is the buckles, rings, &amp;c.—Jones asked him when he wanted it—he said in the course of a few days—Jones said, if he could manage it he would get it—two or three days, after Jones came and asked me if I knew where Newham was—I took him to him, at Mr.</p>

               <p>Cook's public-house, about a hundred yards off—Jones took a set of fur<lb/>niture out of his pocket in brown paper, and slipped it along to Newham on the seat—Newham gave it to me to take home, and told me to make it up in the harness for Mr. Kite—I cut it, and made up part of it on this harness (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—all these small buckles, the terrets, and this buckle are part of the set Jones brought—Jones brought some ornaments the next week—I put some of them on the harness—these are them—I took some off again, as Mr. Kite objected to them, and put on these roses instead—I remember Newham giving Jones an order when he had to make a set of silver cab harness—he asked Jones if he could get him the furniture—he said he would—part of the furniture on this plated harness (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was brought by Jones to the shop—these small buckles, a horse's head like this, and these tug buckles—I helped to make it up, and it went to Mr. Kite's—these roses and other ornaments were brought with the brass ones—I think eight ornaments were put on—there are seven here—they precisely correspond with these five produced—I heard Newham tell Jones that Mr. Kite objected to the stars and the rosettes in front, and in consequence of that, twelve orna<lb/>ments were afterwards brought, and some of them put on—about six or eight weeks ago, I heard Newham tell Jones he had got an order for three compo brushes for Mr. Bell, a publican of Brick-lane, and he asked him if he could get them—Jones said he would if he could—I do not know whether they were brought or not—I am not in Newham's service now—I was working for him when he was apprehended.</p>

I followed Jones in the same way from his master's, and left him at Newham's workshop—on 28th Nov. I saw Huntley in Union-street, at the corner of Bishopsgate-street—I took him into a parlour there—on 29th Nov. I took both pri<lb/>soners, Jones in Mr. Elliott's warehouse, and Newham in the counting-house—I told them the charge—they both denied any knowledge of it, and to the best of my recollection Newham said it was all a lie—I went to Mr. Kite's, and got these two sets of harness—I searched a room occupied by Newham, a front parlour at 35, George-street, and found these five rosettes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in an old mug on the side-board—in consequence of a communication from Huntley, I went to Mr. Attenboro's, and found this gauge—I produce it, and also these compo brushes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to John Hawkins Elliott, of 4, Mattin's-lane, Cannon-street, saddler and ironmonger; he furnishes the furniture and ornaments for harness. Jones was in his service—Newham used occa<lb/>sionally to do work for Mr. Elliott at his own place—in the early part of Feb., I missed a gauge from the stock, and believe this to be it—I believe these terrets and buckles on this brass furniture to be his—on this plated furniture here are three kinds of plating—they would not be sold as a set, they are odd pieces—it is very unusual to have plated furniture for <hi rend="italic">cabs,</hi> it is so expensive—these buckles are plated on German silver—the rosettes and ornaments do not correspond—here are two very peculiar buckles on this kicking-strap, and on this hip-strap are two German silver buckles, not plated—here are two ornaments plated on iron—the price of these buckles plated on German silver is 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each; ordinary ones plated on iron would be about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—we had such in stock—Jones had access to them—sometimes work was given to Newham to make, and sometimes he found his own leather, but on all occasions we found furni<lb/>ture—it was Jones's duty to take furniture or ornaments to him—these brushes are Mr. Elliott's; one is marked "4," and the other "O. 4," and has "Elliott" stamped on it—the "4" is the maker's mark—they are worth 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, and the gauge 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—as far as Mr. Elliott was concerned, Jones had no business to be at Newham's on 14th Oct.—I took precautions to prevent his going there about the latter end of Oct., after the receipt of the letter—I have missed property for the last twelve months—these five</p>

               <p>ornaments are all alike, and are the same as those on the plated harness—we had such—I have not missed them—the prisoners have not bought a dozen of them of us—on the day Newham was apprehended, I sent for him—Mr. Elliott said to him in the counting-house, "I have received a communication that I am being robbed, and you are removing the goods, and the communication names a cutting-gauge;" and then we both spoke to him, and said, "And another article was silver furniture"—he replied, "I never made a silver harness for any one except Mr. Elliott;" and then after a pause, he said, "Except the one I am now making"—I then left him.</p>

On Saturday, 7th Dec, about nine o'clock in the morning, I hung up a pair of cord trowsers outside the shop—I saw them safe about five in the afternoon, and missed them between eight and nine at night—I did not see them again till Lush brought them on Monday—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are very peculiar cord, different to what is generally used in slop trowsers—there is a pin left on them with which the ticket was pinned on—the private mark is gone, but the stitches are left.</p>

On Saturday, 7th Dec., between eight and nine o'clock, I was standing against Mr. Willett's window, and saw the prisoner pull a pair of cord trowsers down, which were hanging up by the side of the window; he doubled them up, put them under his arm, and walked down the Romford-road with them—I did not know him before, but am sure he is the man—about a quarter of an hour after, I met Lush and gave him information—I did not give notice to any person in the shop.</p>

I saw the two prisoners on the Greenwich-road, between twelve and one o'clock—Williams had a bundle on his left arm—I followed them, and saw Williams go into Hitchcock's shop—Jones waited for him outside—they then went to the Eight Bells public-house, and had some gin—Williams then went back to Hitchcock's, and came out with a handkerchief tied round his arm; he gave it to Jones, who put it into his pocket—I followed them, and asked what they had sold—Williams said, his own property—I asked where he got it—he said he had bought it three months ago—I had my doubts, and told him he must go the station—on the way, Jones shifted from the left side of me to the right, about four doors from the station—I searched him, and missed the handkerchief which I had seen in his pocket about a minute before—I went back to the place where he had shifted from me, and there found it in an area—I found on Williams 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and this string, with a fish-hook attached to it—Williams said these three handkerchiefs were his, he had bought them three months ago—they are quite new—Jones said that he met Williams on London-bridge, who asked if he knew where he could sell the things, and he took him to a place at Deptford.</p>

I am gardener to Mr. John Alexander Hankey, of Roe<lb/>hampton, in the parish of Putney; I reside with my family in the gar<lb/>dener's house, on Mr. Hankey'a premises; it is my dwelling-house. On Sunday morning, 20th Oct., about a quarter to eleven o'clock, I and my family left the Cottage, and went to Church—I locked up the house, and left no one in it—I returned from Church about a quarter to one—I put the key in the lock, but before I unlocked the door I discovered something the matter with the wash-house window—a stone bottle which I placed there the day before, instead of being on the ledge as I had left it, was standing on the ground—the casement had been forced out by some instru<lb/>ment, and was set down inside—I afterwards found a spud lying in the sitting-room with which it might have been done—to the best of my belief that spud had been in the cow-house where the tools are kept, sixty or seventy yards from the cottage, when I went to Church—the prisoner had formerly been under me as gardener in the service of Mr. Poulett Thomp<lb/>son, the proprietor of the premises, and would have an opportunity of knowing that the tools were kept there—when I got into the house, I found it in confusion, and things strewed about—I missed a watch, a pair of trowsers, a waistcoat, a gold 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-piece, a rupee, a seal, two purses, some small silver and copper money, some handkerchiefs, a case of razors, and other things—in the spring of this year I had had some conversation with the prisoner about this rupee—he had lately returned from India, and I showed it to him, and asked him about Indian money—the value of the property I lost is 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this is the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-piece, and this rupee is similar to the one I lost—mine was of the present reign—this is all the property I have found—I had been in the habit of seeing the prisoner up to Sept., but I have not seen him since—I believe he was employed on the railway—I cannot be certain whether I ever showed him the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-piece—when I showed him the rupee, I took it from my desk in the sitting-room, and the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-piece was there also, and they were taken from that desk on this occasion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Joseph Christmas Folkard, a pawnbroker, New Bridge-street, Vauxhall. On 3rd Dec. I received information about half-past eleven in the morning, and went about seven doors down Harleyford-road, and came up with the prisoner Gardner—I said, "You will excuse me, Madam, but you have got something that does not belong to you"—she said she had not—I lifted her shawl on one side, and took from under her right arm this shawl: it is my master's; I know it by the pattern, and there is a private mark on it—I had told a person the price of it half an hour before—it was then hanging across a rail which goes along the door, inside the shop—I took her back to the shop—she begged I would not give her in charge, and cried a good deal—she said she did not take it, and begged I would forgive her—Rawson was brought back by one of our young men.</p>

I was outside Mr. Folkard's window—the prisoners were both there together, looking in at the window—I saw Rawson pull the shawl from the rail a little way, so that it touched the ground—he then left it, and went and spoke to Gardner—I went on to the next window, and saw Rawson pull the shawl down in the doorway, and throw it to Gardner, who put it under her arm and went down Harley-ford-road—Rawson went towards South Lambeth—I have no doubt he is the man and Gardner is the woman—I went into the shop directly, and gave information.</p>

In June and July, 1849, I was anxious to get a child into the Orphan Working School, and came in communication with the prisoner in that respect—she said, "I have a great number of votes at my command, but I cannot afford to give them gratuitously; if you can assist me in getting a person in whom I am interested, into the Governesses' Benevolent Institution, I can get your child into the Orphan Working School"—I told her I had no money of my own, and no one to whom I could apply except my sister, and she had assisted me so much since my husband's death that I doubted if she could—she had said she wanted a subscription to the Governesses' Institution, and could command 700 votes for the Orphan Working School, and for that she should want three guineas and a half, which were to be applied in purchasing proxies for the Governesses' Institution—when I told her about my sister she said, "You do not know what she might do if you were to try, to benefit the child"—I wrote a letter, gave it her, and she took it to my sister—she called again next morning, said my sister had given her a guinea and a half, and gave me this "I O U" for 300 votes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I believed she had the votes—she said in a fortnight or less my sister was to send her down another</p>

                  </hi>. I was cook on board the <hi rend="italic">Garland Grove</hi>, now lying in the East Country Dock. On Monday, 25th Nov., I had had a little drink, and was charged by the mate with an assault on him—I was taken before the Magistrate on the Tuesday—on the Sunday I had seen the prisoner at the ship, and we had some drink together—on the Tuesday I was ordered to find bail—the prisoner came to the station, and said he had tried to get two men as bail for me, but the Magistrate would not take them—he asked what I was going to do with my wages and my things—I said I would send to Mr. Eldon, who I lodged with, to look after them—I told him, as he had been a friend to me, under my mattress he would find a belt, with two half-crowns in it, which he was to bring to me—he did not bring them—I did not see him till he came to me at Horsemonger-lane—I was discharged, went on board the ship and received my wages, two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes—I gave the prisoner one 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a piece for the two <hi rend="italic">bailers</hi>, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for himself—he got out of the ship, and said, "Come on, I will show you where your things are"—I said, "Who told you to take them out?"—they were the things I had left in the vessel—we went to a public-house to get change for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note—the master said he could not change it, and the prisoner and one of the <hi rend="italic">bailers flew</hi> out—the other stopped, and I</p>

               <p>said, "Let me see where the things are"—they said, "There are the things"—I <hi rend="italic">overhauled</hi> them, and missed a jacket, a double blanket a canvas bag of clothes, and some fat, which was safe in the ship when I left by the side of the bag of clothes—when I asked him what he had done with the two half-crowns, he said they were two pieces of wood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sailor, on board the <hi rend="italic">Garland Grove.</hi> The day after Hush was given in charge the prisoner came on board the vessel for the belt to find some money to get the cook something to eat—I went with him to the forecastle to the cook's bed-place, and saw him take the belt, but nothing else—he left it and said, "There is something in it, that is what I want"—he came again next day, and said he had come for the cook's things—I went with him to the forecastle, and he told me to see he did not take anybody else's things—he took the cook's new white bag, which appeared full, his chest, the fat, and some dirty things, which he put in an old bag, the bedding and blankets—he left the ship, and I saw no more of him.</p>

On the Thurs<lb/>day before I was before the Magistrate, the prisoner came to my house, and brought a chest, mattress, rug, and a lot of dirty clothes and cooking utensils—I did not see any blanket—I cannot tell how many bags there were—he said they belonged to the cook—I had seen him before, and understood he was in trouble, and the prisoner asked me for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the clothes, which I lent him—he said it was to pay his expenses, and the <hi rend="italic">bailers</hi>, and to get the man out, and bring him down again to the ship—the things were locked up in our store-room, the key of which generally hangs in the bar—the cook came with the prisoner that evening, and was shown the things: he looked over them next day, and missed some of them—I cannot say whether the room had been locked all the time between.</p>
