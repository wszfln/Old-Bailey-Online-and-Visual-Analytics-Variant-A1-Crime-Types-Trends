Gilkes;" believing that to be the genuine signature of Mr. Gilkes, I gave the boy a 50 cheque-book, with a series number of £5068—all the cheques in that book bore that same number—these, two cheque marked B and C are two cheques from that book—one is for four guineas, payable to G.

I am chief constable of Exeter—I received on 12th March a warrant for the arrest of the prisoner, signed by Sir James Ingham, and on 17th I went with two officers to the prisoners house; I remained in the street—as soon as the prisoner saw the officers I saw him jump out at the top window, a distance of about 20 feet, into a place called Paragon Place—he then ran round a distance of about 50 yards into South Street—I stopped him—he had no trade of his own of any kind; he lived at 32, Magdala Street, his mother's house was at 4, Mermaid Yard, Somers Town—I took him by train to London—he said "Can you toll me, Captain Bent, how many cases they are going to bring against me?"—I said "I only know of one at present, that is named in the warrant, Harrison, of Middlesex"—he said "There are other cases I fear"—he also said "How much do you think I shall get?"—I said "I do not know."</p>

Watney and Co., brewers—the Admiral Rodney's Head belonged to them—in November, 1879, it was purchased by Mr. De Caville from a Mr. Ellis—after the purchase by De Caville I found the license was transferred to Hands—De Caville requested that Hands should be accepted as tenant, and he was accepted; in December he was our tenant—I remember Mr. Abingdon, his brother, and Mr. Greenway coming to see me about the transfer on 7th December—the agreement for the sale from Hands to Abingdon for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was shown to me; I did not see the agreement for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I had not heard of it at that time—I called Mr. Abingdon's atten<lb/>tion to the term of the lease being only about a year and a half—Greenway was the principal spokesman—he asked Mr. Abingdon if he would go on; Mr. Abingdon considered, and then, in answer to my question, he said he would go on with it—Greenway's name and business were brought in to me at first by a clerk—I asked Greenway or Abing<lb/>don the price of the furniture; I do not recollect the answer—Mr. Wilcox attended afterwards to the transfer—a day or two after the appointment to transfer, Hands had notice to quit—the house was after<lb/>wards transferred and sold to Mr. Harris for 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., including the furniture, "<hi rend="italic">all at,"</hi> as it is called.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think the brewers take the lease direct from the Duke of Westminster—I cannot say for how long the lease was—I have been in the brewery six or seven years—the agreements are conditional upon the brewers accepting the tenant—De Caville paid 225<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the</p>

               <p>lease—I know Hands was in business at Croydon; he was distinctly our tenant—I do not know that De Caville increased the value of the busi<lb/>ness; people do take public-houses, improve the business, occupy for a short tune, and sell for a larger sum—Abingdon had every opportunity of deciding whether he should go on or not—as far as I saw, Mr. Green<lb/>way acted as broker—I believe I knew him by sight, I am not sure—I gave directions to put in an execution, I think in January—there was an ar<lb/>rangement that if the house was sold, half the amount claimed should go to Mr. Abingdon; that was promised to Mr. Hands.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not know 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been paid as deposit on this house—if I had known the price of the house was 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the matter would have stood upon a different footing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am senior collector at Messrs. Watney's—on the 20th December I attended at the Admiral Rodney's Head to carry out the transfer; I saw Frederick Abingdon, Green way, Henry Hands, and Mrs. De Caville—Abingdon asked to speak to me in private; I said I preferred to speak in public; Greenway said "It is all right, Mr. Wilcox, here is the agreement"—Abingdon was out of temper—Green<lb/>way produced the agreement to purchase for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said "This agree<lb/>ment, Mr. Abingdon, appears to be perfectly correct, have you given any more?" he said "I have"—I said "What are you giving for it?" he said "400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Greenway said "Yes, it is perfectly right, Mr. Wilcox"—I replied to Mr. Abingdon that he had no right to give any more, and that he had done wrong—he said "Here is the receipt for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it was for this room of furniture;" that was the room we were in—the goods were enumerated; they were purchased of Mr. Ellis—I said to Green<lb/>way "These things appear to be worth nearer 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. than 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" Greenway said "That is a matter between themselves," or words to that effect—I said "My instructions are that the price was 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and not 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I must consult Messrs. Watney before I allow the thing to go on"—I consulted them the next morning—the next day (the 21st) a distress was put in for rent; the man remained in possession till the place was let to Mr. Harris—Mr. Harris paid 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., "<hi rend="italic">all at</hi>"—15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was, I should think, about the value of the furniture—I remember the house being purchased by De Caville from Mr. Ellis for 225<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., "<hi rend="italic">all at</hi>;" it was worth about that as a going concern.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The sale for 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was in February—on 21st January notice to quit was given to Hands; at that time 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was due for arrears of rent up to the Christians quarter—the house was closed about six weeks before we sold it—we received about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for rent when De Caville took it from Ellis—the debt to Watney's upon the house was about 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—De Caville had increased the indebtedness to the firm; he owes about 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went to see how the business went on every 28 days—the house was doing in the way of trade from 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week; that would be in the takings of all lands—the brewers' payments were about 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month; the distillers' and pale ale brewers' would bring it up to considerably more, but not to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—I had no idea Hands was in difficulties—I would not allow the change to go through unless every<lb/>body got their money ready—I postponed the change, for inquiries—up to the time of my leaving the Admiral Rodney's Head Mr. Abingdon said he was quite willing to go on.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Dated 17th December, pay Henry Hands or order</hi> 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">signed Greenway and Kars<lb/>lake.</hi>) Greenway went away for the money; he returned in about two hours—120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was put down on the table in paper—De Caville counted it and put it in his pocket—I did not see the other 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the previous Tuesday De Caville said he had sold the house for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that Mr. Abingdon had agreed to pay 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the furniture in one room, because it was desirable that the brewers should not know the house was sold for more than 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know the signature to this agree<lb/>ment—I never gave any one authority to sign my name; I was never asked for it; on the contrary, I was promised that my name should never be used; De Caville promised me that—I signed this document because Greenway and De Caville represented it was necessary, the house being in my name—Green way produced it from his pocket (<hi rend="italic">The receipt for</hi> 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—I never received any money at all—the 17th was the first time I saw Greenway.</p>

               <p>o'clock, I was in Courtfield Gardens having a conversation with four other constables; I heard a sharp snap, a subdued report, at the of Court-field Gardens, at the other end of Cromwell Road—after that I saw a flash, and heard another report, but the Cromwell Road being dark I could not exactly distinguish the position—I ran down to the place, and when I got as far as Courtfield Gardens I saw as man running close under the railings—I ran after him; there was no one in front of me at that moment—I think subsequently Constable Copper was—I saw the man fire two shots in the direction of Cooper's head—I could see it distinctly; at the same time he said "Come on, I have got some more of you"—those two shots were fired in quick succession—he then fired another shot rather more to his left—he said them "you can have another"—he then turned to the left again, and passed by the vicarage, ad reached St. Jude's Church—I and Copper still pursued him; after that I heard another shot fired; I saw the flash; it appeared to incline towards the centre of the road, to my right—the man then ran a plank leading to an unfinished building on the south side of the gardens—I ran round to the back, and watched, but no one came out—I gave directions to the other officers—the prisoner is the man who fired the shots, and went into the unfinished buildings.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a daughter of the last witness, and assist her—on Tuesday, 8th March, about 6.30, I found Mr. Henry's office open—I went in, saw the drawers in Mr. Henry's office open, and fetched my mother—I saw the prisoner at the second door with my mother—she said "A gentleman has called for Mr. Henry," and asked him where he had been to—he said "Upstairs"—my mother said "The gentleman has left his card"—I looked over the banisters, and saw the prisoner going down the steps, with an umbrella in his right hand—it was not my umbrella—I do not know whose it was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of E. W. Henry and Co., of Queen Victoria Street—the prisoner was in our service; we had the character of his family—on Wednesday, 9th March, on going into my office, I found two or three people round a desk which had been broken open, and the prisoner among them—I said to him "What do you know about it, you were here last?" he said "I know nothing"—I said "Well, did you lock up last night at the usual time?" he said "Yes"—I said "Did you deliver the keys at the Safe Company's office?" he said "Yes"—I said "Did you post the letters?" he said "Yes"—I said "Did you come back again to the office?" he said "Yes"—I said "How did you expect to get in, seeing that you yourself locked the door?" he made no answer—I said "What did you come back for?" he said "When crossing Southward Bridge on my way home I remembered that I had left my stick, and went back for it"—Mary Ann Underwood said "You did not take away a stick, you took away an umbrella"—I then walked into my room and found that my umbrella was gone—I said "You had better tell us all you know about it, as I am very anxious not to do anything, and you had better think of it while I am reading my letters"—in about half an hour I came back; he still said that he had nothing to say, and repeated "You cannot prove anything against me"—the conversation was in Mr. Clements's presence—I then sent for a policeman, who came—I showed him the desk, which had been burst open, and told him what the boy said—he went to the prisoner's house and came back—I expressed great diffidence about giving the prisoner in charge; I said to him "If you won't tell us anything I shall send you to a place where you will be compelled to tell," and told the detective that he must take him—all through the morning the prisoner again and again repeated that we could not prove anything against him, and his mother came and he said the same thing—that was in Mr. Clements's presence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was examined at the Mansion House—I think I mentioned there his saying that we could prove nothing, but I am not sure, and I believed I told Sir R.

               <p>refused to take him—I gave him in custody about 3 o'clock; he had been in the office all the morning—he said that he had been at his old school till 10 o'clock; I believe that was found to be true—I have not left that out purposely; I was not aware that I had not said it—it appeared material to me then to know where he was the night before—I was naturally anxious that the boy should have fair play, and I bailed him out at the Mansion House myself—I would not prosecute him—I do not repudiate the prosecution—I gave him in custody—I did not lock him up—the authorities did that—I am not laughing—I gave him in custody—I said that it would be a good thing for him to be locked up—I am the prosecutor—his mother came and asked me not to charge him—I told her I would not if he would confess, and she offered the money to me—I said that I could not take it unless he said that he took it—I don't think I said that if he would confess I would not lock him up—he said that he had gone back to the office to get the brown paper in which his lunch was wrapped, and which his mother had particularly told him to bring home—I had no reason for not telling you that—I keep back nothing—his mother, told me that she had particularly told him to bring the paper home in which his lunch was wrapped—he came with a very good character of his household—I have not inquired into his character since—I think he has got into bad hands—he said that if I would withdraw the prosecution Mr. Freshfield, the solicitor to the Bank of England, would send him to sea.</p>

About 6.30 on this morning was on duty at the lock side, Limehouse, and met McDonald, who said "Come and take a man in custody who is trespassing on my barge"—I went with him, and found Evans lying in the barge's hold bleeding rather profusely from wounds on his head, but perfectly sensible—he said "This man has assaulted and robbed me," pointing to M'Donald, who immedi<lb/>ately said "You take him in custody for trespassing on my barge"—we went to the station together, and on the way mat Costello with Robinson—M'Donald said "A woman has been stabbed outside Moore's public-house, and I believe this is the man," pointing to Evans, who made no answer—M'Donald said "I followed the woman along the Horseferry Road to a doctor's shop. I did not follow her the whole way there, but I turned back again and went on board my barge, and then found this man Evans lying at the bottom of my barge, and not knowing what he was there for I went into my cabin and got this stick for protection, but seeing that he was bleeding from the head I ran for a policeman"—I did not hear what passed at the station.</p>

He has also stabbed me in the left hand. I struck him with my hitcher, and he fell down the hold of my barge; I have stunned him"—I gave directions to Costello, who returned with McDonald, Robinson, Evans, and another constable—Evans was first put in the dock, and M'Donald said "I will charge this man with being on board my barge for an unlawful purpose, I found him asleep on top of some empty casks on board my barge; I gave him one on the head with this stick, and he fell down the hold"—he had this stick in his hand—Evans pointed to M'Donald, and said "That man has robbed me of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and has knocked me about in this manner, with others"—he was bleeding from he forehead, and some of his teeth were knocked out—in consequence of that I directed the prisoners to be placed in the dock, and they were charged with assaulting and robbing Evans—I charged Robinson, who made a statement to me—Evans did not make any charge against Robinson.</p>

I have been robbed of 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;" M'Donald drew back towards the pavement, and Evans rushed towards that end of the passage; some one called out "Look out, he has got a knife"—I saw no knife—Evans ran through the passage towards Rope Walk, right up to the other bridge; M'Donald and the two women followed him—I then heard a cry of "Police! Murder!" and M'Donald and the two women came back from the passage—one woman was bleeding from her forehead, and M'Donald bound a handkerchief round her head, and said "Get home and call a doctor"—while she was going away, Robinson came on the pavement, and M'Donald said to him "Let us follow the man, he has stabbed the woman"—I was within a yard of them, and could hear distinctly—they went down the cut side, where the barge was lying, and I went into any office—I do not know whether the two prisoners belong to the same barge.</p>

I must pay Preston his costs, 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," nor do I recollect saying, "Well, you will have to pay that"—the Chancery proceedings have been going on since 1877—my father was entitled to some legacies, and I was entitled to them as his executor—I paid about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. expenses for the Chancery proceedings; I have no receipts for that, he never gave me any—I was not in the habit of getting receipts from Hattersley—he was a great friend of mine and a constant customer—I did not keep a banking account from 1877 to 1879, only a deposit account—I paid the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in different amounts, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or whatever he asked me for, without getting any receipt—the largest sum was 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it was a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and 10 sove<lb/>reigns; in 1878—I paid that to Mr. Simmonds, a clerk in Chancery Lane; Hattersley told me to do so—I do not recollect receiving 25/. from Hat<lb/>tersley a few days after on a Saturday night at the end of November in a public-house—I know the Peacock public-house kept by Mr. Wilson; he is dead—I went there occasionally; I lived very near—I know Mr. You will, a farrier, and I know Mrs. Shepherd—I was not paid 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the Peacock public-house towards the end of November in the presence of You will and Mrs. Shepherd—I did not say, "<hi rend="italic">Jim</hi>, what about <hi rend="italic">squaring</hi> up? you have got the money all right," nor did Hattersley say, "If you want to <hi rend="italic">square</hi> up you had better pay my costs and what I have paid Preston for you," nor did I say, "You give me 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and cry quits"—I</p>

Pether, both of them fully dressed—I had a conversation with Carter—I went down into the cellar, and sent a constable to the station—Carter and Pether were eventually taken into custody, committed for trial, tried in the other Court before the Recorder, convicted and sentenced, Pether to eight years and Carter to eighteen months—the prisoner was examined on that trial as a witness to fact on the part of the prosecution—I did not go upstairs to the top floor—I went into the bedroom on the first-floor; there was a little furniture there, but it was very scantily furnished.</p>

I am at present a convict undergoing eight years' penal servitude—since my conviction, on 16th December last, I have been confined at Pentonville—I first became acquainted with the prisoner Holt about five or six years ago—he was then a public-house broker and connected with a partner named Murrough—at the time of my conviction he was a public-house broker and distiller I might say, at 14a, Finsbury Pavement—I first heard of the Duke of Wellington public-house last year, in July, from the prisoner—prior to that I had been a proprietor of public-houses for 21 years—at this time I was an uncertificated bankrupt—in July I knew a man of the name of Carter; I had known him between eight and nine years—he was travelling for a ginger-beer manufacturer of the name of White at that time, and living at 17, Gloucester Street, Oakley Street, Westminster Bridge Road—I had the first conversation about the Duke of Wellington with the prisoner in the Minories—my wife was with me—I met him by chance; there was a man named Pigott with him—Holt asked me if I was doing anything—I said No, I was not, I had been trying to settle with my creditors by paying 1*. in the pound; I offered 1*. in the pound, and it was refused—he said he had got something better than that for me; he had promised to give me a turn—he said "I have heard of a public-house that will just suit you, and you can make some money," and he added that if I could not do a large trade it would do for a <hi rend="italic">scorch</hi>—I had had one fire at a public-house of mine 13 years ago—there was one 12 years ago, but that I did not consider one of mine, as it originated next door—I asked him what money it would take for the public-house, and said I did not care about the fire—he said "Nonsense, I will send you all the stock and spirits that you want in, and I will find what money you are short on the day of the change, and that will be a good opportunity for you to settle with your creditors"—I asked him where it was—he said "The Duke of Wellington or Magic Cave, Brook Street, Ratcliff"—I replied "That is not much of a place for business"—he said "What odds about that. I can get you insured by an agent I know of the name of Miles, at Stratford; and I know the fire inspector in that district, I can make things all right with him, for I have just settled a claim for Mrs. Richardson, that keeps the King's Arms, Brunswick Place, City Road, and I got her over 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for her things, which was a considerable deal more than they were worth; but mind, if you entertain this, I must stand in"—I asked, him how I could manage it, not being able to take a house in my own name—he said "You have a friend of the name of Carter, haven't you?"—I replied "Yes"—he said "Then take it in his name if he is agreeable"—I said "I do not know whether he will be agreeable or not"—he said "Don't mention my name to Carter about the fire, let that come by degrees, he is sure to know it"—I said "I know Carter will raise no objection as to using his name; I will tee him;</p>

               <p>as regards the fire I do not know anything about"—I told him I would see Carter that evening, and he said "Come and see me at my office is the morning"—during that conversation Pigott was looking in the windows—I think my wife was walking up and down; they were out of earshot—at I went home I and my wife went and looked at the Duke of Wellington, and the same day in the evening I went to Oakley Street, Westminster Bridge Road, after tea—I saw Carter at the Oakley Arms, and had a conversation with him—the next morning, in consequence of our conversation, I met Carter at Holt's office, and had a conversation with him—I said "We have come about the public-house that you spoke of"—I don't think Carter heard this, we were not all in the same room—he said "All right, I will come out"—he came into the front office then, where Carter was—I asked him the amount of money it would take, as I had previously told him I should have to borrow some money, as I had none of my own, and he said he would find the remainder—he said "I think 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I have a man here of the name of Friend that knows the landlord very well, I am certain he can save you a good deal of money. I will introduce him to you"—he then introduced me to Mr. Friend—I spoke to Friend about it, and he said he knew the landlord very well, and it was a friend of his who had a friendly bill of sale on the house, that the man's name was Stroud, and he thought if we gave him something he could arrange for about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told Friend we were Agreeable to that, if he could arrange it for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. we would give him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think Holt saw him first—Friend, I, and Carter, after this con<lb/>versation, went down to the Duke of Wellington and saw Davis, the landlord—I think Friend went first and arranged the matter with Davis—I think we found Friend there, but I am not certain—it was finally Arranged that Carter should have possession for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and pay the book debts amounting to 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we were to meet and pay a deposit of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Holt's office the next day or the day after—Carter and I went, and I gave Carter the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to hand over to Holt—I had 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of my own, and I think I borrowed a sovereign of my son-in-law, and Carter, in my presence, handed it over to Holt, he acting as a broker for both parties—it was arranged at this interview that the change should take place on 3rd August—I saw Holt on two or three occasions before that, at his office—he asked what furniture I had—I said I had three rooms full, or nearly so, which the trustee allowed me—he said "I shall be able to allow you a good price for those if it is a good fire"—he asked if I had any jewellery—I said I had a watch and my wife had a watch—he said "I have a lot of <hi rend="italic">duffin</hi> jewellery I can put you in, and some works of old watches"—I asked what ho meant by works of old watches—he said "You fool, if it is a good lire they won't inquire about the cases; they will think the firemen took them"—he then said "I think it will look better, after the change, to have the house done up, it would look more genuine"—on 3rd August I and Carter, Holt and Mr. Dewey, from the brewers, were present at the change, and I think my son-in-law Mr. Attenborough and Mr. Friend—while the negotiations were pending I usually wrote or telegraphed to Carter, and met him at the Oakley Arms—on the night of the change Holt said to me "You had better take possession, and move your furniture in, and live out of the business until the matter comes off, and be sure and come to me as soon as you are moved in, and bring Garter with you, in respect of the insur<lb/>ance"—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188103280067"/>
               <p>and Garter subsequently went to Holt's office relative to the insurance—I think that was some few days after the change—Holt said "I think I shall insure it for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said I thought that seemed a lot of money—he said the things were worth more than we gave for them, and if it was a good fire he could charge almost what he liked—he than said "No, I will make it 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." and he divided it into certain portions; so much for furniture, so much for jewellery, fixtures, fittings, and so on, in separate sums—I think he put it down on a piece of paper, and I think it was given to the insurance man with those figures on—he then wrote Carter a letter of introduction to Mr. Miles, of the brewery, Stratford, the insurance agent—I and Garter were in the room when he wrote it, and he handed it to Garter—this is the letter (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—I went with Garter to the Stratford brewery; Garter went in; I remained outside—I did not see Mr. Miles—I think Garter gave me the papers with the amounts on—I am not quite sure—I think the insurance agent received it from me at the house when he came—when Garter came out he told me the gentleman would call, and I was to let Holt know—I did let him know next morning—I think I next saw Holt a week or so afterwards at his office; he asked if I had received the policy—I said "No"—I had previously told him that the gentlemen had called, but I had not heard anything of the policy, and I asked him if I should write—he said "Perhaps you had better"—he then asked me if Garter had paid a deposit on the insurance—I said "No"—he said if he had it would have been all right, because he knew a man that paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. deposit, and his house was burnt out, and he received the insurance money just the same—I then wrote to Miles—certain letters passed between us, and eventually I received the policy, I think by post; the letters from Mr. Miles were addressed to Garter (<hi rend="italic">These were dated September</hi> 13<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 25<hi rend="italic">th, and</hi> 29<hi rend="italic">th</hi>)—I am not certain whether I gave the policy to Holt—I put it in a drawer when I received it—I had a conver<lb/>sation with Mr. Holt about taking Garter to Hoare's brewery—I think it must have been before the change—I did take him there and saw Mr. Bailey, the business gentleman, and Garter gave his references—previous to that Holt came to me in a brougham; I did not care to have anything to do with the fire, and for that purpose I went to Holt's office, and placed the house on his books—it was about a fortnight or three weeks before the attempt to fire the house that he came to me in the brougham—he said that he had come to take an inventory of everything that was in the place; that it would be a good thing for me, and also save him a lot of trouble, as he should assess the claim, and it Would save him going into the matter afterwards—he told me for my own sake to copy it, which I did in a book—I have not got that book; you have it—he said I must do it for my own sake, as if it was a good fire I should lie paid a good deal more than they were worth—lie said I should be paid a good price for everything, or nearly double its value, and if Garter had 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., according to how it came off—he thought that would pay him very well, and he told me to tell him so, which I did—I told him I did not care about the fire, neither did Garter—he said "What are you afraid of? you had a fire yourself 12 years ago, and you ought to know all about it"—I said "That occurred in the house next door, and I was a great loser hy it," which I was—he said "Shall I send you down the <hi rend="italic">fire king</hi>? but I hardly know, for he made a mistake at some private house at Dulwich; he let a candle burn out wrong, so you had better try and manage it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188103280068"/>
               <p>yourself"—he said he would send me in some spirits of wine, that it was very dear; it would cost 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a gallon—"you can buy methylated spirit much cheaper—you can get that for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a gallon"—something was said about brandy and whisky, and he said "I hardly know what you want with that" (meaning the spirits of wine) "for that matter, because the brandy and whisky that I have sent you in is enough to burn the town down"—on Saturday, 6th November, I saw Carter, and had a conversation with him—on the morning of the 8th I went with Carter in a cart to Holt's office, and told him I had got a four gallon bottle in the cart to get the methylated spirit in—he said "All right"—he had previously promised to let me have 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I promised Carter 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of it; that was to live upon until the fire insurance was recovered—I asked him for that 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he had not got his cheque-book with him then, but I was to come for it on Thursday; he said "Be sure let me know the moment it comes off so that I can attach the money "as it would come into his hands, and it would be safer with him than with Carter—I told him it was brewer's collecting day next day, and that the license was overdue—he said "Never mind about that; let me know and I can attach before—the brewers; they will have to wait until Carter receives the money"—Holt told me where to get the methylated spirit; in the Mile End Road—before we left Holt said "As it is brewer's day to-morrow I insist on the fire taking place to-night, and for that purpose I shall attach the money, and Carter had better give me an I.O.U., so that it will make it a larger amount as far as the stock is concerned; if Carter has to produce vouchers I can make it all right on my books, and the money that is standing as it is will of course go to the general account"—there was money lent by him on the day of the change—Holt said "The fire must come off to-night"—I did not want it; I was cautioned against it—nothing was said at that interview about putting the house on the books for sale instead of burning it; previously I did put the house on the books, because I wanted to avoid the fire, and Holt came down and got out of temper about it—Carter and I made arrangements about the fire taking place that night—we were interrupted by the police about three in the morning—before my conviction a man named Leggatt came to see me in Newgate; he also saw me after my conviction at Penton<lb/>ville, and after seeing him I saw Inspector Abberline, and made a state<lb/>ment to him—I have seen Carter since my conviction, but had no conversation with him—the property in the house at the time of the fire was worth more than was stated; I should think 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would cover it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR H. GIFFARD</hi>. When I said it was worth more than has been stated, I meant the house was worth more than the price we gave for it—I think the furniture and things and stock in trade were worth about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the two fires I have spoken of were fires in which I was perfectly innocent of any impropriety—I had no hand in making them; one happened while I was on the premises, but one did not—I was insured in both cases—I was paid the whole of one policy, or nearly the whole; that was 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Prince Arthur in the Law Fire Insurance Company—I was paid 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the salvage given me; I think the other policy was something like 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it might be 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am not certain what I got for that; I think something under 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I can't remember the name of that office; it was very likely the North British; that was on the Hare public-house, Bethnal Green—I am not certain; I think that</p>

               <p>was in 1868—I don't think I knew the prisoner at that time; he had nothing to do with either of those houses—I believe the fire at the Prince Arthur occurred in the house adjoining—the police did not break in and see spirits flowing all about the house, I will swear that—I lost over 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold in the ruins; I found a greater portion of it afterwards—I and Carter made arrangements to burn the house in question—I did not use the water-pot that I know of; I was tipsy that evening—I don't know that either of us used it—I am almost certain we did not—I hare ad<lb/>mitted that I lent my hand to it, and I am sorry for it—I emptied some of the methylated spirit that was brought in the bottle into the can, and a portion was sprinkled on some canvas that Holt told me to prepare and hang underneath a shelf where the spirit bottles where, and I got some paper and put it in the cradle; of course it was intended to catch light by the spirit—I called my daughter, Mrs. Attenborough, at my trial to prove that there was some spirit upset—I first saw Holt not very long before July—after I lost my money in my bankruptcy, through his partner I may say, he promised to put me in a house again, and I called at his office occasionally to see whether he could find me any<lb/>thing according to his promise—I have known him between ten and eleven years by sight, but to speak to only since I left the Green Man in Hoxton about five or six years ago—he never had much to do in the traffic of public-houses with me; it was generally his partner—when he said that the public-house would not do much business, but it would do for a scorch, I knew that scorching meant a fire of some kind—I did not exactly know what he meant—I should think it was a fire—I thought it was his intention that I should set fire to the place and get the money from the insurance company—I knew he was acquainted with a class of people that had been burnt out—I thought perhaps he thought as I had been burnt out at the Prince Arthur, he might take this liberty—I don't think he knew me at that time—up to this time I had been an honest man—I said I would rather not have anything to do with it—I did not care about it, neither did I ever promise him—I went into the house with the intention of working a trade up, and I put it on Holt's books for sale—I did not agree to burn it when I went in, but I was forced to it—I did not intend to burn it if I could have worked up a trade; I wanted to avoid it—I wanted to sell it for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I thought he might perhaps borrow 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the distiller—I could not borrow any money myself, because I was a bankrupt—I cannot tell you positively the exact time when Carter was a party to the conspiracy to burn the house down—Mr. Holt always told me not to mention his name to Garter—I think it was perhaps a week or two or three weeks after the change I spoke to Carter about burning the house down; I am not certain as to the time—I said I thought about having to burn it down, or something to that effect, and he objected to it; I can't tell you the words now—Carter and I had never been engaged before in such a transaction—I think he partly guessed from the conversation he heard with Holt, because it was partly hinted—I knew Carter as a ginger-beer traveller; I did not know any<lb/>thing disrespectful of him; I believe he has been a publican—I can't tell how the conversation began, but I know I mentioned it to" him, and that he was to receive 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he certainly partly agreed, but at the last moment we tried to avoid it—I don't think I mentioned Holt's name</p>

               <p>to him; he knew that—I have mentioned Holt's name to him—I am not certain whether it was the first time, but it was mentioned; I believe so, I am not certain—I think I first mentioned to Carter that the home was to be burnt either at the house or over the water or at Mr. Holt's office, I am not sure which; I think it was at the public-house; at least I am certain it was; I mean the Duke of Wellington—I never recollect telling my wife about it; she might have heard some conversation—I don't think she was there at the time it was discovered; I think she was over the way at her daughter's, but my memory does not serve me very well—I don't think the police were knocking at the door for 20 minutes before I let them in—I don't think my wife was there when they came in; yes, I think she was; I am not sure—I don't believe she knew any<lb/>thing of it, because I have some recollection of her going to bed, and me too, but I could not exactly tell you—I think she came over as the police came in, but I am not sure—I don't think she knew there was going to be a fire; she might have known; I am not certain—I never told her, but Mr. Holt was very often at my place, and she might have caught up a few words—I have some recollection of her going to bed on this night and being disturbed, and then going over to her daughter's; but, to tell the truth, I was tipsy that night—I think I recollect her coming in about five minutes before the police came in and took us in the bother, and there was a row and quarrelling with my wife—I fancy she thought there was something amiss—she saw Mr. Holt come to the place and take the inventory, and that she thought something was going to occur—I think she must have heard some conversation that emanated from Mr. Holt—I have seen my wife since my conviction—I think the child was taken over to Mrs. Attenborough's and left there—I am sure it was takes over at its bedtime—I think I told my wife to go over with the child about 11 or 11.15—I think she made some remonstrance, and I think I said "Mind your own business," or something to that effect, and then I think she came back just as I and Carter were in the act—I can't tell you what she was doing while the police were knocking at the door—I don't know where she was; I think she came in when the police came in—I think I came to the house after 11 o'clock; I think Carter came in first; I am not certain—we had been out together to Kensington, to Chapman, my son-in-law's—I did not go in, because I was not friendly with him; I waited for Carter while he went in—my son-in-law had promised to give information to the police in respect to this fire—I waited at the public-house opposite the vestry-hall—Carter went to Chapman because he had been cautioned against having anything to do with the fire by Chapman—our object in going to Chapman was to know if he had given information; if he had, it would not have occurred I told Holt about it, and he said he feared nothing about what he could do—that was on the Monday that it occurred, when I went to his office to get the methylated spirit—I told Holt that my son-in-law had sees Carter, and told him that he had better not have anything to do with the fire, as he had better be 15 miles away than have anything to do with it, as he intended to give information—I did not tell that to Holt; that was what Carter told me—I did tell that to Holt, and he replied "What have you got to fear about, he can't do anything, for they can't do any<lb/>thing unless they come and catch you at it"—those were the very words he used—I have not been friendly with my son-in-law for two or three</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188103280071"/>
               <p>years—I never recollect laying anything to Carter about dividing the money from the insurance office—I told him he would have 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think I told him so on the Saturday week before the attempt—I think that was the first time, but I won't be certain—I could fix on one day when Carter asked me what he was to have; I think it was either the Saturday or the Saturday week before, but he could tell you better than I—I think I mentioned Holt's name to him; I am not sure—about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was what Holt told me to tell him—I am not certain that I did mention Holt's name, but I think I did—I don't remember sending Leggatt to Holt when I was arrested—I have known Leggatt about 15 months, I think—I did not tell him to say to Holt that if he did not send me some money I would say he was concerned in it; nothing to that effect—I don't recollect it; I don't think I said so; I will swear I did not—I did not tell Leggatt that Holt was to have 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Carter 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I was to have the rest—I will swear I never said so—I knew that Leggatt was getting up subscriptions for my defence; I learnt that from a visit I had from him in Newgate—I only recollect his coming twice—I don't think he visited Carter—it was Carter who bought the methylated spirit; I gave him the money; I got it from Holt; it was a sovereign—Holt told me that methylated spirit would be cheaper than spirits of wine, and he told me that the spirits he had sent in were enough to burn the town down if the house had caught fire—I can't say that all the spirit in the house would have been burnt—I saw Leggatt also when I was in Pentonville after my conviction; he said he knew that Holt had to do with it, and why did not I confess—that was not to get myself pardoned, or to get a remission of my sentence if I got Holt convicted—nothing of that sort was said—the reason I gave information against Holt was this: I have suffered from heart disease many years, and I was very ill, and I thought it my duty, as Holt was the whole and sole cause of the matter in consideration, and I had credit for the whole of the affair when I did not, I thought it right on my part to give all the information necessary and requisite, and confess the truth, and I have been much better since—I told Leggatt that Holt had something to do with it, and I think he went to the inspector—nothing was said about my being examined as a witness against Holt that I recollect; I never said anything about it—I did not tell Leggatt that I was to be greatly bene<lb/>fitted by the fire, and that Holt was only to have a small share—I believe Leggatt is a publican; I was not acquainted with him beyond his taking a house that my son-in-law kept—I did not send for him when I was in custody—I had no one in the world to take any interest in the matter as far as my wife was concerned, and he kindly tried to get subscriptions for my trial.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Leggatt took a house that my son-in-law Attenborough had, that was the Tiger, in Long more Road, Mile End Road—he saw me first in Newgate after my committal, and we had a conversation about getting money for my defence—I might have asked him to ask Holt for some money towards it—I afterwards learnt that Holt had subscribed 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my defence—I might have said something to Leggatt in Newgate about Holt, but I am not sure—I told him in Pentonville that I would confess to Inspector Abberline, and I think he sent him;' I did not send for him; I made a statement to him which he took down—when Carter went to Chapman he was not at home unfortunately; that was about 8</p>

               <p>o'clock on the night of the 8th—we had not bought the methylated spirit at that time; oh yes, it was bought in the morning; I was forgetting myself—my memory about the night in question is not very dear; I was the worse for drink and very bad—the child spoken of is Mrs. Atten<lb/>borough's youngest child, three or four years old—they lived over the way, but she and the child generally came to my place every day—I think they left about half-past 12—they generally left when the house closed—I think my wife went out with them that night, but I am not clear about it—I did not pour any of the spirit on the carpet to my recollection; it might have dropped off the canvas, perhaps, but there had been an accident I believe in the early part of the evening before I came home from what my daughter told me—I don't mean that all of it was an accident, because some must have dropped off from what I put on the canvas—if I could have disposed of the house for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should have done so—we tried to work a trade; there was not much; there was no substantial business—I went with Carter to the distillers' to borrow money if I could to pay Holt out, and so avoid having to burn the house—I think that was prior to or just after putting it on the books—I went to Holt's office with Carter on the morning of the 8th; nothing passed then about selling the house—we went there with a cart and a bottle for the methylated spirit; that was when I got the sovereign from him—I did not get the bottle from Holt; I brought it from the house.</p>

Before taking the house I made no inquiry as to what the takings were; the man had the brokers in the house; it was a brewer's yearly tenancy—Carter was accepted as tenant—I went with Carter to see Mr. Bailey at Hoare's brewery—I knew that the house did do a trade at one time; it was not a new house; I thought there might be a chance of working it up—I got the methylated spirit between 12 and 1 in the day; it was three gallons; Carter fetched it; I did not go in, I waited outside—lie brought it out and put it in the cart—he took it to the Duke of Wellington; I waited at the Crown and Anchor at the corner of Jamaica Street till he brought the horse and cart back—that was between 1 and 2; we then left the horse and cart and went home—my wife was attending to the business—Carter told me he had put the methylated spirit in a bottle behind the bar; I saw it—I came home from Kensington about a quarter past 11—the methylated spirit had not been touched at that time to my knowledge—I don't think any one but me and Carter knew what it was—we waited till the house was closed, then Carter and I emptied a portion of the spirit into a quart can, or jug, or basin, or bowl in the bar, and a child's cradle was brought down—there was some canvas in the cupboard, and that we hung underneath where the bottles were—a portion of the spirit was <hi rend="italic">saturated</hi> on the canvas, and some paper was put in the cradle saturated with the spirit; I don't think there was much paper; I think the spirit was only put on one piece of canvas; there were two pieces—I don't recollect anything else—I think Carter did something, but that I can hardly tell—some paper might have got shifted; I tried to hide it when the police came; there might have been some there; no doubt it was saturated; I don't recollect what else was done—Carter must have done something; I think he sprinkled some on the curtains, I am not sure—Carter did not want it at all that night, more did I, but it was arranged for that night between 2 and 3 in the morning—I am almost certain that my wife came in a few moments before</p>

                  </hi>. I am now undergoing 18 months' imprisonment in the House of Correction—I was tried with Pether in December last, and convicted of attempting to set fire to the Duke of Wellington—I was not present hero, or at the police-court, when Pether gave his evidence—in July he spoke to me about the Duke of Wellington—I was then living with my wife at 17, Gloucester Street, Westminster Bridge Road, and was employed as traveller to a ginger beer manufacturer—I did not know the Duke of Wellington before that date—in consequence of what Pether said to me we went to Mr. Holt's office in Finsbury Pavement one morning in July—I had not known him before, Pether introduced me—he said "This is Mr. Carter, who will take the Duke of Wellington"—Holt said "You had better go and look at it"—nothing further passed—I went with Pether to look at the house—Mr. Davis was then in possession; he was there, and his son, and a Mr. Friend—we had some conversation there about taking the house, and next day I think we went to Holt's office again, and met Davit there by appointment, and Mr. Friend—we settled about taking the house, and paid 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit; it was arranged that I should take the house—we were to give Davis 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and pay his brewer, and take the book debts—I paid the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Davis—Pether gave me the money—I got this receipt (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Received of Mr. Davis 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., being the deposit paid by Mr. Carter on 29th July, 1880. Signed, G. Sains<lb/>bury for Mr. Holt")—Sainsbury was Holt's clerk—I afterwards attended when the change took place, to take possession, at the commencement of August—Pether was present, Davis and his son, Mr. Sainsbury, some gentleman from the brewer, and Mr. Holt—I had no money of my own to pay; Pether was to find the money—I saw him pay Davis some money—on settling up 18/. odd was short—Pether asked Holt to lend him the money, and he drew a cheque for it—I am not certain how much was paid at that time; I think it was something near 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I signed these agree<lb/>ments—this is my signature, and the one underneath as well—it is signed by Mr. Davis; that was at Holt's office—I think I signed these agree<lb/>ments there; before I went to the house—I did not go through the stock when I took possession—Pether was to live there, but the license was taken in my name—some time after the change I went to Holt's office about insuring the house, by appointment with Pether—Pether and Holt talked it over about who we should go to, and Holt proposed Mr. Miles, a friend of his—he said "He has asked me to send him customers, as he will allow me half his commission"—Pether asked whether we should mention his name—he said he would give me a note, and he wrote this note to introduce me to Mr. Miles—Pether had got the items down on a piece of paper, and he asked Holt whether he thought that would be sufficient—Holt looked at it, and said yes, he thought that would do—the</p>

I would not wear—I did not particularly notice it—I merely did what Pether asked me; to sign it—we said we were going to get the spirit, and Holt said that methylated sprit was the cheapest, and he said "Let it be a good foggy night"—Pether said "That does not much matter to me"—nothing more passed—I did not get any money on that morning; at this time I and Pether had arranged to set fire to the Duke of Wellington; it was an understood thing from the beginning—it was first spoken of when we took the house—I was to have 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and Pether was to have 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if it was all right; if the claim was got in full I was to have 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we got the cart from a place near the Duke of Wellington where Pether kept his pony—we went with the pony and cart and bought the spirit in Whitechapel Road; that would be in the morning just before dinner—I went into the shop and bought three gallons—I had a bottle with me, which I took from the Duke of Wellington—I paid 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the spirit—I forget the amount exactly—pether gave me a sovereign to pay for it—I got the change—I brought the bottle out and put it in the cart, and took it to the Duke of Wellington and put it behind the bar—Mrs. Pether was minding the house then—I then went and joined Pether, who was waiting for me at the top of the street with the pony and cart—we took the pony home to the Grown and Anchor—we then went over the water to my place in Gloucester Street, and in the even<lb/>ing we went to Kensington to a public-house called the Goat, which was kept by Chapman, Pother's son-in-law—I had seen Chapman three or four days previously, and it was in consequence of that that I went to Kensington to see him—we had not then properly decided when to set fire to the house—we got to Chapman's about 8 o'clock—I went in, bat he was out; Pether, was waiting at the top of the street in a cab—I went</p>

               <p>back to the Goat in about half an hour to see if Chapman had come home; he had not, and I then joined Pether again, and we went back to my lodgings—we went to a public-house in the Westminster Bridge Road and stayed there some time, and then went to the Duke of Wel<lb/>lington—we got there between 11 and 12 o'clock I think—Mrs. Pether was there and several customers; nobody besides—I did not notice any<lb/>body else in the bar; I was in the bar-parlour—I saw Mrs. Attenborough there; she was serving in the bar; she was generally there—I know her little boy; he was there—she and the boy went home about 1 o'clock is the morning I think, after the house was closed; no one went with them—Mrs. Pether was in the bar-parlour—I don't know what became of her; I think she went upstairs—at that time the methylated spirit was in the bar; nothing had open done with that when Mrs. Attenborough and the child went away; the little boy had upset a bottle in the after<lb/>noon or evening—I don't know whether it was whisky or brandy, but he knocked it off the shelf in the bar-parlour—they told us of it when we came home, and I saw marks on the carpet—there might be three or four dozen bottles of whisky or brandy in the house—I went over the house—I went upstairs; there was none of my property in the house—the furniture that was moved in was Pother's—after the house was closed and Mrs. Attenborough had left, Pether went upstairs and fetched down a child's cradle with some clothes in it; a night-gown and night-shirt I think, and a table-cloth and some canvas, and there was a piece or two of matting with it—the cradle was put in the bar-parlour, and we hung one or two of the things about saturated with some of this spirit—we poured some of it out of the bottle, and threw it on to the clothes, and we hung them on the top of the cupboard with some canvas, and we used some of the spirit on the carpet, and in the cupboard, and on the canvas, and different things that were hanging about, on the curtains and on the matting—we did not use any in any other parts of the house—we had not used a gallon of it; the rest was in the bottle in the bar—we began to use it, it might have been an hour after Mrs. Attenborough left, or more—I was sober, Pether was not—we had not long commenced when the police knocked at the door—Pether ran upstairs and answered them from the window—the police said they wanted to come in; they thought there was some one inside, and the sergeant said "Open the door"—Pether said "I will go and see;" and he said "No; it is all right"—the police said "No; it is not all right; open the door or else we shall make a forcible entry"—I dare say it was a quarter of an hour before we opened it—they kept knocking during that time—I ran upstairs with the cradle and some of the things, and Pether was pulling some of the other things down; some paper had been pulled out from the bottom of the cupboard, and that was pitched back into the cupboard again and the door closed; some spirit had been thrown upon the paper; Pether then opened the door, and the police came in—there was a water-can there—I had not used that at all, or seen it used—I was fully dressed; Pether had his trousers on—Mrs. Pether was dressed; she had a cloak on her—I don't know what he had under it—the police came in and we were taken into custody, and afterwards tried and convicted—I saw Leggatt at the House of Detention; he came to see Pether, not me—I did not see him to speak to—he came to see me in Newgate after I was committed—I did not make any statement to him after my conviction—Inspector Abberline</p>

"I do not think much of it in that neighbourhood"—he had asked me previously if he could work it in my name—that must have been a month before I agreed to lend him my name—he was looking after a house some time before he had the Wellington—there was nothing said at that time about burning it—he said he thought he had found a house that would suit; us—I said, "Perhaps you can sell the house for a little profit"—he said, "It would not pay"—the agreement that the house should be burnt might have been a week after taking possession, or three or four weeks—he said, "This house must come down"—I can't tell where this conversation was; it might have been in the street or in the house—it was then he said the house would do for a blaze—no particular day was named—I asked him, "When do you propose it?"—he said, "About next Sunday fortnight or three weeks," and then it was put off to the Monday—I said it was too early, we should wait till after Christmas—he said, "No, it must come off"—the paper on which the items were entered was brought to Holt's office by Pother—I saw it; I don't know whether it was in Pether's handwriting; I did not take particular notice of it—I learnt that day what the amount of the insurance was to be; it was 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I don't remember telling the Magistrate that I did not know what the amount was—Holt was examined against me as a witness—I did not know him until I was introduced to him by Pether on going down to his office to look after a house—it was Holt who said, "Let it be a foggy night"—if I said Pether said it was a mistake, and I rectified it the Second time Mr. Abberline came, which was about a week afterwards—he was reading my evidence, and I told him it was a mistake—I did not in that interval think that what I had said at that time had not proved anything against Holt—I don't know where the I. O. U. is, Holt had if, I don't know what for—I had no dealings with him other than for this public-house—I was bound to sign it because the house was in my name—I suppose it was for goods sold and delivered; that was what I thought it was—Pether told me it was to show to Mr. Holt to attach</p>

I am the wife of Samuel Pether—I remember going to live at the Duke of Wellington—some time before that I was with my husband in the Minories, and met Holt with another gentleman—my husband spoke to Holt—I did not hear what passed, I was walking up and down on the other side of the way—afterwards, on our way home, we went to the Duke of Wellington and saw Mr. Davis—subsequently I was present at the change; Mr. Holt was there, my husband, myself, Carter, and two or three more—I was present when an inventory was taken by Mr. Holt; my husband and Mrs. Attenborough were also present—Mr. Holt said he would send in some strong whisky and brandy for the night of the flare—soon afterwards some bottles of spirits came in from Holt; I can't say how many, there looked a good many—after the attempted fire I handed some of those bottles to Mr. Leggatt—the morning before my husband was apprehended he went out—he came back with Carter; they remained some time and went out again in the afternoon; they came back about 12 o'clock or a few minutes past—they sat in the bar parlour—as near as I can guess when I left them it was just upon 2 o'clock—while they were out Mrs. Attenborough's little boy had a whip and knocked down three bottles off the shelf; I was in the kitchen at the time, and as I came back into the bar parlour Mrs. Attenborough was wiping up the mess—my husband and Carter had been drinking when they came home—my husband saw the mess on the floor that the spirits had made; they told him of it directly he came in, and he was very angry—my daughter left between 1 and 2 o'clock—I carried the child across the road, and came back again in 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour—I had some words with my husband, and he told me to leave the room, and I went upstairs, undressed myself, and got into bed, and I was just in a doze when I heard the police come in—I heard the knocking at the door, and I partly dressed myself and came down—the police took my husband away—I stayed on the premises—Mr. Leggatt came and assisted me—I visited my husband from time to time at the House of Detention—in consequence of my deafness I met Leggatt once or twice outside to go with me—I saw Holt once or twice outside the House of Detention in a public-house opposite—shortly after my husband was in custody I went to Holt's office, and asked him to assist me towards my husband's defence; he gave me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said that was as much as he could afford; he gave the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. Leggatt—I went to his office more than once—on one occasion he asked me if the police had taken anything away; I said yes, they had taken some things away—he asked if they had taken a bottle of stuff away; I said "No"—he did not mention what kind of bottle—after my husband was taken into custody I found a jar or bottle; it was a strong spirit; I smelt it; I poured it away; I told Holt what I had done—when my husband was before the magistrate at the Thames Police-court, I was outside—I met Holt there; he told me to go lower down to a house to have something to drink, as he did not want anybody to see him speaking to me, as he was the chief witness in the case—I went to the public-house, and he joined me; we had something to drink; he paid for it—Mrs. Carter was with me, and Mrs. Attenborough—a few days before Holt was taken into custody I met him in Holborn, oppo<lb/>site</p>

               <p>Joiners Street, Westminster Bridge Road; we formerly lived at 17, Gloucester Street—we have known Pether for some yean—I first became acquainted with Holt on the second remand of my husband—before he went to the Duke of Wellington my husband had been a traveller for a mineral water manufacturer—I knew that he was mixed up with Pether at the Puke of Wellington—I had conversation with my husband about it several times—he slept at home—at that time he was earning 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day, besides 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen commission money; that was all we had to support us—we had no furniture or jewellery—I have eight children, the eldest is 14—I knew Chapman as Pether's son-in-law; I knew nothing of him—he told me something before the night of 8th November—my husband went out that morning; he came home about half-past 8 at night—he stopped at home a little while and went out again; he said he should not be long, but he did not come back at all—next day I received a telegram, and went to the Duke of Wellington, and found that he was in custody—I went daily to the House of Detention to see him—on the second remand I saw Holt outside the Court; Mrs. Attenborough intro<lb/>duced him to me—he said he could not be seen speaking to me as he was the chief witness in the case—he asked me if I would take something, and we adjourned to a public-house and had something to drink—I saw him next outside the House of Detention; he then told me not to open my mouth so wide, as everybody would know my business, and he told me to meet him at a public-house in Chiswell Street at 12 o'clock, not to come to his place of business, but I did not go to Chiswell Street, I went to his place of business in Finsbury Pavement that same day; he was very much annoyed at my coming there—I asked him for some money in consequence of what my husband had said—I told him he was the cause of all my husband's trouble; that I had eight children to keep, and I did not know which way to turn—he said that when Pether came to him he had not got more than 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; he knew men that had got money from him; he could not be seen giving me any money at his place of business, but he would send me some stamps, and he sent me 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in stamps, with a slip of paper; I turned the stamps into money—I think I saw Holt twice in a public-house outside the House of Detention when I went to visit my husband—I spoke to him each time—he said it was a very great pity, that if somebody had not been talking it would have been all right—we had something to drink on those occasions, which he paid for—I was outside this Court when my husband was tried; I saw Holt outside; I don't think I went anywhere with him—after my husband's conviction I went with Holt to Hoare's brewery—I told him he was as bad as the men that were put away, as I had heard it was him that had sent the things in to destroy the house—he asked me who told me so—I told him Mrs. Pether—he said a lot of old women got together, and did not know what they were talking about—he also said "The men are away, and it will all have to be proved"—I first knew that the house was to be set on fire something like a month or two before—I persuaded my husband not to have anything to do with it from the beginning—I did not know what he was going out for on the night of the 8th.</p>

I am not implicated in it at all; I have had tip-top Counsel's advice, and they won't take the convict's words"—before the trial I told him that Pether wanted to see him very particularly—he said, "Tell Sam that I really must not come, as I shall be one of the chief witnesses in this case, but what I shall say will do him no harm"—I went several times to the House of Detention, and on two of these occasions I saw Holt outside the prison—Mrs. Carter and Mrs. Pether were present—I showed him this letter from Chapman, and he read it.

Hoare would not employ anybody else—the sale was to Mr. Halsey—he said he would not have anything to do with Mr. Holt; that he did not consider he was a safe man to have anything to do with; and he employed Mr. Messino—Holt did not get the signatures of Carter and Pether to carry the business through, I got them myself, in this very place—he did not give me the papers—I brought them away myself from the Wellington, and gave them up to Mr. Bailey, at Hoare's brewery; even the insurance policy—I endorsed the license.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the prisoner's employment, at 14a, Finsbury Square—it was part of my duty to enter in the call book the persons who called—I entered the service about the 20th September, 1880—on the 21st of September I find an entry that Pether called—he said he wanted his house Bold, he wished to see Mr. Holt—I told him he was out, but I would take any instructions from him—I told Mr. Holt when he came in, and the entry of wanting his house sold was subsequently transferred to this register—at the page for 8th No<lb/>vember I find a portion of the page wanting—I know nothing about it—I do not find any entry of Pether having called on that day—I read in the paper an account of Carter and Pether being taken into custody—I called Mr. Holt's attention to it when he came to the office—I cannot remember what he said exactly—I am still in his employment—Pether called at the office on several occasions, and Carter occasionally—Mr. Holt said he did not wish to see them—he did not give me any instructions about not entering their names in the call book—he told me not to enter the females' names, refering to their wives; that was after the husbands were in custody—I did not keep the call book, that was the duty of the office boy—parts of other pages nave been cut out of the book—I did not cut them out—I do not know who did, or by whose authority it was done—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is Mr. Holt's diary—I find on the 8th November an entry of Pether and Carter having been there—Mr. Holt saw them on that day—I did not keep either of the books on that day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a public analyst, 79, Great Tower Street—I have analysed the contents of four bottles of spirits handed to me by Inspector Abberline—the one labelled "Fine old pale brandy" is a sample of spirit 3 degrees over proof; it is really a raw spirit, not brandy at all, coloured with calomel and burnt sugar; it is not fit to drink; it is more inflammable than ordinary brandy or whisky; one bottle was labelled "Fine old Irish Whisky," the other two bottles bore no labels of a spirit's name—they are very slightly under proof, one of them 3 1/2 degrees and the other 4 1/2—the strongest whisky retailed in bottles is 11 degrees under proof; the more common is about 22 under proof—I never knew whisky sold for consumption so strong as this—it is highly inflammable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The more you approach pure alcohol the greater the inflammability, and the more the publican is able to water it down.</p>

I should suppose that no such brandy as this was ever bottled for consumption—as regards the whiskies, it is within possibility that bottles of this strength may be sent into public-houses, but brandy 6 over proof is quite unknown except in casks in bond; the strongest at which it is given to the public would be at proof, not over-proof, and the strongest in a house of this description I should think would be 20 under proof.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I was unsensed at first, and said that you were not the man, just for the moment—I had been running, and was out of breath—I did not go to the Princess Alice between the time I was robbed and the time I went to the station; and I never saw you there—I expressed a doubt the first time the inspector asked me, and then I said that you were the man—I was not drunk; I had had two or three glasses—when you were stopped I said that you were not the man, as I had been running, but directly I got to the station I recognised you—when you had your hand in my pocket I said "You thief"—I sat down on a chair at the station, but not because I was drunk.</p>

On 5th March, about 11.30, I heard a noise in Commercial Street, but saw nothing to account for it—after a minute or so I heard a cry of "Police" 200 or 300 yards down the street, and tailed a constable to go there—I then saw the prisoner running towards me in front of a cab, about 80 yards from me—I stopped him and said "What are you running for?"—he said "I am going to the public-house; I have been out to make water"—several people said, "It is all right, policeman," and no one coming up to make any complaint, I allowed him to go into the public-house—a minute afterwards Yarrow came up, bleeding from his mouth; his trousers were disarranged, and he said that he had been robbed—I went into the public-house, and told the prisoner I wanted him outside—he had a glass half full of drink in his hand, and came out rather reluctantly—I asked Yarrow if that was the man who robbed him—he said "No," and repeated it two or three times—I was not satisfied, and told the prisoner I should take him to the station for further inquiry—I took him there, left him with a constable, and went out for a quarter of an hour—on my return Phillips was there, and the prisoner was being charged; and Yarrow said, "He is the man"—the prisoner said that he had not robbed him; and I am quite sure he is the man—I saw him running for about 80 yards before I stopped him.</p>

I am a Justice of the Peace, living at Isle<lb/>worth, and am Chairman of the Heston Local Board—the prisoner has been in their service since Nov., 1874—his salary at first was 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, which has been increased to 175<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he also had a commission of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per<lb/>cent, paid to him for new roads—this book of regulations bears his sig<lb/>nature—it was his duty to attend the Finance Committee on all occasions, and to keep the surveyor's cash book, and produce it to the committee on the 2nd and 4th Tuesday in the month—the treasurer is the London and County Bank, Hounslow—it was the prisoner's duty to pay into the bank the sums received by him—he was supplied with the receipt book—it is headed "Heston and Isleworth Local Board"—it was his duty to give those receipts for money received on account of the Board Only—he also produced from time to time to the committee, apportionment sheets, pur<lb/>porting to show the amount still unpaid in respect to the new roads—they have been searched for since he has been in custody, and cannot be found—on Wednesday, 23rd of February, in consequence of suspicion I looked into the prisoner's account, and the meeting was adjourned to Saturday, the 26th, when we having missed several sums, asked the prisoner whether he could account for them not being entered in the bankers' book, or in his cash book—he said "No"—I then said "Tell me how much you have taken, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?" he said "No"—another member said "400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."? he said "No"—I asked him to tell me what he had taken—he said "About 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I asked Mm what he had to say—he said "I am very sorry"—this was at the Town Hall, Hounslow—the investigation was continued on the following Monday, and in consequence of what was discovered I gave him in custody—this surveyor's book is in his writing (<hi rend="italic">Several entries were pointed out where the amounts charged did not appear in the accounts</hi>)—I have been carefully over the books in the prisoner's writing, and find that the Board has never received these three sums—a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188103280098"/>
               <p>resolution was adopted in May, 1878, "That the surveyor be paid 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per<lb/>cent, upon the cost of repairing streets"—he was paid that percentage, and always by cheque—there is also a resolution of 8th January, 1878, that the commission was not to be paid till all the money was paid—he had no authority to retain any money in his possession.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIS</hi>, Q.C. I found this book kept by the prisoner in his office—I have gone through it, and ticked the items in it—I do not find in it an entry of nearly all the money I suppose to have been taken to make up the deficiency—I found at page 25 "Stratford, Grosvenor, and Osborne Roads," and various sums, are marked "Not accounted for"—I find on March 9th, "Bignell 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," against which is written "Not accounted for," but he has entered the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. In the New Roads book—I find a great many of the sums I charge him with taking entered in this book, but there are no dates except the word "May" in one place—he did not say when I first asked him about the amount, "I am sorry, but I shall be glad to assist an accountant in examining the state of the books"—nothing of the kind—I read him a resolution which I had drafted, stating that an accountant would be employed to assist in the investigation, and he acquiesced—Mr. Register and Mr. Marshall were with me when I first spoke to him—I do not think we paid for keeping our banking account—the prisoner, I am told, kept an account at the same bank, so that the clerk would know of his account—the Government officer audited his accounts, and the Finance Committee—I think about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was due to him for commission—if he paid for labour in his office he always had a cheque in advance of it—he did not keep a horse and trap with the sanction of the Board, he may have hired one—I have seen him in a small cart—he had to look over about 45 miles of road, and it might be 60 including the new roads not yet dedicated—his district was about 6,942 acres—the banking account was always placed on the table for me to see—I had no idea that he was paying cheques of the Board in to his own account—Mr. Denne ought to have told me of it—the prisoner generally endorsed our cheques for the new roads—I know to my astonishment that several cheques of the Board have been paid into his account—I do not know that certain allowances were due to him for attending certain inquiries at Worthing, Edmonton, or Aylesbury—a reso<lb/>lution was passed that the travelling expenses of the Board should be paid to go to Worthing to investigate a process of sewage, and at my request the prisoner accompanied us, and his expenses were paid—Mr. Wyon was present on the 28th, and the prisoner was called in from time to time, but he gave us no assistance whatever—the Board was not equally divided about prosecuting him—I was disinclined to give him in custody, as I thought the Committee should not usurp the functions of the Board—there was no division.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My reluctance to give him in custody did not arise from any doubt as to his criminality—he has been paid on the completion of every road since 1878—nothing was due to him till he had accounted for the whole sum—there was no outstanding claim by him against the Board—there is no other matter in which they owe him money—I have gone through this receipt book; all the items entered on the counterfoils are duly entered as received, in the surveyor's cash book, but there is one receipt for a sum in this indictment which has been taken from this book and not entered, that is Mr. Hessom's on 30th July, 1880—I find</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188103280099"/>
               <p>one receipt has been taken out, and there is a blank counterfeit—the account book which we supplied to the office ought to have been sub<lb/>mitted from time to time to the Finance Committee—here are a series of items on page 26 occupying 8 or 10 lines, which have been, duly ac<lb/>counted for, then comet a series of items under the head of "May, 1878" which have not been accounted for, and afterwards here is "March, 1879"—I find in my own writing here, "<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you received these amounts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you paid the amount into the bank? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If they are not in the bank book I have not paid them in." My initials are attached to that statement—I think I first saw those items on the 26th or 28th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Hounslow and Isleworth Local Board—I was a member of the Finance Committee 12 months up to 8th March last—we had the surveyor's book and cash book produced—this is the cash book, he should enter all receipts in this column—the chairman took the Finance Report and read the accounts, and another member took the bank book to see if they corresponded. This (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) is the bank book, and this the official receipt book, which was produced occasionally, not every time—it was the prisoner's duty to take the receipts out of the book as he received money, fill up the counterfoils, and pay the money into the bank—in the oases which, had come before me I found the counterfoils duly entered—we examined the pass book more minutely on the Special Committee—all these items entered in the counterfoils are duly entered in the treasurer's books—this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is on the official form, but I do not find a counterfoil for it—they are not numbered—in searching his drawers we found a great many receipts which had been torn out of books like these, and some of these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) as well, which have evidently been printed on purpose—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not an official book, it was never brought before the Finance Committee till I became a mem<lb/>ber and asked for it; the other members did not know of it—when the chairman asked the prisoner why he did not produce the other book, he said that it had been produced to the Works Committee, of which I was a member—I demanded it, and the prisoner was instructed to fetch it—I fist heard of the book at the end of 1879—the prisoner kept it in his room—I asked for it afterwards, and one occasion the prisoner said "I have not the book here, it has gone to a person to be made up," and he went away for half an hour to a man named Lampton for it—it had been made up recently—items under the heads of "Pavements," "Roads" were entered up to a certain dates; most of them have dates—those amounts have not all been paid in—they have all been paid in up to March, 1879, but not afterwards—all the top ones have been paid in, and all the bottom ones have not, from where the prisoner's writing commences—on 11th February a report was made by the Finance Committee, and the result of that was a Special Committee on 13th February to investigate the prisoner's accounts—I was a member of it—the prisoner was present that day—I took the bank book and cash book, and one of the other members took another book—all the sums in the private cash book were accounted for in every case—we adjourned to the 26th, and then continued the inquiry, and then adjourned to the 28th, when we had Mr. Wyon, an accountant, to go through the accounts with us—I have examined the pass books, and Mr. Bignell's, Mr. Mann's, and</p>

               <p>Mr. Hessom's accounts are not paid in—I did not receive any infor<lb/>mation from Mr. Denne that any amount had been paid in to the prisoner's private account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been a member of the Board from its com<lb/>mencement, and of the "Works Committee, but I went off that—I did not know of this book being kept nearly all the time—I should say I first knew of it about 1877; that was three years before the investigation—I joined the Finance Committee in October, 1879, and then I thought it right that this book should be brought—I inquired many times what people owed money in respect of roads—the Board kept a list of the persons among whom the expense was apportioned—here it is—we sent the prisoner to them to know what moneys they had paid—he was sent as a natural thing—I had no suspicion then that people had paid road expenses which had not reached us, but I was told that he was living extravagantly, and beyond his means—I went on the Finance Committee because I thought things were wrong—when the resolution to employ Mr. Wyon was communicated to him he said, "Very well, I will be here," and consented to render us every assistance—he was in and out of his office on the Monday, and we called him in several times when he was wanted—it commenced at 10 o'clock and finished at 6.30—he went out to lunch—he rendered us all the assistance he could—we had a special committee about the commencement of 1880 to find out how much was outstanding in respect of the roads—we then went into three or four roads, and found the accounts nearly right—there was a little matter of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he said he did not know whether it was collected or not, but he would ascertain—there were other roads to go into, but the collec<lb/>tion was not finished—we got the banker's book and the cash-book, and were satisfied that it was all right—I did not want to take his character away, and I dropped it altogether—when the chairman said that we had found three or four small items unaccounted for, and asked if he could explain it he said, "No, only that I suppose I have had the money, and have not accounted for it"—some one, I think the chairman, said, "We must go into this, and investigate the whole thing"—I don't know whether the chairman used the word "accountant," but the prisoner said that he should like the whole thing gone into, and employ an accountant, and he should be prepared to meet the amount—he agreed to it, but I don't think he suggested it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The assistance he gave was, when we could not find an account entered, we referred to him, and he said "Yes, I suppose I have had it and have not paid it in"—he answered every question put to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brothers as meat con<lb/>tractors and butchers, at 7 and 8, High Street, Marylebone—Sibley and Pearson were in our employ, one did a contract and the other a round—it was the duty of both to take meat out of doors—in consequence of missing meat we began to keep observation, and on 7th March, about 6 a.m., I was in my private office, which looks into the shop—I can see through a reversible blind—I saw Sibley take a piece of beef while Pearson endeavoured to hide him as much as possible—Pearson was between my brother and Sibley—Sibley took the beef outside and put it into Pearson's cart—they came back; Sibley then took a leg of mutton from the back part of the shop and handed it to Pearson outside, who put it in the cart—meat which is intended to be taken out is placed in what we call barges with four handles, and not at the back of the shop—these two joints were not taken from barges, and had not been weighed—on 9th March, about 6 a.m., I was at the same place, and saw Sibley take two ox kidneys and two pounds of steak from a table at the back of the shop and put them into the cart, and Pearson drove off with them—I communicated with the police—Pearson was in the habit of supplying the lunatic asylum at Banstead.</p>

                  </hi>. On the evening of 11th March I marked some meat with my brother, and left the shop—next morning, Saturday, about 6, I was in the private office watching the shop—I saw Sibley take a piece of sirloin of beef from <hi rend="italic">the</hi> back board and put it into Pearson's cart—it had not been weighed—it was not taken from a place where meat had been weighed ready for going out, it was one of the pieces I had marked over night—I then saw him take a piece of steak and a bullock's kidney, and put them into the cart—they had not been weighed—Pear<lb/>son only had to go to Banstead asylum and schools—that meat was not ordered for the asylum—I went out, met Brown, and we went from London Bridge to Sutton, where I went into a public-house nearly opposite Bouchard's shop—I looked out at the window, and after some time my cart driven by Pearson passed on its return from Banstead—he drove 20 yards past the house, pulled up round the corner of the side street, and went into Bouchard's shop with a parcel wrapped in sacking—Bouchard was standing at the door—after about five minutes Pearson came out without the parcel, went back to his cart, and drove away—Brown went after him and then returned to me, and we both went to Bouchard's shop—he was serving a customer—Brown said "What meat is that that the man just brought here"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—Brown said, "Both I and Mr. Curnick saw him give it to you"—Bouchard said, "What! do you mean the meat the man brought when I was out at the back, there it is," pointing to the parcel under the counter which I had seen Pearson take in—Bouchard opened the bag and it contained the piece of sirloin and the kidney, which I had seen in the morning—the sirloin had the mark on it which I had put on on the Friday night—Brown said, "I shall take you in custody for being connected with this robbery"—Bouchard said, after a pause, "Well, I suppose it serves me right."</p>

On Saturday morning, 12th March, I went with Mr. Arthur Curnick to Sutton—we went to the Greyhound public-house, watched from the window, and saw Mr. Curnick's cart pass, driven by Pearson—he drove about 20 yards beyond Bouchard's shop and then turned up a side street, got out with a bundle under his arm, and went to Bouchard's shop—I don't know how long he remained in the shop, as I left and went to the Angel public-house, where I stopped Pearson and had a conversation with him—I then went back to Bouchard's shop with Mr. Curnick—as I went in Bouchard said "Good morning, Sir"—I said "Are you the master of this shop? Where is the meat which was brought here by a man just now?"—he said "I have had no meat brought in just now"—I said "You have, for I and Mr. Curnick saw it"—he said "Oh, you mean that which the man hrought while I was in the back, there it is," pointing under the counter—the parcel was pulled out and opened—it contained some beef—I said that I should take him for receiving it knowing it to be stolen—he said "You are not going to lock me up, are you? let me stop till to-night"—I said "Yes, I must lock you up now"—he said "Oh! I suppose it serves me right"—I took him to the station and then went to Mr. Curnick's shop and took Sibley—I told him it was for being concerned with Pearson in stealing some meat that morning—he said I beg your pardon, suspected of stealing"—I said "No, being concerned in stealing it"—he said "I am sorry to think I am placed in this position, but I showed to you and to Mr. Curnick that I am not the man."</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of John Maygrove, a silk merchant—I reside at 227, Bethnal Green Road, and manage his business there—on 5th March I returned home about a quarter to 12 o'clock—I examined the premises, and saw that all was safe before I retired to bed—about 6 a.m. I was aroused by a neighbour, Mr. Cooper, of the Board School—I found the front door unbolted, and the bars of the windows broken; the window had been lifted out—it is a skylight window, which lighted the room from the roof—that gave free access to the whole of the premises—a sheet of glass had been taken away—two bars were broken away, and a rope was attached to the two that were broken away—I have no doubt an entrance was effected through the skylight—the drop from the skylight was nine feet, but there were racks, so that he could get down like on a ladder—the door was left unlocked—the three bolts were all undone—I searched the place—I have a very large stock, and could not tell at once what was missing—this bundle of Surdah Organzine, known in the trade as "Brown's throwing," I believe is mine—Brown has been dead some years—I missed this bundle from the stock; it is about 4lb. 6oz.—it was weighed in my presence, and weighs the same as the bundle I lost—I had only this one bundle on the premises; it was sent to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188103280105"/>
               <p>me from Maygrove's as a sample—I also missed two bundles of white China sewings, weighing about 25lb.—this bundle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is of the same class of goods—the bundle found on the prisoner's premises weighed 12lb. 10oz.; that returned by the Parcels' Delivery made 13lb. 6oz.—I have not the slightest doubt it is the same; I recognised it by its weight, its throw, its dye, and its bundling—the bundles are made up for dyeing purposes, and this is made up in a different way to what silk is generally made up in—I identify the whole, of this property as mine, but I have no means of proving the dyed silks—upon taking stock I find I am 12lb. short of dyed sewings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This is an invoice from Arthur Hulme, of 3 and 4, Great Winchester Street Buildings, of 26th August, 1878—"musters" are all kinds of silk—I said at the police-court, "I cannot swear posi<lb/>tively to the organzines," because there were other parcels about—I also said "Organzine is sold at different sales"—they have taken off my strings and put on common strings—this is not dyed up as my silk is—I did not say, "I cannot swear to any of the silk"—I said, "If it costs me my life, I will find out who stole it"—I have pawned silk with Mr. Russell, of Fore Street, about 18 months ago—I was not employed by any one then; I pawned for Mr. Scrace—my last master was supposed to have lost two bundles of silk—I was his market clerk—I was employed by Mr. James—he did not lose any silk to my knowledge—I had open orders to go and buy in the market, and when the prompt became due, he had not any money—Mr. Maygrove demanded an explanation, and I told the truth—he may have said, "Well, I have engaged you, let us hope what you say is true"—I was 10 years in James's employ—he did not charge me with dishonesty—some of the customers belong to me, and there is a lawsuit now pending—he gave me a bad character, but last week he gave me a sovereign—he said I was a drunkard—I was appren<lb/>ticed at Cutler's then—I was 10 years with James and Co., of Coventry, at their London house; and 18 months, in the employment of Reginald James, after the dissolution of the partnership—it is not a fact that every person in whose employment I have been has lost silk; only two have—I said at the police-court that these silks are alike, but one is a little coarser than the other.</p>

                  </hi>. This silk is my property—my business is at 227, Bethnal Green Road—this bundle weighs 4lb. 6oz., and corresponds exactly with the quantity stolen from my place; and it is made by a man who died five years ago—I have about 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of Surdah Organzines—there is no demand for it while the Italian silks are so cheap—I bought it at a public sale about 18 months ago—if it had been boiled and dyed it would have destroyed its identity—I know this by its being made up raw for dyeing—the residue corresponds with that which I lost in every respect—the value of the whole of the property lost was about 73<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sterling—I received this parcel from the Parcels Delivery on the day following the arrest of the prisoner—the exact weight was 13lb.—there are 15lb. of dyed sewing, 19lb. 4oz. of warp, 1lb. 6oz. of sewings, and 4 gross of crape cord, which makes up the total quantity lost, with the exception of 12lb. of dyed sewings—I have known John Hay since this happened—I saw him at the police-court instructing</p>

               <p>Counsel—I had a visit from him at Bethnal Green Road—he mentioned the prisoner—there are a great many people who carry on this business at the end of London where I carry on mine—I said at the police-court I had sold silk to the prisoner—I know Mr. Scrace, a silk dealer; I have done business with him—I know Edmund Hughes—I know Mr. Hulme, who carried on business at 3 and 4, Great Winchester Street Buildings—I swore at the police-court to the specialty of this; it is a specialty of silk altogether unsuitable for that district—I have my books in Court, including my ledger account—I buy largely at sales—I have bought Brown's Surdah Organzines at sales, but not frequently—Munt has been in my employ since 1st December—he came from Mr. James—I did not go to Mr. James about something James said—I had a guarantee and a reference from F.B. Carr and Co.—if Munt says James spoke to me about him he is under a wrong impression—I may have told him I should go, but I did not go; I have never seen Mr. James.</p>

               <p>I went to his premises, and received from him a bundle of Surdah Organ<lb/>zines—from what Ward said I went to the prisoner's premises with Sergeant Thick—I saw Thick enter the house, while I kept observation, between 12 and 1 o'clock—when he came out I went in with him—I said "Mr. Walker, we are two police sergeants; we want to see you respecting a bundle of Surdah Organzines that you sent to Mr. Ward's this morning to be dyed"—he said "I do not think I did; if I did I have the invoice inside"—I said "That is part of the proceeds of a burglary"—we went inside, the prisoner took down some papers to find the invoice for more than half an hour; he did not find it—he then threw them down and said "Look for yourself"—I said "You must consider yourself in custody for receiving stolen property"—Thick commenced to search the house—he asked Thick if he had a search-warrant—Thick shortly after<lb/>wards produced the bundle produced of China sewings—Mr. Munt came in afterwards and identified this bundle—Thick said "How do you account for the possession of this?"—the prisoner said "I bought it two years ago"—Thick said <hi rend="italic">"This</hi> also is stolen property"—he said "Well, I bought it last September"—at the station I showed him this bundle of organzine, and I said "This is the bundle we received from Mr. Ward, the dyer's"—he looked at it; he said "Yes, I bought it off a man named Brown, about three months ago, but I do not know where he lived"—he was placed in the dock and charged—in a conversation the prisoner said "I admit sending it; I bought it at No. 2, Winchester Street Buildings."</p>

I live at 12, Little Pearl Street, nearly opposite No. 6—I am married—the road is wide enough for two vans to pass—on 11th March, about 11 o'clock, I wag at my door talking to a neighbour—I saw the deceased coming along with a man who they said was her lodger—she was crossing over the road to her own door, and just as she got against No. 7 the prisoner came out of that house and knocked her down—he hit her with his right hand on the right side of the head, and she reeled round and fell on the back of her head—I could not say whether his hand was open or closed—the woman who keeps No. 7 came out and caught hold of him by the skirt of his coat, and said "Oh, Patsy, what did you do that for?"—he went away directly—he made use of a bad word when he struck the woman, "You b—cow"—I crossed the road and saw her lying down, and the man who was with her carried her inside her house—I bathed her head with some cold water; she did not speak; her head went first one way and then the other—I said "I think fine is dead."</p>

               <p>11, I was called in to see Mrs. Hennessey—she was then in a partially conscious state; we could just rouse her by speaking very loudly and shaking her—she gradually got more and more into a comatose state until she died on 22nd March—I found a contused wound on the right side of the head just above the ear; it was quite a recent wound—there were also bruises on the other part of the head; the scalp was puffy and swollen—blood was oozing from the wound; it had not bled much—I made a post-mortem examination on the 25th; the cause of death was extravasation of blood on the brain, in all probability caused by a blow; it must have been a hard blow; a fall might have caused it—on removing the scalp there were several bruises, some of a recent date and some of an older date, and on removing the skull there was an enormous amount of extravasated blood on the brain, extending round the back of the head; the internal organs generally were diseased, the liver especially indicating a hard drinker.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should date the injury from about the time I saw her—I take it that the blow on the side of the head was something harder than a man's fist, unless he had a very hard knuckle indeed—a person much addicted to drink in a violent passion would have a tendency to cerebral haemorrhage—the heart was flabby and soft.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Hassey, the nominal pro<lb/>prietor of this business under an assignment—prior to 8th. of March, 1880, I had been carrying on business with my brother at Burstall, Yorkshire, as dyers—we had established a branch in Queen Victoria Street, London, in August, and had a manager there named Nichol, whose salary was 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

               <p>3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week, and 5 per cent., but I did not engage him—in March, 1880, the firm was compelled to go into liquidation, and on 9th of March they executed this indenture (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) assigning the London business to Mr. Robinson—that was before the liquidation—on 1st of July, 1880, Mr. Robinson assigned it to Mr. Hassey—when the trustee was appointed of the old firm, this deed was explained to Mr. Good, the trustee—all the particulars were given to him, and from the date of this deed I have practically conducted the London business myself—the defendant acted as clerk up to the 26th of August, 1880—this cheque (<hi rend="italic">dated</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">th August</hi>) was received by the firm during my absence, and was paid into our bank, who sent it back as being improperly endorsed, and I told the defendant not to endorse in that manner again—it was endorsed "Taylor, Taylor and Co., per Jervis"—the prisoner had not authority to endorse or sign cheques—I sent him to Scotland at the end of September, and had reason to be dissatisfied with him there—I wrote him this letter of 13th October—he had taken his salary weekly up to the time he went to Scotland—I next saw him on Monday, 18th of October, at the office in Queen Victoria Street, and gave him in custody, having ascertained certain facts from the boy and the housekeeper—he was taken before an Alderman at the Mansion House—the charge was partially gone into, and on 26th of October an adjournment was taken I understood for three months—I knew of the 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. then, but not of the 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—up to that time I never heard a word from the prisoner as to any alleged partnership—my solicitor made a mistake in the day to which the case was ad<lb/>journed—I went with him to the Mansion House on 26th of January, and found that the prisoner had appeared the day before, and had been dis<lb/>missed—I gave him in custody again on 17th of February, on this charge of forgery, and he was committed—he had no authority to sign this cheque, nor have I received any portion of the money—I did not know of it till Mr. Payne wrote between the 18th and 26th—that was why I preferred the charge on the 26th—I left town on the Thursday before the 18th of October, leaving the boy in charge of the office with instructions with regard to the prisoner, if he came—he had no authority from me to take away the letters, or to take any cash after the 13th.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The business is legally vested in Mr. Hassey—he has given valuable' consideration for it—he undertook to pay all the debts, and has given a cheque for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., with the understanding that it should never be presented—the business in Burstall was J. C. Taylor and Co., and in London it was Taylor Brothers—it went into liquidation at Burstall; there was a composition deed before that—we failed to pay the composition in March, 1880, and so we had to go into liquidation—I cannot say that Mr. Good is a friend of mine; I never spoke to him; I considered his being appointed trustee the larger of two evils—I did write on 3rd April "We scored one by getting Good in"—I was not impecunious at that time; I had funds when I started in August 1879—the composition deed was in 1879—Nichol has also been in financial difficulties—he has been in the firm of Tobey and Nichol in the same line—I believe Jervis was out of business—he was not in the same line—they were woollen merchants, and the business I was going into was the woollen trade—Jervis, Nichol, and I did not agree to start a firm, Jervis being the only person to work it—we did not meet and talk the matter over at the Cafe de Paris, Ludgate Hill—most</p>

               <p>of the creditors knew that I had a London business—I never made an arrangement with Jervis and Nichol to try and work up the London business in the woollen trade on the terms that Jervis was to receive 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week and 5 per cent, net profit, and Nichols 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week and profits—I say that Nichols was the manager—I never had any claim by either of them, that they were anything else but clerks—this letter initialled T. N. was read before the Master of the Bolls. (<hi rend="italic">This contained the words</hi>: "To secure <hi rend="italic">your</hi> confidence;" <hi rend="italic">"You</hi> have pinned us down," and "The development of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> business.") The letter was only initialled N. and J.—I recognised their writing—I did not understand what he was driving at in the letter—the letter of discharge was on the 13th October, and on the 12th I issued some circulars. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that after that date they were under the necessity of dispensing with the defendant's services.</hi>) I did not know where Jervis was then—I had sent him to Scotland—I had a telegram from him from Scotland; I think on Tuesday or Wednes<lb/>day the 13th—I sent the notice to his private house in London—he sent out this circular to the customers. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he repudiated the prosecutor's circular as he was a partner in the firm.</hi>) It was on the 16th or 18th that he came and took away the books and letters—I was not in London on the 16th, but I gave him into custody on the 18th, as near 12 o'clock as possible—I did not know at that time that a gentleman had been to my office that day to serve a writ upon me, nor have I learnt it since—I do not remember saying at the Mansion House that I had heard that somebody had called on me before I gave Jervis in custody—I am almost positive I did not—Mr. Wontner was my solicitor there; it was practically said on the first occasion that the books were only taken in order that they might be kept from me until my right to them was ascer<lb/>tained, and an offer was made to me that they should be put in the hands of a disinterested person, with liberty on both sides to examine them, and Mr. Wontner had them—my solicitor received an account setting out the moneys which had been received by Jervis—I have seen it—it set out these two cheques—he gave me credit for them, but that was after he was charged with forging the endorsement—all the documents I charge him with receiving on 27th October were admitted in that account—he had already been charged on the 18th with stealing these two sums, and on 26th with forging the endorsement, and on 22nd October my solicitor received this letter dated the 21st—I received this account on 27th October. (<hi rend="italic">Claiming a balance of about</hi> 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">in the prisoner's favour.</hi>) I cannot say the amount from memory—he fabricated an amount and called it profit; I only owed him nine days' salary—he had his money to go to Scotland—I said at the Mansion House "On Saturday last there were three weeks' wages due to him," but that meant that it was three weeks since he received his wages—I said "More than 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was due to him on Saturday"—he has never had occasion to sign cheques to my knowledge—we had two Argentine contracts—I have only known within the last three days that he endorsed cheques in those matters—I have sworn "The transactions referred to were made by bills, and not one of these cheques was drawn by the said Arthur Jervis"; that is true; it was a contract with the Army, and our bills were paid; but this contract was with the Navy—I know now that the contract with the Argentine Republic was one in which cheques were received, and that he endorsed those cheques Taylor Brothers and Co.—the moneys were paid to me—the cheques are dated April, 1880; they are for 246<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—two</p>

               <p>actions were commenced in Chancery; one by Jervis against me and one by Hassey against Jervis—a summons was applied for before Mr. Justice Field for an injunction on 24th October, and since then no action has proceeded—I have not seen an affidavit of Jervis in which he says "I cannot proceed with my said action until the defendant comes within the jurisdiction of this Court, and I have been advised to allow the question of my partnership to be decided in that action"—it is im<lb/>possible to say what he claimed because he has filed nothing—this writ is dated the 18th, and mine is on the 20th—I went on with my action but failed to prove my statement in time, and an order was made giving me ten days to deliver the statement of claim, I believe—I cannot tell you whether I delivered the statement of claim—Jervis went to my house again on 26th January and 17th February—he again claimed to have the books—he said he had had a letter from his solicitor authorising him to come and see them by force—I cannot say whether he said that my action was dismissed—I would not say that he did not—between 25th January, when the charge was dismissed at the Mansion House, and his coming on 17th February, I took a criminal proceeding against him—I applied for a warrant at the Mansion House, and I believe I was refused; that was not on the same charge; the charge on the 17th Feb. was for assault—he lifted up his umbrella against me twice, but did not strike me—I was trying to prevent his taking the books—I did not give him in custody for assault—I did have him taken in custody; that was for attempting to steal the books; two of the very books he had been charged with taking at the Mansion House—I did not know that he denies my account of a cheque of the Great Western "Railway Company—I never said to him that in consequence of my having borrowed money, the banking account ought to be kept in my hands because I was solely answerable—I had borrowed money of my sister to put into the firm—I did not take the premises which I have now got, by representing to Mr. Jardine that the business was mine, and mine solely—I see him here—I negotiated for the house in the name of Taylor Brothers and Co.—I did not to the best of my knowledge represent that I was the only person in the firm—I did not write "There is no person in business with Mr. E. Taylor," nor was it written with my knowledge or authority or sanction, but I knew after<lb/>wards that it was written.</p>

I said "I have nothing to do with it, but here is his father-in-law, speak to him," and he spoke to him and expressed some pity for him, and said "Yes, I have taken 15 guineas from your son-in-law, and I have made 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by it, and am willing to return you that sovereign which I made: I have not got the ticket now, but when I get the ticket let the wife of Abraham Levy come and say '.

March 1st, 1881. Messrs. Garvie and Co. Gentlemen,—Herein please find my accounts as promised. Trusting this will be satisfactory, Yours obediently, E. F. Cowdry. A few receipts will be forwarded to-morrow"—I received the account pinned on to the letter—I do not find either of these three sums entered—the account begins January 1st, 1881; that is the only account I received from the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I communicated with him on 25th February this year asking for explanation of his cash account in January; I asked him to call on me as well—the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid to me in the first place—I know it because I receipted the account—I knew where the prisoner was—there is no pretence for saying he absconded—I said at the police-court he absented himself; I did not know he was in the employment of other engineers—he received a good character when he came—I have another place of business at Southgate; that was only opened last Christmas—I have no place of business in Scotland—Mr. Cowdry kept the cash-book produced; there are two keys to it—I keep one; the other is for the cashier—I never knew it locked since he had it—he had to keep an invoice-book, ledger, bank-book, cash-book, petty cash-book, and collecting-book, but I sometimes made out the invoices myself—he had to collect the accounts—he had very little to do with soliciting orders—he lived in Battersea, and I asked him occasionally to call on customers in that district—I have an assistant named Fowler, and the boy Flint; also Mrs. Middleton, the housekeeper—Cowdry paid them their wages; he has also paid the man at Southgate two or three times—there were two fitters; one was Lock and the other Long—Cowdry paid them both; that was before Christmas—he paid petty disbursements out of cash he received; that was not with my approval—he should have drawn a cheque—I call petty cash, amounts under a sovereign, but we never make a limit of a shilling—I always complained of his paying</p>

T. P. Bragrath and Co., wholesale ironmongers, of Upper Thames Street—I went to them at the com<lb/>mencement of November—I have never seen Green on the premises, but I have seen him at work at his father's place—I have known him about two years—I have not seen him there with Hateley—I pledge my oath to that—they were not constant associates—I have not seen Hateley in Green's place, and never saw him speak to young Green—I knew Green because I was in the employ of an engineer in Globe Road who knew his father—Green is not Walters—I have never seen Mr. Thompson, a factor and ships' store dealer, of 16, Satchwell Street—I was the only clerk—no one else was in the employ except Dangerfield, who was employed on odd jobs.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant.</hi>) I was with Sergeant Thick on 24th February, and saw Holmes and Slater together outside the Cat and Mutton, London Fields—I took Holmes—we put them both in a cab and took them to the station, where they were placed among others and iden<lb/>tified by the two Akers—I then said to Holmes, "Can you give me any account of how you became possessed of the ale?"—he said, "A man named Thomas Smith sent me"—I asked him what Smith was and where he lived—he said, "I don't know"—he gave his address, 580, Old Ford Road—I went there and found an empty shop—I went to Slater's house, and found in a bedroom this card. (<hi rend="italic">The address written by Mr. Cudden</hi>)—Smith gave his address, 62, Regent's Road, London Fields, but it is No. 60.</p>

Thompson, factor and ship store dealer, 16A, Satchwell Street"—I saw it still there on 7th January, but it was removed after that—I saw Hateley in the passage close by it on 7th January and called his attention to it—I said "Who is Thompson?"—he said "I don't know"—he said that 16A had never been let since it was built—I could not find Mr. Thompson or that any person occupied 16A but Hateley—there were some boards inside 16A and two coffins, which he said were second-hand ones.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now living at 12, Upper Baker Street, Portman Square—I am a married woman, but not at present residing with my husband—in 1863 I was married to a man named Richards—I had one son born in 1865, and he is still alive; his name is Marmaduke Francis Julian—I lived with Mr. Richards until the year 1873—he brought a divorce suit against me, and our marriage was dissolved—I do not remember the date of the dissolution—during my married life I knew a gentleman named Lindmarke, in business rela<lb/>tions with my husband, buying his types—at that time my husband was Government inspector general of mines at Buenos Ayrea—Mr. Lindmarke was the second Government engineer in the same place—my mother's same was Heurtley—I am her only surviving daughter—I have one brother—his name is Percy—he is alive—my mother died in September, 1876—she left behind her a great quantity of jewellery, and laces of exceptional value, and also a very extensive wardrobe—I estimate the value of the whole at about 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this was left to me for my own separate use, and she also died worth a considerable sum of money—I cannot say how much, as the affairs have not yet been arranged in the family—I subsequently married a gentleman of the name of Hart-Davies—he had been a sailor, but when I married him he had no occupation—my mother lived at Hampton Court House—I was married in 1878 to Mr. Davies at Hampton, in Surrey—after my marriage we went to live at Hampton Court—after this the establishment was broken up, and my aunt going to Sandgate, I went to Farquhar Lodge, Upper Norwood, in June, 1878—whether my marriage was a happy one is no concern of any one—I ceased to live with Mr. Hart-Davies—in May, 1879, I became acquainted with Mr. Fletcher—at that time I was living at Farquhar Lodge with my husband—we were both of us out of health at the time, I was suffering from the heart, and trouble, and I was introduced by my husband to Mr. Fletcher, as a magnetic doctor—Mr. Fletcher called at Farquhar Lodge, I think it was some time in May—at that time I did not know his wife—when Mr. Fletcher came, after making a few preliminary remarks, he sat down and took me by the hand to magnetise me, as he called it—he remained in that position for some time—it might be ten minutes—my husband was not present—he told me not to be alarmed if he went into a trance—whilst still holding my hand he shut his eyes, and there were convulsive shivering movements, which shook him, and then in an altered voice he began to speak a message from my mother, which I wrote in my scrap-book or diary—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the message was congratulations from my mother at having found me again in the spirit</p>

F."—I cannot tell when that was; he wrote me a letter in Gordon Street, which he called her letter—it was arranged that I was to pay him for four visits, which I did, it was about five guineas—the 18th July was the date of one of the meetings at Upper Norwood—the same thing invariably took place at these meetings, he took my hand and went into a trance.</p>

I imagined at the time that I felt something icy cold go over my lips, and I asked, through the medium, "Was that a kiss?" and the answer came "Yes, dear, I stooped over yon and kissed you as you said 'Good bye'"—at that time I had been introduced to Mrs. Fletcher—the came to see me at Upper Norwood, and her husband joined her later in the day—after the usual courtesies and polite speeches upon our mutual introduction, she said she felt within her that she could be a sister to me, that she felt a strong attraction towards me, as if we might become sisters—on that occasion we went to the Crystal Palace together, and Mr. Fletcher joined us there afterwards—we passed an agreeable after<lb/>noon, and they remained at Farquhar Lodge that night—they went to town next day, Sunday, to prepare for Steinway Hall in the evening—they invited me to attend the religious spiritualistic service that was going on there that evening—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)are the tickets of admis<lb/>sion—I went there that evening with my husband; it was a trance lecture by Mr. Fletcher—Mrs. Fletcher was present, the place was crowded—I should say there were 400 or 500 people there—it was a mixed audience; there were persons from the fashionable world, and some of the humbler classes—Fletcher went into a trance with his eyes open—he was controlled by some spirit guide—he gave a religious discourse—he gave the religious discourse in the trance, it lasted about half an hour—at the end he woke up—the service was interspersed with music, hymns and so on—the persons who sang were on the same platform with Fletcher, ranged against the wall—after the discourse was finished he came out of the trance, and after the hymns were over he went into another trance of the same sort, with his eyes open—the gas was turned on extra high—while under that trance he professed to see spirits everywhere, they giving him messages, which he delivered to various persons in the hall, to those to whom the spirits purported to send them—it gave great satisfaction to these people, who seemed to recognise their departed ones—some messages were of a more private character, and Fletcher in his trance said the spirits preferred his deliver<lb/>ing them privately at his house alone—the messages through Fletcher were chiefly to ladies, and the defendant's chiefly to gentlemen—Mrs. Fletcher did not upon that occasion take any part in the service, except as one of the audience—the whole finished with the Lord's Prayer being chanted—after the service Fletcher mingled with the congregation, who seemed to make a great "fuss" over him—the character of the discourse was of an entirely religious nature, immortality and the life to come, and was couched in very beautiful language—the messages were sent on little pieces of paper—sometimes Fletcher would say "I see a spirit standing over that lady's head in row No. 3, I see written over that spirit the name of 'Charley,'" or some such name, and Fletcher gave a description by which the persons recognised the relative—he then said "Any one who recognises the message, let him answer it"—the Spirits would then deliver messages through the mouth of Fletcher—on this night about a dozen messages were given—the service lasted two hours—after it the Fletchers paid me a great deal more attention than to any one else, pressing me to come and see them—I remember on many occasions conversations taking place with both the Fletchers when they</p>

               <p>came down to see me, about the jewellery which I had and about all my affairs—on one occasion the defendant went into a trance while at Norwood—I had previously shown her all the jewellery—while in the trance she said my mother desired that I should not wear the jewels too often, because the magnetism which was in them was so strong, that it might help to take me into the spirit life before my time—at that time I had a set of amethysts and diamonds, necklace and pendant and earrings—while in the trance my mother appeared to speak through the defendant, and desired me to hand them to her to wear for affection's sake, as though they were her own—my mother, she said, desired I should call her (the defendant)"sister," and Fletcher "brother," because she loved them Ike her own children—after that I continued to call the defendant "sister Bertie," and the man Fletcher "brother Willie"—they called me "sister Juliet"—a short time after this interview I paid a visit to Mrs. Fletcher at Gordon Street; I took the amethysts with me in a packet—I saw Mrs. Fletcher alone; we conversed about spiritualistic matters, and presently I heard raps from different parts of the room, which was called the <hi rend="italic">seance</hi> room—a little coffee-table appeared to move by itself all along the room, and stopped at her lap—I was much amazed, and asked what the raps were—she answered that the spirits wished to communicate a message—the raps continued under the table, the defendant saying that they would spell out by raps what they wanted by the alphabet—they appeared to do so, and she said the spirits wanted to write, and she must get some paper and a pencil—she called to Fletcher, who brought a pencil and paper—she held the pencil in her hand over the paper, and her hand began to shake, as if controlled—she said it was being controlled by spirits, and she said she felt my mother was near—she wrote a message on a piece of paper, "Dear Juliet, do as you are instructed by me"—this is the paper; I saw the defendant write it; there was no one else present—the defendant said, "You perhaps know best what that means"—when I saw the words I was struck with the resemblance they bore to a previous message at Farquhar Lodge, and I presented the amethysts and diamonds to the defendant after I had seen the message—I was induced to do so by the message, which I was led to believe, and did really believe, came from my mother—after that I went home—I collected my jewels together in a bag, thinking I should be dis<lb/>obedient to my mother if I did not hand them over—I took them to town on the first opportunity—I went to Fletcher's house and saw Mr. Fletcher alone—he went into a trance, during which he purported to give a message from my mother—while my mother was speaking through him, as I believed, I fell on my knees before him and put the jewels into his lap, thinking I was doing an act of obedience—my mother, through Fletcher, blessed me for having obeyed her instructions, saying that if I had not done so, so strong was the magnetism in them I should have been drawn by it into spirit life before my time—Fletcher said it was a great temptation to her to have me in the spirit world, but the higher powers forbade—I felt pleased, and my mother, through him, handled the jewellery in Fletcher's hands, saying, "Oh, what happy memories these bring me!"—my mother said I was to impress upon Bertie to wear the jewels and to have no compunction, but to wear them as her own—I was to do this lest "sister Bertie" should have any compunction—after he came out of the trance he collected the jewels together, admired them</p>

               <p>very much, and then called to his wife—Mrs. Fletcher thanked my mother for having done this, and appeared to hesitate before accepting them—I told her to hare no compunction, and she gathered them together and locked them up—the value of this jewellery was between 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was induced solely by the trance messages from my mother, delivered by the defendant and her husband, to hand them these jewels—when they woke up they did not appear to know what had taken place, and I told them what had happened—they knew whom they were controlled by, but pretended not to know what had passed—when the husband woke from the trance, I told him what he had said, how pleased my mother was for my having carried out her directions, and given up the jewels—I went back to Norwood, and afterwards I saw the defendant wearing the jewels—I remember seeing a photograph of her while she was wearing them—this one has a dress of my mother's, and this is a chemise of hers—I showed her the extensive and valuable wardrobe of my mother, and she said it was not good for me to touch them too much, as the magnetism was so great—it consisted of valuable dresses, Indian shawls, and laces—she, on the contrary, had no objection to touch them; she packed them almost exclusively herself on account of that reason—the contents were packed in boxes and trunks, and were sent to the Fletchers' house in Gordon Street—a few things I took myself to Vernon Place, to where the Fletchers recommended me to go and lodge—the bulk of them went to Gordon Street, two or three van loads—this was in October—before I went to Vernon Place from Norwood I received numerous letters from the defendant and her husband.

Furthermore, in view of my experience with trustees and other parties since the death of my mother, I have preferred to dispose of the property in the manner above indicated, and during my lifetime, rather than it should be disposed of in a way repugnant to my own nature, by those who might obtain possession of it upon my decease, or by disposing of it by will, as I might have done but for this gift of conveyance. In witness where of I have hereunto set my hand and seal this 25th day of August, 1879. Juliet Anne Theodore Hart-Davies. Witness, Francis Morton.") I subsequently had another interview with Morton, when another docu<lb/>ment was drawn up; that might have been a week or ten days after, in Gordon Street—I previously had a conversation with the defendant alone that day—she gave me one of my mother's messages, urging me to write a letter to her to make things more binding still, that she could keep—in consequence of what she said I went to Morton's study; he was waiting for me—I told him that Mrs. Fletcher required a letter which would make it binding for her protection, that she could keep in case anything should occur to me—there was no mes<lb/>merising on this occasion—he made out a draft—he wished that I should put a head and tail to it, as he expressed it, in my own style, and take it to Farquhar Lodge and copy it out on my own crested paper; I did so, and this is it (This was found upon the prisoner)—at Morton's earnest inatructions I took back the draft to him and put it into his hands—he said he wished to destroy it—I sent the copy by post to Mrs. Fletcher(This was form of a letter to the defendant, in substance to the same effect as the dead of gift)—I supsequently made a will—prior to doing so I had conversations with the Fletchers about it—Morton was the first to suggest to me about it; he said I should take into consideration the delicate state or my health, and the un<lb/>certainty of human life, and that I ought to think of making a will before my departure for France—he suggested that I should leave the money where it would be most wanted; where it would be most useful—suggested that my great desire would be to leave the bulk of it to the cause of the propagation of spiritualism in its higher phases, the teaching of the progression in the life to come and its immortality—he said that legally speaking I could not do that, it must be done through individuals, as the outside world, having no sympathy with the cause, would say that I was mad—he suggested what could be better than to leave it in charge to my adopted brother and sister—this was after several interviews—occasionally Fletcher would come to Vernon Place and say "Morton is coming here to-day about some business," seem<lb/>ingly knowing nothing what it was, and occasionally Mrs. Fletcher would send him on to me on business—I had conversations with her about the desirability of making the will on divers occasions—I was speaking to my mother through the defendant as to Morton's proposi<lb/>tion about the will; she went into a trance, shut her eyes, put her hand out and embraced me, and then entered into conversation with me as her daughter, as though it was with my mother in the spirit world—she</p>

               <p>told me to go to Colonel Morton and he would know a good solicitor—I went to see him, or he came to see me, and I asked him if he knew a good solicitor to help him make this will valid, and to draw it out pro<lb/>perly—at first he mentioned the firm of Murray and Miller, and I went with him to their office and he deposited a few papers with them, one was a document relating to some family matters; they were my papers—on that occasion I believe he did not touch on the subject of the will—on a later occasion I got another message from my mother through the defendant to take away the papers from Miller's, I spoke to Morton on the subject—he made an appointment, and I told him I must take the papers away from Miller's—he said "You must go, and I will meet you in a cab"—I went to Miller's and got the papers, or demanded them, and they were sent to me—Morton met me in a cab and we drove directly to another firm of solicitors, Messrs. Field, Roscoe, and Francis, of Lincoln's Inn Fields—Morton introduced me to Mr. Francis, whom he represented to be an intimate friend of his, but Mr. Francis had never seen him before—we had a conversation about the will, and Mr. Francis was to draw it up and Morton to assist—the will had been previously drawn up by Morton in my presence for me to write out, a draft—I copied it, and ultimately handed it to Mr. Francis to inspect—Mr. Francis found it necessary that a codicil should be added, and it was drawn up by him at Vernon Place—I signed the will that had been prepared by Morton, and subsequently signed the codicil that was pre<lb/>pared by Mr. Francis—this is the will (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this is my draft copy (<hi rend="italic">This bequeathed the whole of her property, both real and personal, to the defendant and her husband in equal moieties</hi>)—this is the codicil—my signa<lb/>ture has been since cut away from both the will and codicil—nothing is said in the will or codicil about the propagation of spiritualism—Mr. Francis carried out my instructions in every way; nothing was said in his presence about leaving it to the cause of spiritualism; Morton said it was not desirable to put it in the will—it was Morton who suggested making the will; I had no idea of making it till it was proposed—I certainly believed at the time that the message about the will came from my mother, and only under those conditions would I have made it—the defendant purported to go into a trance and give instructions, and I believed her—while I was at Vernon Place I received a number of letters from Mr. and Mrs. Fletcher. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">purporting to come from "Mums," and headed from "Sphere of Light, in Heaven" and "Sphere of Best in the Spirit World." In one letter Fletcher wrote, "Do what you like, but don't fall in love with the French officers," and in another he described a visit of himself and wife to the Albert Hall, where the mother of Mrs. Hart-Davies had a box. The spirit of the mother, he said, appeared during the performances, and said how much she would like to see the name of "Fletcher" on the door instead of that of "Heurtley." Reference was frequently made in the correspondence to the anxiety of Mrs. Fletcher's son, Alvino, as to the state of the prosecutrix. "He is afraid," said one of the letters, "that some one may steal his baby's heart away. Dear child, he does not know how twined about his love are the tendrils of Julie's heart; he does not know—what I know—that no other shares his place in Julie's heart; some day he will know so too."</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Alvino is 16 years of age—the "H. D." alluded to in the letters refers to my husband—the following letter (74A) I received in another from the defendant: "Mama comes just now and says, burn all the letters, letting not one vestige of one of them escape that has a word of this complication in it. I will satisfy her mind of the purity of Willie's mind, and also of his complete trust in her. Tell her, God bless her, I will breathe upon her, and take Willie's dear soul to her, and bring hers back to him, and lore you all most tenderly all the time.—Mums"—I tore off part of the letter which enclosed this because Mr. Fletcher had the impertinence to write to me that I thought of him otherwise than a brother because of my dreams; my indignation was intense, and I wrote to them to that effect; it brought on me a severe illness—Mrs. Fletcher, in the letter purporting to come from my mother, ordered me to destroy all correspondence on the subject, and I honourably obeyed her instruc<lb/>tions; I wrote to her threatening to break off relations—there is not the slightest foundation for suggesting that any intercourse took place between myself and Mr. Fletcher, or that there was any improper conduct between us—I wrote a number of letters to the Fletchers; I have not received them back—I have seen the "handsome captain" (Lind<lb/>marke) in Court almost every day; I do not see him now—on my return from Tours on May 1, 1880, I arrived at Dover at 3 a.m. and went to the Lord Warden; later in the day Mrs. Fletcher and the captain saw me; they had been out driving—I afterwards went with the defendant to Gordon Street, where I remained for 12 weeks until we went to America—I found a room prepared for me—I did not pay for my board, it was not necessary, I gave them all my income; that was 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, an allowance from relatives till my affairs should be arranged—Captain Lindmarcke frequently visited the house during this time—in the early days the prisoner informed me that my mother had requested that we should form a trinity—love, wisdom, and work; Fletcher was to represent wisdom, the prisoner, work, charitable work, and I was to represent the affection of the family to bind them all together; I don't know that the trinity was ever formed; I only heard of it in the "message;" it was all a mystery to me—a party was formed to go to the States, consisting of the defendant and her husband, myself, and two friends; one of them was their friend Captain Lindmarcke, the other was a lady traveling with them, a friend of Mrs. Fletcher's; I could not swear to the name; if it could be suppressed it is wished; one of her names was Julia; the family would not wish her name mentioned, the defendant would net wish it</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The witness did so, and it was handed to the Court and the Jury</hi>)—Alvino went with us—I went with them because I was obliged to go—I noticed that there was a prodigious quantity of luggage went with the Fletchers considering that they were only going on a two months' absence; there were trunks and boxes, and I remarked on it to Fletcher; he replied that Bertie had an impression that she would never return to England—I took two ordinary-sized boxes, not large—we went by one of the Anchor Line steamers—the voyage took about 12 days—when on board the defendant and her husband were very cruel and neglectful, remarkably so, so much so that some of the passengers remarked it—the "great kindness and sisterly affection" did not continue—when we arrived at New York Mrs. Fletcher and Lindmarcke went off in one direction towards Boston; Fletcher, Alvino, the lady, and myself stayed in New York—the next day we went on to Greenfield, and thence to Lake Pleasant, where there was a spiritualist camp meeting—the prisoner and Lindmarcke joined us there—whilst at Lake Pleasant I found myself so miserable and unhappy that I consulted some friends named Horne—I was afterwards introduced to Dr. Mac (his real name being M'Geary), a celebrated magnetic healing doctor, and, in consequence of some conversation I had with him, I told Fletcher that having come to my common-sense, and changed my mind, I had arrived at the con<lb/>clusion that I had been cheated and hoaxed, and that these purported communications from my mother were all got up to defraud me of my property; therefore I informed him that I desired to sever the con<lb/>nection; to cease to be a sister; and to demand my property and jewels back—Fletcher looked very vexed and excited, and said he could not possibly consent without first consulting the spirits—he said he was quite sure my mother would never consent to such a course—I said, on the contrary, I was sure she would approve of it, and insisted upon having my property—he refused, and again said he must consult the spirits—I retired to my room, where I was shortly afterwards joined by the prisoner, who at first deigned not to know what had passed—she said that Willie had confessed to her the night before that he left no longer only as a brother towards me—she also said he had worn a lock of my hair under his clothes for a year—I told her then of my disgust at the revela<lb/>tion that Fletcher had expressed towards me feelings stronger than a brother; then, suddenly changing her tone, the prisoner said, "I under<lb/>stand you have been asking for the jewels;" and, pointing her finger at me, she added in a firm, hard voice, "If you persist in demanding these jewels there is speedy and certain death before you"—I replied that I would have my jewels and property, and at once made preparations to start for Saratoga with the Homes—I gave Dr. Mac a power of attorney to act for me in my absence—a few stations on the road to Saratoga we were joined by Dr. Mac, who had been in another part of the train, and in consequence of what he said I got out and adjourned to Montagu, a town adjacent to Lake Pleasant—while at Montagu Dr. Mac recovered from the Fletchers some of the jewellery and property I had parted with to them—as they refused to deliver up the rest the prisoner and her husband were given into custody—the detectives took us to a bedroom in which we found Mrs. Fletcher and Lindmarcke, the latter being in his shirtsleeves—Lindmarcke knocked Dr. Mac's hat off and assaulted him,</p>

               <p>whereupon he was handcuffed and taken to gaol—in the room we found a quantity of my property; underlinen marked with my initials, which had been worn by the prisoner—I believe a warrant was afterwards issued for the arrest of myself and Dr. Mac for stealing my own property, and conspiring to use it for our own purposes—Dr. Mac and myself after<lb/>wards returned to England, where I consulted a solicitor for the purpose of recovering the rest of my property—the prisoner was locked up, but as the offence was not committed in the States she was afterwards released—I found a considerable quantity of my property at 22, Gordon Street; but the boxes seemed to have been ransacked; some of the dresses were placed between the mattresses, a portion being in Morton's room—the house was then occupied by two ladies named Malt by—I have not re<lb/>covered all my property—I made an inventory of the things, and as well as I could repacked them, and sent them to the Pantechnicon—among the things not recovered is an Indian teak box of lace, which I value at be<lb/>tween 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there are also certain articles of jewellery missing, including a watch, and certain rings which were precious to me on account of personal recollections—I was induced to part with my jewellery solely because of the messages which according to the prisoner purported to come from my mother; the same answer applies to my lace, dresses, and all the rest of my property—I signed the deed of gift and the letter assigning the property to her, because I thought it was the command of my mother, a sense of filial obedience.</p>

This jewellery inventory is in my handwriting—I made it out I suppose in America, unless it is a copy I made since—I made five or six copies—this I did in America, from memory—I had no list with me at the time—that I swear—I knew there were many more things, but that was all I could remember then—this represents the jewellery that the Fletchers had got hold of—I knew there were a great many missing, but I could not remember them all on that occasion—the greater part of these were recovered at different times by the aid of Dr. Mac—the 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of lace is not in this list—I was then on the subject of jewellery alone—some of this lace was bought at the Exhibition of 1876, but I was abroad at the time—my mother's lady's maid and my mother's friends informed me of it—I know it was in her possession in Hampton Court—the box was delivered to me—I could procure an invoice of it—I have not got one here—I could produce it if you wish to send to Connecticut for one of my mother's lady's maids—I have had the lace since my mother's death—it was most magnificent lace—I have not had it valued—it has been valued by various per<lb/>sons—if you believe in spirit life, you had better go and ask my dear mother's spirit, she had it all her life—the value of it is traditional—they were in my possession when she died—I cannot swear whether she died without a will—the affairs have to be looked into—I know that she willed her personal property and jewellery and clothes before her death—I know there ought to be a will; there is reason to know there is a will; that has to be investigated—no will has been found yet, it has to be searched for—I am the administratrix—I swore her property to be worth something under 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was not my doing; the lawyers persuaded me to do it for certain reasons of their own, which I had nothing to do with—I am not going to communicate my family affairs before this Court unless it is relevant—I was muddled by the lawyers; I could not under<lb/>stand</p>

               <p>what they were doing it for; I know I had this lace in my pos<lb/>session, and I Know it was my mother's—in 1876, a short time before her death, she caused all this property to be gathered in boxes, and my adopted uncle, Mr. Sampson, wrote on the boxes "These things are Juliette Heurtley's," and they were passed on to me by my aunt directly I returned from France—I did not see my mother before she died, but she left them in trust verbally to be given by my uncle, and he died before I could return; I was sent for afterwards, and my aunt delivered these things to me for my mother and uncle—these were personal things already in my possession, and had nothing to do with the will—they were given to me in my mother's lifetime; it is quite immaterial whether I was there to receive them—my aunt, Mrs. Sampson, is alive now, and she can swear to the same facts—she for one has seen the 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of lace, and the maids, and Madame Michaux, a dressmaker and Court milliner; I don't know her exact address, it is in the City, in Oxford Street or Regent Street, I don't know; I am like a foreigner in England, I have been all my life away—she saw a good deal of it at 22, Gordon street—there is very little of this lace now at the Pantechnicon, some pickings off dresses, that is all I have seen—originally there was a list of the lace; I don't know where it is—since I have been away the Fletchers have got hold of my private papers and letters, and pulled about and ransacked everything—I have carried about the Fletchers' letters with me in my pockets—I have not got back any of my own letters—I cannot tell how many boxes there are at the Pantechnicon—besides the lace, I miss some jewellery, a watch, a diamond ring with three square cut cameos, another ring with three turquoise and some diamonds, and a very valuable cameo, with my mother's portrait—I was married to Mr. Hart-Davies in 1878—before Mr. Fletcher came to me I had seen my mother since her death, in dreams, as everybody does, more or less; we all dream more or less; they may be dreams or visions, call them what you will; sometimes they are called visions—I don't remember whether I have ever seen her when I have been out of bed and not asleep, simply as visions or dreams; it seemed like a dream passing before me—not in white robes and a crown on her head, that I remember—I suppose she appeared like something beautiful and bright, but you cannot define these things very well; I think she was more like her natural self to me, like a memory coming back to me of her natural self, more like a living memory—I think I saw a vision of her as she appeared in life while awake, I do not know; I do not remember, it was like dreaming awake, or awake dreaming—I cannot tell you how she was dressed; generally such things do not happen perhaps more than once in a lifetime I have not seen her frequently—it may have been on some occasions; I was much attached to her, and often thought of her; it was natural that I should dream about her—I have seen her distinctly as other persons see them, exactly, seeming dreams or visions, but as dreams—I had not been an acknowledged spiritualist before I knew Mr. Fletcher, but unconsciously, in feeling, on a belief in immortality, and in the sympathy of those who have gone before, in that sense; that is what I have always believed in—I never saw my mother in any sense different from that, other than as in a dream—it seemed to me in a dream as if I had seen her with my eyes—if I have said I saw her in a vision when I was wide awake, I contradict that; I have dreamt it, and it seemed to</p>

Mr. Burrows, of Hampton—I did not tell the Fletchers while I was at Vernon Place that I had discovered that my husband had put arsenic in my wine; I never knew that he did so, so I could not have discovered it—I never went to Gordon Street with my dress torn complain<lb/>ing that my husband was poisoning me, nor did I then ask Mrs. Fletcher to take care of the jewels for me—I did not say I was a believer in the affinity of spirits—I did not say that in the development of my belief I considered Mr. Fletcher was the counterpart of myself—I did not tell Mrs. Fletcher at that time that I had formed a notion of a spiritual Trinity on this earth—that was not my notion to begin with, she had said it long before, when I first knew them—I never proposed such a thing; she proposed it to me; it was quite her own idea; it was from the message—I did not know what it meant—if they used the expression, "a triangle," I did—I was like a sheep; I followed what they said—I very much regret it now, but I have learned experience—they said I was to go in as one of the triangle—I called myself Affection and Love to keep them all together, and I do not know what else—I was to be the love element of the family—she kept</p>

               <p>pressing me to go and live with them before I went to France, and when I returned I did—she was not against the notion that I should come and live where Mr. Fletcher was—I did not say, "You are in about the same position as 500 ladies I know"—she did not say if she accepted my condi<lb/>tions the house would be full of triangles—in my affection for them I followed all their ways, from my mother's messages—they did not suggest to me that I should write to my aunt to see whether she would take my furniture in before I went to France—I do not know whether I did write to her—I have often written to her—I did not write to her about taking anything in—she did not refuse to have anything to do with me, or to take anything in—I did not ask her to take care of the jewels and furniture—she did not interfere with my affairs—she did not say she would not do so—I do not know as a fact that she would not—people have tried to estrange us, for their own interests and for their own purposes, but they have not succeeded—I have not had occasion to see my aunt since; we have corre<lb/>sponded—she is a very old lady—she has her own affairs and I have mine—Mrs. Fletcher did not suggest that before taking the furniture into the house I had better write to my trustee—afterwards, when they had got it all, and they were frightened at the responsibility of having it, they did—when I was going to France they were afraid he would come and interfere—all these things were put in their possession for safe custody, except the jewels—the jewels and the wearing apparel had nothing to do with the furniture; they were sent there because of the trance messages—the boxes were sent shut up—I was ordered not to touch my own clothes by my mother, as I supposed—they were extremely nervous for fear people should inquire how they got hold of them; and so was Morton—they did not ask for a paper from my husband—just before I left for France they once asked me to communicate with Mr. Burrows—I introduced him to them when he came to London, to make it comfortable for them before I left—I am not aware that I have not been on good terms with Mr. Burrows—on the con<lb/>trary, I received a very kind letter yesterday from him—we were always on good terms; I am not aware of any quarrels—we have had many busi<lb/>ness troubles, owing to other people—I have never had occasion to complain of any one defrauding me before this—I am not in the habit of remember<lb/>ing my wrongs—the Fletchers urged me to ask Mr. Burrows to come to London, and he came and lunched with me at Vernon Place, and I took him on to the Fletchers; my husband was not present—it was a personal matter entirely—he knew that I was depositing these goods and jewels with the Fletchers—he could not interfere, under the terms of my marriage settlement—the wardbrobe and other things were placed in boxes and locked, and they were directed in Mr. Sampson's writing with my name, and that is the way they were delivered over to me after my mother's death by Mr. Sampson's widow—I did not communicate to the Fletchers the circumstances under which the property became mine; they only saw my name—the papers were originally outside on the boxes when they first came to their house—I fail to remember whether I ever said anything to them as to how they had been left to me; I only know they were my own—there was a separate marriage settlement—I have two separate mar<lb/>riage settlements, one for the personal property and one for the Sampson property—I had those two marriage settlements at the time I married Mr. Davies—I suppose they are in proper hands—one of them was executed at</p>

               <p>he took from a drawer in the room, and some from the top of the drawers—this list (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was made of them in pencil by Mr. Fletcher—he signed it (<hi rend="italic">a dressing-case, a diamond and opal heart, a turquoise ring, a coral fan, a variety of other articles, and a bill of exchange</hi>)—he said that was all the jewellery that was there, and he really did not know what Madame wanted, as he had no list, but some things he had had given to him, and he did not know whether she wanted those things—I told him that the Sheriff was at the door, and no doubt he would furnish him with a list—he said there was some more property which had been re<lb/>ceived the previous day at his mother-in-law's house at Lawrance and he would give me an order to get them, and I might send who I pleased for them—he did give me an order, and I gave it to the Sheriff, who brought back the remainder of the jewels—I took them into my charge, and they were deposited in my bedroom—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a list of the articles recovered from Lawrance—Mr. Fletcher made it, and I signed it as being the balance of the jewellery. (<hi rend="italic">This was signed "Received by Dr. Mac. J. W. Fletcher.</hi>") When the box was brought from Lawrance and de<lb/>posited in my room Mr. Fletcher immediately came and opened it, and made this pencil inventory—he said that the jewellery in the box belonged to Mrs. Davies—about the same time a list of dresses and articles other than jewellery was made—I do not know about its being done the same day—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a list of various dresses which Mr. Fletcher put into a box, and put into my possession; it is his own writing—he said that that was all he could find at the time—I then went to Boston—Madame Davies did not accompany me; I waited her return there at my brother's house—I left the matter in the hands of Mr. Urridge at Boston, and Madame Heurtley put it into the hands of a detective—I received a communication from the detective, and went to the defendant's house at Boston, and found her there—she was seemingly in her bed-room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know that Fletcher said he was very sure Madame Heurtley had not applied for the things herself; he may have, I don't recollect now—I do not think when I went into Mrs. Fletcher's bedroom on the last occasion she took out of the box all that belonged to Madame Heurtley; she lifted some things up, and said that they belonged to Madame Heurtley—I am very sure I did not take any of her things—I was. arrested, and put under bail of 40,000 dollars—I did not appear to my bail—I do not know whether if I go back to America they will make me pay—it is my intention to try and go back—I made a solemn oath—a bargain was made, a solemn obligation entered into, that if Madame Heurtley dropped the prosecution in the police-court, all other suits in America should be dropped against me, and upon that assurance I did not go back—I did not understand that a compromise was come to that all goods should be given up on payment of 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. expenses which the Fletchers had been put to—the compromise was come to in the United States—I am considerably an American; I was born there; 1 am a British American—Mr. Ives was Madame Heurtley's soli<lb/>citor, and Mr. Mohun was the Fletchers' solicitor—I do not know any<lb/>thing about this deed (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), authorising me to give up, but I can say this, that Madame Heurtley never agreed to it—I carried the agree<lb/>ment to her, and she demurred—Mr. Ives consented to it, as representing her—I did not know that the agreement was that if she would pay the</p>

               <p>expenses they had been put to, they would give up the things—I did not persuade her to run away from the agreement, and come to England—she and I talked it over, and I came over—the terms were that certain property should be given up which was not in Madame Heurtley's power to give up—I did not go to the people and tell them I was going away—I am a doctor for healing the sick—I do not mean to say that I have studied medicine—I was not a provision merchant before that—I do not claim to be a doctor of medicine; I heal without medicine—I cannot say that I heal by spiritualism—I attended the spiritualist meeting at Mount Pleasant, and met Madame Heurtley there—I did not commune with her spirit at all—if you ask me if I am a Shaker in a religious point of view, I say "No"—I do not understand that I am a spiritualist doctor—since I have been in England I have tried to attend to my business, and I hope with success—I do not know whether I am the Doctor Mao in the <hi rend="italic">Spiritualistic Review</hi>, who cured by the interposition of hands; I leave the patient to say that—I do cure by the laying on of hands—I am not at all modest about it—I lay my hands on whatever part it is required—I cannot say that I cure all complaints in this way—I do not know that there is a common form of <hi rend="italic">seance</hi> in America, it is common to man<lb/>kind, if they know how to exercise it and practise it; it is said to cure gout and rheumatism—I do not set bones (<hi rend="italic">handing in some pamphets</hi>)—it is the American practice to advertise one's business—I do not know that Mrs. Heurtley is cured—this is called the <hi rend="italic">Spiritualist Magazine</hi>—it describes a lady wearing a flannel on which I have laid my hands, and then it says: "It has a soft penetrating warmth, not a surface heat;" it has a soothing influence on the flannel first of all—health is communicated to flannel the same as disease is; if you lay your hand on a piece of flannel, and you give it the small-pox, you give the person the small-pox, and in the same way you take it away—I can communicate magnetic influence by the bare hand, without flannel, to any part of the human system—I have applied it to all parts; it cures all the local affections of those parts—I found Madame Heurtley suffering in her mind—I have not applied my hands to her at all; I can cure her mind by another process; not by flannel, but by advice—I have not been treating her magnetically that I am aware of—I may have given her a glass of wine or a cup of tea—having all these powers, I have not applied them to her at all, but I have cured a good many people in this way—it is understood that mag<lb/>netic influence cannot be communicated through silk; we look upon silk as a non-conductor of any magnetic fluid—I did not leave the country without telling my lawyer; I had another lawyer, but Mr. Ives was Madame Heurtley's lawyer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Field, Roscoe, Francis, and Osbaldiston, solicitors, of 36, Lincoln's Inn Fields—Colonel Morton first called on me on 28th January, 1879, with a letter of introduction from an old client of ours at Boston—he then said he was going abroad, and I did not see anything of him for four or five months—he then came and spoke to me about some lady who had some law business in hand, and who was not quite satisfied with her solicitor—he brought Mrs. Hart-Davies with some papers on a Chancery matter which had been lying dormant some time—I took them home the same evening, and wrote her a long letter of advice—I subsequently prepared a codicil at her request—not a word was said about spiritualism, or that there were any spiritualistic dealings in connection with the will.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Morton brought a letter of introduction from a gentleman of position, whose name I had rather not mention, and which introduced him as a member of the Boston Bar of high reputation—I made no inquiry about him; I could well rely on the introduction—these are my original notes—he saw me more than twice before Mrs. Davies came, and he gossiped with me about the difference between American and English law—he seemed to know what he was about—he came with Mrs. Davies the first time she came; that was about the Chancery business in connection with her marriage settlement—I should think she was there half an hour—that was on 16th October, 1879—my entry is, "Attending you on your calling with Mr. Morton, going through some papers in the suit, &amp;c., perusing papers and accounts furnished, and writing you on the next day, 16th October"—I spoke to her a great deal; she knew what she was about, and was able to maintain her own interests—she understood the nature of this suit, but we did not go into questions about her property; that was the business of the first interview—she was quite up to the average of ladies on matters of business, and seemed to understand her own interests perfectly well—the next entry I made is, "Attending Mr. Morton on his calling, &amp;c., and writing to yourself, advising you thereupon, and advising a short codicil"—I only saw Morton; I told him I could not touch her will without seeing her; that is my rule—he said that I could see her whenever I liked—I wrote to her, and she wrote to me to go to Vernon Place, as she was not well (<hi rend="italic">Reading his entry</hi>)—she had to reform her settlements, and I warned her that if she was going abroad she had better make arrangements—I asked her why she had left everything to the Fletchers—she said that she had no relations, and had quarrelled with her husband, and did not intend him to have any of her property; that she owed a great many acts of kindness to the Fletchers, and thought they deserved it more than any<lb/>body else—she told me the first time she came, I think, that she had quarrelled with her husband, or else Mr. Morton did, and she said that she should not live with him any more—she did not mention a son by the husband she had been divorced from, and I feel sure that she said she had no relations—when I read the codicil to her she said nothing to me about spiritualism—no one else was present at Vernon Place while she was consulting me or when she said she had no relations, but Mrs. Mayhew was called up to witness it afterwards—nothing was said about her property, or whether the Fletchers were taking charge of it—I knew nothing about protection deeds or deeds of gift—I would not have drawn them—she was very clear, indeed, and very shrewd and sensible, and what would I think be called a fascinating woman.</p>

My father keeps the Greyhound at West Ham—I act as barman—on 24th February, about a quarter past two, the prisoner came to the bar with two friends; he asked for half of bitter, a small lemon, and a glass of mild and bitter, which came to 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; he gave me a half-sovereign, and I gave him his full change, 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; it consisted of half a crown, a two-shilling piece, two sixpences, four separate shillings, and a halfpenny—he picked up the half-crown and pretended to test it with his teeth, he then did the same with the florin—one of his friends said,</p>

I live at 847, Old Ford Road, Bow; I am night watch<lb/>man in the employ of Mr. Roberta, at Rowatt's Wharf.; I nave been there 11 years and 8 months—on Tuesday morning, the 8th March, a fire happened there—I first noticed it between a quarter and 20 minutes past 2 o'clock; it broke out in the N shed—I first shouted out "Fire, Police; for God's sake, Noonan, get up!"—he is the fireman and lives on the wharf, and the two prisoners live in his house—part of the N shed joins right up to his house—I went and opened the shed and the flames came against me—just after the fire breaking out I saw the two prisoners come downstairs, from Noonan's house; Jeremiah had no shoues or stockings on, nor his hat—John came down first, he waft fully dressed; Jere<lb/>miah might be a minute or two after him—Noonan had nothing on but his night shirt—the N shed was burnt down—on Tuesday evening, the 8th, I came on duty before 5 o'clock—I made an examination of the premises by my superintendent's orders—I examined the M shed; the roof seemed secure; it contained a lot of paraffin oil in barrels, stored on the top of each other—I climbed up to the top of the barrels and walked over</p>

               <p>them—I suppose there were 400 or 500 barrels there; I could walk upright upon them and the roof—the roof was perfect and the barrels were all right—I had asked Jeremiah on the Tuesday morning to come and help me, and do all he could with the barrels; that was about three o'clock, when the fire was raging—his answer was, "Go and yourself"—he did not come and help me—about half-past 5 o'clock on the evening of the 8th I met John Sullivan at the bottom of Bow Bridge—I said to him, "Jerry is taken for that fire"—he said, "I suppose I will be the next"—I knew that morning there was a hole found in the roof of the shed—I met John Sullivan about 10.30 on Tuesday night, the 8th, and asked him why was he not gone to bed—he said Mr. Noonan had told him to stop up to have a look round while he was having a lie down.</p>

I am unmarried, and now live at 85, Chatham Street, Walworth; I formerly lived at 55, Gravel Lane—on the night of the 13th December about 12.20 I saw the prisoner putting up the shutters—I went away and returned in about 10 minutes; I then found the shop closed—I heard Mrs. Davies scream "help and murder" and heard some one fall—I unlocked the door and went in, and saw her lying on the ground in the passage near the parlour door; the prisoner was leaning over her—she said "I am stabbed"—I asked him if he had done it; he said "No"—she was lifted into the parlour into a chair by Mr. Fotherby—I didn't see any knife about; there were no supper things on the table—they occupied the shop and two parlours at the back.</p>

I live at 55, Gravel Lane—on 13th December about 12.20 I heard a little bit of scuffling downstairs in the parlour underneath—I got out of bed and listened, and after two or three minutes I heard "murder and help" screamed—I ran downstairs and saw Mrs. Davies lying in the passage, and the prisoner close to her—I pulled her up and put her on a chair, she said she was stabbed—I said, "Where?" she said, "Here, but I can't tell you"—I said, "If you are stabbed, where is the knife?"—I looked about but could not see one—the prisoner said he had done nothing—I went for the doctor.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector M</hi>). On the morning of the 14th a little after 2 I went to 55, Gravel Lane—I saw the prisoner in the passage—I asked if he was the landlord, he said, "Yes"—we went into the back parlour—I found Mrs. Davies there, and Dr. Wilson and his assistant—I asked Mrs. Davies who had committed the assault upon her, she replied, "My husband"—he made no reply at that time—in conse<lb/>quence of what the doctor said I thought it right to take a statement from her—the prisoner was present—it was made in answer to ques<lb/>tions that I and Dr. Wilson put to her—I took it down and read it over to her, and she put her mark to it: this is it. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I believe I am in a dying state, and make the following statement voluntarily. My husband and I have not for the last two days been on good terms. He has been drinking. He struck me first with his fist. I defended myself as well as I could. He had then no knife in his hand when he was putting up the shutters. He found some wooden boxes in his way. He got angry at this, and struck me with the shop knife. When I received the blow I rushed to the door and screamed 'Murder.' Mrs. Fotherby came. I showed the wound to her. I am positive my husband done it; there was no other person in the room. I don't know the cause of the quarrel. I was perfectly sober. I had had a portion of a quartern of gin between four of us, one of whom was my husband's mother.") When she had made</p>

               <p>this statement I sent the prisoner to the station, and then searched the house—I found these two knives (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this long thin one was on the counter in the shop, about eight feet from the parlour door—this broad one was on the bacon-slab beside the door, a few inches from it—the thin knife was clean, the other had a stain on the point of it—I could not see what the stain was, it was dry—I called Dr. Wilson's attention to it—I hare the clothes which the prosecutrix was wearing—the doctor and I compared the holes in these clothes with the broad knife; the hole went through the apron, dress, and petticoats—the knives were shown to Mrs. Davies, who said she could not identify either of them as the knife with which she was stabbed—I read over the charge to the prisoner at the station; he wanted to make a statement—I cautioned him, and said I would take it down; it might be used against him in evidence—he said, "Very well"—he then made this statement. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "As soon as I. came, home my wife accused me of being out whoremongering again, which I denied, and then started putting up the shutters. There were some cheese-boxes in my way, which annoyed me. I told her to move the things out of the way, when she said, 'B—them; move them yourself'. I then made a rush at her, and attempted to strike her. We went into the parlour and had a free fight. In the scuffle she took up the knife and <hi rend="italic">drawded</hi> it across my wrist, which was marked longways. She got the knife from the bacon-board in the shop. In the struggle she got her stab.") I read it over to him and he signed it—I looked at his wrist, and noticed that there was a mark on it—I believe it was the left wrist—it appeared to be a mark from finger-nails, a scratch—it was fresh, but not bleeding then—I called Dr. Wilson's attention to it next day—the prisoner also had some scratches on his right cheek, apparently made with a finger-nail; they were fresh.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I found the knife on the bacon slab—there are two steps leading from the parlour to the shop—I found the prosecutrix in the sleeping-room; the prisoner was about speaking while we were questioning her, and he was stopped by Dr. Wilson—he said "Hush"—he thought the woman was dying—this dress is a sort of black stuff, the petticoat of flannel; there were no stays—the wound on the prisoner's wrist was about six inches long, extending from the wrist up the arm—I found some dinner knives in a drawer in the parlour; none of those were pointed.</p>

I live at 38, Great Charlotte Street—on the morning of 14th December, shortly after I o'clock, I went to Mrs. Davies—I found her suffering from a punctured wound low down on the left side of the abdomen, the abdominal wall was perforated, and the intestines protruded about a foot and a half; one portion of the intestine was divided in about half its circumference—we removed her to her bed in the adjoining room—I had to enlarge the wound in order to return the intestine, and I then sewed up the external wound; the operation took some considerable time—afterwards, while the woman's statement was being made, the prisoner kept interrupting—I told him for his own sake not to speak—the long knife was brought to me; the woman said</p>

               <p>she did not know that it was done with that knife; in my opinion it was probably done with this broad knife—the woman was in great danger at the time—I have attended her ever since; every day for about six weeks, and at intervals since—I think she has quite recovered now—I have seen the clothes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the holes in them exactly correspond with the larger knife—the clothes would scarcely offer any resistance—I examined the prisoner's wrist the following day—I could not positively say how the wound was caused; probably by a scratch; it might have been from the point of a knife.</p>
