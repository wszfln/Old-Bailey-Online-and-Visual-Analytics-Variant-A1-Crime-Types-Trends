I let the place to the prisoner—he took it by the week—it was the shop, parlour, and use of the shed and the bed-room—we let it to him himself at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he was to have it one year, according to agreement—he was not to have the use of the barrow—I saw the barrow in the yard shortly before Christ<lb/>mas—I went to the prisoner, who had coals and coke in the shed—I said to him, "Where is my husband's barrow?" as he wanted it to make use of—he said, "Woman, I know nothing of the barrow"—I said, "Where is the washing-tub?"—he said he knew nothing of that—it is called a cask in the indictment—I had never sold him the barrow, nor given him the use of it—he had no business with the partition—he took it down without our consent, and put it into the shed at first—the quartering was in the shed—it belonged to my husband, and the stove was in the shed—I never sold it to the prisoner—he had no right to move it—we have never had one farthing of the rent—Loader kept the shop about a month or five weeks, and found himself ruined—he took his goods away, and locked the shop up—we have lost the use of the shop—we found the prisoner at another beer-shop.</p>

About three o'clock in the afternoon of the 14th of February, I had occasion to go down stairs, and met the prisoner coming from the back-yard—I saw something bulky under his arm—I asked him who he was, and what he wanted—he muttered something, and ran away—I ran, and cried "Stop thief"—a man caught him in Half Moon-alley, Bishopsgate-street—he was out of my sight a few seconds, as I fell down, and nearly broke my knee pan—when I came up, I found part of a leaden pipe</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of the watch of Bread-street ward. On the 1st of April, about eight o'clock, I was in Gutter-lane, and saw the prisoner, and two other persons with him—all three together—Taylor was carrying the property in question under his arm—I followed, and at last took him into custody, and took care of the property—some time after I took James, the second man—they were tried here, and the property was then produced—I apprehended the prisoner last Thursday week.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you desert with a large sum of money, and were you not tried by a Court Martial for it in France? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I got my living when I came over here by the money I got for my pay at Portugal—I sold picture-books about the struct—I would sell any thing—I have been in prison, but it was all through a conspiracy against me—it was from the information of the prisoner—I was arrested on the 3rd of June.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a die-sinker, and live at No. 6, Maria-street, Kingsland-road. I was acting as pot-boy at the Acton Arms at the time in question—Mr. Kelly came there, and called for a quartern of gin—three women were at the bar at the time the gin was called for—he was served with it, and then I went into the tap-room—he was then taken sick, being the worse for liquor—I cannot say that I heard him call for the gin, but it was lying on the bar when I went in—I was out at the time it was called for—I did not see him drink any gin—he had a glass of porter to drink—there were three women at the bar—I did not hear them call for any liquor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said before the Magistrate that they called for a quartern of gin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw the gin on the bar—Mr. Kelly paid for it—I saw his sovereign on the counter—he pulled out his purse—I then went away into the tap-room—he was taken very sick, and was retching very bard—I did not see him put his purse into his pocket—he was not to very much in liquor, but he was a little the worse for it—I had seen the women before—they were occasionally customers at the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at the prisoner; can you take on yourself to say that she is one of them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She was dressed very differently then to what she is now, hut I believe she was one of the three—when the prosecutor was taken sick, my master told me to see him out at the door—I did not do so—the three women saw him out—I remained against the door—I could see what</p>

               <p>was doing—the door is three or four yards from the bar—I went to the door with him—I observed the prosecutor leaning over some palings, and retching very much—he was about five yards from me—while he was retching, the three women were round him, the same as I had seen in the public-house—the prisoner and another woman then went off. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see any thing done before they went off? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The prisoner had the prosecutor's purse in her hand—she got it from his right-hand trowsers pocket—I saw her take it, and then I saw her and one of the other women go off—I had seen the prisoner at our house several times before—I am positive she was in the house that night, and I am positive that she had the purse in her hand—the Acton Arms is a public-house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What do you mean by saying that she was dressed very differently when asked if you knew the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She was dressed differently—she had a bonnet on then—it is about four months ago—I am positive she is one of the persons—she had a bonnet on, and a kind of a light shawl—I think the shawl makes a good deal of difference in identify<lb/>ing her—she is in a different dress now—that made me doubt about her at first—I was not exactly sure of her then, but I have looked at her since—I did not say she was dressed differently without looking at her—I had seen her, and was not positive of her—I am positive of her now—I did not say I was not positive of her—she had on a kind of straw bonnet—I have not seen her since.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you lead the prosecutor to the door of the public-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not—I swear that—I was examined before the Magistrate—(<hi rend="italic">looking at his deposition</hi>)—this is my handwriting—it was read over to me before I signed it—I was desired to attend to it—I said, "By the desire of my master I led him to the door," and I said that the three prisoners led him out—(<hi rend="italic">the deposition being read, was as follows, "By desire of my matter I led him to the door, and the three women followed him out,"</hi>)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, did not you say that you led the prosecutor to the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not swear it—I swore that the women led him out—when I saw the prisoner in Old-street, it was in the open street, between two and three o'clock in the day—it was above a mile from my master's house—the wo<lb/>men were all perfectly sober on the night of the robbery—I have always been of that opinion—I have seen them tipsy sometimes, but they were sober that night—I gave evidence here on the last trial.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, did not you then say that the prisoner then on trial, one of the three women, was in liquor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not—the prosecu<lb/>tor was rather in liquor—I did not swear the woman then being tried was rather in liquor—there were only the three women there—there were no girls there, only the three women—that I swear—I never said there were three or four girls round the bar—I called these-women girls—I did not say there were any girls besides these—I never stated there were more than three—they said they would see Mr. Kelly out—they all three lived together, at least, Ann Sherwood, the one who is transported, said so.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Shaftesbury, and practise as an attorney there, and did so in April last. On the 17th of April, the prisoner called on me at my office—I never did any business for him before—I knew him by sight, but did not know his name—he told me his name was Cornish, that he had a little matter of business to be done—I asked him what it was—he said he had money in the funds, and wished to sell out 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him in what stock it was—he said he had a document in his posses<lb/>sion which would show what stock it was in—I asked him to show it to me—this is the document he showed me—(<hi rend="italic">looking at an account</hi>)—he told me it was 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said, "You will find it in that account"—he said it was an account between Mr. Alner and his wife before his marriage—the account is now exactly in the same state as when he produced it—I observed that Mr. Alner charged himself with what he received on account of his wife, and on the other side he discharged himself—I took means to obtain a power of attorney, but it turned out that there was no such stock, and as such, nothing came of that—the instructions for the power were returned to me, and the prisoner was persuaded that nothing could be done with it—I told him that there was no such stock—some letters passed between me and him about it—I communicated the information to him by letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you, in the course of any conversation with him, tell him there was no such stock as that in the name of Miss Wallridge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did when I saw him on the 2nd of May last year at my office—he told me he had seen Mr. Robert Alner, and he had told him if the money was not in his wife's name it must be either in his (Alner's) name alone, or else in the names of Mr. William Bridge and himself, and that Mr. Alner had desired him to get him a power of attorney now for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and to bring it to him and he would execute it—I then went to the bank of Brodie and Co., and de<lb/>sired them to send up for a power of attorney to sell out 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. standing in the name of Robert Alner, or Robert Alner and Mr. Bridges, part of 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner always confined himself to the 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this power was after<lb/>wards delivered to me unexecuted by the clerk of Brodie and Co. on the morning of the 4th of May—I had given directions for it on the 2nd of May—I then put it into a letter, and sent it to the prisoner by a messenger—I saw the prisoner about it afterwards—he brought it back to me on Saturday the 13th of May, to my office, in the same state as it is now, apparently ex<lb/>ecuted and attested, except the word "Dorset"—he told me that Mr. Ro<lb/>bert Alner had been over to his house at Piddletown, and executed it there—one of the attesting witnesses lived at Has elbury, and the other at another place—I made an observation on that, and he said Mr. Alner came over to his house and executed it there, and said he was sorry he should have had so much trouble about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There is a paper annexed to the front of it—did you write that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>

               <p>Part of it, and part was written by my clerk—it is an authority to Brodie and Co., dated May 10th, and signed "Robert Alner"—it merely says, "Pay proceeds of£300 Stock, 3 per Cent Annuities, (for which I have exe<lb/>cuted a power,) to William Cornish and Mary Elizabeth, his wife; or either of them."—(Signed)—"Robert Alner"—he brought me that authority with the power of attorney—there was a blank left for the date—it had been sent up in blank, but it was returned to me filled up and signed—underneath this is in my handwriting, a direction to Brodie to pay the above to George Chitty—this was signed by the prisoner in the presence of my clerk, who has witnessed it—it is dated "13th of May"—in pur<lb/>suance of that order I received the money—I had credit for it in my ac<lb/>count, on the 18th of May—the prisoner called on me that day, and asked if the money was sold out—I told him it was—he then said he would call next morning, and said he should require£200—he called next morning, and I sent my cheque to the Bank, payable to him—my clerk brought back twenty£10 notes of the Shaftsbury Bank—I gave them to the pri<lb/>soner, and he gave me this receipt for it, which I have in my ledger—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I made a statement of the account between him, and hit wife, and myself, to show what he would be entitled to after paying my bill—here is the account—(<hi rend="italic">reading</hi>)—"Bill£6 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—cash at different times, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," on the credit side is "Amount of proceeds of stock, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., part of 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3 per Cents Reduced"—after deducting brokerage and power of attorney, 269<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—deduct power of attorney, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., net 267<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the balance due to them, 259<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—underneath the balance it brought down, "Cash on account, 19th May, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and he has signed his name—I then drew out a receipt on a 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. stamp, which I desired him to get signed by himself and his wife, for the whole proceeds, and delivered it to him, but he never brought it back—I delivered to him this paper—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—as a copy of the account I have just read—it is in my own handwriting—I delivered it to him at the time the transac<lb/>tion took place—it corresponds with my ledger exactly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner afterwards make an application to you to gets power to transfer a further sum of money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—about June or the latter end of May—he applied to me to get a power to transfer 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the remainder of the 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the power remained in my office some time—I handed it to him, but it never came to me as an executed deed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Turn to your diary for the instruction you had for the second power for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no entry there of it—I have not been taken into custody as <hi rend="italic">participites criminals</hi> to this—nor charged—I was before the Magistrate—I was not charged as an accessory to this forgery, that I am aware of—I went there at the request of Mr. Freshfield—he wrote to request me to go there as a witness with my clerk, and I went with him, and returned the same day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the state of your banker's account at the time you sold out the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think I owed them any thing at the time—sometimes I am overdrawn 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or less or more—it appears by my book that I owed them nothing at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does it not appear that till you got the 260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. your banking account was so much overdrawn? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Looking at the book</hi>) Yes, certainly—no, it does not; I see, by looking, here are the sums I drew out on the 18th—the date of the sale is the 18th of May—my account was balanced at the end of the year, and here is, Dec. 31st, 1836, my account balanced; and then</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183802260037"/>
               <p>I owed my bankers 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on the 2nd of January 1 paid in 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on the 1st of March 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and up to the 30th of March following I see I owed my bankers nothing—the first debit to me is, May 6th, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the power of attorney—I drew a cheque for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 20th, and another for 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the 18th of May, for the prisoner, when he called on me, and I left the remainder there—on the 19th I drew a cheque for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when this money was put to my credit I did not owe my bankers any thing—I did not pay the prisoner the 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—he came on the 18th, and said he would call in the morning—I wrote a letter to him, inclosing a£10 note, and he called before the letter went to the Post Office—I did not pay him the money—on the 18th of May the balance in my bankers' hands was 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was the balance I owed my bankers; but allow me to explain—it appears that the bankers had given me credit for the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and charged me with the 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on the 19th of May it appears J owed them 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not pay the 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd to the prisoner, but I sent up a cheque for the amount.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why not pay it to the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did not come—he was to have come in the evening, when I was to arrange it, but he did not come till next morning—he then said he should only require 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I sent to the bankers' and got it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Well now, then, was not your balance overdrawn at the time you received the prisoner's money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—at the time the money was put to my account I did not owe them any thing—I did not know this was car<lb/>ried to my account at all till afterwards—here is the account the prisoner gave <hi rend="italic">me—(producing it</hi>)—I did not find him a very intelligent man—I found him rather deficient—I did not consider him illiterate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, was not one of the questions you asked him on your first interview with him, whether, on his marriage, there was any settle<lb/>ment executed, and did not he tell you he did not know whether there was or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did not at the first interview, but when the bankers informed me that the money was not in his wife's name, he called on me, and I asked him, "Was any thing done on your marriage?"—he said something was done, but whether it was before or after he could not tell—he did not tell me he did not know whether there was any settlement or not—I paid over the last balance, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, to him, in November—on the 21st of September the balance due to him was 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have been an attorney since 1820.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When he told you he wanted the stock to be sold out, that it was in the maiden name of his wife, and you found there was no such stock, as an attorney acquainted with business, did it not excite your suspicion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—nor when he told me, if it was not in that name, it was in the name of Alner, or Alner and Bridge—I did not inquire of Mr. Alner if it was correct, because the prisoner told me he had seen Mr. Alner—I did not write to Mr. Alner—I had seen the prisoner about a year and a half before, when he was a witness in a case at Dorset<lb/>shire, in which I was concerned, and I recollected him from that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Well, but he having given you information which was incorrect, and referring you to the names of trustees whose signature he was to get, you thought, it your duty to go on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I made myself debtor to him, and he had the money whenever he wanted it—he applied to me to get another power of attorney to sell 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will swear that—I do not know whether any body was present—I am not in the habit of having persons present</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183802260038"/>
               <p>when I am on business—the prisoner told me he was out of business, and wanted this to go into business—he at first produced the account to me, and said that would explain it; and I considered, by the account, that it was in his wife's name—I considered at first that he was aware the stock was in his wife's name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But afterwards, when he said it might be in Mr. Alner's or two other names, did not you think he did not know where it was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said that was what Mr. Alner had told him—I never asked the prisoner to lend me 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not apply to him for the loan of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will tell you what I did—I did not apply to him—he proposed it—he came to me about the second power, and said, "I have seen Mr. Alner; he has con<lb/>sented for us to have the remainder of the 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 1 shall want about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; will you keep the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in your hands till we want it?" and I said I had no objection—I know that money in the funds pays interest—he said he should not require the money, would I keep it in my hands till he wanted it—I said I had no objection—I paid him interest for the balance in my hands when the balance was struck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to swear that at this time you do not owe the prisoner money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do swear it most solemnly—here is my account—he is my debtor, for I am charged with the expenses of the second power of attorney.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Here is a piece of paper pasted into your ledger, and which I see "On 26th November, Mr. George Chitty paid me 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which settles all account between us?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—that happened on a Sunday—I was passing an inn where he was—he said, "I shall be obliged to you to pay me the balance"—I said, "Certainly"—I had not the money, but I went and got it—I returned to the inn where he was, paid it to him, and took that memorandum; and next morning I got my clerk to paste it into the book—I do not keep any cash-book—this is my ledger—I always enter it into the ledger at once.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you pay a single farthing to your bankers after you got the 269<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the proceeds of this 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Looking at his book</hi>)—No—I have not any account—I did not know this was carried to my account till the other day, when Mr. Freshfield wrote to me for my pass-book—I sent to the bankers, and said, "Will you make it up to this time?" and they made it up to the 11th of November—since that I have had no transaction with the bankers—I am in my banker's debt at present—I owe them 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I was not in their debt at the time this sale was made—the account begins on the 2nd of January, when I paid them 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—at that time I owed them 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., all but 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I paid them more than 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. after that—I paid them orders, but they are not entered in the book—if I go and ask for a draft, they do not enter it in the book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you were first examined before the Magistrate, was it on oath or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Without oath—I have been in the habit of practising in Criminal Courts—I considered I was being examined as a witness, though not on oath; and after I had made my statement, and gone through the account, the prisoner said every word I had stated was true—Mr. Fresh<lb/>field was present, and other witnesses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you not know you yourself were under charge and under exa<lb/>mination, and told you might say any thing if you liked, but were not obliged to state any thing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not told so—I was not cautioned by the Magistrate that I need not say any thing unless I liked—he said, "Mr.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183802260039"/>
               <p>Chitty, will you explain it?" and I said, "With pleasure"—I believe the Magistrate's words were, that I need not say any thing unless I liked, but I might make an explanation if I pleased—I have heard that put to pri<lb/>soners before—I believe it was two or three days after I made my state<lb/>ment that I was examined on oath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When parties come to you to represent they want stock sold, and you find it in the hands of trustees, are you in the habit of doing it without consulting the trustees? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have nothing to do with it—I give it to the bankers, and give them instructions—I have not had an instance of being applied to for a power of attorney for years—if a party say they are sent by the trustees, I do not think it. my duty to apply to them—I certainly see now that if I had written to the trustees, it would have saved all this—I knew Mr. Alner to be a gentleman of respectability and station in Dor<lb/>setshire—I certainly considered, on looking at the power and the state<lb/>ment of the account produced by the prisoner, that it was the handwriting of Mr. Alner, and the bankers considered the same—the bankers were not glad to get it to settle their account, for it was not to be placed to my ac<lb/>count—the signature to the power is not placed far from the right place—it is not so near to the seal as I should put it, but that is a matter of opinion—I think it is sufficiently near—I should say it is executed in the right place—I see no objection to it—I cannot tell who drew this line from the word "Alner" down to the seal—I will swear that—I will swear it was not done by me, nor in my presence, that I know of—I have no knowledge of it at all—I will certainly swear it was not done in my presence—I have not the least knowledge of it—I will swear, to the best of my knowledge, it was not—I will swear positively it was not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are not the two first witnesses names opposite the seal, instead of the person purporting to execute the power? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That will appear by the thing itself—they appear opposite the seal certainly—that is a very unusual thing—it is bad writing—I thought it was oddly done, and mentioned it to the bankers—I noticed the distance of "Robert Alner" from the seal, but the bankers said, as long as it was signed by Robert Alner, they thought it would do—I looked at the account, and said, "It is Robert Alner's writing"—I said it was very odd for the persons demanding to act to witness up there, for I thought it oddly done—I did not think it my duty to inquire of Mr. Alner, as I considered it was Mr. Alner's handwriting—I have not received any money from the prisoner besides the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I paid him over all the proceeds of the money except that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I find, in the first three months of 1837, you paid to your bankers only 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and up to the same period you drew out 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, leaving a balance in your favour of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and when I was debited with the power of attorney, that made my account even—At the commencement of this business my account was even with them—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the paper pasted in the book</hi>)—I wrote this above the prisoner's name, at the inn, on Sunday the 26th of November, and he signed it—I had, before that, cast up and balanced my account as it appears there—it is merely an acknowledgment of the balance being paid to him—I have in the course of my time seen many deeds executed imperfectly, in the coun<lb/>ty particularly—I have seen names signed a greater distance from the seal than this—I went on with the business, believing it to be a genuine trans<lb/>action—I had not heard any thing about the prisoner, or who he had married—he told me who he had married when he first came—on seeing the</p>

               <p>account, he told me he had married the lady whose account that was, and that she was a niece of Mr. Alner—I took this power to the bankers—they made some observations about it, and forwarded it to London, and the money came from London.</p>

I recollect Mr. Chitty applying to me, in the month of April, for a power of attorney; in consequence of which I wrote to a house in London to obtain one for him, according to his instructions—we received the power from our correspondent in London, and I sent or took it to Mr. Chitty—I received it again from him, about seven or eight days after—it was then executed, and in the state it is now—I sent it to London the same evening as I received it from him—Mr. Chitty's account was afterwards credited with the proceeds of the sale.</p>

Q.</hi> I see that Mr. Chitty's account consists of two items of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., besides the money which was the produce of this sale in 1837? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it finishes by ending in our debt 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—where the balance is struck 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in our favour, a line is drawn, and 1838 is pat at the top—that has taken place since I left the bank—there is January, and then there comes October and November—that is, cheques that he has drawn, and were not charged to his account—although he had not paid any more money, he had drawn money out.</p>

               <p>seven o'clock there was a knock at the door—I opened it, and found the prisoner there—he asked me for the first and second volume of Ivanhoe—I told him it was not a library, and we did not let out books—he said no, he knew that, but that they had had them from their library, and he wanted them—I asked him to come in—he did so—I shut the door, and went into the parlour—while I was delivering the message, I heard the coat-stand rattle in the hall, as if something was being pulled off it—I called out, and ran into the hall immediately; and as I went into the hall, I saw the pri<lb/>soner making his escape—he shut the door after him, without waiting for any thing—I saw him again about three or four minutes afterwards in cus<lb/>tody, and knew him immediately—I said, "That is the man"—I have not seen the coat since—I had let my master in when he came home, and ob<lb/>served him place his coat on the middle peg of the stand.</p>

I was passing along Westbourne-place, on the evening of the 30th of January, and within a few yards of No. 4, I observed the prisoner come out of Mr. Bate man's gate, on the foot-path, and run away—at the same time I heard an alarm of "Stop thief"—the houses are fronted by a fore-court—I saw him run out of the gate—it was past seven o'clock—I could not observe whether he had any thing with him—I pursued him directly, and never lost sight of him till I took him—he turned a corner, but there was a gas-light at the corner—he might have put the coat over the railings to another person be<lb/>fore I saw him—I am certain he is the person who came out of the gate—Mr. Bateman came up, and held me as well as the prisoner till the police-man came up—the prisoner ran first, he then made a dead stop, and, when he was taken, immediately pretended to be very tipsy—he said he had just come out of the public-house, and asked what was the matter.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Frederic-place, Mile-end, and am a boot and shoe-maker. On Friday, the 2nd of February, just about midnight, I was a little elevated, and met the prisoner just past Mile-end turnpike—I had been with my brother the best part of the afternoon—I was passing—the prisoner seized me from behind—she began to talk very quickly to me—I listened to her, and walked home to her house—she did not ask me to go—I went quietly on—I think she took me to No. 1, Little Collingwood-street, up stairs—I was there, I suppose, three quarters of an hour—I only gave her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to get a pot of porter and a pipe of tobacco—I had a sovereign and a half-sovereign, wrapped up in a <hi rend="italic">£</hi> 5 note, in my fob, under my watch—I was on the bedstead—I felt the prisoner's hand at my watch, as I thought, and I put my hand down, and the watch fell into my hand—I said, "What is this, how is this?" and immediately I was left in darkness—I suppose it was the prisoner's hand that pulled my watch out—the waistband of my trowsers had become unbuttoned—I judge that was by the operation of the prisoner—the braces were not undone—I missed my money, I suppose a quarter of an hour after she got the pot of beer and the pipe—I did not charge her with stealing it—she was too quick in going away, and leaving me in darkness—I went down to the street's end, and requested a person to tell the first policeman, and in a minute a policeman came to me—I told him, and he knew the prisoner, and knew her residence—I went to the station soon after, and the prisoner was brought, and said, "If you will give me the change, I will tell you where the£5 note is.</p>

On the 27th of January I went to No. 127) Wentworth-street, Whitechapel, at a little after three o'clock in the afternoon—two officers, named Duke and Hall, were with me—I found the street-door of the house open—I went up two pair of stairs, followed by Duke and Hall—when I got to the top of the two pair of stain there was no landing—there was a door which was shut—I tried it, and found the fastening of the door——in feeling about for the fastening, I found a piece of cord hanging down—I laid hold of that with my right hand, and put my left hand on the latch—by pulling the cord I removed a log of wood, which was placed against the door, and opened it—I entered the room immediately; and on the left-hand side of the room, sitting in front of a small furnace, on a stool, was the prisoner—he had on a waistcoat with sleeves—there was charcoal in the furnace—as soon as I entered the room he rose up from the seat—he had a small brush in his right hand—Duke and Hall had followed me into the room—I took hold of him on one side, and Duke took hold of him by the other side—he resisted having the handcuffs on, and dropped the brush on the ground—I handed him over to Hall—Duke went to the fur<lb/>nace, turned round, and said, "Reynolds, look at this, feel this"—he showed me a sixpence, as if it had been under the process of gilding—I felt it, and it was quite warm—it appeared yellow—I then went to a bench close to the window, alongside of where the prisoner had been sitting—I removed a tin dish containing charcoal-ashes, and then saw the lid of a tin box—on removing that, I saw three silver sixpences under the box-lid—I called Hall, and gave them to him—he took them up—I afterwards</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-officer of Hatton-garden. I went with Duke and Reynolds to Wentworth-street, and assisted in apprehending the prisoner—when I entered the room he was standing up, and Duke was putting the handcuffs on him—I was the last that went into the room, but not above a minute after them—we were all on the staircase together—I took the prisoner into custody from Duke directly I went into the room—I searched him, and while I was doing so, he said I should find no bad money on him, nor <hi rend="italic">them</hi> neither—in his left-hand pocket I found this purse, containing ten good sixpences, of various dies—in his right-hand pocket I found a purse, containing 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—after searching him, Reynolds said, "Hall, look here"—I went to the bench where he was standing—he took up a tin cover, and under it were three sixpences—Reynolds gave them to me—these are the three—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—he then took up an<lb/>other cover, and there were four sixpences, which he gave me—three of them have the garter removed, and are yellow—I have given the prisoner the amount of the good money found in his right-hand trowsers pocket—there are half-sovereigns among it—I kept the money itself, and gave him other money for it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Mr. Powell describe to you the trade of this man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said he believed him to be a watch gilder—I expected he was a gilder—I have produced every thing I found—here is a little bottle found in a cup<lb/>board, which I believe has had quicksilver in it—I have not been paid for this job.</p>

I have examined the coin which has been produced—these are all good sixpences—there are three or four of them which are gilt—the three produced by Hall, and they are sixpences of the reign of Geo. IV., and all have been gilded with gold—one of them has bad an altera<lb/>tion on the reverse side, by the removal of the gaiter surrounding the shield—three of those produced by Hall are in that altered state, but not gilt—the garter has been removed in all of them—here is another produced by Hall of the same description as the last—it has been altered, and is in an earlier stage of the process of gilding—it requires the further application of fire, and a brush to part the quicksilver from the gold—all I have now spoken of were produced by Hall.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you satisfied that appearance on it, arises from the amalgam of quicksilver and gold, or from the heat of the furnace throwing out the alloy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From my experience I have no doubt there is a portion of gold on the surface, a considerable portion of gold on the surface of it—the three are also certainly gilt—here are four other sixpences, produced by Duke, in an earlier state of gilding—three of them appear to have only had quicksilver, but no gold on them—this substance produced in the paper is an amalgam of gold and quicksilver—(<hi rend="italic">this was the substance found in the soft state</hi>)—that is a material always used in this process of gilding—the proportion is generally one part gold to six or eight of quicksilver—this process of gilding is usually called water gilding—water gilding is the technical term known in the trade, that is, gilding by amalgam—it is tech<lb/>nically called water gilding—there are many other processes of gilding—the silver is generally cleansed by muriatic acid diluted, it is then washed over with quicksilver only, and then the amalgam of quicksilver and gold is applied, by rubbing it on by one of these instruments which have been</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183802260070"/>
               <p>produced, and which is generally used for the purpose by watch-gilders; it is then held over a charcoal furnace, the quicksilver is driven away by the heat, and a brush is applied to take away the remaining portions—these basins each contain quicksilver, and the bottles also contain quicksilver—this glass vessel when at the police-office smelt very strongly of acid—I could not tell what—there is quicksilver in it—they both contain quicksilver, and the bottles also—two of these half-sovereigns produced by Hall resemble the sixpences.</p>

About eleven o'clock, on the night of the 8th of February, I went into a chandler's shop, kept by James Wolley, and from information I received there, I was led to the Queen's Head—in consequence of information I received there, I went to No. 11, Bennett's-court—Bailey and Garby, two police-constables, were with me—it was between eleven and twelve o'clock—I knocked at the door of the house—the female prisoner answered the door—I did not know her before—I asked her whether a female lived there, named Hill—she said, "No"—I then asked her whether her husband, King, was within—she said, "Yes, he was"—I immediately ran up stairs, desiring the constables to follow me—my lantern was lighted—I went up one pair of stairs—the house consists of two rooms—I went into the room, and saw the male prisoner standing by the bed—he was then trampling on a white substance, which I could see under his feet—I endeavoured to take him into custody—he crossed the room as quickly as possible, and threw a handful of what I considered was half-crowns, into his mouth, from his right hand—I laid hold of him by the throat, and felt them distinctly in his month, and in the passage leading to his throat—I could feel distinctly that they were half-crowns—I could not form any idea of what number—I should say there were a great number—he was unable to utter a syllable, his mouth was so full—I did not get any of them out—he swallowed them—I called for Bailey to assist me—he came and held his hands—he was very violent, attempting to get away—he struggled hard, and while he was struggling the female prisoner entered the room with a lighted candle, which she immediately blew out, and said, "Oh, my God, we are done," or words to that effect—Bailey said, "He is reaching towards the fire"—he had at that time extricated his left hand from Bailey, and Bailey said, "He is endeavouring to throw something into the fire"—(the fire was low)—I looked, and saw him reach his left hand towards the fire—I let go of his throat, and told Bailey to hold him—he got his left hand from me, and passed something from his left hand to the right, and out of his right hand I took four counterfeit half-crowns, which I produce—Bailey said, "There is another at his feet"—I looked down, and saw him endeavouring to conceal a half-crown on the floor, with his feet—I took it from under his feet, and now produce it—I desired the constable to keep him in safe custody while I searched the room—he said, "You need not search any more, you have got enough to <hi rend="italic">lag</hi> me"—I searched his person, but found</p>

               <p>nothing else on him—I picked up the white substance which he was trampling on, and have it here—I searched, among other places, a drawer in a table, and found a small file, with a quantity of white metal in the teeth of it, as it is now—I then found two Britannia metal tea-spoons; and on the mantel-piece, a large tobacco-pipe, with a quantity of metal in it, and black, as if it had been in the fire—the male prisoner then said, "That will help to transport me"—I found a pair of scissors on the mantel-piece—I afterwards found a flour-tub in the room—on looking into it, both the prisoners stated, nearly with one breath, that it contained flour; but on ex<lb/>amining it, I found it was plaster of Paris, in powder—I then went into the lower room, and found, in the table-drawer there, a sheet of glass-papper—I asked the male prisoner if he knew any thing about Hill—he said he did not—he said a man must do something for a living, and he might as well be transported—I told him not to say any thing more to criminate himself.</p>

                  </hi>. I have examined the stuff produced by the officer—it appears to me to be parts of a plaster-of-Paris mould, for the purpose of casting half-crowns—on three of the pieces there remains a small portion of the impression of the obverse side of a half-crown—I can trace some of the letters—here is "E, J, G, R, A," on one of the pieces, and "R, G," on another—I am satisfied it has been a mould for half-crowns—I have ex<lb/>amined the five half-crowns, they are all counterfeit, and have all been cat in one mould—they are Britannia metal, a similar kind of metal to the tea<lb/>spoons produced—the half-crowns are of the date 1818, and I believe this portion of the mould has been made from the same coin—this powder is plaster-of-Paris—the tobacco-pipe contains white metal of a similar descrip<lb/>tion—this tin band is used to put the mould into shape—the roughness is taken off the coin with a file, and the glass paper is used after the file—the scissors would cut off the get which fills up the channel of the mould.</p>

On Wednesday evening, the 7th of February, I shut and locked the shop-door, and the cellar-flap was fastened by a chain—I left the shop—I came into the shop several times after; and, about a quarter to nine o'clock, when I came in again, I found the street door open—the lock was undone, and somebody had unfastened the door, which had a spring<lb/>lock—I suppose they had got in from the cellar-flap, as it was found open afterwards—I found the door open, and the pigeons were gone—my son keeps a bird-shop—those birds which were taken were opposite the door—they must have opened the street-door, and given them out to some<lb/>body.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 18, Foley-place, and am a mechanic. I lost a great coat on Monday evening, the 29th of January, from the passage of the house—the prisoner Raiker is errand-boy to my wife, who is a milliner—he had been with me between three and four months—he did not leave me till the following Monday—I had not dis<lb/>charged him, as I did not suspect him—after that he came to my house with his father—the other prisoner was not with them at first—they went and fetched him, and Winsby said he had received the coat at the door of my house from Raiker—Raiker was there, and his father, and the officer, and they brought with them the man who bought the coat of him—his name is Carpenter.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 54.) On the 12th of February I was on duty in Hackney-wick. I do not know how far that is from the prosecutor's—at a quarter past seven o'clock in the morning I met the two prisoners in company together—my suspicion was attracted by the bulky appearance of one—they had both smock-frocks on—I spoke to Smith, and bid him good morning, and after a little time I ordered them to stop and give up the property they had in their possession—they stopped—I searched them, and found eight dead fowls and two dead ducks—on Smith I found five dead fowls and one dead duck, stowed about his body, hanging to his braces, and his smock-frock was made like a bag—on Baltock I found three fowls and one dead duck—they were suspended from his braces, under his smock-frock—I asked where they got them, but they would not tell me—I took them to the station-house—the fowls and ducks had been recently killed, and were partly picked—the heads and necks were not picked.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 6th of February I made a search, as I stated in the last case—I found nothing on the prisoner William Taylor—I went to a house which I was informed was his lodging, but I do not know it myself—I am not aware whether any witness can prove it—I found a sheet in a chest of drawers, among other things, in a parlour, at the back of the prisoner Morgan's shop, which is an old clothes shop—I found Georgiana Stevens in bed in a room, and found a box there—I asked the prisoner Georgiana Stevens whose box it was—she in<lb/>stantly answered, "My box"—Frances Taylor was in another bed, in the same room—she said nothing there, but at the police-office she said, that part of the property I found in Georgiana Stevens's bed was in her bed, which was not the case—I found nothing in the bed where she was—in the box I found some pieces of ribbons and silk—it seemed the fag-ends of a roll of silk, and on the bed where Georgiana Stevens lay I found an old patch<lb/>work quilt—I found nothing else referring to this robbery—this was on the 7th of February—on the night of the 6th, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I went to Oliver's lodging—he was just going to bed—I did not mention this robbery to him, as I was not aware of it at the time.</p>

I am a horse-hair manufacturer, and live at No. 10, Waterloo-street—I use the house as a workshop and a kitchen—it is one house—the upper part is the workshop, and the lower part the kitchen. On Sunday, the 14th of January, I went out between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day—I left nobody in the house—the door was locked, but it was a very bad lock, and out of repair—we left the window down, but to that it could be opened—we came home between nine and ten o'clock in the evening—my mother-in-law had gone into the house before me—I found the window fastened, and the shutter also—I missed four candle<lb/>sticks, two blankets, two sheets, and a trunk, with different articles in it; 2nd I missed about llb. of horse-hair, and some ribbons, which belong to my wife—I had seen them about a week before we moved—I had seen the box they were in, but had not seen the ribbons in it on those premises—I had seen the candlesticks when I went out in the morning—I believe the trunk produced to be my wife's—I am certain it is the trunk which I saw in the place when I went out—I cannot swear to it, but I am quite certain it is the trunk—I only know it by its being papered, and by my father-in-law's putting this lock on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the witness's son. On the morning of the 6th I examined the window shutters, and saw a mark near the bottom, as if it had been forced by a chisel—the umbrellas which were taken belong to me—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some</hi>)—these seven are all my property—I had seen them on the afternoon of the 5th.</p>

On the 7th of February I went to the prisoner's premises, about eleven o'clock, and searched them—I found these seven umbrellas there, and no more—three of them were in the par<lb/>lour at the back of the shop; and four, including one with a white handle, up stairs, behind the bed in the front room—they were put into a corner, be<lb/>tween the washing-stand and the bed—it was a Waterloo bedstead, which was down—the other three, which were down stairs in the parlour, were between a chest of drawers and a cupboard, in a very narrow space, entirely out of sight till I looked into the nook—they were loose—I asked the prisoner where he got them from—he hesitated a long while, and then said he got them from a man in Petticoat-lane, in the way of trade—his wife said, in his presence, that they occupied but one more room up stairs, and that was an empty one—in about ten minutes the prisoner said there was a room up stairs, partly occupied by himself, and partly by his brother, named Young—he did not say when he got the umbrellas.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 3, Charles-street, Gibson-square, in the parish of St. Mary, Islington. The prisoner, Jane Roberts, came into my service on the 29th of October—she was my only servant—on the 7th of February she came into the drawing-room to me, between eight and nine o'clock, and said my daughter wanted the keys—my daughter was ill in bed—one of the keys opens a cupboard at the bottom of the kitchen stairs, which is a store closet, and a variety of things were kept there—there was plate in it, some tea-spoons, dessert-spoons, two forks, a skewer, and a marrow-spoon, all silver—it was where I kept the plate not in use—I think I had seen it all about a fortnight before—I saw that cupboard that afternoon, and I know it was locked—I had passed it many times in the course of the day—I went to bed that night after eleven o'clock—I looked at the street door, and saw that it was locked and fastened—I called to the prisoner to know if the back doors were fastened—she said, "Yes," and my daughter, who was sleeping in the back parlour, said she had heard her fasten them—the prisoner slept in the front kitchen—about half-past twelve o'clock she came into my bedroom, opened the door very quietly, and said, "Ma'am, don't be frightened; there are thieves in the house"—I did not hear any thing—she said, "Don't you hear them, ma'am? they are going"—I listened, but did not hear the footsteps of any one—I was sleeping in the back parlour on the ground floor—it is an eight-roomed house—I got up immediately, and ran to the top of the house, where I had two gentlemen, lodgers, and called them—she said the thieves had been in the house for some time before, that they had tried her door, and she had heard them a long time—that she went to sleep after their trying her door, and was awoke by their knocking at her door—she thought something had fallen against her door—when I got a gentleman to come down stairs, she went down with him, and at the bottom of the stairs was some linen in a wardrobe, tied up with some soap and candles, and the cupboard door was wide open, with the keys in it, and three boxes pulled out—I said, "Why, they are curious thieves, they have taken nothing"—she said, "Yes, ma'am, they have taken the plate"—I examined the front door, and it was quite fast, and the back doors were both open—the back door leads into the garden—I saw the plate-box standing there empty—it had contained plate not in use, and I did not know she ever knew plate was in that box—she then told me that the plated articles were gone out of the wardrobe, and I found they were gone—I told her I wondered she came out of the kitchen, knowing there were thieves in the back kitchen—I asked her if they were in the back kitchen, and if they had a light—she said she could not tell, that she ran up stairs, expecting to find</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183802260124"/>
               <p>us all murdered—the policeman observed some footsteps in the yard, and I observed wet footmarks on the kitchen stairs—the prisoner was without her shoes and stockings, and the policeman observed that whoever had been walking there, was without shoes or stockings—there appeared footmarks in the garden, going out of the house, down towards the wall, but none coming towards the house—they appeared footmarks of only one person—I said I wondered the dog at the next house did not bark—she said, "Probably it was asleep"—there is a gravel-walk in the garden—the policeman said there appeared the footsteps down, but not up, but I did not examine that myself—I kept a little dog a short time before, which was let out of the house about a week before, and, to the best of my knowledge, I saw that same dog in White Conduit-fields afterwards, with its throat cut—there were marks of wet footsteps and naked feet on the stairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner ask to go out in the course of that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the course of the night she proposed, as we were up all night, that we should have some tea, and about four o'clock wanted to go out to get milk—I said I could not be so unreasonable as to send her out at that time, but she wished to go, and I allowed her—she was absent an hour—she went out at the front door—the policeman came almost immediately after the alarm, and looked into the garden, and ont he following morning he informed me he had had her in custody before, and then she said she had been to her mother's when she went out in the night—her mother lived close by, about five minutes' walk from our house—she did not say why she had been to her mother's—it was the policeman spoke to her about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know of a petticoat being found at the pawnbroker's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—and she acknowledged to me that she had pawned it, the day after the robbery, and it was found that day or the next—she told me she had taken it to pledge, for her mother was ill—it was my daughter's petticoat—my daughter had missed it in the course of the day, and named it—it is her property, not mine—she is twenty-two years old—I did not miss the carpet till it was brought to my house—my daughter went with the po<lb/>liceman to the prisoner's mother's the day after, and it was brought to me—it was my carpet—I asked the prisoner how she came to cut the carpet—she said she thought it was too large for the room, and her mother wanted a piece to put her feet on—it might be a little too large for the room—I did not miss the. blanket till it was found at her mother's, the next day—she said she took it to her mother's—she gave no reason for taking it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the morning of the 8th of February, between eight and nine o'clock, I was sent for to Mrs. Webb's—(the policemen who were there in the night are not here)—the prisoner Jane opened the door, and let me in—I asked if Mrs. Webb was at home—she said, "Yes"—she asked me into the parlour, and begged me not to say any thing of what had happened before—that was all she said at that time—she did not mention what she meant—Mrs. Webb came into the parlour, and told me about the robbery—I went out and examined the doors—there had been no force used to them, nor was there any marks of violence whatever about any of the doors—I examined the garden, and saw several foot-marks there, but the policemen having been there over<lb/>night, I cannot say any thing about them—I afterwards went to the pri<lb/>soner's mother's house, in John-street, and found a blanket, piece of carpet, and nineteen duplicates—I found several things in the room which I was not certain of, and went and got somebody from the prosecutrix's house to come and look at them—when I came back again I could not see</p>

               <p>them—I asked where they were—the mother denied their being there, but afterwards said she had burnt them—I had seen a handkerchief and several trifling things there—I did not find any traces of articles being burnt, but the fire was much fiercer than when I went away—I took the mother into custody, and afterwards the daughter—the mother said she had purchased the blanket for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the carpet for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., at a marine-store shop—she afterwards owned that her daughter had given them to her—the daughter denied all knowledge of the plate—she said she had given the blanket to her mother, because she had nothing to cover her, and the carpet she had cut off and given to her mother—the mother at first said she had bought them, and afterwards that her daughter Jane had given them to her—she at first denied her daughter having been there that morning, and said she had not seen her for two or three days before, but she afterwards said she had been out for some milk, and called round there to tell her the house had been robbed, and stopped there an hour, or it might be an hour and a half—I produce the blanket and carpet.</p>

On the night of the 19th of February I was opposite the shop of Richard Cook, at the corner of Pindar-place, about four yards from the door—I saw both the prisoners go into the shop together—Whiting shifted a piece of ham along the window-board till he got it close to the door—he then came out of the shop with it—Wood stood before him, and could see what he was doing—when Whiting came out of the shop I caught hold of him, and he dropped the ham at my feet—I took him inside the shop, and asked Mr. Cook if he had lost any thing—he said a piece of ham—I said, "Here it is, and here is the <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> that took it"—Wood was just coming out</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Coach and Horses public-house, in Welbeck-street. On the afternoon of the 18th of February the prisoner came to my bar and asked for half a pint of porter on credit—I would not serve him, and just previous to that I had put two bottles of wine on a shelf by the bar—I turned to the bar-parlour, by the fire, and returned in about five minutes, and missed a bottle of wine, the pri<lb/>soner was gone from the house-about twenty minutes after, I saw him at the corner of the mews, where my house is, and accused him of it—he de<lb/>nied it, and abused me very much—I went to a stable just by, where I knew he was in the habit of going, and in the second stall of the stable I found part of my bottle of wine—I got a witness, and went into the har<lb/>ness-room to see if anybody came to take it, and in about twenty minutes the prisoner came to the stall and took the wine—I seized him, and said, "Then I have got you at last?"—he said, "Yes"—it was red wine in the bottle, the same as I had lost—the flavour was the same as mine, and the mark on the bottle was the same as the other-nobody but him could have taken it, as it was gone momentarily.</p>

                  </hi>. I am bar-maid to Mr. Richard Higgins—he keeps a tavern at No. 264, Oxford-street, near North Audley-street. The prisoner came to our house on Tuesday evening the 6th of February, about half-past eight o'clock—I am sure it was that evening—he called for a glass of gin and water—I took it to him, and took a Ger<lb/>man silver spoon with it—in about five minutes he came out of the room and bid me good night—I went in to take the glass away, and a metal spoon was put in the place of my master's German silver one—the pri<lb/>soner came again about a quarter to nine o'clock on the 8th of February—I was told he was the same man that had been on the Tuesday—he asked for some soup—he did not call for any particular sort—I told him we had none—he called for a mutton chop and mashed potatoes—I served him—he rang the bell, and asked for another chop, and paid for what he had before he had the second chop—I left with him the tray and a silver table-spoon, which was my master's property—it is worth about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I left that with the first chop—he paid me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and said he was in a hurry—I then saw the spoon was changed, and a metal spoon put on the table in place of my master's—I went and told my master—my master's son came into the room and accused him of it—he rose up, and the silver spoon fell from his wrist—I am sure of that—the metal spoon was on the table—there was no metal spoon there before—I saw the silver spoon fall by his feet—I saw my mistress pick it up—this is it, and this is the metal spoon—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—I sent for an officer—he came, and took him in the coffee-room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Mr. Edward Fellowes, and have been so fourteen years. It is my duty to attend at his place of busi<lb/>ness in Broad-street every day—I go at nine o'clock in the morning, and we close about six o'clock in the evening—the warehouse is in that story of the house where the kitchen usually is—the counting-house is on the ground floor, and the warehouse is underneath that—it was formerly a kitchen—you go down stairs to it—there is a door leading to it which opens immediately behind the street or passage door of the house—it is a strong door, secured by a strong lock—on going through that door, and going down stairs, you come to another door, secured by two strong locks,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183802260144"/>
               <p>and lined with iron—it is the duty of the porter, at night, to fasten up that warehouse, and he gives the keys to me—I usually go down myself, and put the gas out, and see the warehouse secure—he fastens the door.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you able to say whether on the 15th, the day of the robbery, you were in the warehouse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I saw every thing perfectly safe about half-past five o'clock—we had some Italian tram silk, some called "or<lb/>ganzine," and some called "cad man"—I received the keys from the porter in the ordinary manner, at the close of the day, and put two of them into my desk, in the counting-house, and that of the top lock, belonging to the bottom door, I put into my pocket—the porter does not live in the house, nor do I—I went home, and, about eight o'clock the same evening I heard of the robbery, and went to the warehouse—when I arrived I first saw the housekeeper, who is a man—he is not one of Mr. Fellowes's servants—the house is not entirely occupied by Mr. Fellowes—the upper part is let off—the street door is the common entrance to Mr. Fellowes and the other parties—the street door is closed when we leave the premises—on seeing the housekeeper I went down to the warehouse—I found the top door open—I proceeded down to the bottom door—I found the top door had been opened by a skeleton key, and in the top lock of the bottom door I found a skeleton key—no violence had been used to the bottom door—in my judgment, both doors had been opened by skeleton keys—I examined the warehouse, and missed about 540lbs. weight of silk, worth from 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was a quantity of each of the three sorts taken, about 3 cwt. of Italian tram, 140lbs. of organzine, and better than 1 cwt. of cadman—I am accustomed to silk—it was bound up in the usual manner, when in our warehouse, as it comes from the throwsters in England—we made the warehouse secure, and left for the night.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was your porter there when you went at eight o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He lived at some distance, and after being there a short time I sent for him—I employed myself, during the rest of the night, in ascertaining the extent of the loss, and in giving information of the robbery.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silk-manufacturer, and live at No. 6, Fort-street, Spitalfields. I have known the prisoner for six or seven years—I have known him as a kind of agent, to sell silk about at different parts, and for different people—he did not keep a warehouse, that I know of—I do not think he did—I do not know where he lived—I only knew him by going about the trade—on the 27th of January he came to me about twelve o'clock in the day—mine is a public warehouse—he showed me two samples of silk, and asked me 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the tram, and 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the organzine—I asked him what weight there was—he said he could not get the tram then, but could get the organzine in the afternoon—he asked me to buy the organ<lb/>zine, and he thought there would be about 32lbs.—I said, "Bailey, is this all right?"—he said, "O yes, I shall not bring any thing but what is right"—he said it belonged to a man who was going to Macclesfield that evening, and wanted the money to go with—he said then that he could</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183802260145"/>
               <p>have the tram on Monday, (this was on Saturday,) and I could have it if I thought proper.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When he presented the samples, did he say what quantity there was of each? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said there were thirty-two lbs. of the organzine and about fifty-two of the tram, but he could not have the tram before Monday—he said he could bring the organzine in the afternoon—I said I should not be in before half-past three o'clock, and he said he would be there at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you heard at that time of Mr. Fellowes's robbery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I had a bill lying on ray desk about it—I said to him, "Bailey, this aynt Fellowes's silk, is it?"—he said, "No, by no means"—he was going out when he mentioned about the 32lbs., and he said, would it matter if there was double the quantity—I said no, I could find the money if it was all right—he then said, "I can cat the cord, and let it into your drawer"—I did not exactly know what that meant, but it gave me some suspicion, particularly as I thought the silk corresponded with that described in the bill on my desk—I had only seen the samples—nothing more passed between us, to my recollection—he said he would meet me at half-past three o'clock, with the silk—I left, and returned at half-past three o'clock, and learnt that he had been there, and left a bag of silk—I did not see the bag before he came in—my daughter, Eliza Farrington, and her husband, keep the house—the prisoner came to his time, at half-past three o'clock—in the meantime I had been to my neighbour Fowler, and showed him the samples, and then went to Mr. Fellowes, and made an arrangement about the officers coming to my house—when the prisoner came in at half-past three o'clock, I said, "Well Mr. Bailey"—he said, "I left the bag in the kitchen"—I said, "Well, fetch it out?"—he did so, and brought it, and put it on the counter, and then two officers came in, took it off the counter, and took the prisoner and the bag—I did not know where the prisoner lived—I heard him give an account of where he lived, but do not recollect the address he gave—I afterwards saw a small quantity of silk produced in a kind of pickle jar—it was Italian organzine—it is like the sample I have, and I think it is the same silk.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you know they were his? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From Fowler or Gilbert, I think, not from himself—I believe Gilbert and Fowler went there with me—it is a very small house, one story high, and has only four rooms—I saw a woman there—we said we wanted to see Mr. Bailey, and asked her if she had any silk in the house—we told her we had come to search the place—she give us leave at once—Herdsfield and I searched together, and found some silk—while we were making the search, a knock came at the door—it was opened, and a man came in.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What passed between you and Ridgway, in October, about purchasing any thing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said he had met with a friend who had advanced him a considerable sum of money, and he should have silk to sell at times, such as he could not use—that he was commencing manufacturing, and should have silk which he could not use—I told him I should have no objection to take any thing that would do for me—I afterwards saw him in Maccles<lb/>field.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In January this year, did you receive any thing from him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—on the 18th of January, a bundle of China and Italian silk came to me by the <hi rend="italic">Defiance</hi> coach—I received a letter on the 25th—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—I believe it is the prisoner's handwriting—I have seen him write a little—after six o'clock that evening the package was de<lb/>livered by the porter from the coach-office—when I opened it, I found it contained Italian tram—I did not weigh it—I suppose it to be the weight stated in the letter, 48lbs.—I consider it about that quantity—I only ex<lb/>amined it superficially—I then packed it up, and re-directed it, and sent it back about an hour and a-half or so after I got it—I sent it back by the <hi rend="italic">Defiance</hi> coach, which it came by—I believe this is the direction, and the card I put on it when I returned it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I sent a note inside the parcel, addressed to Mr. Ridgway—that letter did not explain why I sent it back—on the 30th another parcel came to me, corresponding nearly in size with the other—it was packed in canvas, like the other, and ad<lb/>dressed to me—I do not know the handwriting of the direction—I just merely opened the head of it—it was silk—I thought it was the same as I had returned come back again, and I sent it to Pickford's van-office the same hour—I carried it to the office, which is very near my house; and supposing it came from Ridgway, I just merely wrote on it, "Mr. Ridg<lb/>way, till called for"—this is the paper I wrote—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I sent it for the purpose of being at Pickford's when inquiry was made for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After this, did you hear something about this from Stockwin's appli<lb/>cation to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the bundles were brought to town, and I was brought with them, by Stockwin—I was examined at the Mansion House as a witness—I arrived in London on, the Saturday evening, and was detained till Monday, at noon—I was released on Monday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> After being admitted as a witness, you were allowed to leave town? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was first a prisoner on this charge—it was on the 30th I received the package which I thought was the same I had sent back—the first was on the 25th—I sent that back the same day—Maccles-field is 167 miles from town—I believe the card to be the direction I sent, but I am not sure of it—I am a dealer in silk and silk-waste, and also a tailor—I did not forget that when I said I was a dealer in silk and silk-waste—I had no motive for not naming it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Pray, Mr. Hooley, have you given us all your trades? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—all that I am now, not all that I have been—I was a little in the cotton-waste, and I had a little manufacturing of silk, and I had a dyeing concern—nothing else—I was never a silk-weaver nor a trowster—I have been a</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is anybody here to whom you gave the parcel directed to Mr. Ridge<lb/>way till called for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I have been to Macclesfield since I was examined—I expected I should have had a letter or something from Ridgway, and that was my reason for sending the parcel to Pickford's, to be kept till called for.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence (written.</hi>) I was born in Denmark, of Jewish parents, who apprenticed me to the business of a watchmaker. I invented a vessel to move upon the waters without the aid of steam, masts, or sails. The model which I constructed was greatly admired, and I was advised to visit some of the cities on the Continent, in order to dispose of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183802260155"/>
               <p>the invention. Lord Oxsted and Marshal Haugh gave me this advice. I visited Gottingen, when Professor and Hoffraad Gaus, and Dr. Stern, strongly recommended me to come to England. At Hanover Professor Hausmann, and Lord and Minister Wish, gave me the same advice, as did also Secretary Simson. I also visited Cassel, where Professor Henshell, Professor Rothschild, and Sir F. Breithaupt reiterated the same. I accord<lb/>ingly came over to this country, between two and three years ago, and found myself an entire stranger. I had not been more than a fortnight in London before I had all my papers stolen from my pocket; but, providen<lb/>tially, I saved my money upon that occasion. After being some time here, without any prospect of succeeding in disposing of my plan, I determined to return to my own country, and set off, with intention of taking shipping at Liverpool; but, passing through Oxford, I obtained employment from a David Cohen, a Jew, as a watchmaker. I ultimately set up in business for myself; and, during the time I remained there, was converted to the Christian faith, and was baptised there in the month of May last, by the Rev. Mr. Champneys, the present rector of St. Mary's, Whitechapel. I found I could not get on in my business, and was at length arrested, and confined in Oxford Castle for debt, at which place I took the benefit of the Insolvent Debtor's Act in November last. I returned to London, and obtained assistance from the "Society for promoting Christianity among the Jews." My invention was still uppermost in my mind, and I at length met with a party with whom I entered into treaty for the disposal of the same, which treaty was to have been ratified, upon highly advantageous terms, the very day after I was taken into custody upon the present charge. I throw myself into your hands. My character, up to the present time, has been without a blemish. Even Mrs. Lawes, the prosecutrix, must do me the justice to acknowledge that it was without complaint. I freely admit having pledged the property, but do most solemnly avow that it was not done with any dishonest motive, but simply to enable me to carry on the negotiation to which I have alluded; and with the full determina<lb/>tion to redeem them immediately upon the same being brought to a conclusion. With respect to the manner in which I became possessed of the watch belonging to Mrs. Lawes, I borrowed it from her to show to a customer, and on the same evening I supped with Miss Rogerson and a Dr. Gerstmann in her apartments. Previous to supper she excused her<lb/>self, on the ground of indisposition, and went to bed, leaving the watch still in my possession, as either of the two latter individuals could testify, so that it is wrong to say I took it from the table.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a journeyman cooper. On the 14th of feb<lb/>ruary I was living in Petticoat-lane—the prisoner lodged in the same room with me—on the 14th of February I received, from Ipswich, a£5 note, of the Ipswich bank—I should know it from its general appearance—when I received it, the prisoner and two young men went with me to the Blue Boar-tap—I believe this is the note, (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>,) from its ge<lb/>neral appearance—I said it was an old looking note, and had a broken back—I have no doubt this is the note I received—the prisoner went with me to the tap on Wednesday evening—on Wednesday night the prisoner went to bed first, and not having had a good opportunity of reading the letter, I took the note out and read the letter—I put the note into the letter again, and put them into my box, which stood between the beds—the prisoner had an opportunity of seeing that—no one else was in the room, and no one else sleeps there—there is no lock to the box—I went to work the next morning between seven and eight o'clock—on the Saturday night I found the letter and bank-note were both gone—the prisoner continued to sleep there from Wednesday to Saturday—about half-past one o'clock on Sunday morning I heard a violent ringing at the door—I looked out, and saw the prisoner and two disorderly females—the prisoner was in liquor, and I gave him in charge.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long had he been in the service of your husband? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About eleven months—my husband went to gaol on the 31st of October—I do not know whether the attorney has the papers from the Insolvent Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know William Dockerell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not certain of the name—I have heard the name of John Frederick Fulford—I do not know a person named Grant—my mother's name is Loader—I have a certificate of her being unable to attend here—these three charges were named before the Magistrate, but they were not gone into—they were certainly mentioned—(<hi rend="italic">Dockerell called in</hi>)—I do not know that man—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a man named Grant</hi>)—I have seen him about twice.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now I ask you, whether Grant was employed to take your husband's name off the cart, and paint on Mrs. Loader's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know any thing about that—I was not in great distress when my husband went to prison—not particularly—I did get on—ray husband returned to the In<lb/>solvent Court all the property he had—the broker came to the house about a fortnight after my husband went to prison, which was in November—the prisoner's wages were 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—my husband was in prison till the 6th of January—the prisoner's wages were paid in the meantime—I paid them—I have no voucher for it—it is not the custom with us to have receipts for wages.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, was the prisoner ever paid by you at any time 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for wages? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On my oath he had, every Saturday night, what he had not drawn in the week—sometimes he would have 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. sometimes 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., according to what he wanted—I never took any voucher—I did not enter it in any book—it is not the custom to do it—it is never done—we do not keep any book to put down those sort of things—I keep no books but what we call a ledger and day books—we have no book for entries of payment of flour, no further than the miller's own books—I have nothing to do with that—when we have flour in, it is put down on one side of the book, and when they receive the money, they put the money down on the other side—we keep no book at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had the prisoner, at any time, to raise money for you and your family, while your husband was in prison? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—he was always too destitute himself, to be able to do it—he did not find corn for the horse</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183802260186"/>
               <p>without my giving him money first to do it—he never pawned his coat to get corn for it—he never paid me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a lump—I swear that positively—he never produced an account to me, to the amount of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., paid for me—nor of 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, paid for my husband—he never produced an account to me of the sale of the truck, nor of the horse and cart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you, at the end of November, in distress to carry on the busi<lb/>ness for want of money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not more than common—I was in daily difficulty just then, but the creditors were such they would not allow me to be in particular distress—it was a dispute between my husband and his half brother, on which he was arrested—his brother sent him to gaol—I do not recollect any particular distress at the latter end of November.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you, at any time, in the presence of Grant, tell the prisoner that you could not go on unless he could assist you with money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—the prisoner never went to his friends at Romford, to borrow 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for me nor my husband—I never heard it—we might have been several times without bread or flour in the house, but I was obliged to find money to get it—I never had any assistance from the prisoner's friends—I always paid the prisoner 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he was always in my debt—my husband was sup<lb/>ported in prison the same as other people—very frequently I have not been able to supply him myself with money—he has been short of money, but he has had friends to do it, but I always paid the prisoner his wages.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he make out a bill of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and produce it to you, or did you ever have in your possession a bill, made out by the prisoner to that amount? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had a bill, hut it was not owing to him—the prisoner gave me the bill—I think it was on the night he left me, but I am not quite certain—I do not know where that account is—I did not take any notice of it, because it was not due to him, nor any of it—it was owing to the man who lent me a sack of flour, but the bread was so bad I would not pay the bill—it was a bill for flour and bread, which I had borrowed—it is the custom of bakers, when they borrow bread one of another, to return it back in bread—the account was made out in the prisoner's name, but I did not consider I owed it to him, and told him so—he said it was in his name, and he should expect to have the money for it—he did not tell me he had pledged his credit with the man for the flour—his credit would not fetch a sack of flour—he could not demand the money for it—he gave me the bill, but. It was a mere form—I will not say on my oath, whether he asked me for the money or not—when it occurred I had no idea of this, and it passed on as a trivial thing—I think, the last time I saw him he demanded money on account of that bill—he certainly did not request me to pay him the amount of the bill—when he brought it he might mention the payment, but never after—he never sent Grant to me to request the payment of it—I never sold the truck to the prisoner for 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, after your husband went to prison, did you and the prisoner and Fulford carry on the business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I carried on the business, and they served me as journeymen—there were two horses, a cart, and a truck, at times employed in the business—there was money to carry on the business when my husband went to prison—I found money the whole time—there was no money left in the house—if the horses were without food, it was because the prisoner had spent the money which he had for that purpose—he was always supplied with what he asked for for them—he never took away the horse and cart by my desire, nor with my knowledge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not more than once explain to the prisoner, that you could not carry on the business without means, and ask him to get what money he could on the horse and cart? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—I did not ask him, after the name had been altered on the cart, to take them away, that they might not be found on the premises when the broker came—I never knew that they were gone, till he went away, on the 26th of December—I went round to the stable the night after he left, and then, for the first time, found the horse and cart gone—I cannot tell how long before I had seen them safe—I should say it was nearly a month before—I thought the horse and cart was being used in the business, but the cart was out of repair—he had put me to the expense of 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to mend the wheel, and then he said it wanted more repair, which he said would cost 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the bill was 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—so the next time when he said it was out of repair I said, "You must do what you can without it, you must use the barrow, I am not going to spend so much money on the cart, there is a barrow, and there is a boy"—I did not tell him to do what he could with it—I did, not tell him to remove the horse and cart before the broker came—there were two horses and a cart—they were not all assigned to my mother—one is the property of my sister—she bought it—it never was mine and my husband's—she bought it last April, and we used it from that time—my sister lived in the Strand—the horse was at our stable, and we had it from April till my husband went to prison, and till the 26th of December, when I missed the whole—the prisoner never pawned his coat to keep the horse alive—he did not pawn it for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., about the 13th of November, to get food for the horse—I did not borrow 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of him on the horse and cart—nor fivepence—I never did so.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever send anybody to collect accounts besides the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not from these customers—the boy has distinct customers from the man—I never sent any strange person besides the prisoner and the boy to receive accounts.</p>

                  </hi>. I was employed in the baker's business before Mr. Toome went to prison, and was there with the prisoner after—there was no money left in the house to carry on the business, to any knowledge, after Mr. Toome went to prison—there were only two or three sacks of flour—Mrs. Toome, the prisoner, and myself carried on the busi<lb/>ness as well as we could after he went to prison—a horse and cart was employed in the business, and there was one horse at grass, at Mr. Strange's at Harrow—I recollect the horses being without food, and the prisoner got the money to furnish them with food—sometimes he asked Mrs. Toome for it—one Wednesday in particular he asked Mrs. Toome for money—she said she could not give him any, she had spent the last for a sack of flour—the prisoner said he would get some—he came down stairs and got a blue coat, and went to Long-acre, and pawned it for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went with him—laid 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of it out for corn—he told Mrs. Toome so—and he had the other 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for himself—I heard him tell her so, and she said, "Very well"—I heard him tell her he had pawned his own coat to get food for the horses—I was standing in the shop at the time.</p>

Pray, if you can, send up by Sunday a goose, or a brace of birds, as a present for Mr. Carter; you have got hit direction; never mind the expense, I will pay you tenfold shortly; pray do not disappoint him, for he has been so kind, and I cannot pay him at present.

I was employed by Mr. Wisbey—on Saturday morning, the 3rd of February, I remember being sent with a box to Mr. Morrison, in Fore-street—a tall man met me, and asked me if I was not Mr. Wisbey's boy—he said he wanted to take the box to Brook-street, and I would not let him have it—all the way along he said he wanted to take it to Brook-street—he told me to run all the way back and tell my mis<lb/>tress to get some ribbons—I went with the man as far as Smithfield, and then he gave me three parts of a quartern of gin—he then went into Hol<lb/>born, and had a pint of porter—I had part of that—I sat down in a house—we stopped there a good bit—he wanted me to run out and fetch a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, but I would not stir—he then went out himself—he was gone a good bit,</p>

I was at the Bull public-house, at Barking, on Sunday, with Joseph and William Sinfield—we had some beer together, and came home to our house again—they live next door to me—we were talking about the pig—a bullock had gored it, and let its entrails out, and master sent me for a butcher to come and dress the pig—I told them it was in Washburn-street, and Joseph said in the course of conversation that he would have the pig—when we came to Chalk Starve, I and William went home, and he went towards my master's house—he asked his mother for his red cap, and gave William his hat—William heard what he said about having the pig—I went next day to work at Mr. Biggs's—he made inquiry about the pig—I said I knew nothing of it—I afterwards went to my father, and by his advice told Charles, the servant, of it—I afterwards told my master what had passed when he questioned me—the pig was gone then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Barking. On Monday evening; the 25th of December, I was sent for, to take William Sinfield into custody—I went to the house, went up stairs, and saw the remains of the brains of a pig, and fragments of meat, and salt, strewed about the floor—I got a light, and found a chopper—I saw the pig's head, which appeared to have been hacked with some blunt instrument—I brought the chopper away—I did not see Joseph in the house—I could not find him—I apprehended him on the 2nd of February—I could not find him till then—I have the head here and the chopper—it appears to have been hacked with that instrument.</p>

I was on duty on the 6th of Feb<lb/>ruary, about six o'clock in the evening, at a turning at the back of Ken<lb/>nington-common—I saw the prisoner coming along, with a pair of springs on his shoulder—I followed him to the common, and asked him where he brought them from—he said, from his master, Mr. Kesterton, of Camberwell—I said, "What has been done to them?"—he said, they had had a new plate on—I looked at them, but did not see any—I asked him where he was going to take them to—he said "To Vauxhall"—I asked him "Who to?"—he said, "To a steel manufacturer"—I said I thought it was not very probable—he then told me he was going to take them to Westminster—I then took him back to His master, and found they had been stolen.</p>
