I shall not; it is mine"—I had a struggle with her—I took her off the platform into the station, where I handed her over to a City policeman—at the Police-station, in the dock, she denied all know<lb/>ledge of the purse, but while she was standing in the dock she dropped this other piece of the same purse that she took from her pocket—a silver medal was found in her pocket—she said the watch was given her to mind by the prosecutrix—a purse containing £1 15s. 11 1/4d. was found on her, and loose in her pocket was found 6s. 6 1/4d.</p>

I was in plain clothes on March 5th in front of Lane and Smith—I saw Lacey leave the back parlour behind Croney—he had a bottle under each arm, one green and one blue, and something else—he rushed into the back garden and came back into the house through the passage—we stopped him, and he said, "What is the matter?"—I ok him into the back room where Croney was—I went into the back garden with Lane, and the 1andlady came behind with, a light—I saw Lane search the garden and find behind a fence two bottles and a parcel containing 44 half-crowns—I took Lacey to the station, and then went to 102, Liverpool Road and found all these things, and took them to Dr. Rose—there were 60 coins—this with the blue handle is the saucepan found a Grosvenor Street, and the black one was at Liverpool Road.</p>

Burns"—he said, "I cannot stop, I cannot stop," in a very hurried way, and ran away—I ran after him and caught him, and the police were soon by my side—he said, "What harm have I done you?"—the police took him away.</p>

               <p>he had gone 150 yards Egan stepped him—I caught up the cab, and requested the driver to leave his seat—I then discovered that he was drunk—I informed him of what he had done—he made no reply—I took him to the station, where be was detained, and then went to the hospital—the prisoner was charged with inflicting grievous bodily harm—he said, "It is no fault of mine"—I did not hear the prisoner warn the man, who was crossing the road—the man died on March 3rd—he was not unconscious, but he said nothing in the prisoner's presence.</p>

On the evening of February 25th I was walking up Farringdon Road with another officer—when we were just by Chapel Street I saw the prisoner driving the cab, just turning the corner—I saw the deceased pass just in front of the cab, and it knocked him down about the centre of the road—the horse was going at a full trot—the prisoner whipped him, and he broke into a gallop—I heard a shout after the accident, but not before—I stepped into the road to try and stop the horse, but could not—Austin followed while I attended to the wounded man, and took him to the hospital on an open ambulance; with two other men, and Dr Weaver saw him—the cab struck him somewhere about his shoulder, and the whole cab went over him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the Divisional Surgeon—on February 19th I was called to Bow Street Station and saw the prisoner—he complained of pain in his head—I thought he was not quite right, but he spoke quite rationally in answer to my questions—I suspected epilepsy; he was very pale, and the pupils of his eyes were dilated—that was the only occasion on which I saw him; about seven hours after ho was taken to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I got nothing to confirm my suspicions of epilepsy, but it struck me at the time—I did not speak to him about what he had done; only about his ailment—the inspector asked me if he was ill, and I said he was quite fit to go before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I was not examining him as to the state of his mind—the inspector sent for me to know whether it was desirable for him to remain in the police cells or go to the infirmary.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner has been employed under me since 1897—his behaviour was very good—he was a simple lad, he did not make friends—when he who doing nothing, he pulled a book out of his pocket—about a year ago he had a quarrel with another boy; about that time he lost his father and mother; he was only receiving 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week; bur I knew than he was without a father, and raised his wages, and the man he worked with quarrelled with him and struck him on the head with a hammer—I did not know anything about it till I saw one of the boys washing his head, and I had him taken to King's College Hospital—he continued working, but I let him off easily, and when he came back from the hospital I let him go home—a few weeks before this crime happened I heard that he had been hounded into the office after he received his money, as if somebody had been running after him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have had him under observation just under three years—I thought he was simple—we had a charwoman at home named Miles, and I suspected that he was related to her, and took an interest in him—I noticed no difference in him after the affair of the hammer last year—it did not strike me that his father and mother's death made any difference in his manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. SCOTT</hi>. I have had the prisoner under observation since February 19th—he is weak-minded and below the average of intelligence—he complained of pains in his head and giddiness—I could find no organic cause for the giddiness—I found no epilepsy at all—I have heard the family history—the cause of his aunt's malady is doubtful—he is 19 years old—I have heard that he had trouble in losing his father and mother, and was left alone—a weak mind would be very likely to be upset by that—I found no indication of a blow on his head—the death of his father and mother when he was only earning 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week would not improve his mind—I have heard what Bardell said, and I that he gave himself up for murder, and that be said, "I expect I shall get five years for this; that does not fully account for his not appreciating what he had done—I come to the conclusion that his mind was confused when he was at the station; that he was mentally upset—I think he did know what he was doing, but did not appreciate it to the full extent—I have not heard that the girl's father asked him to marry her, I understood that he asked him to pay money-—I have also heard the father deny it—that does not weigh with me at all in forming a conclusion as to the state of his mind—I have heard from the witness Hartley that for the last fortnight before the occurrence his manner changed, and he became very silent and depressed—that would suggest an increase of the weakness—I heard he had been worried—worry and passion would affect a weak mind more than another—the change would not necessarily point to a weaker mind—if there was a change in his manner entirely without any cause for it, any temper, it might indicate weakness—weakness sometimes grows very rapidly—one sign is delusions as to facts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I gave particular attention to the prisoner, in strict conformity with my duty—I watch all persons who are to be charged with crime—I think the prisoner knows at present what he has done, and that it was wrong—his mind is below the average—I should not at any time have felt justified in giving a certificate that he is insane—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am Assistant Superintendent in the Registry at the Home Office—instructions are issued from the Home Office to persons who are desirous of obtaining naturalisation under the Naturalisation Act of 1870—this document (No. 9) is a copy of that issued to aliens applying for naturalisation—it requires the memorial of the applicant to be verified by his own statutory declaration, and it is required that the statements in the memorial and the respectability and loyalty of the applicant must be vouched for by a declaration made by four householders who are natural born British subjects, and in each case it is required that the persons shall not be the agent or solicitor of the memorialist—the fee payable on the grant of the certificate is £5—on November 24th last the memorial of Alfred Paget, asking for naturalisation under the Act. was received at the Home Office, and was accompanied by a declaration of Alfred Paget, and also by the statuory declarations of Haynes Morris, Don Watson, and Sandbrook—they were forwarded with a letter signed" Be✗ard Abrahams," from 2, Great Marlborough Street—the Deed Poll was also sent, which shows that Alphonse de Blutstein in 1876 changed his name to Alfred Paget—the papers were handed over to Scotland Yard for the police to make inquiries in the usual way—the instructions state that the statements in the memorial and declarations</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. C. F. GILL</hi>. There are a great number of applications for naturalisation in the course of the year—a very small percentage of them are refused—sometimes the applications are made through law stationers—the forms are obtainable at any well-known law stationer's—passports are only issued to Englishmen—if the Secretary of State is satisfied with the. evidence of an alien who applies, and who has resided in the United Kingdom for not less than seven years, and of the evidence of his intention to reside, then no explanation is given—there is nothing in the Act of Parliament with regard to character—I have nothing to do with the interpretation of the Act—I have never read the Act—I have been in the department for seven years—any person making an application for the instructions would get them free—the information to be given is the name of the foreign State to which the applicant belongs, his place of birth, the names and nationality of his parents, his age and profession, whether he is married, or his any children, their names and ages and number, and stating that, for a period of five years out of the last eight years he has lived in England—there is nothing in Section 2 about his character—when an application is refused no reason is given, it is simply refused, and there is an end of it—Paget's memorial is on one of Waterlow's forms—his memorial says that he resides at 2, Woodstock Street—it is written by somebody else, and signed by him, and he declares that the contents are true—this declara<lb/>tion with regard to Eccles is partly printed and partly written, and is declared before a Commissioner for oaths—there is no statement with regard to anything except residence—it depends on the circumstances of the case as to how soon the papers would be sent to Scotland Yard, but, assuming that the papers are properly filled up, they ought to go in in a day or two—I do not know when these papers reached Scotland Yard—I did not send them in.</p>

In the beginning of November, 1899, I made the acquaintance of a man named Don Watson. He sold me a pair of horses and a carriage. I afterwards met him at Brighton, and I came from Brighton with him to the office of the defendant Abrahams, in Great Marlborough Street, for the purpose of getting a formal receipt for the money I had paid for the carriage and horses. This was towards the end of November. I saw Bernard Abrahams then for the first time, and while I was waiting I also saw Mr. Paget. I had seen him before. I did not speak to him. Watson introduced Abrahams to me. I went to Abrahams' office more than once after that day with Watson, and I saw Paget there on other days. Watson told me that Paget was trying to get naturalised. Watson traded under the name of Vivian Blackwell. I afterwards, about November 24th, went to Paris with Don Watson. Early in December, I think in the first week, I saw Abrahams and Paget together in Paris. I saw them at the Cafe de Paris on a Saturday and a Sunday night. They were together on both occasions. Abrahams joined me and Watson, and we went to the Cafe Americain and the Cafe Maxime. Abrahams said he was staying at the Hotel Ritz, and that Paget was also staying there. He said that Paget had something to do with a company, and was 'doing' somebody, and Watson asked Abrahams how much he was going to get out of it, and suggested that Paget would put Abrahams off with a few hundreds, and Abrahams said, 'Not if I know it.' I made a statement to Inspector Arrow on January 5th last which he took down in writing, and that statement was as nearly as possible correct. I have been ill since then, and my memory has rather failed me since. I did not see Paget in Paris after that Sunday night. I think I saw Abrahams on the next day, Monday; I was with Watson at the time. Abrahams said he might leave that night for London. When I first saw Abrahams at his office in London he said, 'It would be as well for us to go to Paris.' He said Paget had been in Paris, at the Hotel Ritz, and had made a lot of money in Paris, about £40,000; he did not say how, but that he had made it in a few weeks. I know Abrahams said in Paris something not in Paget's praise, to the effect that Paget had not treated him well in the way he spoke to him; but I cannot now remember what he said about Paget. I signed the statement that I made to Inspector Arrow after he had read it over to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined for Paget:</hi> I was about a fortnight in Paris. We saw them supping on the Sunday night at the Cafe de Paris; there were a good many people there</p>

               <p>and we went afterwards to Maxime's, and went on from there to the Cafe Americain; that would be about 2.30 a.m. I do not remember at what time we went home. Watson and Abrahams and myself drove together from one cafe to the other. I think it was the first week in December. I had been in Paris once before. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined for Abrahams:</hi> I saw Mr. Abrahams altogether twice in London and three times in Paris. I first went to Abrahams' office about the receipt, and to consult him about a woman who was claiming the horses I had bought, and was annoying me. She had tried to prevent the horses leaving the stables; that was her only annoyance. I did not instruct Mr. Abrahams to act for me; I had my own solicitor. Mr. Abrahams was Watson's solicitor. My meeting with Mr. Abrahams at the Cafe de Paris was accidental, as far as I know. There were two or three other gentlemen with Abrahams at the time. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined:</hi> Watson showed no surprise on meeting Abrahams in Paris. The day I saw them in Paris was probably Sunday, December 3rd. I never heard the name of the company in Paris that Paget was doing business with. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined for Abrahams:</hi> Mr. Abrahams, in Paris, advised me to place myself in the hands of Messrs. Cook, the tourist agents, who would see me safely back with my horses to London. I have not seen Abrahams since. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined:</hi> Abrahams gave me this advice in consequence of something that Watson had done. I told Abrahams what Watson had done; he had stabled my horses in his own name in Paris, and then claimed them as his, and I had to go to a French Court about it...."</p>

I went with Sergeant Mew to 2, Wood<lb/>stock Street on the evening of December 1st—I saw Paget, Abrahams, Haynes and Morris there, and Abrahams' clerk—I was present when Mew questioned Morris and Haynes, and I saw Mew write down the answers—I did not make a note myself—Abrahams' clerk said, "I have known Paget 10 years; I can vouch for his respectability"—Abrahams said, "Mr. Paget is one of the best, and I can assure you he has always a good glass of wine."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). On January 31 st I received a warrant for the arrest of the defendants, which also included Morris—on February 5th, in consequence of some communication by Paget, I went to 30, George Street, IIanover Square—I saw Paget, and told him I held a warrant for his arrest—I read it to him—he said, "I know nothing about that; I instructed my solicitor, Mr. Abrahams, I left it to him; he must answer for that; I have been in England 20 years, and I wish to become an Englishman"—we then left for Marlborough Mews Police-station—on the way he said, "When one of your men explained the matter to me I said to Abrahams, 'What have you done? this is a serious matter;' and he said, 'I will take all responsibility'"—the same morning I went to 22, Great Marlborough Street, where I saw Abrahams—I said, "I have a warrant for your arrest"—I read it to him—he said, "I should have thought a summons would have done, I am not going to run away; I wish to say I am innocent, I have a perfect answer to the charge"—later in the same day Haynes and Eccles were brought to Bow Street by Ser<lb/>geant Mew, and I charged all of them—Abrahams said, "I wish to say I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190004020049"/>
               <p>am perfectly innocent of the charge"—Paget said, "I am perfectly innocent of the charge; all that I did swear was true"—the other two defendants said, "I wish to say the same"—later in the same day Eccles said, "I used to carry on business as a commission agent at 2, Woodstock Street, in the name of Goodall"—I knew Paget before that—on January 25th, 1899, I arrested him on a warrant charging him with fraud—he was brought up the same day at Marlborough Street Police-court before Mr. De Rutzen—Abrahams appeared for him as his solicitor—the case was remanded for a week—Abrahams applied for bail for Paget—the Magis<lb/>trate appealed to me in the usual way—I said. "I object to bail; the prisoner is known to the police," and bail was refused—on February 1st Paget was brought up on remand, and again remanded for a week; no evidence was taken—before he was remanded I saw Mr. Newton for the prosecution and Mr. Abrahams for the defence conferring, and an applica<lb/>tion was made by one of them to the Magistrate, and the case again remanded—Paget was not present then; he was brought up afterwards and formally remanded—after that Abrahams said to me in the backyard of the Court, "Why object to bail, Arrow?" or something to that effect—I said to him, "The man has been convicted in Paris, and is a swindler"—I do not think Abrahams said anything to that—Paget was subsequently released on bail—I have ascertained that from the books at the Police-court—I was not consulted between February 1st and the 4th, when he was admitted to bail—on February 8th Paget appeared at the Police-court; prose<lb/>cutor failed to appear, and he was discharged—the charge sheet was marked, "No prosecutor"—since then I have seen Paget about London, and also Abrahams—I have seen them in company—I have seen them together in Great Marlborough Street at Abrahams' office, at the Cafe Verry in Regent Street, in the Cafe Royal, Regent Street, in the Pavilion Music Hall, and about the streets in the West-end and the City—I met them in Fleet Street in a cab.</p>

I had seen Paget before January 25th, 1899, but I do not remember having spoken to him—I arrested him on a warrant granted on the information sworn by a man named Pearlman—I did not know Pearlman till then—I never saw him again after he had been cross-examined at Marlborough Street, to my knowledge—I was the officer in the case—I have no record about Pearlman—he was cross-examined as to whether he had been convicted—no application was made at that time for the discharge of Paget—I subsequently learned that he had been admitted, to bail in two sureties of £50 each—I never saw Abrahams and Paget in each other's company before January 25th, 1899, that I am aware of—there is no officer in charge of this present case superior to myself—I have heard that Paget was interested in a company—I do not know that the name of it was the Anglo-French Syndicate, Limited—I believe I heard the name at Bow Street—I have not made any inquiry about it—I do not know that Paget wanted this matter carried through quickly, as he was going abroad—I have heard that he wanted to go to China, but I forget who I heard it from—I did not hear Paget say so—I have seen Paget and Abrahams together at the Pavilion twice—I cannot give you the dates—I think the Cafe Verry is tne nearest cafe to Abrahams' office—I have seen them there together more than six times—I learned</p>

               <p>that they had been in Paris together in December—I had no conversa<lb/>tion with Paget about this case till I arrested him—I went to his house in Woodstock Street—I was well known to his wife, who told me he was in Paris, and she gave me his address—she said she expected him home the next day—I called the next day, and so on for nearly a week—when he returned he sent me a telegram, and I went and saw him and arrested him.</p>

Thanksgiving Day. <hi rend="smallCaps">JUDGE GILMORE"</hi>—he came again on December 1st—he asked me to go to an hotel with him—I said, "No, I prefer to stay in my own house until we go away for good"—I said, "You had better stay at my house till we go"—that night he stayed and slept with me—I believed I was his lawfully wedded wife, or else he would never have stayed there—he remained through December—he said he had sent his luggage on—he was always waiting for it—when he came in he asked whether it had come—it never came—he said it had gone to Strat<lb/>ford instead of Catford—I paid the household expenses—he had no money—he said he was waiting for his money to come from America—early in December I told him I thought it was very strange I did not have a marriage certificate—he said, "Oh, very well, I will see about it," but that it was not the usual thing in America—I said it was the usual thing here—then this paper came addressed to me in this envelope, which I opened—the prisoner was at home when it arrived—he said, "This is the first time I have had my letters opened by anyone else"—I said, "I have a right to open it"—I showed him the certificate—he asked the nurse to sign her name at the bottom of it—she signed it—I locked it up—I believed it to be a genuine certificate of marriage—there was a mistake in the name, which was "Omequi" instead of "Onequi"—the prisoner said he would take it when we went to dinner at the Consul's—that is Judge Gilmore's—(<hi rend="italic">This document was a stationer's form, commencing in large German text "This Indenture," upon which was written</hi> "Emergent Certificate.

I am married—I live with my father at 19, Fordale Road, Catford—I am a certificated nurse—I attended Miss Fenton in her confinement in 1898—I have been friendly with her since—in November last I had communications with her with regard to pro<lb/>posals which had been made to her—I became aware that a marriage had been arranged between her and Onequi—I was present on November 29th, when Judge Gilmore came to the house in Brownhill Road, and a cere<lb/>mony was gone through—the Judge produced a paper, which I signed, and he took away after the prisoner and Miss Fenton had signed it—from what had been said I believed it to be a genuine marriage ceremony—from about December 1st I know the prisoner lived in the house as the husband of this young lady—he remained till February 5th at that house and in lodgings till February 16th this year—he told me his people were cotton and tobacco planters, of Richmond, Virginia—that was both before and after the marriage—he said he had been in business at 1244, The Broadway, New York, as a broker, in the name of Sir Henry Onequi—he showed me this photograph, on the back of which is written "Sir Henry Onequi, formerly of 1244, The Broadway, New York"—he said he inherited that title from his grandfather, who was English—he told me later that he had followed the profession of a palmist—he looked at our palms and foretold our destinies—I was present when this certificate arrived on December 13th—the prisoner handed it to me, and I signed it—Miss Fenton took it—I believed it was genuine—Miss Fenton became ill—I examined the prisoners linen, and found a peculiar discharge upon it—they were to go to America, and I was to have the furniture—it was afterwards arranged that I was to go, but the furniture was still to be mine—the prisoner was to sell it for me—on January 9th Mr. Smith came to see the furniture, which was arranged to be sold for 10 guineas—the prisoner told me not to take less than 7 guineas, and it was arranged to be sold for 8 guineas, as we were going away, and Mr. Smith would not give more—there were nine rooms—I received two payments of £4 and £5 10s., with which I paid bills—the arrangements fell through—I brought her away from her lodgings on February 15th, and took her to my father's house—I communicated with the police—the prisoner came to my father's house and asked for the certificate—I said he could not have it—Miss Fenton had given it to me before she moved from the Brownhill Road—she was very delicate and weak from the want of food,</p>
