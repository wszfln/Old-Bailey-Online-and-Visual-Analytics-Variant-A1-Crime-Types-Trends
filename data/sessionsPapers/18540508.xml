I am a stock and share agent In March last I took the first floor of the house, No. 30, Percy-street, at a rent of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—the defendant was the occupier of the house—I paid him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account, as he wanted money; he asked me to let him have it; he is a portrait painter—there is no ground whatever for saying that I was ever tried for breaking into a wine cellar in Coram-street—I have never been tried for any offence whatever; not a word of this libel, as regards myself, is true—since the defendant has been out on bail he has been to my banker's, and to persons with whom I deal, stating things against my credit—my wife's maiden name was Emma Berry—I have been married eight years—I received some money under some trust property belonging to my wife; I paid that money into the Royal British Bank, in trust for her, and the prisoner went to my banker's, and by that means ascertained my wife's maiden name—on Monday, 20th or 21st March, when I returned home from the City, my wife made a complaint to me about the defendant—she was agitated, and crying—I went down to the defendant, and asked him what he meant by making use of such abominable language to my wife and servant—he said she was a wh—, and so was my servant, and on that I knocked him down—there was a disturbance in the house, and we went before a Magistrate, who suggested that I should leave the house—I promised the Magistrate that I would leave before 12 o'clock that night, and I did so, and so did Mr. Benjamin—Mr. Benjamin is not a friend of mine, only a lodger in the house—I knew nothing of him till I went there</p>

My mother, Bosetta Tollitt lives there, and keeps a grass farm—I act as foreman, and assist in her business; the prisoners were in her employ on 14th March—Hill's duty was to take hay to market—Ruislip is about fifteen miles from town—Hill was allowed a bottle of hay as provender for his horses; that is about forty pounds, and he had his feed in nose bags—on 14th March, some hay was shown to me by a constable; I could identify it as belonging to my mother; it is now here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a former, of Enfield Lock. On the morning of 5th May I got up at a quarter before 6 o'clock—I was not called up—I received information that my stack was on fire, which was within one mile of my house, between Ponders-end and Enfield, in a field which opens upon the towing path, which is a public road—there is a hedge between the stack and the towing path—persons going from Enfield Highway would pass by the side of the river Lea, cross the pathway, and go into the village of Ponders-end—the road and towing path form one, between Enfield lane and Ponders-end, but no farther—when the alarm of fire was given, I went by the towing path towards London; my house opens on the towing path—I met the prisoner on the towing path, about 200 yards on this side of the stack, going in the direction of my house, away from Ponders-end and towards Enfield Lock; he was walking—I said, "My good fellow," or "Good friend, where have you come from?"—he said, "From London"—I asked him whether he walked or rode; he said he walked—I asked him what time he left London; he said, "About two hours ago"—I said he could not reach there under three hours; the distance is twelve or thirteen miles—I told him I must detain him—I took him back with me into the field where the fire was, and he was afterwards given into custody—the top of the stack and three sides of it were burnt; the side which had been cut was not burnt so much—there was an engine there, but a large quantity of hay was destroyed—when I gave the prisoner into custody the policeman searched</p>

                  </hi>, Esq. I am a Barrister of the Inner Temple. I am in the habit of going to Westminster of a morning, during term—it has been my usual practice to change my coat before I put on my wig—on 21st Jan. I went down at the usual time, in a coat that had a breast pocket within; I had a porte monnaie in the pocket containing 2 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, a check for 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, a check for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, a sovereign, a half sovereign, and some silver—the checks were both crossed "&amp; Co."—I went into Howard's robbing room, the prisoner waited upon me—he was about to take out my other coat, but I told him I would wear the same as I had on; I took it off for the convenience of tying on my cravat, and I believe I handed my coat to the prisoner, who put it on a chair—I was in conversation with some gentle<lb/>men, and afterwards found the prisoner holding up my coat with both hands for me to put on—I was hurried that morning as some one was waiting for me, and I went down stairs—I saw the person who was waiting for me in the lobby, and as I was going through the passage to the Court of Exche<lb/>quer, I buttoned up my coat, and missed my Porte monnaie—it was then about 10 o'clock—I immediately went upstairs, made known my loss in the room, and addressed the prisoner as he had assisted me, and had to do with my coat, and no one else; I asked him if he had seen my purse, he said he knew nothing about it—I had always been in the habit of taking my purse out of my pocket and laying it on the table to place it in my other pocket, and the prisoner has often seen me do that; but on this occasion as I was going to wear the same coat, I left the purse in the pocket—I went upstairs again, about 12 o'clock, and saw the prisoner; I complained of my loss, and he asked me if the checks were crossed, I said, "Yes"—I received the Bank notes from Minson, a clerk of Messrs. Roberts, Curtis, and Co., they were part of a check for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Exeter bank, of which they are the correspondents; I had received three 5/.-notes, and had given the preceding note to these to Mrs. Kingdon on the preceding night—there was no mark on them, they were new notes.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 9, Pitt-street, St. George-Row. I for<lb/>merly lived in Marshall-street—I am an accountant, and have been so eleven years—I have known the lad at the bar about five months; he came to lodge with me about the middle of Feb.—he left Mr. Howard's situation eight or nine days or a fortnight afterwards—on the day he left, 21st Jan., he came home earlier than usual, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon; I said, "Halloo, Robert! how is it you are home so early to-day?"—he said, "The Court is up, and I have got a holiday for a month"—his father lives in the New Kent-road—a night or two after this I was at his father's place; I saw Mr. Howard there, making inquiries—I afterwards said to the prisoner, "Mr. Howard is making inquiries after you and wants you to go back to your work; how is it you told me a lie?"—he said, "I shall not go back any more"—I wanted to know the reason, and he said he had too much bother, and too many masters—this letter, signed "Richardson," (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one which he employed me to write to Messrs. Howard and Harries for him—the envelope is also my writing; I gave it to him to post—he remained with me two or three days afterwards—in consequence of seeing his married sister, Charlotte Coleman, I said to him, "I was speaking</p>

               <p>to your sister, and she told me that Robert gave her a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to change; that she asked you where you got it, and you said that Mr. O'Brien gave it to you to take 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of it, as you had not change"—I asked him why he said so, and he did not give me any answer—about three or four days after that I told him of a report about some money having been taken from the place where he was employed, and that, as he had left the place, there was a suspicion upon him—he gave me no answer to that—some time after he left, I heard a person say he threw the checks over Westminster bridge; I cannot say who the person was—on the Saturday after the prisoner left, I saw him in possession of a sovereign, a half sovereign, and some silver—I think it was on the Saturday night, and on that Saturday evening I think it was he brought home some new trowsers—I asked him who made them; he said his brother, and that he gave 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—he asked me to go with him to choose a pair of boots—I asked him where he got the money—he said his single sister gave him two sovereigns the night before—he bought a new hat that night, and a new jacket—I afterwards saw his single sister, and from what she told me I afterwards said to him, "I was speaking to your sister Charlotte, and she says she did not give you two sovereigns; she gave you a half sovereign"—he made no answer, but only turned on one side.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the lad come back, and did you advise him not to go home? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On my oath, I advised him to go home; he went with me—while he slept at home, he slept with me; I never slept with him at any other place but once, when we were late, and went to a coffee shop and paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a bed—we had been at the Globe coffee shop, eating, drinking, and reading—he read very little.</p>

Neal and Co., of Upper Ground-street, Blackfriars—on 16th Jan. I directed the prisoner to go to Messrs. Neal, and get a ton of the beet coals—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he brought me back this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the same day—I sent him again for two tons, and gave him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he brought me back this, bill</p>

I gave him an order to get one ton of coals, and gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he brought me seconds, and said that 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the price of them—on the same day I gave him an order to go and get two tons of the best coals at the same place—he brought me back seconds, and this receipt for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said that they had no other coals.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coal merchant, of Upper Ground-street, Black-friars. On 17th Jan., the prisoner came to my wharf, with a van for some coals—my man had gone to dinner—I cannot Bay what coal he asked for—we have a list of prices of coals in the counting house; he usually selected the commonest coals—I wished him to have some vendor's tickets for his employer to fill up—the prisoner represented that his employer was badly paid, and that he wanted the coals for another party—he mentioned no names, and I did not know who he was <hi rend="italic">drawing</hi> the coals for, but he wanted 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. put on the bill to enable his master to get a profit—I charged him the price which was on our list; I cannot say what price that was, unless I had the books; this is copied from the counterpart, and I have a little cash book as well in which he enters it, and gives me a sample for what he receives of me—the cash book is not here, but this book contains the whole of it—I make an entry in the counterpart of the book from which this receipt is taken—the sum entered on the counterpart may not correspond with the sum entered upon the receipt—I pay over to Jordan the money I receive over the counter—I cannot recollect how much I paid over to him—I gave this receipt for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it is in my writing—I had not received 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but less—I do not think that there is any case in which he has paid the money that he has had the bill made out for, but having once assigned the reason, it was allowed to go on, believing that it was his master's order—if he had asked to have 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. put in the bill for himself, I would not have done it—he took the two tons of coals; he bought them in Mr. Clark's name, who left us shortly afterwards in consequence of our selling bad coals—I handed over all the money to Jordan that I received from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You cannot say what money there was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; this is not a common practice of ours—I have known a case of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. being added to a bill before—you may call it a fraud—I have done so to the extent of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. perhaps in one ton in 5,000; I think I can swear to that—I remember two customers to whom I have given such receipts; I mean to the Carmen; they are master carmen—there are a great many men who keep a horse and van, who do not come down to the wharf but they cart coals for less than the coal merchants can, and they come down and say, "I have got to give this man credit, you put me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on;" but we never allow any servant to get 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a ton on coals, and we never put any amount on the bill but what they pay, but in this case I believed that it was his master's orders—it is not, besides that, my custom to give the Carmen a couple of shillings when they bring orders; we cannot afford to do it; nor 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., nor 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we only get 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton—we have perhaps given a man a pint of beer, but not' for bringing an order—if the coals are getting small, we perhaps ask a man to take a sieve and assist, and give</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185405080024"/>
               <p>him a drop of beer—I mean to say I have never given Carmen money to induce them to bring orders for coals; I have to agents, who sell coal for us; we provide them with printed orders and envelopes, and allow them 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton for their trouble in writing to us; and if our carmen get an order, when they are shooting coals we give them 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but we never allow anything for bringing such an order as this—we do not get 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per ton out of the transaction, or not more—our books will prove it—the more business we do, the cheaper we can do it—I never saw Clark—I supposed I was selling to some retailer, and that Clark was the Carman—Clark's customer was the person who was to be <hi rend="italic">done.</hi>

I lire at Amersham, near Lewisham, and have recently arrived in London from Australia, in the ship <hi rend="italic">Joshua.</hi> The prisoner came home in the same vessel with me—my berth was immediately over his—I had been to the diggings at Ballarat, and got gold there—when I got on board, I put my gold into a cigar box, with a pound of tobacco on the top of it, put the lid on, and lashed it up with a bit of cord—the tobacco was in the box on the top of the gold, which was in a bag—I had sixty ounces of gold, or rather more; I think there was sixty-six or sixty-seven ounces, but I cannot swear to that—I saw it safe one afternoon, and missed it next morning; we had been then three or four days at sea—I went to the captain as soon as I missed it, and made a complaint—a search was made, but it was not found—shortly afterwards I went down, and saw the prisoner standing at the doorway of my berth (some berths had doors, and some had not; mine had only a space to get in; a doorway)—he asked me whether I thought Mrs. Levy would take care of his gold if he gave it to her; I said, "Yes, I have no doubt but she will"—he had a short belt in his hand, which was crammed full, but, I did not see the contents; he said it was gold—some short time after that, I lost a bottle of gin to the prisoner, which was in my berth—it was a bet—I suppose he drank it, for he was drunk about a quarter of an hour afterwards—I did not see him take it, but when I accused him of taking it he only laughed—while he was in that state he showed me and two or three others a nugget, which I think came from Ballarat by its appearance; I could swear that it came from that dis<lb/>trict; I know by the colour of it—I asked him where he got it, and he said he got it at Ballarat—afterwards, when he was sober, I asked him about Bal<lb/>larat, he did not give me a willing description of it; he answered very reluc<lb/>tantly—I asked him what part of Ballarat he was working at; he said "Eu<lb/>reka"—I asked him what <hi rend="italic">lead</hi> he was in; he said, "Canadian gully," and every-body who has been there knows that they are two separate <hi rend="italic">leads</hi>—Canadian gully is two miles, or two miles and a half, from Eureka, not more, and the prisoner said it was five or six miles—I asked him where he was working on the Canadian gully; he said "Prince" something, but I forget the name he gave (he was perfectly sober then; this was not on the same occasion—I think it was next day)—I said, "I suppose you mean Prince Regent's gully?" he said, "Oh, yes; that is the name"—I asked him whether he was working at the top or the bottom of the <hi rend="italic">lead;</hi> he said he worked about the middle of it—I asked him how far Jones's Circus was from it; he said it was about three quarters of a mile or a mile; but it is close to where he represented himself to have worked, within a quarter of a mile at any rate—I asked him how deep his hole was; he said fourteen, fifteen, or sixteen feet; and where he represented to have worked, the holes are generally eighty, ninety, and a hundred feet—I asked him whether they slanted; he said, "No"—there were some holes once on the top of the hill, but not where he represents—by the top I mean the upper part—he never mentioned</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185405080044"/>
               <p>the name of the person with whom he had been working—I asked him so many questions that it is scarcely worth while entering into them—I asked him if he knew such and such persons, mentioning the names of the different storekeepers; he said he knew one, but he did not give a proper description—he gave the name of Tapley, and said he was a thin young man, whereas he is a stout old man; but I did not tell the prisoner so, because I wished to see what he did know—there is no young Tapley, that I know of—I mentioned that Tapley was a storekeeper close to where the prisoner repre<lb/>sented that he worked, and asked him whether he remembered any meeting at the diggings concerning the licences; he said, Yes, he had heard about one meeting—I asked him whether he was present; he said, "No"—I think if he had been living at the diggings at the time he would have known something about it, especially living at Canadian gully—I asked him whether he knew any of the Committee; he said, "No"—I do not think that there is a digger, hardly, but what knows something about it; the meeting was held on the <hi rend="italic">Flat</hi>—Henry Boswell, who was the carpenter of the ship, made a communication to me soon afterwards, in consequence of which I went to the prisoner—I talked to him a little time, and then asked him if he would show me his gold; he said, No, he would not; he had been <hi rend="italic">put up</hi> to that—I had never accused him—I was not present when the captain spoke to him—the next morning, after the prisoner had refused to show me the gold, he was called up by the captain (I had asked him again in the morning, and he refused both times)—the captain ordered him to produce the gold; I saw it, and recognized one nugget—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is Ballarat gold, and there was other gold mixed with it—there were two or three ounces of Bal<lb/>larat gold—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the shot belt; it was given up to the captain—there is not the quantity of gold here which was delivered up to Mrs. Levy to take care of; it is the quantity given to the captain (<hi rend="italic">The shot belt was then opened and the gold shaken out into a saucer</hi>) I recognize this nugget, and can undertake to say positively that it was among my gold; it is a dif<lb/>ferent species of gold, it is surface gold—all my gold was of this colour—the small gold was very much burnt, and it looked rather browner than the nuggets; the nuggets are clearer—this is the nugget of which I had given a description to the captain—I had also described it to Mr. Brooks—when this nugget was turned out in the prisoner's presence, Mr. Brooks said, "That is it"—I had described it to two or three others besides—I should think the cigar box would hold 100 or 150 cigars.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 16, Collard-place, and am captain of the <hi rend="italic">Joshua</hi>, which left Melbourne on 30th Jam. On 4th Feb., the third day after leaving, a complaint was made to me—the passengers were not per<lb/>sonally examined, they were asked to produce their gold—some of them produced gold—the prisoner did not produce any; he saw the other passen<lb/>gers produce theirs—I was not aware which of my passengers had gold and which had not—the passengers were not asked to produce their gold, but for their own security they produced it, and placed it in my charge for fear it should be stolen, as this was—Vertue was there, examining the gold that was produced—it was known at that time that there was a complaint in the ship of gold being lost, and when it was being produced the prosecutor was examining it to see if it was his—I took the gold into my possession which they so produced—the prisoner saw the others produce their gold—I saw the prosecutor examining the other passengers' gold to see if he could recog<lb/>nise it, as did all the passengers; they all knew the gold was brought to me and was opened—I cannot be positive that the prisoner was in the cabin to see Vertue examining the gold, but he knew that it was the case—I cannot undertake to say that he did sec Vertue examining it—the search through the ship for Vertue's gold was going on by the chief officer and the seamen when the passengers brought their gold—all the passengers must have known that the search that was going on was for Vertue's gold, that was no secret—on 6th April, in consequence of a commmunication made to me, I re<lb/>quested the prisoner to show me his gold, and before he produced it I asked Vertue to give me a description of his gold—he did—the prisoner's gold was produced by Mrs. Levy, who said that was all M'Lean's gold that she had—I took possession of it, and have kept it ever since—the belt was opened in the presence of the prisoner and the prosecutor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Robert Attenborough, a pawn-broker, of No. 11, Greek-street, Soho. I know the prisoner by the name of Llishman, that was the name he generally pawned in—on 9th Feb. he pawned a coat—I have no doubt that this is the coat (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) which he pawned on the 9th Feb.—it has now a ticket on it for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., pawned on the 14th—it is a black beaver coat, lined with plaid—I have sufficient memory to say that the coat pawned with me on the 9th Feb. was a black beaver, and lined with plaid, on which I lent 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on 14th Feb. this coat was again pawned with me by a man of the name of Hayton—I had known him before—I had seen him with the prisoner—I lent 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the coat.</p>

ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Mr. Attenborough has many houses, has he not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He has four—there are three assistants besides myself where I am—Mr. "Wellman is the only person who takes in pledges besides me—it is a very common thing for persons to traffic in pledges, and sell their tickets—my attention was called to the parcel which I say was substituted for this first coat, about a month or five weeks ago, about the middle of April—that was the time we examined our stock generally—it does sometimes happen that we advance more money on an article than it is worth, but we do not usually lend 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on a coat not worth more than 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have been blamed by Mr. Attenborough for advancing more money on articles than they are worth—in the hurry of business it is quite unavoid<lb/>able—I am thirty-four years old, and have been in the pawnbroking busi<lb/>ness eighteen years—I have taken in pledges about twelve years—I have been with Mr. Attenborough about four years—I have not sworn to this coat—to the best of my belief, it is the coat—there is no mark about it—it was pawned again on the 14th—we place the ticket on it with a pin—we dry the tickets with blotting paper—when the thing is settled, the article goes under the counter, but in process of time it goes in what we call a well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This ticket of 14th Feb. would be outside the wrapper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the wrapper in which this coat was is left at home—I cannot swear positively to this coat; it was a black beaver coat, with a blue plaid lining, that I took in on 9th Feb.; but there is no mark by which I know this—when the parcel is made up, and the customer gone, the parcel goes under the counter till it is booked, which it is shortly afterwards; always on the same day—it then goes in the warehouse, where it is arranged with other coats, according to the price; it remains there till it is brought down to be taken out, or to be looked at—persons come occasionally to see the pledges, perhaps to bring a friend, or to sell the ticket.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been assistant to Mr. Attenborough for two years. I have been seven years in the trade—I know the prisoner as pawn<lb/>ing at our shop—I remember his coming on 10th Feb.—he gave in a ticket of a coat for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; this is the ticket—it is dated on 9th Feb.; this ticket is my writing—Mr. Cotton took in the pledge, and I wrote the ticket at his direction—I saw the coat that was pawned on 9th Feb., I did it up—to the best of my belief this is the coat—I remember it was a black beaver coat, with a blue lining—I did it up in brown paper—when the prisoner pro<lb/>duced this ticket on 10th Feb., he laid it down; I do not remember what he said any more than he paid the interest, and had a new ticket in another</p>

               <p>name—when the parcel came down I gave it him, I only took the ticket off, and laid the parcel on the counter—I asked him if he was going to take it out; he said no, he wanted a new ticket—when I put it on the counter it was towards him; I cannot tell whether he touched it—he said he must have it renewed, or something of that sort—I had a new ticket written—here is the ticket of 10th Feb., it was written by the warehouse boy, by my direc<lb/>tion—the boy wrote it at the desk, no doubt—I was moving about, I have no doubt I turned fifty times; I was in several places during the time—I am quite confident that I lost sight of the parcel—the prisoner was about the middle box—there are five boxes—I think our counter is about three yards long in front of the boxes—I cannot remember what time of day this was—the boxes are not very light—you cannot see into them clearly—whilst I was walking about, the prisoner had the opportunity of substitut<lb/>ing one parcel for another—I remember this parcel was there, and after the ticket was written, I put the ticket on the parcel on the counter—I had no idea but it was the same parcel that was brought down—the string was on it—I remember pinning this ticket on it—the parcel was afterwards booked and sent up stairs in the usual way—my attention was called to it on 3rd April—we then examined all the parcels done in brown paper—we exa<lb/>mined this parcel—it was in brown paper, and had the ticket of 10th Feb. on it—it contained this coat, which I should think is not worth more than 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to lend on it—I can positively swear I never lent the prisoner 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on this brown coat—the ticket of 10th Feb. for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was on it—I did not take it in on 9th Feb., I folded it up—I am certain that this brown coat is not the coat that I folded up on 9th Feb.—between the time that I placed the coat on the counter for him to examine it if he pleased, and the time the ticket was made out, and I pinned it on the parcel that was sub<lb/>stituted, about a minute and a half or perhaps a little more had elapsed—On 3rd March I took in a pledge of the prisoner of a shirt and handkerchief for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I believe I took it in at dinner-time, between 1 and half past 1 o'clock—he came again the same day—I think it was very shortly after<lb/>wards; he said he wanted the parcel down to have sixpence more advanced on it—I do not thick the parcel had then been put in the warehouse, we had not had time—it may be two or three hours before a parcel is booked and taken up in the warehouse—when the prisoner came I got the parcel, and told the warehouse boy to write a fresh ticket for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I put the parcel on the counter to the prisoner, the same as I did the coat—the pri<lb/>soner generally went in the same box—when the ticket was written I put it on the parcel, and put the parcel under the counter again—my attention was called to the parcel now before me about 3rd April—this parcel contains a shirt and a handkerchief—this shirt is not the one I took in, nor is the hand<lb/>kerchief—the handkerchief I took in was a silk handkerchief; this is a cotton handkerchief—we do not take in cotton handkerchiefs—this shirt is worth 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., it is a night shirt, there is no front to it—the shirt I took in was a day shirt—a calico shirt with a linen front—I am quite certain I did not take in this shirt and handkerchief from this man on 3rd March—I should think you could buy this handkerchief new for 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have a ticket of a handkerchief pawned by the prisoner on 11th March, for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a ticket of a handkerchief pawned on 13th March for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I took in a handkerchief of the prisoner on 11th March; I lent him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it—I remember his coming again on 13th March, in reference to this handker<lb/>chief—I had this parcel of 11th March down, and he said he wished to pay sixpence off it, and put it in for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and have a new ticket—I changed</p>

               <p>the ticket for him, and pinned the ticket on it—this parcel has no string, that is all the difference—this parcel contains a black neck handkerchief—this is not the handkerchief which I took in on the 11th—this is a silk hand<lb/>kerchief, but it is full of holes—the one I took in on the 11th was a pocket handkerchief—I cannot recollect the colour of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How often have you had this black handkerchief out since? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only once; we had quite enough of it then—it was not exhi<lb/>bited at the Police Court—these things were not exhibited before the Magi<lb/>strate—it often happens that one person takes the things in, and some one else makes out the ticket—I am taking in pledges all day—in one day per<lb/>haps 200 are taken in, all sorts of things, and each person being anxious to be served as speedily as possible—this brown coat is worth about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to lend on—these things are done up very often some time after the pledge has been taken in—it is very rare we have them in papers—mostly in wrappers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tide surveyor—I went on board this vessel on 19th April—it is my duty to go to see that the cargo is cleared out—I examined the whole of the vessel, to the best of my knowledge every part was examined—I found three portions of wheat, one was in the bottom of the vessel, in the hold, another was between decks, and another was in eight casks, in the store room, in the cabin on deck—I sent it on shore before I would clear—there was about eight quarters in all—the loose wheat was put into bags and sent on shore—there was about sixty-four bushels in all, and I would not clear the vessel till it was all removed—I examined the wheat, it was so good that I conceived it to be part of the cargo—I sent it on shore that the merchants might receive it—of course the duty would be paid—I sent it to the same place that the other part of the cargo went to—in my judgment this other was not on board at that time—I believe it was not—there was a small portion dirty and wet at the bottom of the hold, and there was water in the hold—I saw afterwards some dirty wheat, perhaps two or three quarters—perhaps that might come from the vessel: I cannot say—no person whatever had any authority to remove any wheat without the concurrence of the Custom House officer till the duty was paid.</p>

The prisoner was in my service, about two months—on Sunday, 30th April, I went into the prisoner's room, and opened one of her drawers; I found there a bottle of rum, marked with Mr. Gooch's mark—I took it out, and asked the prisoner if she knew about it; she said, "I know nothing at all about it; you can have my key"—she did not give me her key—she drew back, and would not let me have it—I told her I should search her box—she went up stairs, opened the box herself, and took out another bottle of rum, and on looking in the box there was another bottle containing brandy, a dram glass, a basket which I identified, and some small articles of wearing apparel; two of them are charged in the indictment, this small white shawl, and this scarf—there were several other things in the box—the bottles in the box had not our mark on them—they were medicine bottles—no doubt they were mine, but I cannot swear to them—this scarf is mine—there was this pocket handkerchief, which I can identify.</p>

I am a carman, of No. 4, William-street, Waterloo-road—I let out carts for hire, and always send a man out with them—I know Palmer by sight from his coming to me on Sunday morning, 26th March—he came to know if I could let him have a horse and cart to fetch some sash weights over Blackfriars-bridge—I said I could—he came the following morning—he said if I had not a man his son could drive it—I said we always let a man go—he came about a quarter before 6 o'clock, and I put my pony to, and went with him over Blackfriars-bridge to the wharf—I waited there three quarters of an hour before we went into the wharf after the sash weights, outside the gates, just above, towards the end of the street—Palmer was in the street walking about, he said, while the men went to breakfast—I had been over to have something to drink before—he asked if</p>

               <p>I would have something else—I went across to the public house—I was five minutes in the Bricklayer's Arms—Thomas came over, and had some rum with us—I did not see where he came from—I took the pony and cart, and went down into the wharf to load the sash weights—Thomas came out to the gate, and there I saw him when I came out again—Sweeting helped to load, and Palmer, and some other man—as he was behind the stack he handed them to Palmer—I came over Blackfriars-bridge, and took them to some new buildings in Westminster-road, Hercules-buildings, and there we unloaded them into an empty room—Palmer was in the room, stacking them—he paid me as we went along—I had nothing to drink after we came over the bridge—I am sure Sweeting helped to load, because I took the weights out of his hand—I saw Palmer pull out a purse, and give a man something; who stood behind the stack—he turned his back at that time—my charge was half a crown; it was two hours and a half—when Palmer paid me he said, "I shall make about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the job; I shall lose my other time to-day, I shan't make above 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by this job"—when we had completed loading the iron it was about a quarter past 7 o'clock—I could not swear what time exactly it was; we could not be much more than ten minutes on the wharf.</p>

                  </hi>. I and another gentleman occupy this wharf, and carry on business there—the sash weights produced by the police constable, are similar in make to ours—we have lost such from the wharf, with other goods: more than a ton, and about that time—in consequence of my direc<lb/>tions, the police were watching the premises—Thomas and Sweeting were both in our employment as labourers, in landing goods, and delivering goods on to carts occasionally—neither of them had authority to sell goods, they would not know the price—customers, when they come to buy, generally come to the counting house—we never send goods without an invoice, I never knew a case—they had been there long enough to know that they had no authority to sell or deliver iron in that way—iron is never sold or delivered at that time in the morning, to my knowledge—the clerk, who has the delivery orders, generally comes at 8 o'clock—very seldom sales are made before that time—if any one sends for goods before that time they should wait for an invoice.</p>

Cleaver's wharf; he went towards Bridge-street—he returned in a few minutes, and Wood followed behind with a pony and cart, and went down the wharf—I saw Wood in Earl-street—I could not see what street he came from—Thomas went down first, and Wood followed with the pony and cart; I followed them, and saw Thomas and Sweeting put something into the cart—I then went on to Blackfriars-bridge, and as I turned to look towards Earl-street, I saw Wood coming with the cart—I followed him over the Bridge—he went at full trot through various streets, and came to Vine-street, York-road; he was about going into the yard of a Mr. Martin, an iron founder, and I stopped him—I asked him where he got the pig iron—he said, "Over the water"—I asked him what he paid for it—he said 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked him what the quantity was—he said there was 5 cwt.—I asked him who he paid—he said "A man on the wharf"—I told him I should take him to the station house, which I did—I weighed the iron; it weighed 5 cwt. 37 lbs.—I afterwards saw Mr. Cleaver, and he sent for Thomas to the counting house—that was about 9 o'clock, or a little after—he asked Thomas if he had sent any pig iron away that morning—Thomas said yes, he had sent 5 cwt to Mr. Martin—he asked him whether he paid for it, and where the money was—he said Mr. Martin had not paid for it—he then sent for Sweeting to the counting house, and asked him if he had loaded any pig iron that morning—he said no, only in their own carts—he asked him if he had sent any away in Mr. Martin's cart—he said no, he had not—I then took them both to the station—on Thomas I found 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on Sweeting 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on Wood—Mr. Cleaver asked Thomas what he had done with the money—he said, "I only had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it"—when I was taking him to the station he said, "I only had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it"—Mr. Cleaver said, "Where is it?"—he said,</p>

               <p>"I <hi rend="italic">give</hi> it to my wife"—I went in <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with Thomas and Wood to Guild-hall—I asked Thomas whether that was the man that paid him a sovereign—(me and Thomas were in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> together)—he said it was—Wood made no reply.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. THOMPSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there not a practice of delivering iron before 7 o'clock in the morning 9 <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When we sell pig iron the usual method is different from any other—when a man applies for iron, we give him a note out of the book, of which we keep a counterpart—the man who loaded the iron returned with the counterpart—it is to see that it was all right—there is no entry here to the effect of any iron having been sold on the morning of 31st March; that is the reason why I asked Thomas if he had sold any—the price of the iron at that time was 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cwt, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per ton—the men in the yard have no authority to deliver iron—we never sold pig iron without entering it in the book.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> So Thomas was in the position of superintendent of the other workmen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was merely foreman, if we may so term it—to make it more specific, we will say foreman of the labourers landing goods—he has no control over any one—I do not depute the authority to him to control anybody—he is employed by us to give us an account of the cargoes he and others land, that is his duty; and occasionally, when customers come into the yard, he fills the cart, and with pig iron more particularly—as foreman he would not have control or authority over any One from me—what he might use, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> We understood from the policeman that you asked him the question, when you called him into the counting house, whether he sold the pig iron, and he said, "Yes?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At first he denied it, and then he admitted it—I said, "Did he pay you for it?"—I had a previous knowledge that he had sold it—if he had said he had paid him, and had handed the money, I should not have been satisfied.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I rent the Vicarage farm at Heston—about 1 o'clock in the morning of 17th April I was disturbed from my sleep, went to my farm, and found that the whole of the barns and stacks were on fire—there was a very large quantity of straw, wheat, oats, hay, and other things—the sheds were also burnt, containing the whole of the machinery—the premises were all in a blaze; there was an immense light—the fire was not out for a week or ten days, but it was got under about 6 o'clock in the morning—the sheds were burnt down, and property destroyed to the value of 1,2002. at least—a very large barn was burnt down, and a lot of sheds adjoining—they were obliged to pull down the sheds at the back of the cot<lb/>tage where May lives or it would have been all burnt, and the stack yard in front of the cottage as well—I know nothing of the prisoner; he is a perfect stranger to me.</p>

I am the wife of Jonathan May, Mr. Brevington's bailiff I live on the farm at Heston—on Sunday evening, 16th April, between 7 and 8 o'clock, I saw the prisoner on the premises, standing against the bare, talking to an Irishwoman that lodged there—he asked her where did the master live, and where was the foreman—she directed him to Mr. Brevington's house—I asked him who he wanted, and told him if he wanted anything, if he came to me I would give him information—he said he wanted a night's lodging—I said, "We are not allowed to let any one sleep on the premises, and if you take leave you are liable to be taken up"—he said he did not care a d—about the policeman, and turning round to me he said, "And you can't tell how soon you may want a night's lodging yourself; you are born, but you are not buried; you won't five for ever"—I was very much alarmed at his manner; he held up his hand in a threatening manner, and told me not to forget what he had been saying—his manner made me think he meant something more than he said, and I was alone on the place at the time—he went away threatening me, as far as I could see him, with the same words, "You wont live for ever; don't forget what I say, you may want a night's lodging yourself, and you cannot tell how soon—he kept repeating those words as far as I could see him, and then I heard some one say to him, "Come on," and I lost sight of him—about half past 11 o'clock that night we were awoke by a policeman telling us that the premises were on fire—the barn was burning; the stack of straw and the wood stack was all in flames, and were ail burnt down—between five and six o'clock next morning I saw the prisoner coming from the direction he had gone in on the Sunday evening; he was just going past the gate—Mr. Brevington lives about a quarter of a mile from the place.</p>

On Saturday night, 29th April, I was the last person up, the house was all fastened up—I went into all the rooms about twenty minutes or half past 12 o'clock, I saw them all perfectly safe—I went into the back drawing room—the window was shut—it was not fastened but closed—there was a flower stand in front of one window, and the windows were down—about 20 minutes past 4 o'clock, I was rung up by the policeman; I went in to the back drawing room, I found the window open, and three boxes of cigars, and a great coat of mine lying against the window on the floor—my coat had been, on the night before, on the back of a chair at the further side of the same room, and the boxes of cigars had been on the flower stand, against another window in that room—I came down and found the back door open which led into the yard—it had been opened from the inside—any one getting in by the draw<lb/>ing room window could come down and open that door—I went into the bar, and found one of the tills had been forced open, and the drawers had all been opened—we missed about 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money—I think four or five shil<lb/>lings, three 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces, and two sixpences—we always leave the same amount in the till—after we came back from the station, I found three halfpence on the floor; the till had been locked, and the key taken up stairs—the draw<lb/>ing room window opens to a balcony over the back yard—any one could get to that balcony; if they came along a wall from a mews, they would have no difficulty in getting on—there are some wooden rails on the top of the wall—en active man no doubt could get over them, though they are rather high, and then walk along the wall—I lost some screws of tobacco which had been in a drawer in the bar—I missed all the cheroots there were—hey were rather curious, and were wrapped in a piece of paper in the bar parlour—I have seen them since—they were amongst those which were found on the prisoner.</p>

I was coming out of my house on that Sunday morning at a quarter past 4 o'clock, to fetch some water—I saw the prisoner getting down from the rails at the back of the premises—I have since shown those rails to Mr. Ratcliffe—a person on those rails could get to Mr. Ratcliffe's balcony very easily by going along the wall that the rails are on—when the prisoner was coming down from the rails I spoke to him, and asked what business he had there—he asked me what business it was to me—he drew a few paces back, and he turned round and asked me if I was going back—I said no, I thought he was a thief, and I would not leave him—he put his hand in his breast and said, "I will give you something:" but he pulled nothing out—lie then went to Gloucester-street, and turned to the left; and when he got opposite Mr. Ratcliffe's, he pulled out a handkerchief and some cigars, and 1 saw him throw them down in the kennel opposite Mr. Ratcliffe's—he then ran sway—I ran after him—he ran to the second lamp post, about fifty yards, and there he threw away a crowbar and some more cigars—he still ran on to Dorset-square—I still ran, and kept calling, "Stop thief!" the policeman came across the square, and took him—I had never lost sight of him—I was within fifteen yards of him the whole time—we took him back to Gloucester-street; we found this instrument before we got there—I believe the words the prisoner used to me were, "I will pay you the first opportunity."</p>

He is called Jacob Isaacs, after my father—it is common in our community for the son to bear a different name to his father—my name is Isaacs; my father's name was Jacobs; my son's name is Jacob Isaacs—that is a common thing amongst the Jews—I was present with my wife when a conversation took place between Mr. Pavey and her—this day fortnight, when I came home from business, I saw Mr. Pavey for the first time—when I came home my wife was crying—I heard Mr. Pavey say there was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the purse, and he wanted to lay 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with my other son that it was so—Mr. Koffman said in the deposi<lb/>tion there was 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and Mr. Pavey offered to bet 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to half a crown that it was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I heard him say if he had the money he would go out of the country, to Wales—I heard him say that he would go into Wales if he could get 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the White Hart, in Leman-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Thompson's Cottage, Poplar; I am a mast and blockmaker, in the present service of Messrs. Dunbar. I had been previously in the service of Mr. Mayer, the shipbuilder—I know the de<lb/>fendant, he was in Mr. Mayer's employ as chief draughtsman, and is so now as far as I can tell—about four months ago I lent him a book of prices worked for by the majority of the trade—I had only applied to him for it once before to my knowledge, that was four or five days before 11th April; his answer was, "Send your foreman and you shall have your book, and I feel very much obliged to you for the loan of it," referring to my late fore<lb/>man—on 11th April, hearing that the defendant was on board the <hi rend="italic">Adding<lb/>ton</hi>, which was lying in the East India Docks, I went to the vessel and ascended the ladder reaching from the quay or wharf of the dock to the vessel, and when I had got my head sufficiently over the deck I could not see Mr. Waterman; and while I was hesitating whether I should go on board to see if he was down in the hold, or whether I should go ashore again, Mr. Waterman lifted his head up, he having had occasion to point out some work to a man named Miller, and was hid from my sight—when I saw him, I descended the short ladder from the bulwark to the deck, and waited till he was disengaged, when he came to me—he spoke to me first, and in the most pointed manner said, "What do you do here?"—I said, "I want my book, if you please"—his answer to that was, "Go on shore, go on shore," in the most peremptory manner—I did not offer to go on shore, and he called to his assistant, a person named Miller, who I before men<lb/>tioned—he said, "Miller, put this man on shore;" Miller said, to the best of my belief, "The main is quite capable of walking on shore himself"—the defendant then twice ordered him to go and fetch a policeman, and he left the vessel—while this conversation was taking place, the defendant was standing on an elevated position, two feet high; on a piece of timber, per<lb/>haps not more than six feet from where I was standing, perhaps not quite so far as you are from me—when Miller had left, the defendant began to apply very abusive epithets to me; I can really assure the Court that I am not able to give the exact language—he called me a b—r, and damn his eyes, if he would not do something to me, and all that sort of disgusting language; I had a pretty good share of it—my answer to that was, "It seems to be your object, Sir, to frighten people, but you will not intimidate me"—with that he became more excited, and made a spring at me from the piece of timber he was standing on, and aimed a blow at some part of my face, with his clenched fist, I believe; but I partly warded it off—his fist touched me by the mouth sufficient to draw blood, and that was all—he then sprang back and seized at a caulker's mallet, which is a piece of lignum vitae about twelve inches in length, and two inches or two inches and a half in diameter, with two thick iron ferules at each end of the head—it was in a man's hand; the man held it very tightly, and he was unable to obtain it, and sprang to another which was rove through the ring of the caulking box, and not being able to extricate it, he seized this adze (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which was lying alongside on the deck—I believe he made a blow at the lower part of my person; I cannot speak to that positively, but I know he had it in this form (<hi rend="italic">holding it at arms length over his head</hi>)—he then made a second blow in this manner (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—I believe he aimed at my head, but while he was holding it up, I sprang forward to seize some part of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185405080095"/>
               <p>handle, or his person; I cannot say what part, but just as the adze was in the act of coming down, he was seized violently by the waist by the wit<lb/>ness Coombe, who drew him violently back, and from my seizing the handle it swung round like that, and struck me below the knee—the result was that it drew blood, and laid me by from my employment spine two or three days—when he had done that he swooned away on Coombe's knee—he appeared in a state of very great excitement and passion—I had not said or done the least thing to provoke him in any way—I have not said all that passed, but all that I should like to be on my oath of—I went ashore and so did the defendant, a few minutes afterwards—when he came ashore he looked at me, and, to the best of my belief, made use of some of his former bad language—there was a stage round the vessel where some of the riveters were at work, and there being a similar hammer to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), the handle of which was lying over the stage in this form, he made a spring at it, but being unsuccessful he did so again, and when he had got it he held it over his head, and said, "Now, you b—r," and he said he would beat my b—y brains out—I believe the hammer was coming down, and I should have got it on my head if I had not sprung back—two officers came up, and he said to one of them who was remonstrating with him on the im<lb/>propriety of using such weapons, "If you do not stand back I. will serve you in the same way;" and he said to me, "If I had a loaded pistol, I should think no more of shooting your b—y brains out than that," heaving the gravel up with his feet.</p>

I was at work on the <hi rend="italic">Addington</hi>, on 11th April, in Mr. Mayer's employment—we are situated so that we work for anybody now and then—I recollect Mr. Winn coming on board the <hi rend="italic">Addington</hi> on 11th April, and asking Mr. Waterman for a book—Mr. Waterman said, "Go ashore"—Mr. Winn said, "If you will give me my book I will go ashore"—after that Mr. Waterman was standing on an elevated bit of wood, above Mr. Winn, and he jumped down, and said, "If it was not for making a blackguard of myself I would knock your b—y brains out"—after that Mr. Winn said, "Give me my book, I will go ashore again"—Mr. Waterman said to Mr. Miller, "Go for a policeman, and take this man ashore;" and Mr. Miller went away directly, over the side, and after that the defendant turned to my mate, who was working on one side, and made a snatch to get his mallet out of his hand, but he held it tight, and he then turned to get my mallet—I kept it away from him—he then took up an adze, which was lying on the gunwale of the boat, and swung it this way (<hi rend="italic">over his head</hi>), and then he had it in the act of coming down on Winn's head, who was in front of him, and the words he made use of were, "I will cut the b—r down"—I <hi rend="italic">catched</hi> him by the arm, put my left arm round his waist, and by the jerk of my arm the adze fell on Mr. Winn's knee—I laid the prisoner on my knee, and he shed tears a bit, and then went off into a fainting state—(the axe went round, and fell just below his knee)—he remained in that state two or three minutes—when he came to, I said, "What a pity it is, Sir, that you let your temper overtake you in this manner; some of these days you will do some<lb/>body an injury, and you will be hung for it"—he said, "Let me go," and of course I let him go, and he looked over the side, and saw Mr. Winn standing there—he got up, ran down the ladder, swearing and blaspheming most awfully—there is a stage there, where the riveters were riveting the side of the ship; a hammer laid on the stage, and he made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at it, and said, "I will knock the b—r's brains out;" but the officer stopped him, and I believe he dropped the hammer—after the dock officer had got hold of him he said, "I wish I had a pistol, I would think no more of blowing your b—y brains out than I would of that," and he kicked the dust in front of him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were there two policemen present? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two dock officers; Mr. Dougal and Mr. Smith, I think—they are here—the defendant was on my knee for two or three minutes—this happened about five minutes to 9 o'clock, as near as I can say—I had began work a little after 6 o'clock</p>

               <p>in the morning—I have not been frequently employed by Mr. Mayer as a caulker—I had not worked for him for three yean—I knew Mr. Waterman by being in and out of the yard; he has been shown to me—I cannot say what time he came to the vessel to superintend; it was after we had had our breakfast on board; that was about half past 8 or twenty minutes to 9 o'clock—there were a great quantity of men and boys too, at work on board—I suppose the work was being done rapidly in order to get the vessel ready for sea, but I am very little judge of anybody's work but my own—I did not notice "No person admitted except on business" affixed to the vessel, but it generally is on all vessels lying in the docks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of the East India Docks. I am not a sworn officer—I was near the <hi rend="italic">Addington</hi> when Mr. Winn and Mr. Water-man were there—I saw a mob of people collected round—I went up, which I thought it was my duty to do, and saw Mr. Waterman with a hammer in his hand, in this way, and he said to Winn, "If you do not mind I will knock your b—y brains out"—he said to me, "Stand away, or I will knock your brains out as soon as I will his"—I asked the prosecutor if he had any business in the docks, and he told me that he came to see Mr. Waterman; I told him that if he wanted to see Mr. Waterman, he had better apply another way, and not create a disturbance in the docks—I did not hear what had happened on board the vessel—I did not take hold of him, nor did anybody that I am aware of—there might be sixty or eighty people collected around—the defendant said that if he had a pistol, he should no more mind blowing Winn's brains out than he should laying the hammer down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he lay the hammer down when he said that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he laid the hammer down on the stage—some of the crowd were workmen; they seemed to consist of working people—the crowd was not above thirty or forty yards from where I was stationed; I saw it, and went up and interposed—I advised Mr. Winn to go out of the docks, and if he wanted revenge to apply for a summons—I have never seen a notice on the vessel since I have been there of "Nobody admitted except on business," but I never went on board—it depends on circumstances whether persons who are not engaged, are allowed on board when a vessel is repairing—Mr. Winn said he had business, he wanted to see Mr. Waterman—I did not hear him say that—I do not wear a police dress—Miller did not come to me; he went out to fetch one of the Metropolitan police.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. The prosecutor left a mes<lb/>sage at my house, and I went next day and examined his leg—the skin was abraded at one part, and there was an effusion of blood under the skin at another; it appeared to me that there had been a slight effusion of blood—he remained in, two or three days in consequence, but I had no occasion to attend him—there was no serious injury done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been in the profession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have been in practice nine years—I saw him the day after the blow, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon—I did nothing to it, for if there had been a wound there it was dry at the time—I have been regularly educated as a surgeon—I did not make such a close examination of this blow as I should have if I had known what would happen about it—I can say that I saw the cuticle rubbed up, and from the state of the part I should say that there had been a slight oozing—it was what is called an abrasion of the cuticle—we have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185405080098"/>
               <p>two expressions, the cuticle and the cutis; this was an ordinary abrasion of the cuticle—if the cuticle is abraded the true skin is exposed—the cuticle is the scarf skin; the next skin to that is the true skin, the <hi rend="italic">cutis</hi>—all there was, was an abrasion of the cuticle so as to expose the true skin to view—next to the cutis is the flesh, the cellular tissue; in fact the true skin consists of cellular fibres—I know what the cellular membrane is—there is cellular tissue under the cutis—there may or may not be cellular tissue under the cutis; cellular tissue pervades almost every part of the body—cellular membrane is not an expression we commonly make use of; I know what cellular mem<lb/>brane is, it is a thin tissue—I did not see what you call the cellular mem<lb/>brane, not if you mean that structure which lies beneath the true skin—there was an abrasion of the cuticle only; there was no damage to the cutis, it was simply exposed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> We will drop the cuticle and cutis at present, and talk about what we understand. What do you call the skin of a man? the outer covering of the flesh, I suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; if blood comes from any part of the body, that indicates that the cuticle has been penetrated—but it depends on the sense you attach to the word "penetrated"—blood comes from the true skin, and not from the cuticle, which is insensible—unless the <hi rend="italic">cutis</hi> had been penetrated, there could not have been blood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chair maker, of No. 84, Curtain-road, Shore<lb/>ditch.

               <p>instructed Mr. Dunbedine to issue a writ against him on 4th March—I had waited till then, because he kept continually making excuses—there was frosty weather after Christmas, and he said that the horses could not stand, which I thought was a very feasible excuse—it lasted about a fortnight—I have had other wood from Westrop since 22nd Dec.; that was walnut tree wood—I had two planks on 24th Jan.—the price of the whole of it was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was not to come off the account, or to interfere with the other wood at all; he said that—it was to be a new purchase, and he had to take a bill of my acceptance; he never got it, because I have never had any more to make up the load, and he has never applied for it—the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth was part of an unlimited quantity—I was to have any quantity I wanted, and when I got as much as would suit me, I was to give him a bill—there was no amount mentioned by him that I was to go up to, nor any specified time—there was no date mentioned for the bill—he did not offer me some of Mr. Gordon's wood, or any other wood—he did not tell me I might take as much of the walnut wood in his yard as I liked; nor did I say, "No; I will not take any more of that; I will wait for the wood from Isleworth"—I will swear that.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever use these words in April to any one, "It is gone too far, it cannot be stopped now; if I cannot get anything out of the civil law, I will go to the criminal law?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never did—I believe it was on 22nd or 23rd April that I gave directions to the police officer to take him into custody—I instigated that idea myself—on 21st April I went down to Mr. Chitty's place, and saw him—I asked him if the wood was Mr. Westrop's; he said, "No," and that he had no power to sell it—I asked him if there had been a wagon there on the 22nd; he said, "No," and that it was not his wood—Mr. Westrop had told me that it was to be his, but it was on condition that not one bit of the wood was to be removed till the money was paid—I gave him into custody, because I considered that he had obtained it by false pretences—if I had known it before, I should have given him into custody before—I did not go into the matter with Mr. Chitty of how much had been paid; I asked him, on 21st Dec, if that wood was his for sale, and he told me "No," that he had paid 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit, and that was all, he told me: I did not want to go any further into his business—I men<lb/>tioned to a dozen persons, I dare say, that Mr. Westrop had obtained a bill of me; none of them are hero—I do not suppose it would take above ten or fifteen minutes to measure a load of timber, 600 cubic feet; it depends upon who measures it—I dare say a load of timber would weigh a ton and a half.</p>

Daley is a goddaughter of mine, and I know her sister—I do not know M'Carthy; I saw him once on the Sunday evening after Daley had come to my house with two other females, at two o'clock on Sunday morning—I saw no men with her—one of the girls was Mary Ann Harvey; Daley did not say anything to me about her—neither Daley or McCarthy said anything to me about the girl—Daley left about 9 o'clock on Monday morning, leaving the girl Harvey with me—when they came on the Sunday morning, I got up to let my goddaughter in—she said that her mother and herself had had a few words—I said I would go and ask her mother; she said that it was pouring with rain, and I could not go—she asked me if she might have the candle to go down stairs; I said "Yes," and she went and brought the other two females up—having been seven years in the house, I did not like to disturb the people in the house, and I said, "We will all go to-morrow"—on Sunday morning I got up at 7 o'clock and went to Church; when I came home I found the girls sitting before the fire—after breakfast I went out with my basket, and when I came home I found M'Carthy and the girls having tea—M'Carthy stayed about a quarter of an hour—next morning, when I got up, my goddaughter asked me when I was coming back; I said, "About twelve o'clock"—I never saw her again, but when I came home I found Mary Ann Harvey left behind—I asked if she would go into the Park, and she said she would rather <hi rend="italic">bide</hi> at my place—I locked her in, because I am a poor woman and did not know her character; I thought she might be bad enough to take my little <hi rend="italic">bit of</hi> clothes—she remained with me till the Wednesday evening—I told her I was a very poor woman, and only had my basket to depend upon</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the prosecutor. I know these four volumes of "British Mollusca"—I wrote in this one "W. L. Carpenter," as a memorandum that they belonged to Dr. W. L. Carpenter—I saw them safe on Friday morning, 28th April: I missed volumes 3 and 4 about half past 9 o'clock that morning; volumes 1 and 2 were there then, but I missed them about 20 minutes afterwards—about half past 9 or 25 minutes to 10 o'clock, the prisoner Clamp came and asked me for a book, called "Domestic Scenes in Greenland and Iceland;" he was very near the books—I had missed volumes 3 and 4 then, but two men who I cannot recognise had been in before that, and were near the books—directly Clamp left I missed volumes 1 and 2; about eight days afterwards I saw him in custody and recognised him—I had not known him before.</p>

On 28th April, I went to Mr. Van Voorst's about half past 9 o'clock in the morning—when I went in I saw Clamp, who I have known for a long time, and can swear to him—he had a large bag—there was another man with him; they left before me, and about an hour afterwards I heard of this, and was asked if I knew who had been in the shop—I instantly said that I knew one of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk, living at 9, King-street, Grosvenor-square—on Tuesday, 18th April, I went to Greenwich fair, between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening—as I was going away from the fair I felt a pull at my guard; it was a cotton guard—there was a watch at the end of it, in my waistcoat pocket—I put my hand to my waistcoat pocket, and found my watch was gone—I saw the prisoner before me; he was going away from me—when I first saw him, he was about three or four paces off—two people closed in, the moment I <hi rend="italic">catched</hi> my eyes upon it, between him and me—as soon as I missed my watch, I saw the prisoner going away from me, and went behind him, and saw my watch in his left hand—I laid hold of him by his neck-handkerchief, and with my right hand tried to catch hold of his left hand—he put both his hands together, and the watch went into the right hand—he passed it—I caught hold of both his hands with my right hand, and he dropped the watch—I had a friend with me; he came up at the same minute and laid hold of the prisoner, and I picked up my watch; it was at the prisoner's feet—I said "You have stolen my watch!"—he said he hoped I would let him go, as he had a wife and two children—he tried to get away, but my friend laid hold of him, and kept him till the officer came up and took him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a mechanical draughtsman, of Park-lane, Peckham. In the summer of last year I was employed by the defendant to make the drawing of a rag mill for Mr. Brownhead, and also the pattern of a knife—I charged him 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the two: he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I tendered him the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change—he said I was entitled to it, and told me to keep it—the other drawing was to show the operation of the knives in passing through the mill.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, of Union-street, Borough. In October last, I had a trial at Kingston Sessions—I had at that lime worked with Mr. Brownhead—he was in my debt—I know Onions, he attended at Kingston, at my request, in the business I was there upon—I believe his wife went down with him—I think he was there four days—he went down to answer to my character—it was upon a false charge of exposing myself, and I was acquitted—I did not borrow any money of him, whilst I was at Kingston, nor did I receive any money of him whatever; but one day I desired him to pay some of my witnesses, as they were going some distance, and he told me he had paid them 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have not paid him the money again, as he has made no application for it—I cannot say who paid his expenses while he was there—I did not authorize him to charge 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or any other sum, nor to tell Mr. Brownhead to charge it against me, in my account; nothing of the kind happened between us—I remember seeding in my</p>

The prisoner is my granddaughter—I was staying at her husband's house on 15th April—she came into my bedroom about 8 o'clock on that morning, and said she was going out to chapel—I did not notice anything particular about her then, but on the night before she com<lb/>plained much of her head—her brother was present, and she put her hand on her head, and said she felt bad in her head—about 9 o'clock I heard the servant scream out—I went up stairs, and found the child in a basin of water.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, living at Camberwell; the prisoner's husband is a tenant of mine. On 15th April, about 11 o'clock, I was called by Dr. Clunie to the prisoner's house, and saw her there—she said she had drowned her child—(the child was up stairs then)—I asked her what for,</p>

               <p>but she would not give any reason, only that she thought that it would be better off to be in heaven—she appeared quite beside herself, in a state of madness, and said that some persons, pointing over her shoulder, persuaded her to drown the child, and that she said, "No, I cannot do it;" and they said, "You must do it"—her husband was there at the time.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq., M. D. I live at Southampton-street, Camberwell. The prisoner has been a patient of mine for about seven months—on 15th April, about 11 o'clock, I was brought to her husband's house, and saw the deceased child, which in my opinion had been killed by drowning—the mo<lb/>ment the prisoner saw me she exclaimed that she had drowned her child—I asked her why she did it; she said that it had been so neglected, and that voices were continually crying to her that she ought to drown it, and that when she attempted to do so, other voices cried out, that she knew she ought to do it, but that she was too great a coward, and with that she drowned the child; put it into a pail of water—my opinion is that she was quite insane at the time—I have frequently before observed symptoms of insanity in her conduct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe she was very kind to the child, according to your observation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very kind—it is quite a delusion of her's that it was neglected—she appeared also to be labouring under some strong reli<lb/>gious feeling; she told me she thought she was eternally lost, and when she attempted to pray, innumerable voices told her that they could call upon the name of Christ as well as she, but that she was lost, and it was of no use for her to do so—she is a Roman Catholic.</p>

I know the prisoner, she is the wife of my son Charles Samuel Tucker—they had a little girl, four months and a few days old—on Saturday night, 8th April, I was very poorly, and my son gave me an asylum in his house; I went to bed at 8 o'clock—the little girl, whose name was Catherine Sarah, was then in her mother's arms, and in very good health—the prisoner appeared sober—I had seen her husband go out, and heard him tell her she was not to go out, only to buy two or three things—I went to sleep, and was awakened by a great noise in the house—I partly dressed myself, went down stairs, and saw the prisoner lying on the mat, and a policeman and several people outside the door—I spoke to the prisoner, but she made no answer; I said, "Emma, where is your baby?" a woman in the passage said, "The baby is outside, in a woman's arms"—it was after<lb/>wards given to me by some one, and I took it up to bed, leaving the prisoner on the mat at the foot of the stairs; she seemed to be asleep, but I suppose that was from liquor; I did not perceive she had been drinking—my son came home about three quarters of an hour afterwards—I heard him say to his wife, "What are you doing there, go up stairs"—I did not hear what she said in reply—about twenty minutes after that I was called into the room, and found the prisoner there—my son said the baby was very ill, and he thought it would die, and begged me to fetch a doctor—I took the baby to Mr. Roberts, and had it on my lap while he examined it—I have never heard the prisoner threaten the baby; when she was sober she was very fond of it.</p>

I am a doctor of medicine, surgeon and apothecary, of 40, Bridge-street, Borough,—on this Sunday morning, about 10 minutes to 3 o'clock, the child was brought to me by Mrs. Tucker—it was in a state of collapse; I found a swelling on the right side of its head with discolo<lb/>ration of the skin extending from the right to the left side—it died in about three quarters of an hour; in my opinion, from concussion of the brain—a blow on the side of the head of a child of those tender years would be sufficient to account for the concussion of the brain—if it had fallen out of its mother's arms it might have received such a blow as I saw; or if the mother and child had fallen together and it same in contact with any blunt object, it might produce it.</p>

I remember leaving the Crystal Palace on Tuesday, 25th April, it was about 7 o'clock—I came out of the gate near Sydenham, near the pump—when I got to the visitor's gate, I saw Giardelli and Bianchi—Bianchi said to me, "How do you do, it is a very long time since I have seen you?"—I said, "What brought you up here?"—he said, "I came up for a <hi rend="italic">spree"</hi>—Giardelli was with him then—I said, "It is too late for you to come for a <hi rend="italic">spree"</hi>—we had a pot of beer at the White Swan—there were four of us that drank the beer—one was Giardelli—we had nothing more than that pot of beer in the White Swan—when we came out of the White Swan, we went towards another public house lower down—we had some beer to drink at the second house—I do not know how much—I did not taste it—I was quite sober—after we left the second house, I did not observe anything in Giardelli's manner that attracted my attention—he was very steady at that time—we went towards the Annerley station—that is where I lodge—it is the next station towards Croydon, from Sydenham—when I passed the Victoria Hotel, Giardelli began to skip about, and began to ask me for my son—I said he was gone home to have his supper—it was past 9 o'clock, and it was very dark—Giardelli left my</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at No. 4, St. Andrew's-terrace, Waterloo-road. I am unfortunate—that house is not mine; I have one room in it—I had the key of it from the landlady, Mrs. Rackham, but I never took the key out with me—I came home about half past 2 o'clock in the morning on 8th April—I had gone out about 10 o'clock—when I returned to the house I found the street door open—other young women lodge in the house—the street door shuts, and if you pull a string which is outside you can get in—I don't know whether there is a lock—when I got into the passage I heard a rustling of some one coming down stairs—my room is the top room on the second floor back—I called my landlady to give me some Lucifer's; she gave me some—I struck a light and went to where I had put my key, and I found it there under the carpet and hearth rug, which are in the passage—I lit another Lucifer, and saw that the door of my room was open—I went into the room to look for the candle, which was removed, and I saw that my bonnet was removed—I looked in a box, and I saw my boots, hair brush, comb, and some other things, wrapped in an old petticoat, and my dress wag gone out of the box—I had left my candle on the wash-hand stand—the candle had just been blown out; I could tell that by the redness of the wick—I looked under the bed, and saw the prisoner there with my clothes on—I had to drag her out by myself; nobody helped me—I said, "You cruel creature, you have robbed me"—she said, "Don't call a policeman, and I will tell you who <hi rend="italic">put me</hi> on to your room"—I told her I would let her go if she would tell me who <hi rend="italic">put her on</hi> to my room, but she could not tell me any one—we had a hard struggle, and I called out—she took up a knife from a table close by her, and said if I did not let her take the clothes off before any one came she would stick it into me—she had got my silk dress pinned round her, a shirt, and a flannel shirt and a pair of drawers tied round her under the silk dress—she was dressed, and she had her bonnet and shawl on ready to go out—we struggled very hard—my landlady came in ten minutes, and she saw the prisoner take the flannel shirt and the shirt over her head—after that the prisoner went down—I could not help it; she was too strong for me—she went down and called for the police; three policemen came—the landlady had called the police before, and when the prisoner got to the door there was a policeman there—the prisoner wanted to give me in charge for an assault, and I told the police I would give her in charge for a robbery—one of the policemen brought her up stairs and saw my room—she wanted to go away then—this cotton shirt was torn down by the prisoner struggling—all the things were taken off her before she went down for the policeman—there</p>

I was a police constable, but I have left the force—I was called to the house in St. Andrew's-terrace, and saw the prisoner out<lb/>side the house; she said she would give the prosecutrix into custody for assaulting her—I took her to the prosecutrix, who was inside the passage, and she said she had robbed her—I took her in charge—the prosecutrix's hands were bleeding from a cut with some sharp instrument, and the prisoner was bleeding from both face and hands—I went up stairs and found the room in confusion—these things were on the floor—this cotton shirt is tied together, and this flannel shirt is tied together—these boots, bonnet, and dress I took, and the magistrate allowed the prosecutrix to have them—when I went in the room they were on the floor; they were given to me from the floor—the prisoner said she had been taken there by the prosecutrix, and I think she said she was drunk when she was taken there.</p>
