               <p>The indictment was opened by Mr. Sheppard. And Mr. Rous of council for the prosecution opened the case as follows.</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury; you have heard the indictment opened by my learned friend, and are acquainted with the crime on which the prisoner stands charged. This transaction arises out of a festivity observed by the people called Jews, at a particular period of the year; and the rulers of the synagogue have thought it their duty to bring the case before you for your judgment; it will not be expected from me to aggravate the unfortunate situation of the prisoner, I shall think it my duty only to state the case so fair and so simply as to direct your attention to the evidence on which alone I am sure your judgment will be founded: The Jews have an annual festivity religiously observed on their part, some time in the month of October; the prisoner lives in the neighbourhood, where that festivity creates necessarily some little disorder, he has lived there I believe twenty years, and has been constantly a witness of the return of it. In this festivity some persons unquestionably had exceeded the strict bounds of propriety, squibs and crackers had been thrown, and it seems Mr. Ridout in this last month on the last return of that festivity endeavoured to apprehend some persons who had fired those squibs, in doing so a little scuffle ensued, several fell, and among others Mr. Ridout, they arose however from the ground seemingly without injury, and Mr. Ridout returned to his house and shut the door; some few minutes afterwards he appeared at the window of the room on the first floor, and from thence discharged a gun loaded with shot among the crowd, several were wounded and some fell; and one unfortunate youth of the age of thirteen instantly expired: you will hear the law much more accurately delivered from the learned Judge after you are possessed of the evidence, and therefore can with more correctness apply it; it is however my duty just to observe, that it is not necessary to constitute the crime of murder that there should be a malignity directed against an individual; if a man commits an act from which death may ensue, which from the nature of it marks a wanton disregard of the safety of others, that is equally immoral, and the public safety requires it should be classed in an equal degree of guilt with the premeditated destruction of an individual; I fear it will be difficult for the prisoner to extenuate this case: some expressions will be given in evidence that seemed to shew a deliberate purpose of longer duration than the day; but as these expressions ought not to make any impression upon your mind till you have them in proof, I shall not mention them, but wish you to hear them only from the witnesses.</p>

               <p>I believe I must desire you will explain that expression as usual? - As they do among our people once a year, that is at the feast of Tabernacles, and I stood there a little time to see them.</p>
               <p>Is this a customary annual sport? - Yes, I was standing in Broad-place, I saw Mr. Ridout come out of his house with two men with him, one had a staff and the other had not, I could not tell whether they were constables or not, I saw Mr. Ridout go and lay hold of a man that had just let off a squib, after he had laid hold of this man he called for these two men to assist him, and a scuffle ensued, and three of them laid on the ground, one of which was Mr. Ridout, I saw the two men get up first, and afterwards Mr. Ridout, I saw him go strait into his house and shut the door hard after him; in three or four minutes after I saw him up one pair of stairs throw up the sash and fire out a fire-arm which appeared to me to be a blunderbuss.</p>
               <p>How was the gun directed? - Towards the middle of Duke's-place Broad-place.</p>

               <p>There was a good deal of noise, I take it, by the two men that were down on the ground; you mean the two men that came out of the house? - I cannot say they were, I did not take notice what two men they were, but among the three one of them was Mr. Ridout.</p>

               <p>Who told you? - He is a man that deals in fish.</p>
               <p>You will not tell his name? - I cannot tell you.</p>
               <p>Where was it? - In the synagogue entry in Leadenhall-street.</p>
               <p>Where did you go immediately? - A man came and run out, and said, the report is given, that a boy and two men are killed, upon which we run to Duke's-place.</p>
               <p>Where did you go immediately with this man that gave you the intelligence? - I did not see him after he gave the intelligence, I run immediately into Duke's-place.</p>
               <p>Had you much conversation with any body before you went to the Coroner? - No, Sir, I did not tell any body to my knowledge, before I came into the room at the Compter, where Mr. Ridout was; I might say before I went up, I heard him say so and so before.</p>
               <p>Did you listen to the report as it was made by any body; and had you much conversation on this melancholy affair, before you were induced to go before the Coroner? - I had not with any body.</p>
               <p>And yet you went before the Coroner? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What the same Levy, you appeared for on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200007"/> Monday before the Recorder, to give evidence of an assault, which assault was contradicted by three witnesses I think? - It was the neglect of the Council, for not calling Mr. Levy up, or else he would have proved his assault.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rous. Who directed you to attend before the Coroner? - I attended entirely on my own account.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did not you take the constable away with you at that time, when you expected a riot? - I do not tell you I expected a riot or disturbance.</p>
               <p>Did not you swear so before the Coroner? - No, Sir, I said upon Mr. Ridout's words, and seeing him stand at his door, I resolved that I would not be seen in any quarrel whatever.</p>

               <p>Thinking that there would be a disturbance at three o'clock, you desired the constable of Duke's Place, Levy, to go along with you? - I desired him to go along with me, I expected no more disturbance than there was every year, I thought nothing of the constables being there to prevent disturbances, he is the constable of Duke's Place, I was not to order Levy to be there.</p>
               <p>He is the same man that you appeared for last Monday? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What did you observe about the body? - They told me he had been shot, and I observed several small wounds about the body, but they were so small I could not introduce a probe, in the cavity of the breast, on the right side we found a quantity of blood and small shot.</p>
               <p>Did you find any other wounds? - There were several other wounds, but I believe his death was occasioned by that, it occasioned a large effusion of blood which I believe was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>What shot was this? - Such shot as they clean bottles with, these are the same size.</p>
               <p>(Producing some bottle shot.)</p>

               <p>What was the state of his health at that time? - He had several bruises about him, I was desired to call at the Compter to look at him, he had two at the top of his head, and what they call a black eye, a settling of blood under his eye, as if there had been a contusion there, and a pretty considerable one upon his leg by his knee, and a large graze on his shin, and several marks upon his legs, and one particular upon his right leg, which was exceeding tender to the touch.</p>
               <p>Is not he afflicted with the gravel and stone very much? - He is afflicted with a violent pain in his back, whether it is rheumatism or the stone in his kidneys, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Long before this he had complained to you of it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then a man in that situation, thrown down and beat, could not lessen that pain I should suppose? - No, it could not, more likely to aggravate it, and I suppose it did, because when I saw him he could not sit upright, I never saw him so bad with it before.</p>

               <p>Did you at that time think there was danger by this multitude of people that were assembled? - I thought there was danger, it was a coffee-house called Tom's coffee-house; they sell wine and brandy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rous. This coffee-house is much resorted to by the Jews? - Yes, by all Jews in that neighbourhood, except Mr. Vaughan, another coffee-house keeper.</p>
               <p>Court. I think you say you saw Mr. Ridout thrown down? - Yes, I did, I saw him on the ground, and several people upon him, and Saunders was thrown down, and there was a Jew man upon him, one Isaacs that sells fish; I desired him to desist.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you thrown down? - No,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200010"/> I had my shins kicked, but I got out of the way as fast as I could.</p>
               <p>What was it you said of that wooden house that you named? - That was Hyam Joseph's near the pump, where they threw the serpents, that was a wood front, my back was towards Mr. Ridouts, that house was on the left hand side of Mr. Ridout's, near the synagogue.</p>
               <p>Jury. The Jury would be very glad to know after Mr. Ridout got up in the situation you describe him to be in, whether they assaulted his house after? - I never looked, my back was towards it.</p>
               <p>How long was you there after? - A very little while, a great many Jews persuaded me to go away for fear I should get an accident, they begged of me and took me by the arm and led me away, they behaved very well to me.</p>
               <p>- SAUNDERS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am constable, I remember Mr. Chapman's application to me, to take my long staff and go to this place, I went there, there were some hundred in the place, throwing squibs and crackers about, some of them hitting Mr. Ridout's house, then the Gentleman you examined last, says to me, the first man we see throw one, we will lay hold of him, immediately one was thrown very near us, we laid hold of the man, and several came to rescue him.</p>
               <p>Were they men or boys? - All men as it appeared in the front of them; we knew a man that threw a squib, and we let him go, then we went towards Mr. Ridout's house, and the mob followed us, and hissed us as we went along, and hooted; then Mr. Ridout spoke to us, he told us he would assist us, if we would lay hold of another, he came out and immediately another was thrown by another man about thirty years of age, a serpent was thrown, and we laid hold of him directly, a great number got round us to rescue him from us, in the skirmish they got Mr. Ridout down, there were several at the top of him I could not discern to see whether they struck him or not, and he had several marks on the legs as if he was kicked, when I helped him up, I fell down atop of the others, Mr. Ridout was down in the kennel.</p>
               <p>How long might he continue in this situation? - I believe about two minutes, and several were upon him.</p>
               <p>How long did you make observation of Mr. Ridout? - I helped him up, he told me he was almost killed, and he walked lame, they dragged him along a foot or two when he was down.</p>
               <p>Where did he go to? - Towards his own house, and several followed him immediately.</p>
               <p>In what manner did they follow him? - They were talking very loud, and looked very vicious at him, but what they said, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Were those people that followed him those that had him down in the kennel? - I cannot say, they followed him close up to the door, then he got into his house, and I heard the door shut very sharp, but the mob surrounded me that I could not follow Mr. Ridout.</p>
               <p>Were the numbers at this time diminished or increased? - They seemed rather to increase.</p>
               <p>Were serpents and crackers thrown at this time? - I did not see any thrown I think after that.</p>
               <p>What became of you; how did you escape? - When I found that Mr. Ridout had got to his own house, and I had lost Mr. Chapman, I was for getting away, but I could not, the mob was so thick, and for a couple of minutes I saw Mr. Ridout again, before ever the alarm of the piece was. When I lifted him up, he told me that he believed he was robbed, for his pockets were turned inside out.</p>

(Producing them.) I shut the door with the assistance of Mr. Ridout; when he came in doors, they broke two panes of glass in the glass door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rous. You was examined before the Coroner? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. We have a number of other witnesses to prove the throwing the squibs at Mr. Ridout's house, but as that has been proved by two or three witnesses, we will not trouble the Court with any more on that h ead.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester, Prisoner's Council. What is Nicholls? - He is a waterman, or pilot.</p>
               <p>He is employed by the Trinity-house? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>But he does look after the bomb-boats? - Yes, by his own authority, by an arbitrary power as I understand.</p>
               <p>You have instructions given you by the Trinity-house? - Yes, the articles specify something of them.</p>
               <p>You know the prisoner perfectly well? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When he found this cordage, he took the boat and you too to the Justice.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you present when they were taken? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. When the Justice had you and the cordage, he said this was taken, by your own confession, from the other side of the water, in Kent? - Yes, I hope no offence in my speaking amiss; the Justice ordered the man to go with me to Greenwich.</p>
               <p>Then you begged for favour? - I begged for none of him; I am a phthisical sort of a man, I could not follow the goods any longer.</p>
               <p>Court. What complaint did he make of you at the Justice's? - He made a complaint as such as this, he brought the goods and me before him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, it is not my duty to keep this up any longer.</p>
               <p>Court. There is only one reason for going on, do they mean to prosecute?</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. My Lord, this man has been used very ill, I will just ask another question; do you know Well Spring? - I cannot say I do.</p>
               <p>What conversation had you with Nicholls's wife yesterday? - She asked me what terms I would make it up upon; says I, I have nothing to say, do you come along with me to my lawyer, and talk to him about it; I said no more to her.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell her yesterday, that if he would pay your expences and loss of time, and give a note under his hand that he would not molest the bomb-boats, you would make it up? - I said no such thing.</p>
               <p>Have you been about to solicicit subscriptions among the boat-men? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Who pays the expences of this Prosecution? - My friends.</p>
               <p>Did not you apply to Argyle? - Not a word, no, Sir, I deny the words before God and man; before my Maker, that is over my head.</p>
               <p>Describe your friends? - Mr. Slade and Mr. Watts.</p>
               <p>Did not you and Mr. Slade go to Mr. Argyle, to desire him to subscribe to prosecute the prisoner? - My friends subscribed out of their own pocket, I cannot tell what has been subscribed.</p>
               <p>After you was released before the Justice, how soon was it before you indicted this man? - The Friday following, this happened on a Friday.</p>
               <p>Was he ever taken up before the indictment was preferred? - No.</p>
               <p>Was he ever charged with it? - No.</p>

               <p>On Tuesday the 28th of September, between eleven and twelve at night, my wife and me were abed, my wife awaked me and said, George, the window shutters are broke open; I got up and looked at the parlour window, it was an exceeding moon-light night, I saw two men pass by the parlour window, one tall, the other short, the shortest came and peeped in, I said to my wife, make yourself easy, they are thieves: I went to the parlour window, and looked sideways, and saw two men turn down the middle turning in the court into Hanway-street; I came back and put on my coat, I was very much flurried: when I came to the sash again, the man that I believe to be the prisoner at the bar, came with his face, as if he was going to rush into the parlour; I did make this imprecation, I said, damn you, you rascal, are you there again! I pursued him, he stopped and pretended to walk the other way, and he said, there he runs; I said, you are the villain: he and I cuffed one another a little, and a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200016"/> neighbour opened his street door, the man ran away, and I ran after him; I called watch all the way, but no assistance could I get: at the bottom of Hanover-yard, the watchman crossed upon him, in the road in Church-street, St. Giles's, we took him in a passage, and he cried out for mercy.</p>
               <p>Court. How did you find your windows and shutters? - The shutters were intirely wrenched out of their place, and hung by a bit of nail, and were both flung back, they were bolted in the evening, they were folding shutters with a middle bolt that runs across the middle stile of the shutters.</p>
               <p>Was the sash open? - No, I have a screw within side that screws it down.</p>
               <p>Were any of the panes broke? - One was.</p>
               <p>Had it been broke before? - Yes, the bed is in the parlour close by the window almost, when I went to the sash I looked sideways, I saw two men a second time turning into Hanover-yard.</p>
               <p>Court. If the sash was fast how could a man be attempting to get in? - It appeared to me that he was close to it, and with an intent to open it, he seemed to be exceedingly eager in the attempt to get close to it.</p>
               <p>Do you think that he was attempting to get in? - I do.</p>
               <p>Was that what you thought at the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. How far did he run from you? - From Hanover-yard I suppose half a quarter of a mile or more.</p>
               <p>When you came up to him what did he do? - He begged of the watchmen not to kill him, or something of that kind, and he would give himself up, we looked in Hanover-yard and in the court for some tools, but we found none, nor none upon him.</p>

               <p>Were any of your lodgers at home at that time? - All of them, I believe; I returned again, about a quarter after eight, and the street door was locked, I could not get in, I called to my lodger that lodged in the garret, and she came down and let me in, when I went in I found my door wide open, and the room in darkness, I called her back again to let me have a light, and the first thing I missed, was the watch from the mantle piece, I looked round the room, and found the bag of clothes was gone, nobody was in the room; in a short time my husband came home.</p>

               <p>You do not know how the outer door came locked? - No, the lodgers were all at home, two in the chambers, and one in the garret, my room was the lower room, the door just by the street door.</p>

               <p>Could that be done without making a noise sufficient to alarm the lodgers? - I do not know, the woman that lives in the chamber is hard of hearing, and the woman in the garret might not hear it, I was not long in the place before the officer came in the place, and asked me if I was not robbed.</p>

               <p>My Lord, on Saturday the 25th of last month, I had been to dine with some friends at Blackwall, and coming home in the evening in a hackney coach, with some of the gentlemen that had hired the coach in the day time, they took me to bring me home with them, I think it was between seven and eight, somewhere on this side of Limehouse Church, near the place that they call the bun-house; there came two people and opened one each coach door; there was a cutlass put in and held to my stomach, the point very close, and demanded my money and my watch; I told him I had no watch, no money; they swore that I had a watch, and that they would have it; my seals as I sat upon the seat were seen on my breeches, they said, damn you, you have a watch, and I will have it, and one of the prisoners came to my breeches, I thought to pick my pocket, I said, damn you, I have no watch, or something like that, and I put my hands to my watch and found my watch was safe; then immediately there was a snatch, and a cry of stop thief, and the men ran away; I got up to jump out, and was going to take out my watch to leave behind the seat, and I found my seals were gone, and part of the chain; I thought to run after them, but there was a wide ditch for me to get over, so wide that I thought it was very likely I should be in the middle instead of jumping over it; they got over, and I afterwards was sent for, and the next morning a person called for me, and shewed me my seals and a part of the chain of my watch.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was the person that came to you the next morning? - One of the people that apprehended them, I really forget his name, there were two or three of them came together, he has the chain and seals, and has kept them in his possession ever since; on Tuesday I was obliged to attend the Magistrate, Mr. Staples, at his office; the two prisoners at the bar were brought there, they asked me if I knew either of them; I told them no, I did not, neither do I; I have not the least recollection, they had something over their faces, what it was I cannot tell, I do not know that I particularly minded.</p>
               <p>Jury. Were they masked? - I did not observe the mask, the other gentlemen said, the man on my side had a crape, and they said the man on my side had a crape, but I was intent on my watch, I did not look much at the man.</p>

A. I think to the best of my recollection; the servant of the house found this cutlass the next morning, standing up in the corner; the prisoner Dodd was the man I stopped, the other prisoner passed me in the street, while I had hold of this man by the collar, he had got as I thought a stick, but it proved afterwards to be a cutlass; I saw him make several blows at the people, as he passed along.</p>

               <p>Was he searched? - Not at that time, he was searched at the Justice's.</p>

               <p>Give the Jury an account of what happened in your shop concerning these two men? - About the 20th of September last, these two gentlemen came into our shop, and they asked me, if the gentleman was within, I said no, and the tall one said I am sorry for it; I said is it any thing very particular; he said no, he wanted some glass; I told him, if agreeable, I could serve him; he said very well, they told me they wanted some fashionable punch glasses, I shewed them some low ones, and they said they wished to have the others; then they told me to reach some decanters, we agreed for the price of both, then they asked me for some large goblets, I reached them some and they agreed for them; then the young one said, that is not the business we came for, he asked me if I had any plated tea-spoons; I said yes, they said their servants were neglectful when they carried six-penny-worth of brandy and water, or rum and water into the coffee-room, they seldom got their spoons back again; I looked them out some, and they measured them, for they said it is so offensive to a gentleman when a spoon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200025"/> slips in; the young one said, there is a pencil case you said you wanted; with that I went behind the compter, for they made me reach down the highest things I had in my shop, and I drew out out a glass containing various goods; he asked me the price, I told him seven shillings and sixpence; he said he would give seven shillings provided the screw was good, he asked me if I had a pencil, I told him no, he desired me to send for one, he said he had no sixpence, I sent for one, and it was put into one of the glasses amongst the rest of the goods, then he pulled out a silk handkerchief and wiped his face: I had a great suspicion of them from their first coming in, when he took up the handkerchief I saw a bit of a vacancy in the case, but not knowing how my spouse had placed the things I could not be certain, Mr. Artz looked me very hard in the face, and he said, Madam, here is a little box that was taken from that place; I said, Sir, I ask your pardon, I was not looking at that; he then desired me to reach down a pair of mandarin figures, I would not reach both because I thought I saw a hand near my glass, I said to my little boy, in Hebrew, my dear, take care, for I am frightened to death: I can tell no other particulars, no further than I could not positively tell what had been in the shew-glasses, had I laid it out myself I could; I asked them for their direction, they gave it me, they told me it was Vintineer's-hotel, Carlisle-street; I told the child to run to the door and see which way they went, and he run, and they were out of sight; immediately I took out the drawers and looked them over, I could not tell what was lost: the tall gentleman says to me, come this way I want to look at some basons, I went from behind my compter to the further end of my shop, I got upon the stool and I reached some basons, and while I reached them, the sash on this side I heard move, I turned shortly, and that gentleman stood close to the sash, there hung four watches, I immediately missed a watch, I

             the sash close again, I said to my little boy I certainly do miss a watch, when my husband came in, I said to him look over the drawer, and at the sash, I am afraid I have been robbed, he immediately missed a watch, a diamond ring, two gold seals, and a great many more things that were not brought up to the Justices; it was a watch with a silver face, and two picture rings I think. I set every thing down of the clothes they had on, even the different watches they had in their pockets, one had a plain watch, and the other had a gadrooned watch, I saw their watches, they took them out, and said one to the other, come Sir, it is time to go home to dress: after I gave the description they were immediately taken.</p>
               <p>Were they then brought back in your presence? - No Sir, they were not, I saw them at the Justices.</p>
               <p>Were they searched at the Justice's? - I saw them at the public-house opposite.</p>
               <p>Were they searched there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was any thing found upon them belonging to you? - I was not present.</p>
               <p>Court. What day was this? - About the 20th of September.</p>
               <p>They began by asking for your husband, did they not, Madam? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>What was the first thing they asked to buy? - The first thing was some punch glasses.</p>
               <p>Did they buy any thing? - They bought some, but I was not paid for any one thing.</p>
               <p>Did they take them away with them? - No, I was to send them home at four o'clock.</p>
               <p>How many punch glasses did they buy? - Six.</p>
               <p>Which of them bought the six? - Mr. Artz.</p>
               <p>Which of the two is that; - The tall one.</p>
               <p>Then one said to the other, that is not what he wanted? - Not immediately.</p>
               <p>What did they do next? - They bought more things.</p>
               <p>What things? - Decanters and goblets.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200026"/>Which of them bought the decanters? Mr. Artz, they bought two pair of goblets, then they asked for some plated spoons.</p>
               <p>Was it Artz that asked for all these things? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did the other do all this time, did he do any thing himself, or only appear in company with Artz? - He seemed in company with Artz; he said, he had bought half a dozen knives and forks, and they did not prove to his satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Then you understood by the things that they bought, that Artz kept a coffee-house? - At first I did, but when they asked for so many things, and hauled the things over; I was affraid.</p>
               <p>What was the next thing asked for, after the spoons? - A silver pencil case.</p>
               <p>Was any of them bought? - Yes, one at seven shillings, they then asked to look at a pair of China mandarins.</p>
               <p>They then sent you to pull out another drawer? - Yes, the drawer where the pencil cases were.</p>
               <p>Was that drawer near you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was it that you heard the glass move? - At last of all.</p>
               <p>Did Artz buy any thing? - Yes, the two mandarins, at twenty five shillings.</p>
               <p>What was you doing when you fancied the sash opened? - I was reaching down some blue and white pint basons.</p>
               <p>What was it struck you then? - The other Gentleman then advanced towards the sash, and I having a pile of basons in my hand, I could not turn to look, but I heard the sash move.</p>
               <p>By the other Gentleman, you mean Gore? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You shut the sash? - I shut the sash afterwards.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was opened by one of them? - I heard it open, it goes upon castors.</p>
               <p>Was it shut before Gore went towards it or open? - It was shut before.</p>
               <p>What was it you thought at that time about the watches? - I could not tell what; it was a front sash with various goods, I could not tell till Mr. Hart came home.</p>
               <p>Where were the rings? - In the drawer I drew out of the shew glass, where the pencil cases were; the spoons I fetched from the drawer.</p>
               <p>You described one of the men rubbing his face with a handkerchief, repeat that again? - Mr. Artz took out his handkerchief and put it upon the glass, and then took it off again, and I saw a vacancy; Mr. Artz then looked very hard in my face, and said, Madam, here is a box that came out of that place, I said, I ask your pardon, Sir, I was not looking at that; I was very much confused.</p>
               <p>They took nothing away nor paid for any thing? No, Sir, only left me this direction.</p>
               <p>What is the direction? - Vintineer's Hotel, Carlisle-street, I said you have not put the number of your house, he said there is no occasion for any number, it is the only hotel in the street.</p>
               <p>Were the things to be sent to them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Hand up the direction, how do you read it? - I never read it at all, I gave it to my husband, I think he called it Vintineer's hotel.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheppard, Council for the prisoner Artz. What age is your little boy? - Between eight and nine.</p>
               <p>A clever boy? - He is kept to school.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Hart is at home, he serves, I take it for granted? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had he been out the whole of the day? - He went out about eleven.</p>
               <p>What time might this be? - About one.</p>
               <p>Upon your moving a chain, I think, in one of the drawers, Artz said to you, that something had been removed from there, a box? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You told him you were not looking at that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They continued in the shop a long time after that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you went to the sash and restored it to its place, you missed a watch? - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200027"/> thought so at that time, I could not tell rightly.</p>
               <p>You told the child so? - I did.</p>
               <p>How long after they were gone did Mr. Hart return? - I believe, to the best of my knowledge, about half an hour.</p>
               <p>You did not say anything to the prisoners? - By no means, not if I had missed all the goods.</p>
               <p>If you had laid out all the goods in the drawers yourself you would not have been able to have stated what you had missed? - Not in that confusion.</p>
               <p>Consequently as you had not laid it out you are less able to say what was missing? - Therefore I left it to Mr. Hart.</p>
               <p>Therefore you know only from the information of Mr. Hart? - Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Had you at that time any servant? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner Gore's Council, You have had the misfortune to be robbed before? - Yes, indeed I have, more to my sorrow.</p>
               <p>Very lately too? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Of some things of value which you could exactly ascertain? - I cannot particularly state them all.</p>
               <p>Then as far as your knowledge goes, whether those things that you have since found, were taken at the time that the prisoners were there, or not, you cannot say? - I am well convinced, the diamond ring I had in my hand on the Sunday morning, this was on the Monday morning; there was but one diamond ring.</p>
               <p>As you missed the watch immediately upon going to the place, you did not apply to a constable, or any of your neighbours? - No Sir, I did not, because I was not positive.</p>
               <p>They hung in the sash by a hook? - I believe they are hung upon the pevot.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear that they were not hung upon a wire? be a little cautious where mens lives are concerned? - I do not come to the court to take away mens lives, sometimes they are hung by the pendant or the wire, sometimes by the pevot, and sometimes by a string.</p>
               <p>What is the practice of your shop? - There are hooks stuck in.</p>
               <p>As your's is a cabinet of curiosities, it is necessary for Mr. Hart to be very often at sales to pick up those things? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have the conducting of his business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When he came home you did not tell him you had missed a watch, but that you suspected you had been robbed generally? - Yes, I desired him to look into the sash and the drawer, and he missed them immediately.</p>
               <p>You told Mr. Hart you believed you had been robbed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How does that square with your missing a watch the moment you went to the sash? - I am sure of it, I saw the vacancy; I would not wish to say more than I know, I would sooner shew lenity.</p>
               <p>Court to Hyam Hart. When you came back, your wife says she desired you to look? - Yes, upon which I drew out a drawer of the shew-glass that goes out into the street, I opened that drawer and missed a diamond ring, next I missed two gold enamelled rings, and several other things that I could not describe, and I omitted them in the indictment; next there was a watch that I missed, my watches hang on little hooks.</p>
               <p>Upon what she told you, you went to the Magistrate? - No, I first went up to seek for the hotel, as they left the direction; I found there was no such hotel in Carlisle-street.</p>
               <p>Did you find them by that direction? - No, I afterwards gave the description to Mr. Jealous, and I told him the particulars of the things that I had lost, upon which he and several more went and fetched these men in the course of half an hour, with my property upon them, and likewise my shop-mark in the pocket of one of them: Jealous came down to me and said, should you know your ring; I said, it is a yellow rose diamond ring, with three roses at the top, it was marked two pounds twelve shillings<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200028"/> and sixpence; says he, I have got your shop-mark likewise in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheppard. This drawer you say goes out into the street? - It opens on the counter, and rests upon the counter.</p>
               <p>Do you yourself take every thing out of that dr awer of a night and replace it in a morning? - If it is anything of value we do, but not every individual article.</p>
               <p>Can you take upon yourself to say you remember every article? - That would be a very great hardship for me to undertake, but if there were five hundred different articles, I could tell that that article was in the drawer very particularly.</p>
               <p>Are there not other articles of equal value? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then how can you particularly tell that? - A man must know within himself, I cannot describe the nature how I should know, but I know I put it in that very morning.</p>
               <p>But how comes it that you can particularly pick out that article? - All the articles I take out over night, I replace in the next morning.</p>
               <p>And there were many articles you did not take out over night? - Small articles we particularly take out.</p>
               <p>You have told us that you did not take out all the articles over night? - If it is a large article, perhaps I may not, but small articles in general I take out.</p>
               <p>There were a great many other watches in this glass, I suppose, of course, besides the one that you missed? - There were.</p>
               <p>Do you take out the watches? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Of course you do not take an account of your stock every morning? - I look to see whether the things hang right.</p>
               <p>Do you count your watches every morning? - I can tell by the hooks, there are four hooks to every pane of glass, and if one is missing, it soon makes a hole.</p>
               <p>Is it not possible, that in dusting your shop window, one article might be missing without being seen? - No, Sir, it is impossible, one watch being missing may make a great vacancy, and every watch has got this mark to it, a large piece of paper, which makes a man more particular.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Is there any mark on the ring itself? - It is a yellow rose ring, and a remarkable fine yellow rose it is, I do not think I ever saw one to fellow it.</p>
               <p>Do you think there is no fellow to it? - I cannot say, such a thing may be possible, I cannot deny that; but it is impossible for my shop-mark to be fellowed.</p>
               <p>There is one hotel in Carlisle-street? - No, Sir, not that I could learn, there is one Mr. Angelo's, it is a kind of subscription-room.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that there is no house in Carlisle-street that is called an hotel? - Do you mean a house of ill fame.</p>
               <p>There are a good many of them, are not there? - How can I answer that, am I obliged to know every house? I enquired, and received for answer of several housekeepers, that there is no hotel in the street.</p>
               <p>Are there no houses of public reception, called Taverns, in that street? - I never was in one, that is all I can say.</p>
               <p>Are there not more houses than one that they call taverns in Carlisle-street? - There are several public houses.</p>
               <p>You remember taking this ring out the night before, when you shut up shop? - I remember it particularly well, I saw it on Monday morning, I had it on my finger on Saturday and Sunday, that very ring, but I assure you, Sir, it will be as much satisfaction to me, if the honourable Court should find the prisoners not guilty, and more, than if they find them guilty; I have children of my own: all that I do in coming here, is to satisfy the laws of my country.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the making an appointment with anybody about the settling of this business? - I do not recollect my making any appointment, but I recollect people coming to me.</p>
               <p>You have been robbed very frequently lately, have not you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you lost any diamond rings before this robbery? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You cannot tell what things you lost of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200029"/> those former robberies? - Yes, I can, I keep a book.</p>
               <p>Pray what fort of diamond ring is this that is the value of two guineas and a half? - It is the value of it, I gave forty shillings for it.</p>

               <p>A very fine rose diamond ring! - I say a yellow diamond ring, I never saw one of the colour, it is a fine bright yellow rose, it is as elegant as the first water white by being a fine yellow: Jealous has had it in his possession ever since.</p>

               <p>About three o'clock in the afternoon the prosecutor came to me, and said his shop had been robbed by two young men in drab coloured coats; I think to the best of my knowledge that he mentioned whips in their hands, I suspected who they were; I went with an officer into Crown-court, Bow-street, I cannot say the number of the house, I went up one pair of stairs, and saw the prisoner Artz in the room, he had no great coat on, his great coat was hanging up on a door that led to a back room, I then searched him, and I found a ring upon his finger, and in his pocket a little bit of paper, which has wrote upon it,</p>
               <p>"a diamond ring, 2 l. 12 s. 6 d." I then looked round the room, and under the grate in the fore room, I found this diamond ring, I found a pair of knee buckles; I found nothing else.</p>
               <p>Did you go any farther? - The other officer searched the other prisoner, he was up two pair of stairs in the same house, the other officer went up to him, his name is Dixon.</p>
               <p>Did you acquaint the prosecutor what you had found? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him what the mark of his ring was? - No, I did not, he said he had lost a diamond ring and two other rings.</p>
               <p>Did you enquire what the mark was? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>(The ring deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are my property.</p>
               <p>Look at that piece of paper? - That is my hand writing, that is my shop mark, the ring was stuck down in it.</p>
               <p>Court. The description is a very general one; what led you to this house in Crown-court? - It was a suspicion that arose between me and my fellow servant who they might be.</p>
               <p>That description was enough to lead you to the house in Crown-court, where you believed they were? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Crown-court, I believe, is a place inhabited very much by women of a certain description? - It is.</p>

               <p>PRISONER ARTZ's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am by business a pawnbroker and dealer in goods, I am well known by every man in the business to purchase things at sales; I am known by very many: I am apprehensive that these things had been purchased by me the day before; I had upwards of thirty-five watches and other things, the property of a gentleman at Portsmouth, I live at Wandsworth, and if they had been produced he would have sworn to them, I make no doubt; I have subpoened him: I have had five or six different Jews, who came to me and offered to make it up, first proposing a hundred pounds, and then forty; I am informed the things are the property of one Judah Levy, who keeps several of these shops. He has several times offered to make up the affair; I know myself innocent of the matter, I do not know these things are Mr. Hart's property:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200030"/> I submit myself to the mercy of the Gentlemen of the Jury; I am conscious of my own innocence.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Artz called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Gore. I leave my case entirely to my Council.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Gore called five witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>How had the prisoner got into your house? - He lifted up the sash; when I awaked, the sash was up, and he in the house.</p>
               <p>Was the sash down at night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any fastening? - No fastening, but the sash was down in its place, and a curtain before it in the inside, the curtain was drawn almost back.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the sash was down the night before? - I am sure it was, for I had only two children at home with me, and they were in bed, I was the last up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether the sash was up when I went to the place, or whether it was down? - I am sure the sash was down and the curtain before it, for I did it myself.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you sober when you went to bed? - Yes, I came home from my labour from threshing, and I generally go to bed about eight.</p>

               <p>I am sometimes afflicted with lunacy, I have been so for a series of years, and when I get a drop of liquor, I have no recollection of any thing that I do; it was at that unfortunate time that I committed this rash act, I thought the house was uninhabited, it had the appearance of one; when I took this box up, I thought it was a box containing of tobacco, and I never opened it till after it was delivered to that man; I have been in Bethlem, and at St. Luke's, and in private mad-houses, and all will not do; it comes at intervals upon me, like the flux and reflux of the tide; I subpoened Mr. Gosner, the apothecary of Bethlem Hospital, and one Johnson of the Bolt and Ton, in Fleet-street, and Mr. Coleman, the surgeon, that lives below Exeter-change, and Mr. Thwaites.</p>
               <p>- GOSNER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an apothecary at Bethlem-hospital, I know the prisoner well, about six or seven years ago he was sent to Bethlem by the Commissioners of sick and hurt seamen, as insane, and was in a state of insanity for some time, but got well; he was there to the best of my recollection seven or eight months.</p>
               <p>Have you known any thing of him since that time? - About two months since he called upon me, and appeared in great distress, in a sailor's jacket.</p>
               <p>What did you judge of his condition of mind about that time? - I had about ten minutes conversation with him, he appeared in his perfect senses then; he appeared in great distress, and wanted me to recommend him to any apothecary.</p>
               <p>Do you know enough of his case to know whether it was of a kind to be subject to a relapse? - Most of those cases are subject to relapses, we frequently have them over and over again.</p>
               <p>A little drink would bring on the disorder? - Very suddenly, I believe the first occasion of the disorder was from that.</p>

               <p>When did you come home? - In May 1783.</p>
               <p>Did he come home with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What has been the state of his mind since? - He went into the country soon after; I saw him once since he came to London this time.</p>
               <p>What have you understood of his condition of mind since he came home? - I always understood, that whenever he got any liquor, he was insane for twenty-four hours at least.</p>
               <p>Independent of his madness, what was his character? - His character was always honest.</p>
               <p>By his being mate under you, I suppose you had some opinion of him? - I had, otherwise I should not have received him.</p>
               <p>He has no skill, I suppose? - Yes, Sir, as a dresser I can trust him very well, not anything further.</p>

               <p>Had she not a cloak on? - No, I asked her to deliver the stockings, I told her they were ours, and she said, she would not, but she would come back with me; I did not hear what she said when she came back.</p>
               <p>What reason did she give for chusing to come back rather than deliver the stockings? - I do not know.</p>

               <p>This good woman came to me in the morning, and asked me to go with her to buy with a few articles, we went to several shops, and she bought several things; we went into this shop, and she bought some flannel, it was put down, and every thing she bought in the course of the day, I put into my apron, and I was to have the making of them; I never observed the stockings till the boy came after me, when I came back the Gentleman asked me what business I had with his stockings, I begged his pardon, and told him I took them through a mistake; they took us to the office, and they sent to the hosiers and to another place, and those people said, they had lost nothing, and found every thing very right.</p>
               <p>PRISONER BAKER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went into this shop, and asked for a bit of flannel, I bought two yards and a half at fifteen pence a yard; the boy came after me, and said you have stole a pair of stockings; I went back and said, you are welcome to search me; they sent for a constable and searched me, and the constable took fifteen guineas out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. What are you? - My husband is a traveller and pedlar in the country, he settled me in London till he returned again from Cornwall.</p>
               <p>Court to Williams. Were the stockings in a paper? - The stockings were laid on the compter on a bit of paper, she had the paper about them in her hand, the third woman had the flannel, she did not come back.</p>
               <p>Spencer. The stockings were in the flannel, I had it then, but after I was taken into custody the third woman had it.</p>

               <p>Did what these persons said pass in the hearing of the prosecutor? - It was at the door, and the prosecutor was in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. How long have you known the prisoner? - About three or four years; she has lived next door but one to me.</p>
               <p>How far do you suppose the prosecutor was off? - About as far as yourself.</p>

               <p>What did you propose nothing of the kind? - There was a person asked me if I was agreeable to make it up and not hurt the woman; I said I did not want to use her ill, but as I had been used ill I will follow it up.</p>
               <p>What did you propose they should do to you to make it up? - Nothing at all.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the weighers of the Goldsmiths company, on Tuesday the 7th of September were sent to be assayed for Mr. Yardley, twenty-seven pair of silver buckles to Goldsmiths-hall, to the assay-office, I mean only the rims, we in general call them buckles; when they were assayed a note came purporting to be the note of Mr. Yardley, for the delivery of them, that was on the evening of the same day, the course of business is to deliver them by five o'clock; in consequence of this order I delivered the buckles.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect to whom you delivered the buckles? - The prisoner, Owen, I firmly believe to be the person.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner alone? - There might be five, ten, or twenty boys about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200043"/> the office coming for things about the same time.</p>
               <p>How soon after did you see the prisoner Owen? - I did not see him till I saw him at the public office, which was in the course of one or two days.</p>
               <p>Did you then recollect him? - Perfectly.</p>
               <p>And you have now no doubt of his person? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Have you had that note in your possession ever since? - Ever since.</p>
               <p>Deliver it in.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to speak to belief only? - To belief only, I do not positively swear to him, but I firmly believe him to be the person.</p>
               <p>(The Note read.)</p>
               <p>"Please to let the bearer have the work,</p>
               <p>"W. Yardley, Tuesday 8."</p>
               <p>Court. What day of the month was it? - The seventh.</p>
               <p>This purports to be the eighth? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Count. Hand up the indictment, the indictment is a very exact copy of the figure, for it may be read either eight, or three.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. Your Lordship will permit me to ask a question or two. I will beg the favour of you to state the custom of your office more particularly? - In what point do you mean?</p>
               <p>The rule of your office, I believe, is to send in your goods at nine in the morning for the purpose of being assayed? - All goods to be assayed that day are to be sent by nine.</p>
               <p>When are they to be fetched away? - By five o'clock.</p>
               <p>That is not an answer sufficiently particular, they have not the whole course of the day to fetch them away in? - No, there is a time during the process of the marking, and assaying, which is sometimes three, half after three, four, or five, according to the business of the day.</p>
               <p>If I understand you right, the silversmith has, at the utmost, but one hour in the afternoon to send for his goods? - We have them sometimes one, two, three, four, or five days at the office and not fetched away.</p>
               <p>Do you permit the tradesmen to send for their goods any time of the day; when they send them in the morning do you chuse to give them longer than an hour to fetch them away? - Our orders are to shut up the office at five.</p>
               <p>Suppose the silversmith sends this morning by nine, goods to assay, is it customary for the silversmith who wants his goods the same day, to send for them by four, suppose they were to send at three? - If any of the trade want the indulgence to have their business by three, our assay-master endeavours to indulge them, the usual course is to deliver between four and five.</p>
               <p>Have you not many tradesmen sending every day goods to be assayed, and sending for those goods? - Yes, many.</p>
               <p>You said there might be five, ten, or twenty boys and servants that very day coming for goods? - I believe there were, at the time I delivered the work to the prisoner there might be ten, twelve, or fourteen boys or men at the window.</p>
               <p>Your evidence was five, ten, or twenty? - I believe I am within the number now.</p>
               <p>You will do me the favour to recollect that you have told my Lord in the most express terms, or otherwise I should not have examined so very particularly, that as to the prisoner, you would only speak to your belief, therefore I recommended to you not to speak of the delivery of the goods to the prisoner at the bar? - There might be twenty, I do not think there was so many, there might.</p>
               <p>You are a weigher? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Does the assay-master attend? - Not in our office, the goods are delivered from our office.</p>
               <p>You have a great many goods in that office of course? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You speak to small articles? - Some small, some large.</p>
               <p>Small articles, many that might be pilfered? - They cannot be taken away from the office.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200044"/>But they are open to public inspection, to all the servants that come in, you have a vast quantity of small goods that are liable to be pilfered. - Our work is all weighed, and a small ticket of each workman's name upon each bag or box, and placed in different parts for our going to them, when the workman comes for his work ready to be delivered, the window of the office is thrown open, and the boys, or men, or women that come for the work, call out Jones's work, Yardley's work, King's work, or whatever they may come for.</p>
               <p>When they come for their work, suppose it to be Mr. Yardley's; I come for Mr. Yardley's work, they deliver a note purporting to be from Mr. Yardley, looking as that did, and believing it to be from the workman? - We deliver the goods.</p>
               <p>Suppose a little girl of eight years old was to bring you one of these notes, and call out for the work, you would deliver it her, would not you? - If I thought it was a note from her master I certainly should, for we deliver it to many, both old and young.</p>
               <p>Then your attention is paid to the note that is brought, you look at the note, and your attention is directed to the note? - To the note intirely, without the person, we pay no respect to the person.</p>
               <p>It is already in evidence that this was on the 7th of September? - Yes, Sir, Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Is the room where the servants come a light room, a dark room, or middling? - If anything rather dark.</p>
               <p>Court. If I understand your mode of delivery right, the persons who come for them do not come into the room where they are? - No, Sir, they are handed out; sometimes they do, if the gentleman comes himself for his work, we do not let him stand among the boys.</p>
               <p>Court. They are not placed in the reach of the person who comes for them - No.</p>

               <p>Which of them? - I know them both by seeing them before, but the prisoner Owen was the person, I believe, that the work was delivered to.</p>
               <p>Have you known his person before? - No, I do not know as I ever saw him before, I was present at the time of delivery, it was delivered in the usual way, he asked for Mr. Yardley's work, and it was delivered to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheppard. I take it for granted that the business is done rather in a hurry, is not it? - Why, Sir, my part of the business was done, I was at leisure, and looked very attentively at the person who came for the work.</p>
               <p>Tell us how you came to look at tentively at this particular person, there were many boys? - I stood at the window, at the time the window was open, Mr. King was not immediately ready to deliver it, and hearing the prisoner ask for Mr. Yardley's work, I looked at him.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean so speak positively to the prisoner Owen, or only to strong belief? - I wish to be understood not speaking positively, but only to strong belief.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200045"/>Did you deliver it in the usual way? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Had you any more conversation with him at that time? - No, Sir, not about that affair, then we parted, and he went through Smithfield, it was the last day of Bartholomew fair; I went to Goldsmiths-hall in the afternoon for the work, I did not get the work, in consequence of some information from me the prisoner was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner was the person that talked to you? - I am very sure of the prisoner Chant.</p>

               <p>He used frequently to talk with you when he met you? - Yes, Sir, before.</p>
               <p>That day he happened to see you, and asked you if you were going to the hall? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why he never met you without speaking to you about something or other? - Very seldom.</p>
               <p>What did he ask you? - Says he, do not they write, please to deliver the work to the bearer, I told him I believed so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheppard. Was you with Mr. Yardley when the prisoners were apprehended? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Look at that order.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you call Mr. Yardley to prove? - To look at that order; and see whether it is his order.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. We have a release.</p>
               <p>A release of what, who has he a claim on? - On the Company, for his goods.</p>
               <p>Is that your hand writing? - No.</p>
               <p>You was present I believe, and apprehended these two young men? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were they together? - They were going along, I was not positive that they were together; they were walking over Clerkenwell-green, I stopped Chant and the other walked on, I was of opinion that the other was belonging to him, and I asked Mr. Rushforth, who was in company with me to stop him.</p>
               <p>Court. How near was the other prisoner to him? - He might be a yard or two behind him.</p>
               <p>Did you see them walking absolutely together? - I think they were together, one was a little way before the other, I had a little suspicion, the other looked like a thief by his dress; I desired Mr. Rushforth to stop the other young man, he brought him up, I then asked Chant if he knew any thing of my buckles, we went to Bow-street, and Mr. Rushforth told me he believed the buckles were in Owen's pocket, Chant said, he knew nothing of them, he did not know what I meant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. How came you to stop Chant? - The boy came back and told me, that the work was delivered by a false receipt, I went down with him to the hall, and found the description of the boy, and I stopped Chant.</p>
               <p>Was Chant examined? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200046"/>Was any thing found upon him? - No.</p>

               <p>Was Owen examined? - Yes, twenty-four pair of silver rims were found upon him, they were my property, the same I sent to the office in the morning.</p>
               <p>Did you examine to see whether they had passed or not passed at the office? - Yes, they were marked.</p>
               <p>You sent them for that purpose in the morning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you found them, they had the mark upon them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure these buckles are your property? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. Do you know Owen? - I never saw him before I took him.</p>
               <p>Have you had an opportunity since of being informed what business he is of? - I believe he is a hatter and hosier.</p>
               <p>Chant is a relation of your's? - My brother married his sister.</p>
               <p>What business is he? - A buckle maker,</p>
               <p>Was he bred to the business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is he out of his time? - I believe he never was apprentice, they worked in the country by the week.</p>
               <p>Did he work for you before this affair? - He did not work for me.</p>
               <p>Who did he work for in town? - For Mr. Turner the buckle maker, he had lived at my brother's who lives in Cold-bathfields; Turner lives in Charles-street, Hatton-garden; Chant has been in London, about twelve months.</p>
               <p>Was he intimate in your family? - Not very intimate with me, he has been at my house of an errand or so.</p>
               <p>I find he knew your boy Yardley? - Yes, they used to be together when the boy went down to his uncle's.</p>
               <p>Had he been used to come to the Goldsmiths office do you know, for your brother or for Mr. Turner? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>The cause of your suspicion, was that he had been asking the boy the form of the order to get the buckles? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Supposing Owen had this order, by virtue of which the goods were delivered, do you, of your own knowledge, know who gave

             that order? - No, I do not, I know the patterns of the buckles, and the marks.</p>
               <p>It is not morally impossible that another workman may have the same pattern? - It is impossible.</p>
               <p>Do you make the pattern yourself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it of your own invention? - Some of them, it is impossible that any man should have them so exact.</p>
               <p>Was it impossible that another workman should have the same pattern? - They may have the same pattern made from that.</p>
               <p>Do you send your work to the hall compleatly finished? - In the rough.</p>
               <p>Is there not a possibility, or is it not too common, for one manufacturer to take the mark of another? - I think it possible.</p>
               <p>I ask if it is not done? - Not that I know off.</p>
               <p>Then I ask you of your own knowledge, whether it is not done by the cutlers and silversmiths? - I do not know of my own knowledge, it is possible to be done, that you know as well as I.</p>
               <p>The man that made that punch could make another? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Exactly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Have you a doubt in your mind that these are the buckles? - I have no doubt at all.</p>
               <p>Court. Who did you send for them that evening? - This boy.</p>
               <p>Court to Boy. What time did you go for the goods? - About twenty-five minutes past four when I went out, I was there a little before five, I was told the goods were delivered.</p>
               <p>Did you carry any note for them? - Yes, and brought it back.</p>
               <p>Yardley. I sent him with a note, and he brought it back.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. Have you that note here? - I have not, I was so careful of it, I locked it up, it is at home.</p>

               <p>I am Assay master to the Goldsmiths Company, I was in company with Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200047"/> Yardley, when the prisoners were apprehended.</p>
               <p>Did any thing pass between you and Chant about Owen? - We put him into a coach, and immediately took him to Bow-street; previous to his going into the coach, I observed his pockets, I put my hand and found something very hard, as we were going along, Mr. Yardley said, the buckles are here, I said, I did imagine so, there were twenty-four pair of buckles found in his pocket, they were in a rough state, the office mark appeared to be recently made.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. Nothing was found upon Chant? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>The prisoners were not together? - I was behind Mr. Yardley, at the time that Mr. Yardley stopped Chant, I stopped Owen.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sheppard to Prosecutor. Will you swear that you never saw any buckles exactly of this pattern, made by the manufacturers in any of the shops in London, take any of them? - Some of them.</p>
               <p>I believe a good many of them? - I can swear to these, for I never saw them any where, I do not believe they were seen.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Have all these buckles your mark upon them? - Yes, I believe they have W. Y.</p>
               <p>Jury. I should be glad to look at all the buckles? - They are marked some on the bottoms and some on the bridges.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Have you weighed them? - I have not weighed them, but I am sure they will answer to the weight; there are three pair that another witness has in Court, these three pair make up the whole.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I have three pair of buckle rims, I had them from a woman that keeps the Red Cow, in Foster-lane.</p>
               <p>Is she here? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do you know her name? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. That evidence may be laid quite out of the case.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan to Yardley. Now hand me the pattern that you state particularly to be your pattern? - This is made for a particular person.</p>
               <p>Now you will swear that no other silversmith in London had a buckle of either of those patterns, on the day you sent those to the office? - Yes, I had sold some before.</p>
               <p>Then you had before those were sent to the office, sold some of the identical pattern? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then could not that pattern be taken off by another silver-smith, and the buckles taken from them? - No, Sir, when they are quite different.</p>
               <p>Attend to your evidence a little; when you have sold me a pair of buckles compleatly finished, cannot I go to another silver-smith's, and get a pair made for me? - You cannot get them in the rough like them.</p>
               <p>Sir, answer me? - He may make them nearly like them, but not so, but I can tell the difference.</p>
               <p>What after they are compleatly finished, can you tell the difference? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Let a silver-smith take a pair of rims, that are sold without any pattern, and cut me a pair exactly like those in my shoes now? - Not so but that the maker of those could tell the difference.</p>
               <p>Then they would not be exactly alike? - No, they could not make them exactly like them, it is impossible for one man, to make two buckles alike.</p>
               <p>Then you never sold a pair of buckles in your life; you sent twenty-seven pair of buckles to the office? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You got twenty-four pair back, you never weighed them? - I know they were weight.</p>
               <p>Jury. In some of the buckles the marks are very plain, in others the punch is double, do you know them? - When I entered the punch at the office, it was rather a blind mark, it was not made perfect.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200048"/>Can you swear to the impression? - I can swear to the punch, I have not the punch here; there is nothing very particular in it.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to them that are not clear? - I can swear to them all, the buckles, and the punch, and the patterns, and every thing, they were all struck with one punch.</p>
               <p>Court to Rushforth. The immpression appears more or less according as it is struck off? - Yes, sometimes they strike the mark upon a part which we call barred, and that with a ruff file, the smoother the surface upon which the mark is struck the more distinct.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Chant called three witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Owen called eight witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>The Jury withdrew for some time, and returned and asked the following question of Owen.</p>
               <p>How do you account for having the buckles about you.</p>
               <p>Court. He had an opportunity of making his defence, but I will ask him, though it seems to be calling upon him to invent a story.</p>
               <p>Jury. It is only one of the Jury that has any doubt at all.</p>
               <p>Court to Owen. Have you any wish to say any thing as to these buckles being found upon you.</p>
               <p>Owen. Now, Sir, respecting these buckles, I received them from one Forrester, in Charter-house-lane, he said, Owen, if you have a mind to carry these buckles to the Angel, at Clerkenwell, and wait till I come, I shall be there presently; I was going to another place, he only desired me to leave them at this place, I did not know the consequence, nor how they were obtained, this person I understand has absconded.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am afraid it is my duty to ask what account was given when he was first apprehended.</p>
               <p>Court. I will push the enquiry no further, I will leave it to the good sense of the Gentlemen of the Jury, whether they think any credit is due to this story.</p>

               <p>On the 7th of this month, at eleven, I was at my two pair of stairs window, facing the prosecutor's, I saw the prisoner go into the prosecutor's hall, he was not in above a minute, and he came out with a cloak, putting it withinside of his coat; I told Mrs. Brush, and she sent her servant with me, and we went up the Minories, and saw the prisoner at the public house door, putting the cloak in his pocket; seeing us he began to walk away, and then to run; he was taken, and then I saw him take the cloak out of his pocket, and throw it in the kennel; it was given to the watchman.</p>

               <p>About the 27th of September, between twelve and one at night, I came to my lodging in Ratcliff-highway, no person answered, and Mrs. Palmer came up to me, and asked me to go to her house; I told her I would not, I went into the watchman's box, then she came again, and the watchman said I had better go with her than walk the streets all night, so I went with her, and while I was undressing myself, two young fellows came and asked me for some liquor, I said there was no liquor to be got, and they went away, the prisoner was in the parlour then, and she called the two young fellows in, there was a bed in the parlour, and I went to the kitchen door to make water, the two young men were in the parlour then, and when I came back I found nobody there, and my things were gone which I left in the care of Mrs. Palmer; I found the prisoner afterwards at my own door, and I gave the watchman charge of her, but he would not take it, the next morning I had her taken up.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. Upon you oath, did not you go back and sleep in this woman's room that you supposed had robbed you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You knew her perfectly before? - Yes, she called these young fellows in by name.</p>
               <p>By what names? - Tom and Jack.</p>
               <p>You told the watchman she should pay for them? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You slept in the parlour afterwards? - Yes, I slept with her in the bed.</p>
               <p>When you returned from the kitchen, was Mrs. Palmer in the room? - She was standing at the door.</p>
               <p>You said just now; when you returned there was nobody there? - Nobody in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Was not she looking after these men that had robbed the place, and calling the watchman? - No, she was standing at the door.</p>
               <p>Was you drunk or sober? - I was sober.</p>

               <p>I will tell you every word true; at half after eleven this gentleman came home, and his landlord was gone to bed, he began making a sham cry at the door, says I, you foolish blockhead, you had better go down to the watch-house; then Mrs. Palmer came past to get her a pot of beer for her supper, and he said he was poor and had no money; says she, you poor rogue, I will treat you with a bed for one night, so he went to her house, and I went the hour of twelve, and the door was a jar; I did not see the two men in the house; I came to my box and smoked a pipe, and Mrs. Palmer came to me, and said, come up to my house, for two men have taken the sailor's things; when I came up at one o'clock there were a couple of jockeys going over the rope-field, I had no business to go after them; when I came back there was only him and her, he said his clothes were taken away: he could not swear that Mrs. Palmer took them; she lent him a pair of shoes and stockings the next morning to go home in, and lent him sixpence, he had no money; he has lain in her house before, when he had a great deal of property; he was in liquor. I have been watchman two years and a half, my beat is in Ratcliff-highway, I have known the prisoner ever since she kept the house, I had never any complaints against her for robberies.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you learned so little of your duty as a watchman, to suffer women to come and pick up men at your watch-box?</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Do any of you Gentlemen live at that part of the town? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Make a memorandum of this man's name.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. On the story of this idle drunken fellow, you will hardly think proper to convict the woman of felony, whatever opinion you may have of her.</p>

               <p>Did you see him in the hospital? - Somebody gave orders that I should not see him, I went five times in one day, some people were let in, I was not let in.</p>

               <p>The deceased was my journeyman, I saw him after he received this wound, I asked him how the affair first began, he told me he called in at Mrs. Groves's, they asked him to eat some soup, he refused at first, they asked him again and persuaded him, they sent him for a spoon to this Mrs. Smith's, he staid there some time, the prisoner came after him, and said to him, damn you Tom, what are you staying here all this while for, with that he laid hold of a pistol that lay on the table, and said, damn me I will shoot one of you, the woman said, lay it down, it is charged, he said no, it is not charged, there is no priming in it, and says he, damn me I will have a smack at some of you; the person that is the deceased said, he forgave him, and he hoped God Almighty would; I was going to ask some more questions, but the surgeons came in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to ask him why the witness gave orders that nobody should see the deceased but himself? - I gave no such orders, the surgeons gave such orders, and the sister told me, that nobody was allowed to see him, but me and my man.</p>
               <p>Did the deceased at the time you saw him, think himself a dying man? - The first time I saw him, he said, O my dear master! - I am dying.</p>
               <p>- WOOD sworn.</p>
               <p>I was fellow servant with the deceased, I saw him at the hospital, he was stript, he was sitting upright in his bed, the moment he saw me, he cried out O Wood! Wood! I am a dying man, I asked him how it came, and the surgeons would not let me stay, I went again, and the surgeons interrupted me, and about twenty minutes before he died, I asked him how he was, he said, he was just a dying, I asked him whether the prisoner at the bar did it wilfully or no, he said, he did not think he did, he forgave him, and hoped God would; he could utter no more, and I took my farewell of him, and he was dead in a minute.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. I need not call the surgeon, Gentlemen, it is a very unfortunate accident.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>The indictment was opened by Mr. Silvester, and Mr. Pigott also of Council for the prosecution, opened the case as follows:</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you, Gentlemen of the Jury: It falls to my share, in the course of a profession, which has some duties attached to it, that though highly necessary, are certainly painful in their nature, to state to you the circumstances and history of the case of the unhappy young man, now at the bar; and Gentlemen, whatever view you may have of that case, I am persuaded you will agree with me in thinking, that if ever a case did call in a commercial city, such as this is, for the careful and attentive consideration of a Jury, for the fullest exposition, and for the most solemn, and interesting investigation, it is this which you are now about to hear. Gentlemen, you will easily believe, if you have ever heard of the names of the prosecutors, Messrs. Drummonds, in this transaction, that they are as free as their representative in this place must be, from any thing like zeal in a business which involves the life of a fellow creature; I shall think my duty therefore fully discharged in stating to you the history and circumstances of this case, and the steps which lead to it, and in laying before you all the evidence that I have to produce against the prisoner, leaving him and his fate to the laws of his country: but, Gentlemen, I am not without my anxieties on the subject, though they are of another kind; I wish, I confess, that the motives of this prosecution may be felt and understood, that the absolute necessity, the indispensible obligation, which subsists upon those who are the prosecutors, not to smother or suppress a transaction of this nature, happening so near the place in which we are now assembled; I wish, I say, that in this town the necessity for this investigation may be fully known: I am not without some reason to believe, that in this city there prevails a popular, but a very erroneous mistake, concerning the state of the law, as it relates to persons in the situation<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200063"/> in which the prisoner at the bar lately was; a mistake, which perhaps has heretofore been fatal to others, as it may to him: it is believed, that a clerk or servant to a banker or merchant, who imbezzles his master's property, is guilty of no criminal offence, that all that he commits is a breach of trust against the master who employs him; but that in a criminal view the opportunity which access to his master's property gives him, and which therefore, in all sense and reason, is an aggravation of his offence, so far from having that operation, changes his offence, and makes it breach of trust; and this opinion I am affraid has obtained, without any regard to the situation of that clerk or servant, and without any regard to the nature of the trust that has been placed in him; it has been believed to be general, and to extend to every sort of relation, between a master and that sort of servant that I am mentioning: this is a fatal opinion, and of most mischievous tendency in the place where we now are; and it is for the purpose of having the law in this matter settled, if there be persons that think it unsettled, for the purpose of having the law in this case fully understood, that this prosecution was brought before you; this motive however, though a powerful one, is not the only one: after it had been noised abroad, and the subject of public conversation, and of paragraphs in the newspapers, that a theft had been committed in the shop of a banker; do but consider for a moment the situation, in which all those persons who are employed in that banker's shop must be, but for this investigation, which if it does not tend to the conviction of the prisoner, tends at least to remove such a degree of suspicion as to clear all his fellow servants: Gentlemen, to those persons you will recollect, that, character is not to them, as it is to other persons, that which sweetens all the enjoyments, and all the satisfaction of life, it is to them existence; they can have no existence without the possession of a character perfectly irreproachable; and if a robbery has been committed in a banker's shop, in which a great number of these young persons are employed, many of whom are of respectable families and connections, and a general suspicion is suffered to becloud that shop, and the particulars are smothered and suppressed, only consider the dreadful consequences; the consequence to the public you will readily perceive, Gentlemen, is greater still; a banker is a person in whom the most extensive and unlimited confidence is placed, and they would have but little pretensions to the future confidence of their employers, if they suffered such a transaction as this to sleep in obscurity: Gentlemen, those who know the Messrs. Drummonds, the prosecutors, will readily believe, that if there should in the course of the investigation of this business, appear any circumstances which ought to have weight in another place, so far as they can, with propriety and consistency, give that weight their aid, they will do it; but the occasion, the time, and the place, are not yet arrived; the prisoner must first take his trial, and all the effect which belongs to the evidence, that evidence must receive from this Court, and from a Jury of his country, before they think themselves at liberty to lend an ear to any considerations whatever, with which mercy to the prisoner may be mixed. A banker is bound in my opinion, and I have had no scruple to express it, to conduct himself in a case like this, precisely like the Bank or any other monied corporation; to suffer the law to take its course; and not to intercept the law in any shape in its progress. Gentlemen, Messrs. Drummonds are <rs id="t17841020-39-viclabel185" type="occupation">bankers</rs>

It is the practice of this banking house, every Saturday night, to take an account of the quantity of money in this strong room; a person whose business it was to take an account of that money, took that account on Saturday the 3d of April, and having taken the account, he brings the account of the quantity of money he has taken to another clerk, who is a check clerk, and who knows consequently what money ought to be in the shop, that clerk compares his account of the cash taken, with the other clerk, who is the check clerk; and consequently they are enabled to see, whether all the money that ought to be in the shop is there: on the 3d of April, the Gentleman who took this account, in comparing the account, found there was a deficiency of one thousand pounds; you will understand, Gentlemen, that in these chests the money is kept, in bags of one thousand pounds; however, in a place in which such a defalcation as this never happened before, where nobody looked for or expected any such thing, where all the figures answered but one, the first thing that would occur to these persons, would be, that they had made some mistake; a re-examination was had, with all the care which it became them to use, to see if they had committed any mistake; no mistake was committed, and the deficiency of one thousand pounds was found to be actual: you will readily believe this occasioned a great deal of enquiry amongst the clerks in all the house, and excited a great deal of alarm and uneasiness; no person confessed the offence, no means were discovered to fix it on one clerk more than another, and with such unpleasant circumstances, did this transaction rest, from the 3d of April to the 24th of September following, upwards I believe of six months; upon that day it was found that the book called an entry book was missing, and three days afterwards, on the 27th of September, it was found that some leaves had been torn out of a balance book; the alarm and the uneasiness were not likely to be the less for this; it was the subject of a great deal of curiosity, impatient and painful curiosity, to almost all the persons in the house, and a Gentleman who is very much in the confidence of the Messrs. Drummonds, and who from long and faithful service deserves to be so, from great sagacity of observation, discovered that the prisoner seemed to be less curious and anxious than the rest of the clerks were, about one book being missing, and leaves being torn out of another; that Gentleman's name is Wheatley, this first drew his attention<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200065"/> to the prisoner, and application, private as it must be in its nature, was made to the person with whom the prisoner lodged, to know of him, whether he had observed in the prisoner's conduct, manners or mode of life, any thing that could lead to further suspicion; that person answered, that his expences were certainly beyond the natural expence of a person in his situation, he answered so without hesitation, he had been told that he had money in the Bank; enquiry was accordingly made at the Bank, and this further clew being obtained, in searching the books of the Bank it was discovered, that there was there four hundred and twenty pounds in the three per cent annuities, in the name of the prisoner at the bar: Messrs. Drummonds did not want to be told that he had no fortune, and it was not very likely that he should have acquired that sum of money; besides upon looking into the dates, it was discovered that this four hundred and twenty pounds, together with a sum of three hundred and twenty pounds, and all but one hundred pounds, had been purchased subsequent to the loss of this bag of money: as no man is at any loss to account for money that he comes honestly by, you will easily believe, it was natural to expect he should account for this money: it occurred to the Messrs. Drummonds, upon understanding that he was intimate, and had much intercourse with a person, who I believe is a relation of his, that is named Wright, it was suspected that he might have money in the Bank in his name or some other person; application was made to him, and he, on the instant he was applied to, confessed that the prisoner at the bar had given him money, to purchase in the name of him Mr. Wright, but for the use of the prisoner, in which he had purchased four sums of money, amounting in the whole to the sum of one thousand and fifty pounds in the four per cent. annuities: when this further discovery was made, very little doubt remained in the minds of the Messrs. Drummonds, who was the person that had been guilty of this depredation in their house, and of course they thought this a sufficient foundation to apply for a warrant to apprehend the prisoner; when the prisoner applied to this Mr. Wright to lay out the money for him, he felt the necessity of accounting to him in some measure for it, and accordingly he said, a friend of his, a Mr. Stanton in the country, had two hundred pounds of the money, and two hundred pounds belonged to him, and had been sent to him for the purpose of laying out; and as to the rest, it was made up of the three per cents. which he said, he had sold out, and of the savings of his situation: when he was taken up two of the partners of this house attended Mr. Justice Addington's, and whilst he was there, and when very little or no examination had taken place, Mr. Adington having accidentally left the room, and one of the Mr. Drummonds and Mr. Wheatly having gone out for the purpose of conferring on what was necessary, one of the partners, Mr.

             being left, the prisoner desired to speak to him; Mr. Drummond had some little reluctance at going on one side with him, because the prisoner had said that if he was accused by those gentlemen he should certainly put them to death, he should pistol them; and he having made some such declaration, Mr. Drummond, who knew that when he was taken into custody there were found upon him a pair of pistols charged, and a bottle of laudanum, had therefore some little reluctance in trusting himself alone with this man, not knowing what an unhappy and desperate man might do; however the prisoner having declared he meant him no harm, Mr. Drummond was prevailed upon to walk on one side with him; he immediately told him, without promise, or application, or any thing of the kind, the prisoner told Mr.

             that he had taken the bag of money, that he had taken the thousand pounds. Gentlemen, this was supposed to end the business, all that then remained to be done, at least, as he underwent little examination, I believe at that time, Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200066"/> Addington, the Justice, thought it was necessary he should undergo some formal examination, the next morning he was brought up: nothing having passed from Mr. Drummond, no application from him, no question, I believe, even put to him whether he was the guilty man or not, but from himself spontaneously he desired Mr. Drummond to walk on one side, and he then made a full, plain, and unequivocal confession of his guilt to Mr. Drummond; he was remanded by Mr. Addington for the purpose of being brought up the next morning, and I believe, in the evening of that day, while he was in that situation, one of the clerks of Messrs. Drummond, without the privity and knowledge of any person in the house made him a visit in prison, feeling a great anxiety about the other clerks in the house, not doubting but the candour of the world would free them from suspicion, but from an excess of caution and great anxiety, Mr. Crabbs, a gentleman in the house, called upon him, and the prisoner said he did not take those other sums of money (which Mr. Crabbs mentioned to him) but that he had made those alterations in the books. The next morning he was brought up before Mr. Addington again, when he made another confession, including the substance of the confession he had made the day before, an acknowledgment that he had taken the thousand pounds, together with the other sums of money, and that he had made those alterations in the books: Mr. Addington then reduced that confession into writing, and I believe, that he signed it in the presence of Mr. Addington and Mr. Wheatley: the receipts for the transfers which had been made to Mr. Wright were found in the possession of the prisoner; upon the back of those receipts there appeared an obliteration of something that had been written on them:

             I understand, who will be called to day, will tell you in evidence, that the prisoner required him to write on the back of these transfers an acknowledgment that the money belonged to him, and that he did write such acknowledgment as required by the prisoner; in his custody they were found, but the declaration at the back of them obliterated: and this Gentlemen, I believe, will be almost the whole of the evidence; you will understand that it is the practice in this, and I believe every other banking-house, to take a security from all those persons who are taken into the employ of the banker, to account faithfully for any sums of money, bonds, bills, &amp;c. that may be intrusted to them; you know, perhaps as well as I do, that where a particular sum of money, or a particular security for money is given specifically, and individually to one clerk, for the purpose of paying it away, and receiving it in a bill, and that clerk diverts the property, he does not commit a felony (except in the case of the bank, in which case a particular act of parliament has passed) because that circumstance, which is essential, that is a felonious taking, is wanting; and that property which comes to a man lawfully, namely, by delivering to him, he cannot commit a felony upon, at least not unless there be special circumstances: it is for this purpose that the Gentlemen who are bankers always take a bond, which only goes to the extent of one thousand pounds, it not being usual to commit any sum of money, or security for money, at one time, except to a very trusty clerk, above that sum; and if a breach of trust does happen, they have a security, the bond is, that he shall well and faithfully account for all sum and sums of money, &amp;c. with which he shall or may be intrusted. Gentlemen, you know perfectly well whatever may be the inconvenience of this, upon general principles of law, the wisdom of which is very apparent, it is, and always has been uniformly held, that if the possession of property is delivered to a man, and he misapplies that property, or embezzles it, or makes away with it, he does not commit a felony on it, because the owner knows to whom he has given it, and as to the restoration of it there is no uncertainty who has it, no clandestine<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200067"/> taking, there does not consist that clandestine secret taking, and a denial when charged, so that because clerks are necessarily and occasionally trusted with specific sums of money, and therefore if they imbezzle these, are not guilty of felony; to that I attribute the confusion which has arisen upon that, by unlettered persons, and that an opinion has prevailed that a clerk cannot commit a felony on the property of his master, for which opinion there is no foundation; for if a clerk has the care of money, if he has access to it for particular and special purposes, and is sent to the bag or drawer for money for the purpose of paying a bill, if he is sent for the purpose of bringing money out of that chest, or drawer, to pay a bill, and at the time he brings that money, he clandestinely and secretly takes out money for his own use, he is as much guilty of a felony as if he had no access to that drawer; if I send my servant to my library for one book, and he takes another; if I send him for my hat and sword, and he steals my cane, he is guilty of felony: in all these cases there can be no question upon it, and most unhappy I am sure will be the predicament of that young man whose case rests upon it; in all these cases he is undoubtedly guilty of felony. Gentlemen, it of some little importance that all this should be fully understood, and it is the only satisfaction that I derive in this business, that I contribute my mite in having it fully understood in this commercial city, where there is but too much reason to believe that this opinion has led young men, who have not been upon their guard, in this licentious age, into practices which they might be prevailed upon to avoid, if this matter was fully understood, even if their sense of the obligations of morality and religion took no hold of them. Gentlemen, I am persuaded that those reverend persons who assist you in the administration of the laws, will warrant what I have said, and give it that sanction it can have alone from them, by telling you that I have not gone further in stating the law to you than the duty of a candid advocate at least: I shall proceed to call my witnesses, and they will state the facts, and with that my duty will be finished.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Pigott.</p>
               <p>What is your particular department? - I pay bank notes, and keep a balance book on account of the balance of cash in that house: on Saturday the 3d of April, Mr. Heald, the person who has the care of the money, asked me how many money bags there were in my books; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200068"/> told him; he said, then there was a bag deficient, that means there was one thousand pounds less in the iron chest than in the books; then we examined the books, to see if we could find any mistakes; we found no mistake, we could not find out that deficiency.</p>
               <p>Where is this money kept? - It is kept down in a strong room, locked up in an iron chest.</p>
               <p>Who had the immediate charge and custody of that money? - Mr. Heald.</p>
               <p>What was the situation of the prisoner in the shop? - He kept the cash book at that time.</p>
               <p>Did he pay money? - I do not recollect that ever he did.</p>
               <p>Did he receive money? - Not that I know of or remember.</p>
               <p>Do you know of his having been sent to this chest at any time to bring up money? - I do not know that he was, not in my knowledge; he had nothing at all to do with the strong room, it was totally out of his department.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, another of the Prisoner's Council. I observed you made use of this expression, that you could not find out that deficiency; did you mean by that, that you did find out other errors? - No, Sir, we did not find out any others.</p>
               <p>The key of this strong chest and this strong room, I believe, are both deposited in the shop? - They are.</p>
               <p>All the clerks and all the persons concerned in the house have access to these keys? - They may go to them, the strong room is locked up all day long.</p>
               <p>This balance book is made up from the other clerks books? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You cannot get at the data but from taking the sums they give you, the sums paid in or out? - No.</p>
               <p>If one of these clerks was to put down one thousand pounds, more or less, that would account for the difference between the balance book and the state of the cash? - I examined the tellers books every day.</p>
               <p>It all depends on the truth and accuracy of their books? - In some respects it does, we examined the books of the shop for many nights together.</p>
               <p>Is not it the practice of the house, when a clerk is received in any department, that he receives his instructions as to his duty? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pigott. You have that balance book? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(The balance book produced.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Pigot to Heald. Where is this money kept? - In a strong room below.</p>
               <p>Is that room kept locked or open? - Locked.</p>
               <p>Where is the key kept? - In the day in an open drawer, near where I do business; my department is to pay away bank notes.</p>
               <p>Has every clerk in the house, at his pleasure, access to those keys in that drawer? - He might in the course of the business.</p>
               <p>They might have access to that drawer, and come and take away any key they think proper? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I want to know whether, in the course of the business of the house, it is the business of any clerk in the house to come and take the key of that strong room? - Not of any particular clerk.</p>
               <p>Whose business is it? - It is not any one's immediate business; any clerk may take the key and go and fetch up a bag of money.</p>
               <p>Is it the business of every clerk to pay bills? - No.</p>
               <p>Is it the business of a clerk who does not pay bills; was it the business of the prisoner? - I do not look upon it to be his business, but he might do it.</p>
               <p>In the course of the business, whose business it is to go to that drawer, and take the key, and go down to the strong room for a bag of money? - There is no particular person appointed for that purpose.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Silvester.</p>
               <p>You manage, I believe, the business of Messrs. Drummonds? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200069"/>What was the station and employment of that young man at the bar? - His employment was to write the book we call the cash book; he assisted in checking from one clerk to another.</p>
               <p>Was he the pay clerk at all? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>Was it any part of his duty to go down to the strong room for the cash? - Not his duty or his business.</p>
               <p>Who has that key? - That key is kept by Mr. Heald, in a drawer near him.</p>
               <p>If Heald is applied to for a bag, and is busy, he sends down another clerk? - If another teller comes, and he says I want a bag of gold, I am very busy, he sends down another teller for the bag.</p>
               <p>Every night you balance your accounts, but on the Saturday you balance your accounts of the strong room? - Yes, we tell over the bags in the strong room, and see if they agree with our balance book; if there is a deficiency in the number of bags, it must be taken out of the strong room, or it may be taken out of the shop in the course of the day, where three or four are behind the counter, there is a possibility of that; the bags are one thousand pounds each: on Monday the 5th of April I heard that this bag was missing.</p>
               <p>What did you do in consequence of that? - We made every enquiry and examination that we possibly could; we examined the balance books for many months prior to that, but we could find no mistake.</p>
               <p>What did you do then? - We continued our examination for a long while, without any sort of success; during our examination we found leaves that had been torn out of a book that we call a waste book, which still made the matter more complicated and more distressing.</p>
               <p>Court. When was that? - I do not recollect the dates of the leaves, it was in the course of a week after the discovery of the loss.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. The suspicions fell upon the prisoner, in consequence of an entry book being tore? - His behaviour was so different from the other clerks; in consequence of that, we acquired of Mr. Harvey, the person where he lodged, and in consequence of some conversation with him, we sent to the Bank, and there we found four hundred and twenty pounds, 3 per cents. Standing in the prisoner's name; I did not go to the Bank myself.</p>
               <p>What was the salary of this young man at your house? - His last salary was eighty pounds a year.</p>
               <p>Were there any emoluments? - Yes, altogether nearly ninety pounds a year.</p>
               <p>How long was he in that station, with respect to salary and emoluments? - Twelve months at Christmas last, from Christmas 1782 it commenced.</p>
               <p>What was his salary before that? - Sixty pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding, another of the Prisoner's Council. You found the difficulties of ascertaining the matter encreased by leaves being torn out of the books? - That did not prevent us from ascertaining the matter.</p>
               <p>The only mode by which any ascertainment could be got at, was by viewing the books? - By comparing the books with the bags that we had.</p>
               <p>You think a bag might have been taken out of the shop in the manner you have mentioned? - Yes, but we should have found it out when we came to make up our balance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. If I understand you right, the balance book was not torn at all? - It was compleat.</p>
               <p>Then have you the least doubt in your mind, that a thousand pounds was taken from these gentlemen? - No.</p>
               <p>Can the deficiency be ascertained in any other way? - Not that I know of, I do not think it possible.</p>

               <p>Did he give you any reason why he struck it out? - He desired me to burn the receipts, as they were of no use, I having accepted the stock in the Bank.</p>
               <p>Can you explain why this was to be obliterated? - I cannot; I asked him his reasons, and he said the whole receipts might be burnt, as I had accepted the stocks in the Bank.</p>
               <p>Court. How long was it after the last purchase that these were obliterated? - Not many days.</p>
               <p>How many? - I do not recollect: he returned me the transfer receipts before he obliterated the acknowledgment; he called on me one afternoon, and told me that I might have burnt the receipts, for they were of no use; he then took and obliterated the acknowledgments on the back of each: I did not chuse to burn them, I kept them by me.</p>
               <p>How long after the last purchase was this? - I dare say it was within a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Court. When had you the transfer papers first in your possession, before the acknowledgement was obliterated? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Did he deliver them back according as each transfer was made? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Not altogether? - No, he afterwards had them, and delivered them altogether.</p>
               <p>You knew his situation, he was clerk to Mr. Drummond? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He brought four hundred pounds to me first, he said two hundred pounds he had received from a relation out of the country, and the other he had saved out of his salary, that was the first four hundred pounds; he desired me to go to the Bank and purchase in my name, to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200071"/> save him the trouble of going for the dividends, as he could not leave his business; I did so: he brought me afterwards two hundred pounds more, and told me that part of it belonged to a Lady in Lancaster, and the other part was part of the money that he had in the 3 per cents. which he had sold out, and wished that likewise to be purchased in the 4 per cent. which I did: the last time, he told me he had compleated the money that he had in the 3 per cents. and likewise the money that belonged to the lady at Lancaster, or Manchester.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by compleating the money? - He had sold out all his money in the 3 percents.</p>
               <p>What sum did he give you then? - Two hundred pounds; and the money that was in the 3 per cents. he told me had saved out of his salary and perquisites.</p>

               <p>This paper I see is dated the 3d? - Yes, it was the day following.</p>
               <p>My friend has asked you whether there were any promises made him at the time; I must trouble you with a question, whether, antecedent to that time, there had not been any promises made? - I have heard that there were.</p>

               <p>Did you tell them you was going there? - I did not tell them, several of the clerks knew it, I believe I mentioned it to one or two of the first clerks.</p>

               <p>What conversation passed? - I first of all expressed my unhappiness at finding him in such a situation, I then expressed how unhappy I was to hear he had denied other circumstances; I had heard of his confession to Mr.

               <p>Then was your question relative to that? - Yes, the books that were torn.</p>
               <p>What did he tell you? - I spoke to him of the unhappy situation that myself, as his friend, and many others were in; he said, I did deny the books in the morning, but I certainly tore all the books which you found to be torn.</p>
               <p>Can you relate any other conversation that passed? - I did ask him with respect to other sums of money, which he positively denied; I left him, setting forth to him the consequence that would fall upon all of us; I told him, that the only way in which he might expect any mercy from Mr. Drummond, could only be in confessing every thing that lay upon his mind, I said I hoped he would confess every thing.</p>

               <p>I am an apothecary at Charing-cross; I have known the prisoner ever since he has been in the service of Messrs. Drummonds, I have had occasion to attend him in the way of my profession frequently.</p>
               <p>Has that and his conduct in general given you an opportunity to judge of the state of his mind? - My observations were that at intervals I thought him flighty.</p>
               <p>Explain a little more particularly, whether you mean flightiness so as to approach to madness, or madness itself? - Neither.</p>
               <p>Court. You neither denominate it madness, nor any approach to madness? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Explain then your own sense of the word flighty? - That he seemed in many instances very inconsistent in his actions in life, but nothing that I could collect, as a medical man, that was approaching to madness; he seemed inconsistent in many instances.</p>
               <p>Not sufficient to justify sending him to Bedlam I suppose? - No, nor to any other place of confinement.</p>
               <p>Do you remember attending him in the month of February 1783? - Yes, he was not confined.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I believe you know the unhappy man at the bar? - I have known him for some years.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - At Charing-Cross, I keep a mercer's shop.</p>
               <p>Has it happened, in the course of your acquaintance with him, that you have had opportunities of observing the manner in which he has conducted himself, whether with regulated reason, or disturbed reason? - I think disturbed reason, it appeared so to me; I thought him a mad-headed young fellow before; Mrs. Hughes and me were going up the green park one day, and says I, this is Mr. Drummond's crazy clerk, he was laying down on his back on the grass, pulling the grass as if to eat; the second time, I met him in the particularly one morning slip-shod, with no hat, and his head on one side, and his arms wrapped up; another time he was standing at Charing-cross, and he saw me standing at the door, and in an instant he threw a large stick at me; I have seen him coming up, grinning at me, and then turn off, and have no conversation: he has been our common conversation<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200074"/> at the hair-dresser's for a long time, we wondered that Messrs. Drummonds would keep such a man in the house to be a clerk.</p>
               <p>He passed in your idea as a crazy man? - Very much so, I think, from the various actions I have seen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pigott. Did you ever happen to do business with the prisoner? - No, never the least transaction; he often used to come in and see my children, and play with them; I made the observation to Mr. Hope, one of Mr. Drummond's clerks, and he told me that he did business in the same office with him, and that he did business correct; this is three or four years ago.</p>
               <p>Did this information alter your opinion at all, that this young man was under the deprivation of his senses? - Nothing can remove that from my opinion, it made so much impression upon me at different times that nothing could remove it.</p>
               <p>Then four years ago you saw him in the summer, laying in the grass; you saw him walk pensively once, and throw a stick at you; and another time he laughed in your face? - He has laughed in my face scores of times.</p>
               <p>- CRAGGS sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You was a fellow clerk to the young man? - I was an intimate acquaintance of his.</p>
               <p>What has been his conduct, and what has been the impression of it upon your mind? - I have certainly seen him guilty of actions which no sensible man could do, and it is my firm opinion, that at times he is not in his mind.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Did you aquaint Messrs. Drummonds of this situation? - No, I suppose there is hardly one clerk in the shop but has remarked that at the time he was out of his senses, or flighty, or disorderly.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by saying flighty or disorderly? - Disordered in his mind; sometimes he would be guilty of actions that one would not think any sensible person would, I have heard many of the gentlemen say so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You do not mean to say he did not know right from wrong? - No, certainly not. I have seen him do things that it was impossible for a man in his right mind to do.</p>

               <p>What has been your opinion of the state of his mind? - I have thought him very wild at times, when he has been in a passion, and when he has met disappointments I have thought him very wild, but I have no reason to think he was a madman, he was very violent but I did not think him disordered in his mind.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Then he appeared unlike all other human creatures? - He appeared what many men are I think when in passion and under disappointments; I recollect once particularly well that upon the book being missed, I said to my brother clerk I thought it was that mad-headed genius

               <p>Mr. Fielding to Hughes. What general character had this young man? - I never heard the least word of complaint against him, only from an opinion of his situation, I communicated my opinion and my sentiments to a gentleman that attends the house, I mean Mr. Reynolds, above a year ago, and he confirmed me in my opinion.</p>
               <p>Mr. CRANK sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Having lived in intimacy with this unhappy young man I need hardly ask you what was his character? - A very high one in my opinion.</p>
               <p>You never suspected his honesty? - Never.</p>
               <p>Mr. FOVO sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. How long have you known the unhappy young man at the bar? - I have known him almost five years.</p>
               <p>During that time what is your honest and real opinion of his intellects? - I have always thought him disordered in his mind,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200075"/> intirely so, as to other circumstances of his character I have the highest possible opinion of his integrity.</p>
               <p>- RADCLIFFE sworn.</p>
               <p>I have known the prisoner about a twelve-month, last June he then first came into my house, Mr. Wright is a lodger in my house, and Mr. Murray is his uncle, he has called on him and set and chattered, when Mr. Wright has been gone down to dress, he would all of a moment start up, good God, says he, here is Harry! and point to the window, clap his hands in this manner, here is Harry just passing! and then set down very quietly; I thought it was too tender a point to say any thing to Mr. Wright, that your uncle is not in his senses: another time he came and was chatting as before, he catched a trinket of his watch all in a hurry, says he this is a very pretty thing, I will make you a present of it; says I it is past time of day with me; says he you shall have it, but Harry is not coming, and started, and folded his arms, and stood looking at the bureau for a quarter of a minute, then unfolding his arms, came and took his trinket and put it to his watch: a third time, I had several shells upon the chimney-piece, we were talking of the king's dress, then he went and took a shell, says he I will give you a guinea for it, he went and stood at the glass with his arms folded; I communicated this to Mr. Wright, says he I have often seen him do so, and I think it is so.</p>
               <p>Is that your fair and conscientious opinion? - It is from my soul Sir, I will take my oath I never heard any thing against his honesty, I had the highest opinion of Mr. Wright in the world, and I do not know more of Mr. Murray than coming to see his nephew.</p>

            ; the prisoner was not here to be tried at the time his companion stood charged with this offence at that bar, and who was found guilty; the prisoner had then escaped from justice: the facts to bring this charge home to the prisoner are shortly these; a Mr. Linton, on the 8th of July, about two in the morning, returning to his own home, was met in New-street by two persons, who came up to him and robbed him of his money, and observing his watch chain, they came back and asked him for his watch, he not willing to part with it, they snatched it from him, and at the time of the struggle one of the persons struck a knife in his side, which was the cause of his death; one of the watchmen came up, but he could only say he was robbed and murdered, they took him to Mr. Jarvis, a surgeon in the neighbourhood, and he soon after expired; Dixon was apprehended the same morning at his own house, in company with one Smith, the one was sitting in a chair, the other was laying on a bed, when the officers of justice came there, they found the clothes of this man remarkably bloody, and they found bloody water in the room as if they had been washing blood out of something; Smith said he had been in company with this man over night, that the prisoner and Morgan had been at a public-house till about nine or ten in the evening of tha t day, that they went out together and parted, he went to another public-house, the Pilgrim, where he fell asleep at one o'clock, and when he waked, between three and four, the prisoner came to this house, it was clear therefore that the prisoner had been out the greatest part of that night; when he was committed Morgan came to see him, and some conversation happening in the gaol, the Governor of Tothill-fields<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200077"/> Bridewel desired a man of the name of Davis to attend to the conversation, something passed which ocasioned suspicion in his mind that Morgan was also concerned, the prisoner being in gaol, and Morgan was detained; but by some means or other the prisoner broke out of gaol and escaped justice: the evidence I shall have to lay before you, will be first of all, the death of Mr. Linton, that he was murdered in the street on the 8th of July; that the prisoner was in company with Morgan at that time, and the conversation that passed in the prison between the man that has been executed and the prisoner; and from these circumstances you will be to judge whether or no this man is, or is not, guilty of that robbery and murder. I need not tell you Gentlemen, that it is not necessary under this indictment to prove that the prisoner was the very hand that committed the offence; because in point of law if they were in company committing an unlawful act, he must answer for it as well as the man that gave the wound: if therefore you are convinced that they were in company together acting in that robbery and that he was present, it will become your duty, however painful it may be, to pronounce the prisoner guilty of this charge.</p>

               <p>How long was it before he expired? - I fancy it might be nigh upon half an hour.</p>

I am robbed! murder! murder! I jumped out of bed, and looked out of my back window; end hallooed out who are you, where are you? but the voice went from me, I lost it; I dressed myself and came down stairs, when I came to the door they was bringing Mr. Linton down, they brought him into my surgery, he was very capable of speaking, but was not thoroughly sensible; for this reason I asked him who had done this business, he said, do not talk to me, I am a dead man, give me relief, give me comfort; I repeatedly asked him, he still said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200078"/> why talk to me, for God's sake give me ease, why talk to a dying man, let me lay down on my back; then he said, O my wife and children; he lived about twenty minutes, this wound was the cause of his death.</p>

               <p>Mr. Burdett. Do you recollect being in company with the prisoner on the 7th of July? - I do at the Queen's-head, in Vine-street.</p>
               <p>At what time? - On Wednesday between the hours of eleven and twelve, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay with him? - Till between two and three in the afternoon, on Wednesday, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Who else was in company? - Three or four other persons, I do not know some of their names, there were two persons of the name of Smith.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200083"/>Was there any body else there whose names you know? - No, I do not recollect any other person's name.</p>
               <p>Do you know Morgan? - I have seen him.</p>
               <p>Was he there? - Not at that time.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay there? - About three, the conversation of the company turned upon a sight at Tothill-fields, we went then in company to the sight.</p>
               <p>How long had you been at the Queen's-head in Vine-street? - From about eleven I think it was, Morgan was not there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. After you had been at the sight, where did you come to then? - To the same house.</p>
               <p>What time might it be then? - To the best of my recollection between nine and ten; there was the same company, the prisoner at the bar, the Smiths, Dixon went out and Morgan with him, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>What time did they go out? - About ten it might be, I cannot particularly mention the time.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay at the Queen's-head? - We returned from Tothill-fields about nine, went to the Queen's-head, and staid till ten, or a quarter after; Morgan was there, sitting in the box where I was; I believe he staid there till about half after ten.</p>
               <p>Where did you go then? - We went to the Bell, I cannot tell the sign, in Chancery-lane, it is nearly opposite Rolls-buildings.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay there? - Till about half after eleven, I know the landlord was shutting up, and the landlord desired we would depart the house.</p>
               <p>Was Morgan in company with you? - I know Dixon and Smith were in company, but for certain I cannot tell whether Morgan was or not; we went up to the top of Chancery-lane: Mr. Smith, who is a match-maker, and lived in my neighbourhood, he says, Jack, we will not part with dry lips, says I, I have no money; we were at a loss for a moment to know what house to go to; we went to the Pilgrim, then it was about a quarter or twenty minutes after twelve by the dial, the watchman was going twelve as we were going up Holborn.</p>
               <p>Who went into the Pilgrim with you? - The prisoner and the Smiths, and another person whose name I do not know; there were five of us; Morgan was a t the Pilgrim, I believe there were six, there was another person.</p>
               <p>What did you do at the Pilgrim? - We sat there, and drank and smoked.</p>
               <p>Did all the company stay? - To the best of my remembrance they did.</p>
               <p>Court. Till what time? - It was about twenty minutes after twelve when we went in, and to the best of my recollection we staid there till about a quarter after three; I did not recollect any one of the persons in the company being absent five or ten minutes together, for reasons I can tell the Court.</p>
               <p>Did all the company stay all that time that came in with you? - To the best of my recollection they did.</p>
               <p>Was you sober? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was Dixon there all the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you awake all the time? - Yes; there was a Smith in company, who is a very jocose man, and he had a rope's-end, and if any person attempted to go to sleep, he would hit them with that end; that was Smith the match-maker, I believe his name is William.</p>
               <p>As to your own part, you did not sleep? - Not much at a time, I might nod, but for this man I never slept above four or five minutes at a time; he never slept: we came out of that house together.</p>
               <p>Who was in company when you left the house? - There was Dixon in company, Morgan, and the two Smiths, myself, and another person.</p>
               <p>Where did you go? - We went and took a walk, and then went to the Queen's-head, and knocked the people up.</p>
               <p>Who was with you when you went to the Queen's-head? - The same people to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Morgan go with you to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200084"/> Chancery-lane, or did he come in afterwards? - I do not recollect his being at the house in Chancery-lane, but I recollect his being at the Pilgrim.</p>
               <p>About what time do you recollect he came into the Pilgrim? - I recollect his being there at half after twelve.</p>
               <p>Then you did not miss Morgan for any length of time after half past twelve? - He was there, to the best of my knowledge, after half past twelve.</p>
               <p>This you give as a reason why you could not sleep for above five minutes at a time, this humour of Smith's? - It was general, and when one had got a stripe, he would tell of another, so that nobody could sleep.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What are you? - I served my time to a stationer.</p>
               <p>You knew the two Smiths very well? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You knew Dixon and Morgan? - I never saw them before that night, nobody knew where to find me in company but the Smiths; I work for my brother, and have for several years past.</p>
               <p>You have had the misfortune to have been in custody? - I was taken up on suspicion, I was going up Tottenham-court-road, and some persons laid hold of me, for what reason I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Shall I tell you what it was for? - If you please.</p>
               <p>For a footpad robbery, am not I right? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Now this man you do not at all recollect his being with you at the Bell? - It is a house opposite the Rolls-buildings, I cannot tell the sign.</p>
               <p>Did you meet him in the way to the pilgrim? - To my knowledge I did not, I saw him there.</p>
               <p>How came he there? - It is a night-house, any person may go in and come away when they like.</p>
               <p>Where was you during the last session? - What time of the month, I do not recollect what time it was.</p>
               <p>During the time Morgan was tried? - I heard of that.</p>
               <p>How came you then not to come and give this evidence? - I was not subpoened, I am now, if I had been subpoened I should have come, I heard the murder was committed between the hours of one and two.</p>
               <p>And yet you say he was in company from half an hour past twelve till past three? - To the best of my recollection he was, I cannot say why I did not come on Morgan's trial, it so happened I did not.</p>
               <p>You are as sure of Dixon as of Morgan? - I speak impartially as much for one as the other, I am not quite so clear that he was in my company, Dixon sat next to me; Morgan did not, to the best of my recollection and belief they were both there.</p>

               <p>You are sure they were in company together before that, and went to the sight and all that? - Morgan did not go to the sight with me, Morgan came in at ten at night.</p>

               <p>Did you know them again? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did they resist? - Yes, I cannot remember the words, but the meaning was, they desired me to stand off, which I refused.</p>
               <p>Had they arms? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were the pistols presented to you when you came up to them? - I believe they were, but I cannot be very sure.</p>
               <p>Did you seize their pistols? - I did not, I desired they would resign themselves quietly, and they should be treated well, upon those conditions they did.</p>
               <p>What did the prosecutor say when you brought them to him; did he know them again? - He did.</p>
               <p>Was you present when his watch was found? - I was in the room at the time they resigned the watch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did they surrender at once when they were told they should be well used? - Yes, from my persuasions, they resisted at the first, but after a bit of a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200086"/> parley, about five minutes, they surrendered themselves.</p>

             of Halifax of 43 l. 7 s. 6 d. I received the money that day, at Messrs. Boldero and Co. bankers, No. 5, opposite the Mansion-house; I received seventeen guineas and a half, and a twenty-five pounds bank note, I came to receive the money the day before, and it was not due; the banker told me I came a day too soon; I was going to Berkley-square to stay all night with a friend, and on Holborn-hill I met with the prisoner at the bar, and he came up to me and asked me if I came out of the country, and I said I did; he said he was just come from the country too, and he was going to receive money, and I told him I came to receive money too, but I came a day too soon; and when we had walked about three hundred yards further on, he picked up a purse; and we went to a house, but I do not know what house, I am quite a stranger in town; he told me he had found a prize, and he would go in a house and have six-pennyworth<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200088"/> a little farther on, and see what it was; I went into that house with him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he ask you to go into that house with him? - Yes, and there were two or three more men in the house, and he said we will not say anything of it here, we will go to another house, and we went to another house a little farther on, and there was a man sitting, with a pot of beer, reading a newspaper by himself; the prisoner said, we can see now what we have found, and there he opened the purse, and in the purse there was a ring and a bill of the value, the value of the ring was two hundred pounds: this man that was in the room before we went in, says to the prisoner, suppose you give this gentleman, as he was, with you when you found this prize, eighty pounds for his share: we staid there, and I had some dinner with them, and staid there a good part of the afternoon, and they proposed to me to go and drink tea at some place or other, and spend the afternoon, if I would go with them, so we had a coach in the evening, and went to some place to drink tea, I do not know what place; so this other man that was in the room when we came in, he said, I will take you to a good place where you shall have a bed all night; we went all together, the prisoner staid and slept with me; the next morning I got up, and we had some coffee for breakfast; I was to go to the Bank to receive the money at ten o'clock, and they said they would go along with me: we all went in a coach together, I went to receive my money, and they staid in the coach till I came out: after getting my money, I went into the coach to them; I do not remember where we went, but the prisoner told the coachman to drive to some place; then, after I had the money altogether, we came to a house and had some beer, and the prisoner went out, under pretence to get his money from a gentleman to give me, and he came back in a quarter of an hour, and he told me he could not get it; and this other man that was with him called me to the door, and said, you had better take the purse and ring, it is such a fine prize you will make your fortune by it, and give him, meaning the prisoner, what money you have, and I will take you to Red-lion-square, No. 36, where I keep livery-stables, and I will give you what money you like, and the prisoner was to come to this man's house, at Red-lion-square, and to give me my own money and the eighty pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. But the prisoner was not present when the other man advised you to do this? - No, the other man called me to the door.</p>
               <p>Did you go back to the prisoner? - Yes, we both went into the house again, and I gave my money to the prisoner upon this condition, that he was to come in half an hour's time, to this other man's house in Red-lion-square.</p>
               <p>What was the prisoner to come there for? - He was to come there to bring back my own money, and the eighty pounds besides; when I went back to the prisoner to take the ring, as it would make my fortune, the prisoner proposed himself to come in half an hour, and to bring my money and the eighty pounds besides; and he was then to receive the ring back; he did not like to part with the ring.</p>
               <p>He proposed, and you agreed to it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you give him your money? - Yes, all of it, the money and the bank note; then he went away, and this other man and me walked up to Red-lion-square, to his house, and when we came about half a mile, he left me in a square; he said he wanted to go to speak to somebody a little way off, that he had forgot, and he told me to stop there till he came back; I stopped there about half an hour, waiting for him, and he never came.</p>
               <p>When did you see either the other man or the prisoner? - I never saw him till I saw him at Bow-street on Tuesday the 12th of this month.</p>
               <p>How came you to see him at Bow-street? - Mr. Carpmeal took him up.</p>
               <p>What did he take him up for? - For taking the money from me; I gave information the same day, I came to Bow-street<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200089"/> after I found there was no such man or house; I described the prisoner as well as I could: I was sent for to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Where was the prisoner when you went to Bow-street? - I saw him in the back room there.</p>
               <p>Who shewed him to you? - I do not know who it was, somebody shewed him to me.</p>
               <p>What did they ask you? - They asked me if that was the man, and I said it was.</p>
               <p>Did you know him directly? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>It was near two months before that, that you had seen him? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>How came you to know him at that distance of time, he was an entire stranger to you at first, was not he? - Yes, but I knew his face as soon as ever I saw him.</p>
               <p>What, so well as to know him again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Should you have known him if you had met him in a crowd of people, and not seen him at Bow-street? - Yes, I am sure I should have known him any where, I was twenty-four hours in his company.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure that he is th e man? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>What did he say for himself? - He denied ever having seen me before.</p>

               <p>The day that the prosecutor lost his money, he came to the Office to give information, he told me the story, and I went with him and two more; he did not know the house nor the street he described, but I took him to Mrs. Rushforth's, near Charing-cross, and that was the house: I received some information there, by which I suspected the prisoner. I have known the prisoner many years, but I never knew him in custody; I never saw the prisoner afterwards till I stopped him; I stopped him in James-street, Haymarket, I think it was on Tuesday was fortnight.</p>
               <p>Where did he live? - He kept a coffee-house in Bridges-street, Covent-garden.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect what day the prosecutor gave the information? - I believe it was the 14th of August, but I did not make a memorandum, it was about three or four in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>How did you find out the prosecutor? - He left his direction with me, and I sent for him.</p>
               <p>Did he know the man as soon as he saw him? - I was not present; this is the ring and purse which the prosecutor left with me on the day he gave the information.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Look at the ring and purse, and see if it is the same you had of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Carpmeal. Has it been in your possession ever since? - Yes, I think it has.</p>

               <p>When did you leave town? - I do not know the day of the month, it was the beginning of August I know; I did not return till the 18th or 19th of September, I believe it was the 18th.</p>
               <p>Court. When is Bristol fair? - The 1st of September.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. We have had several cases similar to the present, and there is one at this moment reserved for the consideration of the Judges, in order to settle the law, whether these contrivances to obtain money, are to be considered in point of law as felonies, or frauds punishable as misdemeanors; I shall leave the facts to your consideration; if you find the prisoner guilty, his case shall be suspended till that similar case is decided.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>How did you come by this watch? - Last Monday night, at the house of one Mr. Estol, in White-yard, Rosemary-lane, his son said he had a watch that his father was going to buy for him, he shewed me the watch, and I shewed it to Isaacs.</p>
               <p>- ELSTOL sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Proudfoot came into my father's house last Sunday morning, I have known him ever since I can remember; my father keeps a tallow-chandler's shop, and Mr. Proudfoot came in for some things that my father sells, and while I was serving him, he said he had a watch to sell, and asked me if I would buy it; I asked him how much he asked for it, he said a guinea and a half; I asked him how long he had had it; he said, to the best of my knowledge, eight or nine weeks; I told him to shew it to my father, he asked my father a guinea and a half for it; my father said he believed that was rather too much; he took the watch again and went home, after I had served him, and I went after him, and told him if he would let me have the watch upon trial, I would give him half a guinea earnest, and I did so, and he let me have the watch.</p>
               <p>Where does he live? - Right facing my father's, in White-yard, Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>What is he? - He stands at Mr. Johnson's door, a slopman in Rosemary-lane; my father was present when he gave me the watch, he is not here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood, Prisoner's Council. How long have you known Proudfoot? - Nine or ten years; he has lived there ever since I knew him first, as a servant to Mr. Johnson.</p>
               <p>After he delivered the watch to you, as you say, he still continued the same trade? - I was not present at the apprehension, I attended at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>What account did the man that had lost the watch give there? - Isaacs said he sold the watch to the prosecutor about six or seven weeks ago; the prisoner was committed by the Justice for receiving the watch.</p>
               <p>Court. Why did not your father, or somebody who saw the watch given you by the prisoner, come here? - He did not think it necessary.</p>
               <p>Isaacs. It is a very particular watch; I never saw the prisoner before, I know nothing of him.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - No, I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>You do not know that he was on board your ship that night? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Were there any strangers on board that night, except your own crew? - No, not one that I know of, I went on shore about an hour, then I returned and went to bed.</p>

               <p>I was in my master's employ, whom I have lived with eighteen years, and a seaman went by decently dressed, I asked him if he wanted any clothing, he said no, he had got a watch to sell; he shewed me this watch, I thought to buy it for my own wearing, and shewed it to a friend that was going by, who is a Jew, I gave one pound eight shillings for it; he advised me to part with it, and I says to my eldest son, who is now in this Court, the watch is not what I thought it was, says he, father, Mr. Elstol's son told me he wanted a watch, shew it to him; on the Sunday morning I went and asked him to buy it; and he said shew it to my father, I did so, and he sent his son for it, I let him have it till Wednesday upon trial; when I was taken up, I told the magistrate I should know the seaman again, if I was at liberty.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you desire to be taken on board the ship? - Yes, I did, I said so to those very people, and before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor and Isaacs. What do<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200096"/> you say to that? - When the prisoner was in custody, he begged we would let him go out, we said, if he would allow an officer to go with him, but these people would be paid, and he said he would be damned if he did, we brought out one seaman, and he said it was not the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. What was he committed for? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Jury to Verrier. Had any of your crew been on shore between the time you lost your watch and the time the prisoner was taken up? - Yes, I had several times, and several of them.</p>

             the prisoner at the bar was at home Sunday, Monday and Tuesday? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>How long have you known him? - Between four and five years.</p>
               <p>What is his character in the neighbourhood? - Very good, I never heard any harm of him in my life.</p>
               <p>Court to West. You have heard what this witness says, he says that the prisoner was at his house on Epping-forest at the time? - That is the man I bought the horse of at Uxbridge fair, and that is my witness.</p>
               <p>Court to Currer. Are you quite sure that is the man? - That is the man, and nobody else.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood to Currer. What are you yourself? - A carpenter.</p>
               <p>Do you work at your trade? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where is this woman the publican? - At the sign of the Falcon at Uxbridge, I lodge with her there.</p>
               <p>Where did you live before you lodged there? - I lived at Hackney and Newington, I was bred and born in Worcestershire, I go any where I can to get my bread.</p>
               <p>Then you are what we call a traveller, you have no place of abode? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to West. Where did you find the prisoner after the horse was challenged? - At Waltham Abby, the coachman told me he had a suspicion of two men, he had me to them but neither of them were him, we went to Mr. Silvester's country-house, and there we had some breakfast, we then took two of the horses out of the field and went to market, riding a short trot, this was the first man that I saw, that I bought the horse of; I says to the coachman, stop coachman! this is the man I bought the horse of, I said I am sure of the man, we took him into a butcher's shop, Mr. Payne's I think it was, he went by the counting-house and he called a man, whom he called his master, one Mr. Prinnicks, to know where he was on Monday, he called in Mr. Gildart who said he went after him on Monday to go to work and he was not to be found, he neither heard him nor saw him all that day.</p>
               <p>Court to Coachman. What enquiry did you make of West? - We gave a description of his person, Mr. Silvester's country-house is at Stewardstone in Essex, three miles and a half from Waltham Abby; West told me at first he purchased him at Uxbridge for five pounds ten shillings, and paid four guineas and left one pound six to pay; I went to Uxbridge and found every thing true as he had said, I staid there till between four and five, and in my way back I met West and another man, he came back the same night on the Monday, it was not convenient for me to go to Essex, I went on Tuesday, I then took him to market about twenty yards in the town, he said this is the man, says I be you sure you make no mistake; Currer gave the same account at the Falcon.</p>
               <p>Did you know any thing of the prisoner? - I never saw him to my knowledge, tho'<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200099"/>he does not live above three miles from our house.</p>
               <p>Do you know the gardener? - I believe he is something of an odd man to go in there occasionally when my Lord comes down to his country house, he might have been a servant many years, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. When was this man committed? - On Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The coachman told me when he took me that he would carry me to Bow-street and send for some friends, instead of which they carried me to Hicks's-hall, and to New-prison, I sent for this old gentleman, I had no other in the world to speak for me; if I was not innocent I should be willing to suffer.</p>
               <p>Jury to West. Who wrote that note? - The prisoner.</p>

I called my father to serve the prisoner, while I attended the other; my father turned his back, and I saw the prisoner put his hand to his breast, I did not see him take any thing; the little man offered less than the stockings cost, he went out, and the prisoner followed him; I told my father that I had a very great suspicion of them, I followed them two or three hundred yards, I saw the little man go up to another hosier's shop, and the prisoner went up to speak to a woman in a bath cloak, who seemed to be waiting for him; whilst he was talking to the woman, I spoke to a neighbour, and observing his side pocket bulged a little, I spoke to the prisoner, and there was a pair of silk stockings in his pocket; these stockings are my father's own property, I took them from the breast of his coat myself.</p>
               <p>When he put his hand to his breast, did you see him have anything? - I did not: the stockings are spun silk, they stood us in seven shillings and eight-pence a pair, but I have laid them only at six shillings.</p>

               <p>Witness. I met the prisoner coming from Bloomsbury-square, he asked me how I did, he was speaking to another man; and the man said, my dear, you may as well have a dram of something to drink; he was giving something to the man, but what it was I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Court. Your meeting was quite accidental I suppose? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I was taken up with a shilling warrant, a woman and I had a few words, and I was set down crying in the prison, it was on a Wednesday, I am almost sure it was last Wednesday was a month, my heart was ready to break, and the prisoner came to me, and said what are you crying for; I said, I have done nothing that I know of; says she, I have a kinsman that will bail you; I said, how can that be, a man I never saw. I have not got much money. I searched my pocket, and found sixteen-pence; says she, I will take that sixteen-pence, and carry it to Mr. Roberts, to go to carry to the Justice of Peace to get a copy of your commitment, against my kinsman comes to get you out of prison.</p>
               <p>Court. You gave her the sixteen-pence for that purpose? - Yes, she said, I must have more money, says I, I have no more; says she, take off your stays, says I, how can I go without my stays? I pulled off my stays, and sent my own child with them, and she brought me four shillings and sixpence, and a duplicate; when she saw the girl bring me the four shillings and sixpence, says she, they shall not hear what you and I say, come here to the vault; and when we came to the vault, says she, damn your eyes you old bitch, give me that money you have in your hand; I said, I will not give it you; says she, you bitch I will have it, and she put her hand before my mouth, and put one hand over my mouth, and with the other hand she took the money out of my hand.</p>
               <p>In what manner did she take it out of your hand? - She pulled my hand as hard as she could, and held me so, that my nose and mouth all spun out with blood.</p>
               <p>She pressed you so hard with her hand? Yes, I was almost stifled with my own blood; she went to the rest of the prisoners and set herself down, and left me in the vault almost fainting; after I stopped the blood and came to myself, I went to her, and says to her, Bet give me that money you took out of my hand; blast you, says she; you and the money, I take your money! if you say I took any of your money, I will kill you this minute: the turnkey, the fat, jolly man, came and took her away, or else she would have murdered me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mrs. Boardman, look in my face, and say, did I ever take any money from you? I am really innocent, she sent me for beer and gin, she has been learned all these things in the gaol.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the turnkeys of New-Prison, Clerkenwell; two or three days before this happened, the prisoner was committed to our prison on suspicion of a robbery, I belive this was on Thursday the 23d, I only go by the duplicate which I saw, the prosecutrix has it now: I heard the disturbance, my fellow servant went down and I followed him; he is not here, she came and said she had been robbed, her mouth bled a little, I asked her what she had been robbed of, she said four shillings and six-pence, which her child had brought in, and says she here is the duplicate, which she gave me: I then called the prisoner and asked her, she denied it, I took her immediately from that part of the prison and locked her up; she had been searched but nothing could be found, I did not search her myself.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the prisoner use any threats to the prosecutix? - No, I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Is there any other witness who knows any more of this? - No, only my child.</p>

               <p>How old is she? - She was ten years old last August.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Indeed upon my word I am as innocent as God is in Heaven, she did not say this, she only said her money was spent in gin and twopenny, and she not bailed out, she told me to raise her two guineas and she would not come against me.</p>
               <p>Jury. We wish that the child should be examined to know whether she gave the money to the mother.</p>
               <p>Court. You see thus far appears in evidence, that a duplicate for four shillings<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200106"/> and six-pence was in the possession of the prosecutrix, for the turnkey says that she upon the complaint shewed him the duplicate, which was for four shillings and sixpence, which duplicate she now has; now whether after the child has heard all that has passed you will receive any additional satisfaction, is for your consideration.</p>
               <p>Court to the Child. How old are you my little girl? - Ten, the last sixth day of August.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the nature of an oath? - No Sir, I do not.</p>
               <p>Do you know what it is to be sworn? - No Sir, I do not.</p>
               <p>You have never been told the nature of an oath, or the consequences of telling a lie if you are sworn? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Jury to Roberts. Was any money found on the prisoner? - Some of the prisoners said she had swallowed it, others said no, she had hid it in such a place which is very indecent to mention; I took her immediately and locked her up, I did not search her.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. You see when she went and mixed with the other prisoners there certainly was time enough for her to have parted with the money, but there is no evidence one way or the other as to that.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. There was an Indictment against a man for feloniously setting his house on fire, and the crime itself was not felony; the Court of King's-Bench were of opinion that the word feloniously should be considered as surplusage, and it was struck out; now in this case, it immediately refers to the goods and chattles of

The prisoner Wood was one of the men; I made every observation I could of their stature and dress, but none on their faces, except the prisoner Wood's who came to the cabin door, and laid hold of the trunks, by which I had an opportunity of seeing him; the things are the property of Captain

               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long had you been in bed before this happened? - About four hours.</p>
               <p>In a sound sleep? - I was.</p>
               <p>Any light in the cabin? - None at all.</p>
               <p>You was a good deal surprized? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you any arms on board? - No.</p>
               <p>You must have been in a pretty considerable state of alarm not to have known a pistol from a blunderbuss, may be you would not have known it from a little cannon? - It was about eighteen inches long and a brass barrel.</p>
               <p>Was the face of the person that came to the cabin door in a disguise? - He had a handkerchief tied about his head not over his eyes.</p>
               <p>Had that person any light in his hand? - No.</p>
               <p>How long was he in your view? - I suppose a minute, or a minute and an half, at one time, he received the things from the others, and came backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>When you saw Wood before the Magistrate do you recollect saying you could not swear to him, nor did not know him? - I never said so.</p>

               <p>Was there or not, a handkerchief put over the head of Wood, before the Magistrate in order that you might see whether you knew him? - I am not positive whether it was over Wood, or Giles, but it was over one; but I had sworn to him before, the handkerchief made no difference to me; I said positively before the handcherchief was put on, that Wood was one of the men.</p>
               <p>How long were they on board in the whole? - Fifteen minutes at most, we had four more hands besides me.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Who are you? I know you but these gentlemen do not. - I am an honest man, and get my living as a man ought to do, I sell razors and penknives; I exercise no other trade except pencil making.</p>

Pall-mall; I then remarked to him I thought it was very thin paper, he told me it was the same paper as always used; them were the words; he then said, that he was not a judge of the watch, he would not buy it, unless I would let him know what he should lose by it, in case it was not approved of, if he returned it; and I made an agreement to give him thirteen-pounds for it.</p>
               <p>Court. So he only was to lose the difference between pounds and guineas? - Yes, I desired him to indorse the note, upon which he wrote upon it Captain T. Freeman; there were no other indorsements.</p>
               <p>What is the date of it? - Fourth of November, 1783; I did not observe the date, I gave one pound seven shillings in change; he took the watch, it was No. 4281, H. Tylor, London; a gold watch capped and jewelled, I have the name and number taken from my watch book at the time.</p>

               <p>Court. I see here is an entry, commencing with the 17th of April, do you happen to know what that day was? - On Saturday.</p>
               <p>What reason have you to believe it was on the 19th, do you remember Mr. Pearson applying about the watch? - No, I do not on my own knowledge, I went out of town on the Wednesday, and I know it was before that time, and from some papers and memorandums I have since found, it was the 19th.</p>
               <p>What induces you to believe it was on the 19th? - I know it from other business.</p>
               <p>What other business, state the reasons of your belief that it was the 19th? - Here is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200112"/> bill of Exchange which was paid on the 7th, on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>How does that help you to the recollection of what passed on the 19th? - From my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Give us some reasons why, is there any circumstance that induces to believe it was the 19th, why that day more than any other? - I know it was not on Saturday, I am positive of that, nor Sunday.</p>
               <p>What do you say to Tuesday? - My brother can inform you that it was not on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You are perfectly accurate in taking down every thing in your business, you put down the watch-maker's name as it really is? - We may make a mistake.</p>
               <p>You may put down Smith for Johnson, then you do not mean to be exact in the name when you write it down? - We mean to be exact.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear you are exact? - I do not mean to swear that there is the same name in that book as on the watch.</p>

               <p>If you was to put down my name Silversides, that would not do you know? - I made a private memorandum of it.</p>
               <p>Court. In whose hand-writing is that entry in the book? - It is mine, I made a private memorandum.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Upon your oath, did not you say before the Magistrate you was not sure that the prisoner was the man? - I said I did not know for a certainty.</p>
               <p>Did not you even swear before the Magistrate, that it was upon a Saturday? - No, Sir, I said I believed I had a receipt, and I would go home and see for it.</p>
               <p>From whom did you say you had a receipt? - From Freeman.</p>

               <p>Robinson you know perfectly well? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Robinson was the man that had all the conversation with you? - He said he brought a friend.</p>
               <p>Did not you swear positively to Saturday before the Magistrate? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Upon your first examination, did not you swear it was the Saturday? - There were two examinations.</p>
               <p>Upon the first did not you swear it was the Saturday, and that you did not know this man, you knew Robinson, and would produce Robinson's receipt? - No, Sir, it is no such thing.</p>
               <p>Court. Who did you think you had a receipt from? - From the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>In what name? - I did not recollect the name.</p>
               <p>Then what reason had you to suppose you had a receipt from him? - From recollection, it is common for us to take a receipt, I looked for one and could not find it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I caution you, whether before the Magistrate, you did not swear positively to the 17th? - I was cross-examined by the attorney to that man; I did not swear to any time at all; I believed it was the Saturday, that was all I said.</p>
               <p>Did not the Magistrate desire you to go and fetch your book? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Did you come back with your book? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long was it? - I looked some time for the receipt, I do not know how long it might be.</p>
               <p>Did you find the receipt? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Was not the examination postponed to some future day for the purpose of your producing the receipt? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>It is a plain question; I ask you upon your oath? - I was desired to look for the receipt; I did not know what it was put off for, he was fully committed I believe on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Do not prevaricate, Sir, you had not two examinations on the same day. - No.</p>
               <p>I ask you, whether the examination was not put off on your account, and for the purpose of your producing the receipt the second day; it is a very plain question? - I cannot answer it.</p>
               <p>Why? - Because there are people that may be better acquainted with it than I am.</p>
               <p>You understand me, do not you; if not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200113"/> I am sorry for you. - Other people may be able to inform you better than I can.</p>
               <p>No, Sir, I will have it from you upon oath. Was not you desired to come a second time? turn in your mind how you can evade the question? - I do not want to evade it.</p>
               <p>Then answer it. - I think it was on Friday he was fully committed.</p>
               <p>That is not an answer; was the examination postponed to give you further time to look for the receipt? - I think the examination could not be postponed, because he was fully committed.</p>
               <p>Court. That is reasoning Sir, I must have a direct answer to a plain question; was the examination postponed to give you further time to look for the receipt, yes or no, it is a plain question, or do not you know it? - I do not know: I know that Mr. Gilbert or Sir Sampson Wright desired me to attend on Monday.</p>
               <p>Court. Was not the examination postponed till you should so attend; it is my duty as a Judge to insist on an answer to a plain question; there are but three answers that you can, as a conscientious man, give. - I understood, my Lord, that he was to be further examined.</p>
               <p>And did you understand that it was put off to give you further time to look for that receipt? - I understood so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Was not it because you neither could swear to the date nor to the name, (for they both differed) and for the purpose of producing some receipt; which you told the Magistrate you had? that is a plain question: now, upon your oath, will you answer that question? - (No answer.)</p>
               <p>Do you remember the Magistrates suspecting you of a fraud in this business? - No, on the Friday they desired I would look further, and see if I could get any further account of the watch, or see if I could find the receipt.</p>
               <p>Who spoke about the receipt? - I mentioned it myself.</p>
               <p>You take a receipt for your own safety, because this watch might might have been stolen you know? - We mostly do, we very seldom omit it, this might be through hurry of business.</p>
               <p>Was not you told by the Magistrate and by the prisoner's attorney, Sir, if what you now swear is true, it must be a mistake, this cannot be the watch? - I had not swore at all.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it said by anybody in your presence, that if the matter was as you then stated it, it must be a mistake, and that could not be the watch? - It might.</p>
               <p>Was it, Sir? - They said it could not be on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Was not you cautioned over and over again? - I told them that the date when it was bought was not in the book at all.</p>
               <p>Was not you told that men's lives were not to be quibbled away in this manner, Sir?</p>
               <p>Jury. We wish to see the book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If I understand you right, you was sent for on the Sunday, and had not your book on your first examination? - Not at first.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner fully committed at the first examination? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You attended at the subsequent time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner there then? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever attend any other examination of him after he was fully committed? - Never, I went there, supposing that the prisoner was to be brought there again, but he was not.</p>
               <p>Court. What day was you first examined before the Magistrate? - On the Friday.</p>
               <p>When were you examined again? - On the Monday.</p>
               <p>Then you were sent back again on the Monday for further examination? - It was on the Monday or Tuesday, I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Then you had from the Friday to the Tuesday to examine your papers and to look for this receipt? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was on the Friday that it was said that there was a mistake, and that it could not be the watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200114"/>Then it is examination that you have given an account of, was on the Friday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now on the Friday you were not sure that the prisoner was the man? - I would not swear then positive to him.</p>

               <p>You said before the Magistrate, that you were not sure that the prisoner was the man; did you grow more sure of his person by a longer time having passed? - At that time I described his dress and clothes.</p>
               <p>What has made you sure since, Mr. Parker? - I am very sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>What has made your memory better now than it was nearer the time you had seen him? - From my recollection of his size.</p>
               <p>(The witness's brother ordered to withdraw.)</p>
               <p>Could not you recollect the man's size when you had him in your eye? - I did not take upon myself to be sure.</p>
               <p>You were not sure when you first saw the man before the Magistrate, whether he was the same man or not, and you have worked yourself into a persuasion that he is the same man, by seeing him at the Magistrate's: what happened between that time and this to make you more sure; if it was from the recollection of your own eyes, the sooner you saw him the better you would know him? - I believed that he was the man.</p>
               <p>(Court reads the examination.)</p>

               <p>At that time, to the best of your recollection, you believed it was on the Saturday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What happened afterwards to make you believe it was not on the Saturday; what further information had you on the subject, and from what materials did you draw that information; you hear the question? - I know it was after some other business that we did, a bill of exchange that we paid on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>What do you recollect it by? - I said a bill of thirty-five pounds.</p>
               <p>When was that bill of thirty-five pounds paid? - On a Saturday.</p>
               <p>Was it the same day? - No.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was not the same day?</p>
               <p>(Looking for memorandums.)</p>
               <p>Are these memorandums your own making? - I am looking for the bill.</p>
               <p>Your brother has it. (The bill sent for.) But before the bill comes, do you recollect the name was Myers? - Yes, the drawer of the bill for thirty-five pounds.</p>
               <p>When was the date entered of the payment of that bill, was it entered the day it was paid? - Yes, but the bill was paid the day before it was due, being due the Sunday it was paid the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Do you make these entries at the times the money is actually paid, or the things sold? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at that entry of fifty pounds, paid to Mr. Peele on the 17th of April? (Hands him the book.) - This is when the money was paid, but it was put down before it was paid.</p>
               <p>Do not you enter a note for fifty pounds on the day it is paid, for what purpose did you keep it out of the book? - He sent to borrow it, but I did not know what account was between my brother and him; I kept his note, and when I shewed it to my brother, he said I might put it down.</p>
               <p>Court. That transaction seemed in some measure to be consistent with his account of it, because the putting the date of the 17th to that article, seems to imply, that some articles had been entered of a subsequent day: still you have not given any reason why this was on the Saturday, except the payment of the thirty-five pound<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200115"/> bill; can you swear it was not on the same day, can you form any recollection: you have swore that this watch was not sold after the bill of the thirty-five pounds was paid? - I am positive it was not, it was late in the evening.</p>
               <p>What reason had you then for saying it was the Saturday, and what has altered your opinion since? - I am very sure it was not on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Why was you of a different opinion when you was first examined? - The book has altered my opinion; I cannot say at that very instant that I recollected.</p>
               <p>You believed that you had taken a receipt? - I did.</p>
               <p>But you have never found any receipt from this Robinson? - No.</p>
               <p>What is Robinson? - He is an attorney I believe.</p>
               <p>How long have you known him? - I have known him by sight about three or four years.</p>
               <p>Where does he live? - He once lived in Dean-street, the last time he informed me where he lived was No. 4, Rose-street, Petty France.</p>
               <p>How long is it since you have had any dealings with Robinson? - I do not know exactly, about four years.</p>
               <p>What did you mean by saying at first that you knew him by sight? - I know him perfectly well by sight.</p>
               <p>But you knew more of him than that? - I have no other acquaintance with him than any other person coming to our shop; I had dealings with him.</p>
               <p>You must have known him well, or else he would not have come to recommend a particular acquaintance to you? - I have frequently sold him things, and bought things of him before; I sold him a diamond ring and a diamond shirt pin.</p>
               <p>When did you produce the watch; at your first examination? - The watch was never produced, I do not know whether it was ever produced; I sold it to a person that lived in Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>When? - In August last.</p>
               <p>Has that person been Yes.</p>

               <p>Turn to your book to the entry of the sale of it. - It is not in that book; I was informed this watch had been obtained by some false pretence or other, and it was found in the possession of Mr. Dobree.</p>
               <p>Then you had parted with it twice? - I went there for the watch, and received it; when I came back, I desired our man to enter this watch down, and it should be put in the window, which was done.</p>
               <p>When was that? - When I brought it from Mr. Dobree.</p>
               <p>Have you any entry of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Let me look at that: what is the reason that there was no entry in your book of the sale of this watch; do not you enter sales as well as purchases? - Yes there is, but not the number of the watch put down.</p>
               <p>Is the name put down? - I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Where is the entry of the sale of it to Mr. Dobree? - It was never sold to Mr. Dobree, I think somebody else offered it for sale to Mr. Dobree.</p>
               <p>When had you sold it? - I did not sell it.</p>
               <p>But it was sold at your shop? - So I understood.</p>
               <p>When? - I believe in two or three days after it was purchased.</p>
               <p>Then in the next week you will find an entry of the sale of it? - It is not in that book at all.</p>
               <p>Then you must send for your sale book; who is this entry on the 2d of August written by, when it was returned from Mr. Dobree? - I wrote that.</p>
               <p>Who is that additional entry of the number of the watch written by? - By one of my brother's servants.</p>
               <p>When was that added? - After I had it from Dobree, directly when I brought it home, that is a particular account<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200116"/> of at we had in our win-</p>
         
               <p>number is not written at the same time with the line? - No.</p>
               <p>When did you add the number? - When it was put in the window, and brought from Mr. Dobree.</p>
               <p>When did you write the line that precedes the number? - On the day it was brought from Mr. Dobree.</p>
               <p>"Gold watch, capped and jewelled, by Tyrer," when was that written? - I do not know the day, it was when I brought it home from Mr. Dobree; the number was written at the same time.</p>
               <p>Look at it, and see if you will venture to swear it was written at the same time? - It is not my writing, it is a servant of my brother's.</p>
               <p>What is his name? - Grayson; the number is the same hand-writing with the other.</p>
               <p>You do not know when it was written at all? - I do not.</p>
               <p>What was the reason of that particular attention to that watch in August? - No otherwise than any other watch.</p>
               <p>How came you to get the watch again? - Mr. Dobree stopped it, and brought it back to us in August, the person who offered it to him for sale, he stopped it of him; then the person applied to us, and we paid the money back.</p>
               <p>Dobree was informed that Mrs. Fairis had sold it for a bad bill? - I should suppose so, I do not know the particulars; I did not know Dobree: when I brought it back from Dobree, I desired the servant to enter it down in that book, and put it into the window among our other goods.</p>
               <p>Was there a price mark put to it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You were informed Mr. Dobree had stopped the watch when you got it of him of course? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You knew the reason he had stopped it? - No, I did not know the particular reason why.</p>
               <p>Did not you enquire the reason why it had been stopped? - I was in the country, I did not sell it to this person; I went for it to Mr. Dobree's.</p>
               <p>Did not you ask the reason? - I did not ask Mr. Dobree.</p>
               <p>You asked somebody? - Yes, they informed me that the watch a person brought that came with Mr. Robinson had been obtained from Mrs. Fairis by a false bill.</p>
               <p>When you knew this watch had been stopped, as having been fraudently obtained, by Mr. Dobree, how came you to put that up for sale in your window with a price mark? - To sell it again.</p>
               <p>What, when you knew it was the property of Mrs. Fairis, and had been stopped by another pawnbroker? - They said a bad bill.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not Pearson inform you of this the very day after the watch was lost? - I never saw Pearson, I was not acquainted with it at all; I never knew till the latter end of June.</p>
               <p>Court to Pearson. When did you first leave the information at Mr. Parker's shop? - After I had been at Mr. Croft's, on the 20th of April.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You will observe there is not a number of any watch in the whole book but this.</p>
               <p>Court. I have no doubt but that number is entered since, let the Gentlemen of the Jury look at the entry of the 2d of August, you will see an entry of a watch in one line, which seems to be all in one hand-writing; you will see afterwards a different entry of the number, which is manifestly written with fresh ink.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow to Pearson. Did he give as a reason for its being on a Saturday, that it was late at night, and he was busy? - I believe he did; we keep open till twelve of Saturdays.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow to Parker. Have you been able to procure the watch, so as to produce it to day? - I attended on the person to whom I sold it,

               <p>Count. Mr. Freeman you have heard the evidence against you, and your councel is not permitted to state any facts in your defence, all they can do is to examine any witnesses you may call, now is your time if you wish to say any thing.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I am perfectly innocent of the charge against me. My Lord, when Mr. Robinson gave the note into my hand in order to purchase the watch I had no reason to think is false, and therefore believed it to be a proper and a good note; when I went to the pawn-broker in order to purchase this watch, as I was going up the steps Mr. Robinson came close to me, I concluded of course he was going into the shop with me, as I was going to the counter I found he was gone, I then began to bargain for the watch myself, I purchased the watch and gave the note, I then returned from the shop down the steps I then saw Mr. Robinson, it appeared to me as if he had been talking to somebody at the door, I gave the watch to Mr. Robinson which he put into his pocket: Robinson asked me where I was going, I said to the other end of the town, he then said I am going to Princes-street we will walk together, I said I was going a little farther, he said I will go with you and we will return and walk together to Princes-street; I was as far as Princes-street, I did not know him to whom he was going; when we came to Mr. Parker's he then stopped me, he told me he wanted to see Mr. Parker in order to sell this watch, he said I can get more money for it here, I said I would wait for him, I acknowledge I did follow him into the shop; when Mr. Robinson saw Mr. Parker, he said, Mr.

             I want to speak to you; Mr. Parker said, wait two or three minutes; presently Mr. Parker came to Robinson him his business, Robinson had bought a watch but he wanted to sell it, there was a kind of a whisper between them, and from that I concluded of course there had been a former acquaintance, and some intimacy, in consequence of which I went from the shop to the door, and walked into the passage some time; then Mr. Robinson came out, and I said, have you sold the watch? he said, yes, Sir, I have, I said have you sold it well; I am perfectly satisfied, says he; he asked me to sup with him, I said no, we went to Oxford-road and drank six-penny worth of brandy and water, then I wished him a good night and left him: my Lord, I am charged with a matter of which I am perfectly innocent, I rest, and I hope the Gentlemen of the Jury will see clearly I am an innocent man, and I intirely leave the rest of my defence to my councel.</p>

               <p>Court. Have you used any diligence to find Mr. Robinson? - I have.</p>
               <p>What was the result of your enquiries? - I made many enquiries, I sent to many houses where he used, but I could not find him.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Garrow. Has any enquiry been made on the part of the prosecution?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. We know nothing of him my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Parker. What is become of Mr. Robinson? - I do not know, I saw him only once since, and I enquired about this business, I asked him to explain this business to me, and I desired him to give me his direction, which he did, No. 4, George-street, Petty France; I gave this direction to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Have you enquired for him? - No.</p>
               <p>Why had not you stopped him? - He said he would come forward at any time when he was called upon; says he, I understand my friend got this watch with a bad bill, I did not know it was so then.</p>

             I know very well, I then asked the question of Mr. Parker very closely, Sir Sampson Wright said, I see what you are driving at; it appeared then upon Robinson's name being mentioned, as coming to enquire after the watch, that there were many complaints against him, and that another note was then produced; I enquired no farther because they told me that several charges were mentioned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You contented yourself in making enquiry at Bow-street? - I heard he was in France.</p>
               <p>Have you endeavoured to subpoena him? - I could as soon subpoena Mr. England, or any other man that is out of the country, I know him, he is an attorney, I never saw the prisoner till I saw him in Bridewell, I know nothing about him, a very respectable man employed me.</p>

               <p>Where have you seen it? - At the coffee house in Gerrard-street.</p>
               <p>In whose possession was it? - In Mr. Robinson's, he asked me to buy him a dozen of silk stockings, and I thought he meant to give me the money to buy them, but he said, he had a note of a bankers, of fifteen pounds, and he offered this note to me; I think that was about the 16th or 17th of April last.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The date of the note I perceive, assists you to recollect when he offered to you? - No, not at all, I clearly remember his offering it to me.</p>
               <p>You had the note I suppose at that time in your hands? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You was newly come to town perhaps? - I have been in town, I have been in trade a great many years, in Ray-street, Clerkenwell; I have been in many places according to my conveniency.</p>
               <p>What sort of a broker are you? - A house broker.</p>
               <p>Where are your wares rooms? - When I buy goods, I have places to take them to.</p>

               <p>How long have you been out of business? - I have not been out of business.</p>
               <p>Where was your last large fate that you disposed of them all? - I had a sale about a little more than a fortnight ago, called the Marybone coffee house, at High-street, Marybone.</p>
               <p>O, you are an auctioneer? - I am not an auctioneer, I sold them by hand.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Freeman? - I have known him five or six years.</p>
               <p>Have you known Mr. Robinson as long? I believe I have, I knew him when he was an attorney, in the Temple; I do no know where he lives now.</p>
               <p>How lately is it since you saw him? - I met him in the street, about a month ago, he went on the other side the way, I did not speak to him.</p>
               <p>Was Freeman present at the time he offered you this note for stockings? - No.</p>
               <p>What makes you remember it, it was not anything remember? - I thought it was very odd, because I said to him, I had better go and get the calf first, he objected to that.</p>

               <p>What is there particular in the note that you remember it by, who is it drawn upon, who is the drawer? - Bowles, I think it is drawn upon Messrs. Crofts and Co. in Pall-mall.</p>

               <p>Then he lived there? - He lived there to be sure, because I apprehend it is what they call a shop bill.</p>
               <p>Then it is not a bill of Exchange? - No.</p>

               <p>Could it fall from any other house? - I do not imagine it could, but if it had it must have gone in an oblique direction, and probably I had been struck with it.</p>

               <p>I keep a fish-hook shop in Crooked-lane, on the 4th of this month, the prisoner Samuel brought the fish-hooks to my shop in sale; I knew them to the goods that had been packed, that we had sold to Mr. Dobrie, he lives in the same lane I called my man down that made them, and he knew them to be our make. I stopped Samuel, and before Alderman Plomer, Mordecai acknowledged he gave them to him, and had them from one Farmer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. You sell a great many of those hooks in the course of a year? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is there anything material in those packages from others; did you mark the hooks in any mode? - I did not.</p>
               <p>How many may you sell in a year? - A great many thousand.</p>

               <p>And a great many thousand that are manufactured by the same hands? - Yes, the same man that makes one makes the rest; Samuel said he had them on commission, and would produce the man he had them of.</p>

               <p>In the month of June I was in London, on the 9th or 10th, the day when the blue children were shewn in St. Paul's Church-yard; I was walking up <placeName id="t17841020-80-crimeloc368">Ludgate-hill</placeName>

               <p>What reason have you for believing that the prisoner was the person that took your watch? - Because he was the only person that bore against me, and the most likely person I could think of.</p>
               <p>You did not see him have your watch? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor his hand at your pocket? - I felt a hand, and laid hold of it; I did not see it, I only felt it as he was working at me.</p>
               <p>Was that the prisoner's hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can you be sure it was the same hand that picked your pocket? - I am very clear it was.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He denied it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming through the mob, there were many people round him as well as me; I was not nigh him; he said he had lost his watch, I know nothing of it, I had no watch upon me.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker in Princes-street, Leicester-fields; I lost some goods, which I searched for and could not find, the goods were to the amount of six hundred and twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Can you yourself, Mr. Priestman give any account? - I went to one of the prisoner's lodgings in Oxford-street, about three days after I missed these things, and there I found a gold watch, chain, and seals, and a pearl locket, and various other things that are in this box; they were locked up in a large chest: a paragraph having appeared in the paper that I had been robbed, two people applied to me in the morning, and informed me.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he ever acknowledge that lodging to be his? - Not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>How did you acquire the knowledge of the lodging being his? - By the information of two gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the prisoner in your shop? - Twice, I think.</p>
               <p>Who was he acquainted with there? - Nobody as I imagined; but I asked Hulett the apprentice, as I came into the shop one morning, three or four months before the robbery, and Stockdale was standing in the shop, and as soon as he saw me he moved off very quickly, I asked the boy who he was; one time I remember his coming in when I was in the shop, and on seing me he started and asked for something which I had not, and he turned round and went out of the shop, and I then asked the boy who he was: I sold the watch some years ago to a gentleman, and it was pledged with me about two years ago, I am sure it had been in my shop, and had not been parted with after it was pledged; I have not a doubt about the locket.</p>

               <p>Court to Shelley. Do you remember whether the prisoner brought you the ring, or called for payment of it afterwards? - He brought the ring, and said he brought it from his master; I did not pay him then, I paid him the next day when he called again.</p>
               <p>Barker. I have a memorandum of the name and number, the number is 107, and I remember this seal with the head of Voltaire upon it, I can swear to the seal.</p>

               <p>Mr. Perry took them both out of my hand; my trial came on without my knowledge; Mr. Garrow will state my case.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, the witnesses to the prisoner's character on the former trial were very respectable, and were people of great consequence.</p>
               <p>Mr. James. I can only say on the part of the prosecution, that we shall have no objection to his having the benefit of his former character.</p>

               <p>What did you hear on Sunday? - He came to one door and broke through, and he tried a good while, and could not get through, he tried at one of the windows; then he staid half an hour, he tried to wrench the door, he opened the door to come into the stables; I got up directly: after he tried the door a considerable while he came out and tried the window, and opened the sash, but the shutter on the inside was barred, and the access that way could not be made; then he tried to get the door open, then he broke a hole through the racks of the stables in the left side; he could not get through, then he tried another hole; while he was breaking the last hole I went and told Mr. Cousens who it was.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time of night was it? - It was about eleven, I was just then in bed, and it was about three when we took him; the cieling he broke was over the room where I lay, I heard the window crack, and I opened the window to see.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What part of the house was broke when you saw it? - Several parts, the windows on the inside, and all the cieling in a room where my men used to sleep.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a bailiff to Mr. Bond, at Hendon; on Sunday the 10th of this month, the last witness came to me for me assistance, saying there were thieves breaking into the great house, I went across the yard, and I heard a very large piece of wall fall on the floor, I looked round and did not see anything; I went up to the house, and I saw this man without his shoes and no stockings, he laid upon his belly between the rasters and the cieling of the room where this woman slept;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200129"/> I took him two or three taps with a fork; he said he did not come with intention to rob the house, that he denied positively; he said the reason of his coming there was to go to the young woman; he broke a hole, and finding he could not get through there, he broke another large hole, big enough for a man to get through; he had worked there before: I took him into custody.</p>

               <p>Court. In what part of the house was he when you found him? - He was over the cieling of the maid's room.</p>
               <p>Is that within the dwelling house, or is it part of the stables; is it a garret? - No, he was between the tiles and the cieling; I never saw that place before, though I have been there nine years.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say to you? - He said he was very sorry for it.</p>
               <p>The place where you found him was over the cieling of the maid's room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How could he have got through to the maid's room, could he have got through the cieling? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Panton. Had you desired this man to come to you? - No, I never spoke twenty words to him in my life.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I worked for Mr. Bond three weeks, and I slept in that same room four nights, and Mr. Bond gave me three shillings; I went to the house and spent eighteen pence, I had some bread and cheese, and the bailiff came up and asked me if I meant to sleep there, and he said he would never let me sleep there no more; so I told him, no Sir, I will not; I went into the barn and pulled off my shoes, and one of the people asked me where I was going to, I told him I was going to ease myself, I would not tell him where I was going to, I was going after this woman, I was very much in liquor; I went to the stable door and it was open, and the room where she slept in was over it, the door was latched, I could not open it, there was a loose board, and I pulled that off; I could not get in at the door, and I went up in the stable loft to the cieling, and I caught hold of the rafters, and it fell in the room; I went away from that, I set myself down upon a truss of hay, in a little while I saw a candle come, and one of my feet hung down from the loft, the man asked me what I was doing there, I told him, I want to come at this woman, and he told me to come down, and I came down; I did not mean to rob the house.</p>
               <p>Court to the Bailiff. Was he drunk or sober? - He was as sober as I am now</p>
               <p>Did the publican say what he had had? - He lost some money out of his purse, he confessed the night he was taken, and some halfpence he owed me, and he had about eighteen or twenty pence in his pocket out of three shillings.</p>
               <p>Then how much do you rocken he had drank? - I do not know, he was drinking with three of his comrades that lay in the barn with him.</p>
               <p>Did you call up his comrades? - No.</p>
               <p>That is pretty extraordinary; did you enquire of them whether they were sober at the public house? - They said that he was fuddled.</p>
               <p>What did you think of his story about the maid? - I asked him if he had any connections with her, he answered he had not; says he, I would not value killing her any more than I would to stick a pig, and if I should get my liberty again won he to her.</p>
               <p>Court. I fancy he was not sober then.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. These articler of furniture are not portable, or objects for a housebreaker? - There are counterpanes and blankets, and pewter and a coopers,and a great number of things; I sleep there in hay-making time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What is the character of the woman? - I never heard anything bad of the woman, I had an opinion of her, she was not my hired servant; she worked for me.</p>

            ; on the 21st of October, between four and five in the afternoon, I was employed in serving two ladies with sprigged muslin at the end of the counter, near the street door, the prisoner came in and enquired for some clear lawn.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was the prisoner? - I am positive of it; one of our young men waited upon her close to me, and shewed her the clear lawn, I saw him, and she bought either an eighth of a yard, or a quarter, and gave him a shilling in change, and he was rather suspicious of the shilling not being good, and he left her and went to the window facing the street.</p>
               <p>And was this young man and the prisoner further in the shop than you were? - They were, the prisoner passed me when she came in; he came close to me while he went to look at the shilling; I was busily employed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200131"/> in serving a customer, and I thought, I had a kind of a side view of her, and I thought she caught up something, I could not tell what.</p>
               <p>Could not you distinguish at all what it was, whether it was black or white? - No, I absolutely could not, nor whether it belonged to her or us, I could see her catch at something quite quick, but I could not discern the colour of it at all.</p>
               <p>But you had very little doubt at that time, but she must have taken up something? - Why really I thought she must have taken up something belonging to us, or else she would not have taken it in that manner; and she immediately walked forwards towards the door, at this door there was a chair fixed to keep it open, she stood there just against the chair expecting to have the change; I did not know how to proceed, not knowing whether she had anything belonging to us or not, but I stared her pretty full in the face, at which she seemed to be much confounded, and she began to work something that appeared like a bundle under her cloak, to work it, to drop it down behind, and I immediately stepped round to her, and the piece of muslin dropped down behind her.</p>
               <p>Did you see that it dropped from her? - I saw it drop from her.</p>
               <p>Had she a cloak on? - She had a black mode cloak.</p>
               <p>Where did it seem to drop from? - From under her cloak, I saw it when it fell.</p>
               <p>Was there any other woman near her when it dropped? - There was a Lady that my brother was serving.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that it dropped from her? - Positive, I had hold of her by the arm, I could positively swear to her, I knew it to be my muslin.</p>
               <p>By what marks do you swear to it? - By the private marks, and the quantity, and the letter mark, which was nine yards seven-eights, 6. F. a stroke and a B.</p>
               <p>Were these marks in your hand writing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you measured it yourself before? - Yes, I saw it about five minutes before the prisoner came in.</p>
               <p>She was not out of your shop? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott, Prisoner's Council. Have you been here before this sessions, in any prosecution of this kind? - Not any.</p>
               <p>Is this woman a stranger at your shop? - I cannot swear positively that I ever saw her before.</p>
               <p>Had she a capuchin on? - She had a cloak on.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive she had any thing under her arm, at the time she came into your shop? - She had a bundle.</p>
               <p>You have said when she got further into the shop, you had a kind of side view of her, and you thought you saw her take something up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Pray if you thought you saw her take something up, how came it you did not think proper to speak to her at that time? I spoke to her two minutes after.</p>
               <p>It is a little extraordinary to me, you did not charge her directly? - I was willing to go upon sure ground, there were other customers in our shop.</p>
               <p>Then you saw her take it? - I could not be positive.</p>
               <p>You believed so? - I thought so.</p>
               <p>You presumed so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I cannot get over one particular of your evidence, that at the time you saw her take something which you now call muslin; it is a little extraordinary to me, that you should not in the first instance have told the woman of it? - I could not well speak sooner to her, for she had to walk round to the chair at the door, by my staring at her she was much confounded.</p>
               <p>I am not much surprized at an innocent poor woman being a little confounded at the manner you have described, I fancy it is enough to bring a blush in an honest woman's countenance; you have thought proper to lay this indictment capitally, therefore I would have you a little cautious as to the manner of your giving your evidence? - I shall give it true.</p>
               <p>Had she a bundle? - She had.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200132"/>What was the contents of this bundle that the woman had? - I declare I forget now, it was a jacket or something of that kind.</p>
               <p>Was there several articles? - No, there was not, there were two, the bundle was opened at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Jury. There was no muslin in that? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my council.</p>
               <p>(The muslin produced and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>I am a shoe-maker, the prisoner came to me, I made him thoes when he lived at Mr. Whateley's, who is a silk mercer in St. Martin's-court; he called on me about a fortnight ago, and after giving some necessary orders for shoes, he had a bundle under his arm, tied in a handkerchief, which was this petticoat; he told me he had sold a petticoat to an acquaintance of his at Mr. Bennett's, for sixteen-shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. How came that conversation? - He said, his master had sold it to a customer, who said it was damaged, and his mistress would not take the petticoat back from the customer, but stopped it out of his wages; and he said, he would lose two shillings by it, if he could get a customer for it, if not he would send it down in the country to his mother; then I called my wife down, and she said fourteen shillings was more than it was worth, but if I had a mind to have it I might, and I agreed for fourteen shillings; the prisoner came a few days after, and had a pair of shoes, and I ballanced accounts with him, and there were four shillings coming to me, allowing fourteen shillings for the petticoat.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you very sure that is the petticoat? - Yes, I never had it out of my possession, I wrote my name upon it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was there any ticket upon it? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. Then you understood from the prisoner, that there was a considerable bickering him and a part of his master's family? - I understand he disliked his mistress, for he told me, she was a devil to live with.</p>

               <p>Did he say any thing about the things? - No, he asked me on Sunday if I wanted a petticoat, he owed me some money for washing, I told him it would be of no service to me, as I was a hard working woman.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowles. At this time he knew you worked for Mr. Bennet; I suppose you are frequently intrusted with Mr. Bennets's property? - Yes, a great deal.</p>
               <p>Of course you observed his shop marks? I never observed any shop marks, I work for a great many shops.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did he ever bring any parcels to you? - Never, he never was in my room before he brought the mode.</p>
               <p>Court. What may be the value of this russel petticoat? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>What may be the value of the mode? - I do not know what it measures, nor nothing; I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Look at these different things, begin with the russel petticoat.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are my property.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know them by any marks, describe the marks? - It is marked S. I. B.</p>
               <p>Is that mark in your hand writing? - My apprentice's.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the other marked? - No.</p>
               <p>Is there any appearance of a mark being pulled off from the other? - I do not see any.</p>
               <p>Court to Taylor. Look if that mark S. I. B. is your writing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200134"/>Can you say that that is your master's petticoat? - I cannot positively swear to the petticoat, but I can swear it is my mark.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowles. How long ago is that? - I cannot justly tell.</p>
               <p>It may be a year? - No, not above three months.</p>
               <p>Have you ever lived in any other shop? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. When you sell them, do you sell them with the marks on? - We always pull the marks off.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the other petticoat? - I cannot swear to it, there is no other mark than the mark of one of the witnesses names.</p>
               <p>Is there any appearance of a mark being picked out? - I do not see any.</p>
               <p>You say you always take out the marks before you sell them? - We generally do.</p>
               <p>You can only speak to your own practice? - I have seen my master and mistress take it off.</p>
               <p>But you cannot swear that they always do? - No, I cannot, but it is a common practice.</p>
               <p>The prisoner has served customers with goods of this kind? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You cannot take upon you to say, that he always took off the marks from those goods, that he delivered to those customers? - No, I have seen it frequently done.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. The petticoat which has no mark upon it, can you ascertain that? - Yes, I believe it is my own property, we generally know our own manufactories.</p>
               <p>Do you mean that you make the stuff, or that you made up the petticoat? - We generally know the work of our people.</p>
               <p>Are all your petticoats quilted in the same diamond? - Yes, of the black sort.</p>
               <p>Does not the same workwoman work for other shops? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Do you employ this workwoman all the year round? - I employ a great many all the year round.</p>
               <p>Had you sold any petticoats of that sort? - Many.</p>
               <p>Lately? - We are selling them every day.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the woollen cloak? - I will swear this is my cloak.</p>
               <p>How do you know it? - It is my own cutting out.</p>
               <p>I there any mark upon it? - There is none on it now, I have got the fellow piece of it at home.</p>
               <p>Jury. But have not you sold many of your cutting out? - Yes, to be sure, a great many.</p>
               <p>And how do you know that that is one stole, or one you have sold?</p>
               <p>Court. Look at the stuff petticoat? - There is no mark upon this, but I believe it to be my property; because there is only one man that makes stuffs in this manner which I buy them of.</p>
               <p>Why that man deals with other people besides you? - No doubt of it, a great many.</p>
               <p>Then how can you venture to swear that that is your petticoat? - Because it is sold by one man, we generally know our own work, this is made by my people.</p>
               <p>Look at the silk mode? - Here are ten ells and a half.</p>
               <p>Did you measure it before you lost it? - No, it is done up in half ells.</p>
               <p>Is there any mark on that? - No mark at all.</p>
               <p>Is all the mode in your shop done up in that quantity? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you cannot swear that to be your property? - Yes.</p>
               <p>By what? - I have the fellow piece, and the folds and notches are all the same.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by the notches? - The scissars.</p>
               <p>What may be the value of that mode? - Fifty shillings.</p>
               <p>Is that the very lowest? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you examined the folding and the notches very accurately? - I did, before I swore to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. I suppose you look upon yourself as a pretty qualified witness, you can swear to things without marks as well as with; you undertake to swear to that russel petticoat, that the mark was picked out? - No, I supposed it had been picked out.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200135"/>Then you chuse to suppose upon your oath where a man's life is in question, that will be in the observation of the Jury; do you call this russel petticoat extraordinary, such as are not commonly seen? - We generally know our own manufacturing.</p>
               <p>Are they uncommon? - No.</p>
               <p>How many exactly tallying with that pattern, have you now in shop? - Many.</p>
               <p>Very many? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And how many had you in before you suspected this man? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>And yet you chuse to swear to that petticoat? - I believe it to be mine.</p>
               <p>You observe that your conduct does not escape the notice of those that are much more more impartial than the advocates for the prisoner; Why will you undertake to swear that petticoat is your property? Do you undertake to swear that from any other motive than a desire to convict that man? - No, Sir, I do not wish to convict him.</p>
               <p>Then your conduct is extremely extraordinary; however you tell me that petticoat is extremely like many that you have now, and had before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If any other petticoat of your shop, of a similar pattern to that were produced to you now, could you distinguish that from the other? - Not of the same pattern.</p>
               <p>And you have many of that pattern still in the shop? - I do not know that I have just at present.</p>
               <p>Why, you swore just this moment, that you believed you had? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Now as to this cloak, there is no mark upon that? - It is my own cutting out.</p>
               <p>Do not other people cut out cloaks of that size and length for sale? - There is a difference in cutting out, every one does not cut out cloaks alike.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that more persons do not? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What can be your reason for knowing it independant of its being your own cutting out? - It is cut off the same piece of cloth I have at home.</p>
               <p>Is not that very kind of cloth made up into such cloaks? - I do not know that it is.</p>
               <p>Why do not you see of a rainy or cold morning, hundreds of women walking about in cloaks of that sort of cloth? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Since that cloak has been taken, have you measured it with the other piece of which you say it is part? - I have not.</p>
               <p>But yet you swear that comes from that very piece? - I am very sure of it.</p>
               <p>Without measuring, and without a mark, you are sure? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. We are of opinion it is a common cloth for cloaks, that as he has cut out many cloaks, that may be his cutting out, and his cloth, and yet he cannot be sure.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. Now this silk mode you chuse to swear to, that without a mark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Does that differ from many hundred yards of silk mode which are manufactured every year in this city? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>During the time this prisoner lived with you, what was the nature of your harmony together, were there not some bickering between him and part of your family? - Not the least in the world, I always behaved to him like a Gentleman.</p>
               <p>The nature of your behaviour here, does not shew that, my friend? - That I must leave to you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My master said, if I would tell him where the property was, he would freely forgive me, and not take me before a Justice.</p>

            ? - Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>What state of body and mind was he in then? - When he came there he was in a very healthy state; he was there as under butler, he had the care of the plate; this is four years ago.</p>
               <p>While he was in that service, was his mind at all disordered? - It was so much disordered, that he was quite mad, and was under the physician's hands, and was in a strait waistcoat, and lashed down several times; he was sent to the mad-house at Hoxton, and was there between two and three months; I saw him there, he was quite mad.</p>
               <p>What mad-house was it? - One Harris's.</p>
               <p>Did Sir John receive him again into his service? - Yes, when he got well he was there some time; he went into the country, and there went mad again, and ran away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, Council for the Prosecution. Was you there? - No.</p>
               <p>Then do not tell us. - This is the account that the family gave of him there, Sir John sent him down to his friends in Warwickshire, he was there in consinement some time, he got well again and came to town; some time after that he got into Lord Milford's service.</p>
               <p>Have you seen him at any time very lately? - I never saw him after he entered Lord Milford's service till I saw him in Tothill-fields; I saw him a little before he entered Lord Milford's service; I always looked upon him a very honest simple fellow, but not very acute.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Where did he live before he went to Lord Milford's? - At Sir

               <p>To the best of my knowledge, the prisoners came to my house about a month ago, and said they would get such things for me, I was in the back room, and I laid down twenty-four shillings; I do not know which of them took it up; we agreed for four half guineas for twenty-four shillings, and they laid them on the table, and I laid down the twenty-four shillings; I did it for information to find out the makers.</p>
               <p>Did you suspect them to be bad? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you give information to Bow-street? - Yes, before that, I gave the four half guineas to the people in Bow-street, four or five days after I had them; I am not sure of the prisoners, but to the best of my knowledge they are the men.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about it? - Yes, I have a great deal of doubt, they were not in the same dress, I saw them but twice, and they were in slouched hats, I could only see their chins.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. So, this was a trap contrived by you and the gentlemen of Bow-street? - It was.</p>
               <p>Did you know it was a felony to buy bad<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200139"/> money, at a less price than it imported to bear? - I did not buy it for myself.</p>
               <p>Who has paid you the money again? - I have not been paid it again, but they told me I should not lose it.</p>

               <p>Was not your licence stopped by Sir Sampson at the usual time of licencing? - Not this year.</p>
               <p>It was not stopped for any good, I take it for granted? - Not for any harm.</p>
               <p>Was not this trap to lead to your getting a licence? - No, my licence was not grumbled at, why should it.</p>
               <p>Do not argue with me, but answer the question. - Not to my knowledge, I did not know that my licence was to be stopped.</p>
               <p>Was not it an inducement held out to you by the officers? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not they tell you, that your licence was to be stopped, and that this would be a recomendation to you? - May be they thought so.</p>
               <p>Did not they communicate that thought to you, Sir, upon your oath; now mind what you are about? - They did.</p>
               <p>Then why did you hang back so long from that? - Because I should be sure of what I say.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow to Prosecutor. You occasionally sell whole cards of lace? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How many cards of lace do yo think you may have at this hour in your shop, with identically the same marks on them? - Perhaps half a dozen of different sorts.</p>
               <p>How many in general may you receive of the same sort when you lay in your patterns? - Perhaps two or three cards in a year; we seldom lay in more than two or three cards of a pattern.</p>
               <p>May not you have sold a great member of lace on the cards, with the marks on them? - Very possibly we may; yes, I dare say we have.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you examine your box of lace to see whether there was any wan g? - I did not, because I saw her take it, therefore I had no reason to go to my box; I saw her put it behind her cloak.</p>
               <p>Did you ever examine to this day? - No.</p>
