               <p>I came into Mr. Smith's house; they pretended to be very fatherly and good to me, having a little dependence coming to me, he said, he would see me righted if I would make him a will and power; and he sent for a lawyer in order to deprive me of my property; Mrs. Smith came down into the kitchen, and said, as I had been so good to the family, she did not know how to make me amends, and put the ring on my finger; I wore the ring till Saturday night, then being in distress I pawned it.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. SMITH. Did you give her the ring? - No; I shewed her the ring, but never delivered it out of my own possession.</p>
               <p>Did you consent to her taking it? - No.</p>
               <p>After you had shewn her the ring, did you put it into the drawer? - I put it into the case, and then into my drawer, and locked it.</p>
               <p>When you found it missing, was the lock broke? - No.</p>
               <p>How was it opened? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>PRISONER. She gave me some diamond ear-rings at the same time; I pawned the ring for a guinea, bought some asparagus and other things, and gave her the change, and gave it her.</p>

               <p>How long might this pursuit take up from the time you was robbed, till the time you got to the constable's house? - Not more than half an hour; I lost fight of Lucas turning the corner, but it was a moon-light night.</p>

               <p>On the 21st of last April I met with Mr. Hughes in the City-road; he asked me to assist him in taking these two men; I followed them directly: I stopped opposite the coach, seeing them come from it; they ran from the coach by me; I followed Harris into a field; when we got almost to the further side of the field, a little way off Hoxton-square, he turned round with a pistol; I dropped back, he came up to me, and fired the pistol at me.</p>
               <p>Did nobody run after him to try to take him but you? - No, not till I had got him upon the ground; then Thomas Brumsdell came up.</p>
               <p>Did you run or walk when you followed him at the further end of the field? - He ran as hard as he could, and I ran; he ran twenty or thirty yards, and then fell down; he got upon his legs again, and I was got up to him; he had a hanger in his right hand; he throwed the money and his pistols out of his left hand.</p>
               <p>Did you pick it up? - Yes, after we had secured him. He cut me over the fingers with his hanger; I got it out of his hand when I got him upon the ground; this is the hanger (producing it) I picked up 3 s. 6 d. afterwards some other people picked up some more, and gave to Mr. Hughes; this is the pistol (a small pocket pistol) I marked it;

This man has been advised by Justice Wilmot's thief-catchers; when he came into Wilmot's office, he asked if I should be cast for death, whether he would have 40 l. all the court laughed at him; he swore falsely; the thief-catcher took him backwards, and told him, he should have the money if I was cast, and then he said he would swear that I was the person. -</p>

               <p>Last Monday was three weeks, coming from Mr. Whitefield's tabernacle, at half past eight o'clock in the evening, I saw a coach stop at about 40 or 50 yards distance, or hardly so far, either a hackney or a stage coach; the moon shone bright; I said to Mr. Merrit, who was with me, I apprehend some villians have stopped that c oach in order to rob it; he said, No, it may be somebody has rode so far and wants to get out and walk; we walked till we came opposite to the coach, which stood almost<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177705140007"/> opposite the Shepherd and Shepherdess in the City road, in the road to Islington; one of them came away from the coach door, the other seemed to step down from out of the coach; Mr. Hughes looked out and seeing us stand there, asked us whether we would assist in taking them.</p>
               <p>Was he got out of the coach then? - No; he looked out of the coach and asked us to assist him; then he jumped out of the coach and set out after them; one ran towards Shoreditch, the Hoxton way; Merrit and I pursued Harris; when we came to a rise of a hill, Merrit and the prisoner Harris outran me; when I came to the bottom I heard the report of a pistol; when I got up to the top of the hill, I saw Merrit had got Harris down under him, and Merrit was calling out for assistance; I went up to him as fast as I could, and I saw a pistol lie eight or ten yards from him on the ground, and a cutlass about a yard or yard and a half from the side of them where they were tussling together; he asked me to tie the prisoner's hands; I took off my garter in order to bind his hands; he swore he would not have his hands bound; I told him if he made the least objection I would run him through with the hanger; I bound his hands, and we set him upon his feet; Merrit took up the pistol, I kept the cutlass myself; one had hold of one side of his collar and the other of the other; we led him down and gave him into charge of the constable.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that Hughes was not out of the coach when he asked you to pursue the men? - I saw him looking out of the coach; when he asked us to assist him whether he was out or not I cannot justly say, it was such a small distance of time, he was out in a minute.</p>
               <p>When you came up did you perceive either Harris or Merrit wounded? - I perceived Merrit's hand to be all over bloody.</p>
               <p>Which hand? - I believe it to be his left hand.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the pistol whether it was charged or not? - No; I took it up and gave it to Merrit, he carried it to the constable.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing about Lucas? - No, because he took the other road; after we had given the prisoner into custody of the constable, we went back to the place with a lanthorn and candle and picked up two straight half-guineas, which we gave to Mr. Hughes.</p>
               <p>Court to Hughes. Have you those two half-guineas? - No, I spent them long ago.</p>
               <p>HARRIS. The coachman and the gentleman swore before the justice that it was a dark night, now they say that it was a moon-light night.</p>

               <p>How did you know it was the same? - I saw it before and I saw it picked up.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was loaded? - There was something in it; I suppose powder and ball; it was delivered to the constable; we took him to the constable; I took up this sheath of a cutlass (producing it); the ( cutlass fitted the sheath exactly.)</p>

               <p>What sort of a night was it? - Cloudy.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough to see plainly the men? - I could see the pistol in his hand shining; I could not discern any thing else.</p>

               <p>Was it moon-light? - No.</p>

               <p>Could you see so far as that? - I saw them, it might not be quite so much as fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Was it moon-light then, or did the moon rise afterwards? - It was rather a dullish night, the moon had not made its appearance as I saw.</p>

               <p>To BRUMSDELL. Did you hear any thing said to the coachman? - He said, Gentlemen, will you assist me in taking these thieves? we replied we would.</p>

               <p>Do you know the prisoners? - I can't swear very positively to Harris, but to the best of my belief he is one; I can say nothing to Lucas; I know there were two.</p>
               <p>How did the persons behave that robbed you? - They swore a good deal; Harris said, Give me your money; give me all.</p>
               <p>Had they any arms? - Yes, a pistol; he presented it to me and Mr. Hughes; Harris was much confused; first he waved his pistol all round and then presented it to my breast and with an oath said, Give me your money, all your money.</p>
               <p>Where was the other man? - Behind him.</p>
               <p>In what manner did he attack the coach? - He rapp'd at the coach door; I let down the window and he opened the door.</p>
               <p>What did he take from you? - One guinea.</p>

               <p>What sort of a night was it? - The day was hardly gone.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough to see their persons? - Yes; when he was before the justice he was in another dress, which rather confused me, and made me not positive; as soon as Harris went away, Mr. Hughes said to three people in the pathway, will you give me assistance? and they said, yes.</p>
               <p>Was he in the coach or out of it then? - In the coach.</p>
               <p>Did the coach stand still then? - Yes; Hughes was going out, he called upon the coachman for his assistance; the coachman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177705140009"/> came down immediately and run after them.</p>

            : the prisoner came to our shop last Saturday evening and asked for some patent cauls; I was at tea at the time; I was informed she was there, and having a suspicion of her, I watched her and saw her take the caul while the young woman was reaching a box; after she went out of the shop I sent for her back by the porter, and then I sent for a constable, but before he came, she put the net-caul between her petticoats and dropped it on the ground; we had missed several things after she had been at the shop.</p>

Lewis said, No, he could not give him any, because he was only an interloper himself; Britain made answer, then I shall take care of you as well as other; so one word brought up another, and then they went out of doors to fight.</p>

               <p>Who made that answer? - Hall; with that I laid hold of them.</p>
               <p>Did you lay hold of both? - No, only one; I held him as fast as I could; he called the other to assist him, and got from me and went off; they were taken about 100 yards from me and brought back; that is the apron they were tied up in.</p>

I said, yes; and he shewed me the muslin and asked, if it was ours? I told him it was, and got a constable and secured the prisoner.</p>

               <p>What buttons? - I don't recollect.</p>

               <p>You was struggling with him all the time? - No, I had got him upon his knees.</p>
               <p>Whilst you had hold of this man some people, one of whom you think was Farrell, leaped over a ditch? - I had let him go at the time when the women called out to me that they were coming.</p>

               <p>How wide is the ditch? - It is only a drain that is cut down.</p>
               <p>Is it a yard wide? - Not quite a yard I believe.</p>
               <p>He leaped upon you suddenly? - No, I saw him perfectly, he stood upon the top of the bank for a couple of minutes I believe, and then jumped vigorously at me when I let the man go.</p>
               <p>Was your attention more engaged in looking at him or in scuffling with the man that you had hold of? - I could not scuffle with him then, because I left him when the women called out to me.</p>

               <p>How broad? - About the breadth of three fingers; I picked up some of the pieces next morning.</p>

               <p>Why did you say so? - Because it was so.</p>
               <p>Then how can you say you cut your knuckle? - With the knife; it was a little knife that the woman gave me that she picked stitches of the cloaths she mends; she gave it me out of her pocket to assist me; the spring broke and turned and cut my knuckle.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the blood come from the wound immediately after you cut him? - Yes; and these girls picked up the knife in the grass next day in the field; the boy lost the knife out of his pocket coming home, or I should have had it here.</p>

               <p>The Judges have met, and have fully considered the whole matter of this objection, and they are unanimously of opinion, that the necessity of some proper authority to carry a witness who happened to be in custody, before the grand jury to give evidence, regards the justification of the gaoler only; but that no objection lies upon that account in the mouth of the party indicted, for in respect of him the finding of the bill is right and according to law.</p>
               <p>Whether a private prosecutor, by using an accomplice in or out of custody as a witness, gives such a witness a plea not to be prosecuted, or can entitle himself, the prosecutor, to have his recognizance discharged, is a matter very fit for consideration under all the circumstances of the particular case when that question shall arise; but it is a matter in which the party indicted has no concern, nor can he make any legal objection to the producing such a person as a witness, for the accomplice is against him, a legal and a competent witness, and so was

            , you stand convicted of Forgery, what have you to say why this Court should not give you judgment to die according to law?</p>
               <p>Dr. DODD. My Lord, I now stand before you a dreadful example of human infirmity. I entered upon public life with the expectations common to young men whose education has been liberal, and whose abilities have been flattered; and when I became a clergyman, I considered myself as not impairing the dignity of the order. I was not an idle, nor, I hope, an useless minister; I taught the truths of christianity with the zeal of conviction and the authority of innocence. My labours were approved; my pulpit became popular; and, I have reason to believe, that of those who heard me, some have been preserved from sin, and some have been reclaimed. Condescend, my Lord, to think, if these considerations aggravate my crime, how much they must embitter my punishment!</p>
               <p>Being distinguished and elevated by the confidence of mankind, I had too much confidence in myself, and thinking my integrity - what others thought it - established in sincerity, and fortified by religion, I did not consider the danger of vanity, nor suspect the deceitfulness of my own heart. The day of conflict came, in which temptation surprized and overwhelmed me! I committed the crime, which I entreat your Lordship to believe, that my conscience hourly represents to me in its full bulk of mischief and malignity. Many have been overpowered by temptation, who are now among the penitent in Heaven!</p>
               <p>To an act now waiting the decision of vindictive justice, I will not presume to oppose the counterbalance of almost thirty years - (a great part of the life of man) passed in exciting and exercising charity; in relieving such distresses as I now feel; in administering those consolations which I now want. I will not otherwise extenuate my offence, than by declaring - what I hope will appear to many, and what many circumstances make probable - that I did not intend finally to defraud. Nor will it become me to apportion my own punishment, by alledging, that my sufferings have been not much less than my guilt. I have fallen from reputation, which ought to have made me cautious; and from a fortune which ought to have given me content. I am sunk at once into poverty and scorn: my name and my crime fill the ballads in the streets; the sport of the thoughtless, and the triumph of the wicked!</p>
               <p>It may seem strange, my Lord, that, remembering what I have lately been, I should still wish to continue what I am. But contempt of death, how speciously soever it might mingle with Heathen virtues, has nothing in it suitable to Christian penitence.</p>
               <p>Many motives impel me to beg earnestly for life. I feel the natural horror of a violent death, and the universal dread of untimely dissolution. I am desirous to recompence the injury I have done to the Clergy, to the World, and to Religion; and to efface the scandal of my crime, by the example of my repentance. But, above all - I wish to die with thoughts more composed, and calmer preparation.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177705140033"/>The gloom and confusion of a prison, the anxiety of a trial, the horrors of suspense, and the inevitable vicissitudes of passion, leave not the mind in a due disposition for the holy exercises of prayer and self-examination. Let not a little life be denied me, in which I may, by meditation and contrition, prepare myself to stand at the tribunal of Omnipotence, and support the presence of that Judge, who shall distribute to all according to their works; who will receive and pardon the repenting sinner; and from whom the merciful shall obtain mercy.</p>
               <p>For these reasons, my Lord, amidst shame and misery, I yet wish to live; and most humbly implore, that I may be recommended by your Lordship to the clemency of his Majesty.</p>

            , you have been convicted of the offence of publishing a forged and counterfeit bond, knowing it to be forged and counterfeited, and you have had the advantage which the laws of this country afford to every man in that situation, a fair, an impartial, and an attentive trial.</p>
               <p>The Jury to whose justice you appealed have found you guilty; their verdict has undergone the consideration of the learned Judges, and they found no ground to impeach the justice of that verdict; you yourself have admitted the justice of it, and now the very painful duty that the necessity of the law imposes upon the Court to pronounce the sentence of the law against you remains only to be performed.</p>
               <p>You appear to entertain a very proper sense of the enormity of the offence which you have committed; you appear too in a state of contrition of mind, and I doubt not have duly reflected how far the dangerous tendency of the offence you have been guilty of, is encreased by the influence of example, in being committed by a person of your character and of the sacred function of which you are a member. These sentiments seem to be yours; I would wish to cultivate such sentiments; but I would not wish to add to the anguish of a person in your situation by dwelling upon it.</p>
               <p>Your application for mercy must be made elsewhere; it would be cruel in the Court to slatter you; there is a power of dispensing mercy where you may apply. Your own good sense and the contrition you express will induce you to lessen the influence of the example by publishing your hearty and sincere detestation of the offence of which you are convicted, and that you will not attempt to palliate or extenuate, which would indeed add to the degree of the influence of a crime of this kind being committed by a person of your character and known abilities; I would therefore warn you against any thing of that kind. Now having said this, I am obliged to pronounce the sentence of the law, which is,</p>
               <p>"That you, Doctor
