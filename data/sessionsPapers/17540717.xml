I secured him; after which I took out two more from his breeches. We took him before my Lord Mayor, and he was committed to Newgate. Mr. Watson owned one of the handkerchiefs.

            . I was at Mr. Morley's my uncle on the Whitson Tuesday; he desired I would stay till he search'd his man's boxes, and both the spoons were found broke in a hat-box. The prisoner confess'd to my uncle upon his mentioning the spoons to him. He said he had taken nothing else, and was sorry he had taken them; I was in the warehouse with him, and ask'd him with what view he had taken them. He said, with intention to buy him a pair of silver buckles. I ask'd him how they came broke, he pretended the table spoon was bent when he found it, and the tea-spoon he broke in his pocket in bringing it from Ponder's-End. He said he took the table spoon on the Monday before Whitson Monday, and the teaspoon on the Friday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he mention breaking these in the cleaning them ?</p>
               <p>Phillibrown. Not one word.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did that hat-box belong to?</p>

The prisoner at the bar brought papers to me at divers times of several sorts, some printed and some written, which I bought of him for waste paper. I remember I look'd into some of the books that belong'd to the York river company; some of them were dated 1720. The first time I saw him was on the 10th of June; I bought some of him, and paid him for them; he told me his name was Barrington. I ask'd him if he dealt in those sort of things, and understood by his answer that he was a sort of a broker. I said I hop'd he came honestly by them, he said he liv'd in Cold Bath Fields with his father-in-law. That parcel came to 3 l. odd. I desired he wou'd give me a receipt.

               <p>J. Barrington.</p>
               <p>Whiston Bristow. On the 29th of June I went into Mr. Calvert's shop (with whom I deal ) and to my great surprize on one of the shelves I saw one or two of these volumes, stripp'd in the manner they now appear ( There were a great many volumes brought into court, most of them with the covers pull'd off) I look'd in them, and, as most of them had gone thro' my hands some years ago (I have acted as agent for booksellers, and I knew the value of them, I ask'd Mr. Calvert how she came by them; she said she had several more, and shewed me two considerable piles of them. I believe 60 or 70 volumes. I desir'd her to send for her husband immediately, which she did. When he came, I told him he had got books of great value, he said he bought them of a young man who had brought them at different times. I told him the first step proper to be taken, would be to carry them to a place of safety, till we could find the owner. He told me it was a customary way among their trade when one lights of a parcel of waste paper, to assist each other, and that he had sold two parcels of them to two different cheesemongers. I advised him to go immediately to them, and endeavour to get them again, and to advance the price rather than not get them back. Then I took one of the volumes to Mr. Sandby in Fleet-street, an intimate friend of mine, and ask'd his advice, which was, that by advertising them we should soon hear of the owner, as there are but very few copies of them in the kingdom. Then I returned to Mr. Calvert, and with a good deal of joy he told me, he had got back both the parcels untouch'd. He told me he often saw the person he bought them of pass thro' the market, and he hoped he should soon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175407170006"/> come at him. On the Tuesday following he sent for me, and told me the man was taken, and was then before my Lord Mayor. I went there and saw him. (It was the prisoner at the bar) Mr. Calvert was there, and two of the books: he there gave an account he had bought several parcels of such of the prisoner, and the prisoner acknowledged he sold Mr. Calvert all he had in his possession of that sort, at different times. We none of us knew the number of volumes then belonging to the set. I ask'd him whether he had sold any of the set any where else, he said he had left two volumes with Mr. Richards, a bookseller in Holborn. He was ask'd in regard to his place of abode, he said he liv'd in Cold-Bath-Fields. He was ask'd if he had not a lodging in Salisbury-Court, at a stockingshop. (having been inform'd so by some porters) he owned he had. His Lordship granted us a search warrant, we went there with a constable, and ask'd the woman if one Barrington did not lodge there; she said there was a lodging taken there some little time before and I think she said the man had laid there four or five nights; I told her I was afraid she had entertained an indifferent person in her house, and said we had a warrant to search his lodgings; she gave us the key of his room, and said he was well recommended to her. In his room we found a harpsichord. We had found out Mr. Lintot, and he was there with us; he owned the harpsichord as his property. We found some loose prints and papers, which he said he had reason to think were his; some printed books and waste of books, and odd sheets. After this we divided, and I and the constable went to the house where he said he lodg'd in Cold-Bath-Fields, which was the Horshoe and Magpye. We asked the man of the house if one Barrington lodged with him, he said he had lodged with him, but he had found out that that was not his name, so he had discharg'd him his house; he said his right name was

            , and that his father liv'd in that neighbourhood, and was an honest, industrious man. I ask'd him if he had any books, or parchments, or papers of any kind, that might be left by the prisoner, he said we were very welcome to go up into the room the prisoner had lodg'd in, and see what we could find. We went, but found nothing. He gave us a parcel of pamphlets which he said the prisoner had given him to read to divert himself with. (Produced in court. )</p>

               <p>Q. to Mr. Lintott. Do you know any of these?</p>
               <p>Mr. Lintott. I have look'd at them, some of them I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Bristow. We then went to Mr. Richards's a bookseller in Holborn; I ask'd him if he had any volumes of the Lords Journals offer'd to him for sale, he brought out those two very books from his back shop. (Produced in court) He delivered them to me, and put his name upon them, and said he had them of a young man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present at a second examination of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Bristow. I was; it was the next day; there I told my Lord Mayor what I have related here, and Mr. Lintott was very desirous to come at the bottom of this thing, as we thought the prisoner had some accomplice to put him on to it. He was asked concerning it, and he owned there were two other persons concerned with him in taking 140 volumes, and I think he said one of the men was named Welch, he described them both, and my Lord granted a warrant for apprehending them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Lintott. Have you examined these books that are brought into court?</p>
               <p>Mr. Lintott. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. How many volumes did you lose in the whole?</p>
               <p>Lintott. There were 140 of them, exclusive of those two that came from Mr. Richards's; they are my property, and were taken out of my chambers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see them in your rooms?</p>
               <p>Lintott. Yes, I have; and have the key in my pocket now.</p>
               <p>Q. to Calvert. Have you examined all these books?</p>
               <p>Calvert. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, who did you buy them of?</p>
               <p>Calvert. Upon my oath I bought them of the prisoner at the bar, at several different times, to the number of 140 in all, and also bought some other papers.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Lintott. What is the value of them, don't value them as a curiosity, but tell us what you would have sold them for?</p>
               <p>Lintott. The sett have been advertised some years ago for 500 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you take an 100 l. for them now?</p>
               <p>Lintott. No, my Lord, nor 200 l. neither.</p>
               <p>Q. to Calvert. What did you give for them?</p>
               <p>Calvert. I gave him at the rate of fourteen shillings a hundred weight, I paid him a great deal more than appears on that receipt at several times.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of paper did you buy of the prisoner besides these books?</p>
               <p>Calvert. Really I cannot tell, I sold 700 weight to one man.</p>

               <p>On a Monday about the middle of May, I had been in the Strand about a little business; coming back again, I happened to go in at the gentleman and Porter in Fleet-street, for a pint of beer, there I happened to sit down in a little box where were two men; they seemed to be very well dressed. I staid there from 6 o'clock to about 7. They were talking how paper sold a pound; I was so unfortunate as to fall into discourse with them; they told me they had a great deal of paper to sell, and if I would sell it for them, or tell them where they might sell it, they would give me half the money. I said I would meet them in the morning. I did, and they took me up into the chamber where these books were. They said they belonged to the chambers; so accordingly I took the papers.</p>

            . I was at work where the child's mother lives, in Black-horse yard, Pick-ax street, there came news that a child was stripped near Bartholomew-close. I did not know whose child it was then. The prisoner was stopped. I went and took hold of the child. I then asked the prisoner if she stripped the child, she said yes, and that she had proffered the things to sale which she took off the child back.</p>
               <p>Q. What was taken from the child?</p>
               <p>Dawson. A coat and skirt, (produced in court.) Then a gentleman came and asked me if I was the father of that child, I said no, but I was servant to the child's father. A constable was sent for, and he was charged with the prisoner, and we took her before my Lord-mayor, and from thence to the Counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner before that time?</p>
               <p>Dawson. No, never in my life.</p>

She stayed about an hour, and I gave her a piece of cloth to carry to her daughter as usual. She went and reached something from the compter, I then was suspicious she had taken something. I observed as she went out of the shop she endeavoured to conceal something in her apron: this encreased my suspicion, I called to her and she stopped; then I went and asked her if she had not more about her than belonged to her. I looked into her apron and there I found this piece of sattin.</p>

               <p>Smith. I carried her back, and all she could say for herself was, that she took it in the room of the cloth I gave her to carry to her daughter's.</p>

Then she asked me to go home with her to her lodgings, which I refused. Then she asked me to go over to an alehouse to drink with her, I said I would not, upon which she desired me to give her a penny to get her a dram, which I did, after which she behaved in a very indecent manner, such as pulling up her coats, and telling me that I should feel of her - , and asked me if I could deny such, &amp;c. Then she put her hand into my breeches, and then to my fob. I was going away from her, but she dragged me to where her companion was standing. Presently the other woman went off, I then missed my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you missed your watch was it that you had it ?</p>
               <p>Groves. Just before I came up to them; I had taken it out to see what o'clock it was at a lamp, and put it into my fob again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober at that time?</p>
               <p>Groves. I was.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe them to speak to each other?</p>
               <p>Groves. I did not perceive they did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the other person near enough you to take your watch?</p>
               <p>Groves. The other was at a distance when the prisoner put her hand to my fob. I am sure the prisoner is the person that took it, she never let me go from the time she first took me by the arm till I missed it: then I took hold of her that she should not run away, and I charged the watch with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your watch again?</p>
               <p>Groves. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think she was near enough the other woman to give it to her?</p>
               <p>Groves. Yes, she was, just at her going off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her reach her hand?</p>
               <p>Groves. No, I did not, for I was on the other side.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were they to each other?</p>
               <p>Groves. I don't know but that they might touch each other.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Groves. She was taken to the watch-house, and searched by a woman, but nothing was found upon her, and the next morning we took her to Bridewell, and from thence to Guildhall, and then she was committed.</p>

            . On the 10th of June at night the prisoner was brought down to the watch-house, it was my watch night. There the prosecutor said, as he was coming down the Fleet-market she took hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in the hearing of him when he told this?</p>
               <p>Downs. She was, and he said he refused to go along with her: and that then she asked him for a dram, upon which he gave her a penny.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the account he gave the same he has done here?</p>
               <p>Downs. It was. I sent for a woman to search her, but the watch was not found upon her. She was afterwards committed by the sitting alderman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I have nothing farther to say, than desiring he should bring the woman that searched me. I was going down the market, and this young man and a young woman were together, I had nobody with me. They were pulling and haleing one another about. I stood to look at them with my back against post. After he had done he went to button up his breeches, and said he had lost his watch, and she was gone away, and then he came and took hold of me, and carried me to the watch-house, and had me searched in a very indecent manner. Then the constable and he went out to see for the young woman he was in company with, they came back and said they could not find her. For my part I never saw her with my eyes before. Then they carried me down to Bridewell, and after that I was committed to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Was you with another woman in the Fleet-market at that time?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, the prisoner and another woman were together, I had no body with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any knowledge of the prisoner before this?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never saw her or the other in my life to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. to constable. Did the prosecutor appear to be sober?</p>
               <p>Constable. He did to me; I believe he was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What do you value your watch at?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. At 3 l. 10 s.</p>

I had another customer came and called for a pint of bear, I went and drew it. I know my candlesticks were standing on the mantlepiece when he went into the kitchen. When he was gone I missed my candlesticks. After this a market woman who uses my house was telling me that Mr. Clare, at the Coach and Horses in the King's road, had been robbed of a gown and apron, and that the man upon being searched had a pair of brass candlesticks found upon him. She described the man, I went to the constable's house where she directed me, and saw both the prisoner, whom I knew again, and cry candlesticks. Produced in court and deposed to.</p>

I was very desirous to find the thief out. I believe I missed in the whole to the amount of 15 or 20 l. On Whitson Eve I put ten guineas into my desk. (The place where I had missed my money ) and after that in the same evening ten guineas more. In a week after I took out five, and scratched out the ten guineas on the paper, and put down five; two or three days after I went and found but fourteen guineas, upon this I put in no more gold there, but about a week or a fortnight after I put in 19 s. 6 d. in silver, and told it before I went to church in the morning, and as soon as I came from church I told it again, and found in the bag only 17 s. I asked who had been there, and was told none but the prisoner: this confirmed me in my suspicion, that he must be the man. The sunday following, the seventh of this instant, I set

Mr. Wilkinson telling me he had lost money at several times, he fix'd me at a place to watch last sunday was sevennight, about half an hour after 10 o'clock he went out, the maid and the prisoner being alone below, she went up stairs, after which the prisoner walk'd softly across the parlour to the stair foot, then he turn'd round in the parlour to the desk, and opening it drew out a drawer, took out a bag, and put his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175407170014"/> hand into it, but what he took out I cannot pretend to say. Then he did it up and put it in the drawer again, and shut the desk. On seeing this I stepped to him; he on seeing me seemed pretty much fluttered; I charged him with having meddled with the desk. Mr. Wilkinson was near the door in the street, he was call'd in, and brought the constable with him. We searched the prisoner, after Mr. Wilkinson had told the money, and missed 6 s. In searching the prisoner I observed his hand clinched close, we opened it, and found 2 half crowns and a shilling, with the mark upon them that Mr Wilkinson had put. Upon that the prisoner fell on his knees, begg'd for mercy, said he was utterly ruined.</p>
               <p>Q. to Wilkinson. Did you mark any of the money?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. I did, by running an engraver along the Letters V and W in Carolus and William.</p>

               <p>Wilkinson. I was, and saw the money taken from him, upon which he begg'd for mercy. (The money produc'd in court, and depos'd to ) He gave me the key afterward with which he opened the desk; this he has had of a gentlewoman that has had my first floor ever since last September.</p>

            . I think it was on Monday the 6th of June the prisoner came casually to my shop to buy a pair of shoes: she was in a sad deplorable dress; I told her I believed she had no occasion for shoes, and desired her to go out of my shop. She did, but returned again, and sat down in a chair, and said she had money enough to pay for a pair of shoes, and pull'd out a guinea. I sold her a pair of shoes and gave her change out of a guinea. After that she enquired where she could get some new clothes, and pull'd out a guinea or two more; I said there were clothes enough in the neighbourhood, and a person by my direction brought some clothes to my shop door, she bought a gown and several things. Then she enquired where she could have a lodging to lodge safe; I said you seem to be full of money, I am afraid you have committed something bad; she said, De'el took me if I have, it is a good mons moony, it is my own husbands, then she went away. The next morning I had some business in Cavendish-Square, and when I came back there was the prisoner in my shop again; I asked her what was her business, she said, I was a muckle mon, and she heard I was a constable, and she was come to give me a glass of beer, because she had heard she had been saucy to me the day before, and that I had been so good to her as not to took her to the watch-house. I bid her go about her business, or I'd turn her out; then she said I will gang no farther till I treate you. Then she put her hand in her bosom, and there I saw 2 seals hang out, then I said I am afraid you have done some bad action, for I see you have got a watch there, pray what o'clock is it? She said you have got a watch of your own I courted her a good deal to see it, but she would not let me have it; at last I took hold of it and saw the name upon it; then I said you must give me some farther account before you go any farther; she said it was her husband's, and that he was a perriwig-maker in Brewer-Street at the Coach and Horses; I left her in the custody of my apprentice, and went there to enquire whether such a person did live there. When I came there, I found her sister lived there, but the prisoner did not. Then I came back, and went to justice Bedwell with her; he ordered me to search her, I did, and found 38 shillings and 6 l. in silver in a paper, and 11 guineas and an half n gold, in her bosom; then she was committed. ( The watch and money produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This watch and seals are my property which I lost that night I was with the prisoner: the money I will not pretend to swear to.</p>

She told me in the coach going along that she picked up a man in Broad-street by Carnaby-Market, and they agreed to go down to her lodgings in Parker's Lane, there they drank together, after that she helped him off with his breeches, and they lay down on the bed together. After that she took his breeches and took out of them 20 golden guineas and some silver, but did not say what quantity of silver, and the watch, and then went away and left him.</p>

            . On the 8th of June last I happened to be at justice Fielding's, the prisoner was then present, I asked the prisoner how she came to do such a rash action as to take the gentleman's money; she said she took the gentleman's watch and money to keep till he was sober; I asked her why she did not return them, she said she went out and came no more back to the house in Parker's-Lane.</p>
               <p>Q. to James. You say you went before Mr. Bedwell, the last witness talks of being at Justice Fielding's?</p>
               <p>James. Mr. Bedwell was at Justice Fielding's office, they were both together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she mention the house where she took the watch and money?</p>
               <p>James. She said it was in Mr. Cartey's house in Parker's-Lane, I have been at the house since to search for more money that she says she hid there.</p>

            . I lived in Cartey's house in Parker's-Lane, up one pair of stairs forwards, she and her husband came and took that lower room on the Tuesday before she did this robbery. My child and I were sitting on the cill of the door when the gentleman and she came in, I said to my child get up and let Mr. Jones and his wife come in, after that she called for me to go and fetch a pot of beer, and said her husband would not go to sleep without it (meaning the gentleman) and came into the entry to me and gave me six-pence to pay for it, I went and fetched it, and gave her the change.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about taking the things?</p>
               <p>A. Carter. I do not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I had been into the city receiving some money from Edinburgh, as I was coming home I met with this man at the Crown on the top of Broad-street by Golden-Square, he was in liquor, and worried me to drink there; then we went into another house and chang'd a guinea, and paid for a bit of salmon and a pot of beer; after this we came as far as Parker's-Lane, he said he'd have some beer, and got this woman to fetch some; he desir'd I'd take care of his clothes and watch for him. I sat down, he laid down his breeches, after I had help'd to pull them off; I went to see what was become of my child, and when I came back he was gone, and my door padlock'd. Then I went and bought a pair of shoes, and said at that house I wanted other things, the man's wife went and brought in a smock, 2 petticoats and a gown, I bought them. Then because the door was padlock'd he said he'd take me to a very good lodging; he took me to one, I stay'd all night there, but never spent a farthing of the money. I came back to his house again, his wife was washing, then the thief catchers came in, and they have kept all the things I bought.</p>
               <p>James. As she bought these things out of that money I thought proper to detain them for him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. She says you gave her these things in order for her to keep for you.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am pretty sure I never gave them to her at all, but believe she did assist me in pulling my breeches off.</p>

            , on the 5th of July about 10 o'clock at night, we overtook the prisoner and another woman together, they toss'd up their hoops to let us pass, and the prisoner said, Lord! every body is admiring my breast as they go along. Lord, said I, perhaps they are worth admiring, she turned round and said how do you do, my dear, will you give me a glass of wine, and took hold of my hand; with all my heart, said I, then they brought us down to the Rummer by <placeName id="t17540717-24-crimeloc119">Charing-Cross</placeName>

               <p>Q. Who call'd for the bottle?</p>
               <p>Knight. I did; and flung down 2 s. for it before we tasted it, then she came to me and turn'd up all her clothes to her navel, and sat down on my knee, and said my dear; I said, my dear, I'll have nothing to say to you, she unbutton'd my breeches before, and pull'd all out shirt and all. Then I turn'd round and button'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175407170017"/> them up again; by G - d, said she, I will be st - d by you, and came and unbutton'd them again. Then she said where are you going to, I said to James's-street; then she said come along, we will go with you. Then she said to her companion, d - n you, Moll, why don't you haul up; then she pull'd all up, she was with Edwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other come near you?</p>
               <p>Knight. No, she did not. Then we went to go out, when we got to the door I turn'd round to my friend Edwards to come along, and though I had seen the two women in the entry as I thought going with us, they were slip'd away in an instant. Then I put my hand to my pocket, and pull'd out my money, and found ten 36 shilling pieces and 3 guineas missing, and some silver, but what quantity I know not. When we found we could not come at them that night, we went home and lay together; the next morning we were advis'd to go to the same house; accordingly we went and called for half a pint of wine; I said to the drawer, do you know my face? he said, yes Sir, you were here together last night with two young ladies, (as he was pleased to call them, but they were two young devils to me) I asked him where they liv'd and their names, he said he did not know either. That did not satisfy me, I had lost my money, but I thought proper to conceal that, and said they gave us directions where to find them, but we had lost it. Then I went to a friend of mine, to whom I told the affair and we went in again, and the same drawer brought in a pot of porter; we asked him again whether he knew any thing of them, he said no. My friend called for the man of the house, who came; he said to him, here is an odd affair happen'd in your house, and told him of it; the landlord said he knew nothing of the women, or where they liv'd, and the mistress of the house said the same. I said if the drawer would tell me where they liv'd that I might see them, I'd give him a guinea or two; he went out and came in again, and with humms and haws directed us to a house in a court in the Strand; we went there with a constable and a warrant; the constable found the prisoner by my describing her; but we could not find the other woman. After the constable had got her, I went in and said, G - d bless your pretty face, don't you know me again? She said yes, you was in company with me last night; she denied nothing that passed but having my money; she said she did not take a brass farthing out of my pocket; no, said I, I had no such thing in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search her or her lodgings ?</p>
               <p>Knight. No, we did not; had we found money I could not have sworn to that.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know how much money you had in your pocket at that time?</p>
               <p>Knight. To be sure I did by counting of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you count it?</p>
               <p>Knight. A little before we met with them.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had you?</p>
               <p>Knight. Twenty 36 s. pieces, nine guineas, and some silver.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to count it at that time?</p>
               <p>Knight. When I go with such creatures I always do.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been along with such creatures that night before?</p>
               <p>Knight. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been before you met with them?</p>
               <p>Knight. I went out of a house in the Strand about three quarters of an hour after nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there no women there?</p>
               <p>Knight. There were, but I had not been drinking that night; it was then the beginning of the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you quite sober?</p>
               <p>Knight. I had had some liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had all this money when you came out of that house?</p>

               <p>Knight. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Knight. I counted it at coming out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember your throwing your gold, silver and halfpence about the room?</p>
               <p>Knight. No. I pulled out my money to look for silver, but I tossed none about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you drop some on the ground?</p>
               <p>Knight. I don't remember any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to pursue these women ?</p>
               <p>Knight. I did not know where to pursue. I turned round for my friend, and when I looked for them they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you count your money when you went in at the Rummer?</p>
               <p>Knight. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your gold when you paid for your wine?</p>
               <p>Knight. I know then I had it safe.</p>

We both went with them. The prisoner sat on his knee with her cloaths up in an indecent manner, and the other so upon mine. We were there till we drank a glass or two of wine. When we were going out I was talking to my friend, and they slipped away and got off. We went to run after them, but could see nothing of them; we never saw which way they went. As soon as we came out of the house, he told me he had lost ten 36 s. pieces, and three guineas. He had counted it there, but would not make any disturbance about it then. Then we went to his lodgings, and lay together. The next morning we went to the same tavern and asked for the drawer; he would give us no account where we might find them, till we got another friend; then we found the prisoner out, and she was taken up and carried before a Justice of the Peace, but she denied having the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prosecutor take out his money at the Rummer?</p>

He said, there were two women picked up this gentleman and I in the Strand, and had us to the Rummer-tavern, and picked my pocket. I advised him to go there again and enquire for them. We three went, and called for a pot of porter. I said to the drawer, Do you remember these two gentlemen being here last night, he said he did. I asked him after the two women that were with them; he said he knew nothing of them; adding, there were a great many women used the house that they did not know. Then I went to the landlord, and said to him, There is an affair happened here which may be of bad consequence to your house; here is a gentleman has been robbed in it last night of so much money, and I believe your drawer knows it. Said he, I'll call him. I said we had offered him a guinea or two to tell us where to find them. Then the women of the house said she remembered a gentlewoman whose name was Lewis, and she could find it out by that. After that the drawer went to the bar in the yard, and unriddled the affair, and said her name was

When I took this woman in Exeter-Court, she said, I know I was in company with that gentleman very well; then the gentleman came up to her, and said, My dear, you have a pretty face, I know it very well, or such like words. She said, I know yours, and she mentioned what actions they had together. Said I, Did you rob the gentleman of so much money? She said, No, not of a farthing. I took her before Justice St. Laurence, there she owned she was in company with him, but denied having a farthing of his money. Then I took her to the Gatehouse; she owned the same there of her being in company, and her actions, but not to the taking his money.</p>

He said, As I have kissed you, you shall go along with me. I begged him not to take me away. When we came into the tavern, he called for a bottle of wine; the woman in the camblet gown and he sat down together; she asked him for a present; he said, I'll give no present; I have been with two woman in Marygold-Court already. Then he rang the bell, and wanted another bottle of wine. He pulled out two shillings and some gold in his hand, and said, there is two shillings for the wine, I am to go to Haddock's bagnio; and away he went.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he pull them out for?</p>
               <p>Rudd. To send for beer. He dropped some in the plate and some on the floor, and picked it up again two or three times. I desired him to put his gold by itself, or he would lose it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he go out of your house?</p>

               <p>Israel Buckley. The prisoner came to my house on the 4th of June, to buy a ring; I bid her sit her finger. She looked at one and another; at last she said I fancy this will do. I took it and began to weigh it. Then she said she wanted one of two guineas value. I looked upon her and bid her go about her business, and told her she wanted no such ring. She went out of my shop, I missed a ring, followed and stopped her. She dropped the ring in the kennel. Then I brought her back to my house, and put her into a room where nobody was but she and my girl. The ring was found in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175407170020"/> the kennel and brought in after she was gone. We missed a gold chain which had been in the room where we put her to search her. I took her in Aldersgate Street, very much fuddled, that same afternoon and carried her to Wood-street Counter; there she was searched, and had gold and silver about her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the chain upon her?</p>
               <p>Buckley. No, we did not. Then I went to enquire at a pawnbroker's, one Mr. Harrison, and found one row of a gold chain, who said, he took it in of the prisoner. About a week after, the prisoner's mother gave me an account that the prisoner had sold some more of it at other places.</p>
               <p>Q. How many chains were there of it?</p>
               <p>Buckley. There were four; this I found at the pawnbroker's was the uppermost chain, that is the shortest.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Harrison, a pawnbroker in St. Bride's parish. On the 4th of June the prisoner brought this piece of the gold chain and pledged it at our house, producing it.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look upon that chain, do you know it?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe it is part of what I lost, but as one gold chain may be like another I will not swear to it.</p>
               <p>The niece said the same.</p>
               <p>Q. to Stiles. How much did you lend the prisoner upon it?</p>
               <p>Stiles. I lent her 6 shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Stiles. I am sure she is the person.</p>

               <p>Going down to Fleet-market I saw that piece of a link of a chain lying in a piece of paper; there were two women with roses in their hands, they said halves; I said I believe you may take all, it is nothing but a piece of brass. They said you shall go to a silversmith's and have it tried. I said, no, I would not, I might bring myself into trouble. They then said try it upon a flint stone. I went to the pawnbroker's and asked him if it was gold or not, and he tried it and weighed it. I asked four shillings upon it, and he lent me 6.</p>
               <p>Stiles. She never asked me whether it was gold, she asked me to lend her 6 shillings upon it, which I did.</p>

               <p>Thomas Saunders, On the 28th of May last, about 10 at night, I was going on horseback from London to my home at Barkhamstead in Hertfordshire, there met me two men on horseback, one on my left hand side and the other in the road I was in; I asked them what they wanted; the man on my left hand said to the other, he seems to be an honest man, let him go along; upon that I turned out of the way and rode on, and did not think of any harm at all. I rode slowly on towards a place called <placeName id="t17540717-29-crimeloc141">Stanmore</placeName>

               </div1>
               <p>Q. WERE they the same persons you had met before?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I really can't say they were or not. I went on as before, when I came to the top of Stanmore there was a man stood dismounted with his horse in his hand. I rode about 100 or 150 yards past him, then there was a man on horseback in the highway, with his face towards me. I offered to turn out of the road, and he stopped me; I asked him what he meant, or what he wanted; he said he wanted my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing in his hand?</p>
               <p>Saunders. No, I did not. Then I told him I had not got any; then he said, d - n your blood I'll blow your brains out, if you don't give me that bag you have got. I told him I had but a few halfpence and a six-pence. Then he asked me for my watch, I told him I did not carry one. He felt on the wasteband of my breeches to see if I had one. Finding I had none, he demanded what money I had, so I gave it him, which was 9 d. 1/2.</p>
               <p>Q. Look upon the prisoner, do you know him ?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I do not, I can't say this is the person. Then he turned out of the road and came towards London, and I went on my way and wished him a good night. As he went to go by me I looked on his mare and saw something of a skin for a housing behind. I rode slowly on; after which I heard a horse follow me pretty swiftly again; I turned my head about and perceived him to be a horse without a rider. I judged it to be one of the highwaymen's horses. I rode as fast as I could towards Bushey, the mare came following me all the way, and when I stopped at Bushey, she came directly up to me; I laid hold of her bridle, which was upon her neck. I considered some time to know what I had best to do. I stood still, and hearing nobody coming, I went to the Red-lion inn, and called the man of the house, whose name is Cook, he came to the window, I told him I had been robbed, and that I had got the man's mare that robbed me, and desired he'd call the ostler immediately, for I looked upon myself to be in danger. The ostler came and let me in at the gate, and fastened it again. I delivered the mare to him, and desired him to take care of her. I staid there all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a saddle and housing behind upon that mare?</p>
               <p>Saunders. There were, but no housing before. It was a hare housing, like that the man rode that robbed me. The next morning I told the man of the house about the mare, and thought it proper to have her cry'd at three market towns. I left her there with the bridle and saddle, and went home. I had not been at home above two or three days before I was sent for to go to Justice Capper's, and I told him all that I knew, the same as I have done here, as near as I can remember.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When did this happen?</p>
               <p>Saunders. On the 28th of May about half an hour after 11 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not dark?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175407170023"/>Saunders. No, it was not, it was pretty clearish.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see the person's face that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I could not, he did what he could to hide that from me.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call the housing?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I think it is bear skin.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to distinguish that?</p>
               <p>Saunders. It was, I could see it very plain.</p>
               <p>Q. You call it a mare, did you know it to be a mare when you was robbed?</p>
               <p>Saunders. No, but I found it to be a mare afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to swear it was the same housing that the man had that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I can, it was the very same.</p>
               <p>Jeffery Edwards. On the 28th of May the prisoner at the bar hired the mare of me to go out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen her since?</p>
               <p>Edwards. I have at Justice Fieldings.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you deliver the mare to him?</p>
               <p>Edwards. I sent her to him to his master's, Mr. Lebass, in the afternoon of that day, about 4 or 5 o'clock, he hired her for 3 days. She did not come home according to bargain. Then I went to the person that recommended this man to me. The prisoner had sent for me the afternoon of the day he came home, but I could not go to him, but went to him on the Saturday following, (the 28th of May was on a Tuesday.) The prisoner would not tell me where the mare was, but said she was very safe, and he'd pay me for her, which he accordingly did very honestly.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he give you for her?</p>
               <p>Edwards. He gave me 10 guineas for the mare, bridle and saddle.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the saddle, bridle and housing.</p>
               <p>Edwards. The housing was a hare housing, it is a bear or Leopard's skin, a mixed mottled thing, the saddle was a common one.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known the prisoner any time?</p>
               <p>Edwards. I have known him by sight.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is he?</p>
               <p>Edwards. He is a cooper by trade, he worked with Mr. Lebass, a brewer, at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What might he get a year by his business?</p>
               <p>Edwards. I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear in his business at that time he paid you for the horse?</p>
               <p>Edwards. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he continue in his business till he was taken up, which was on the 11th of June?</p>
               <p>Edwards. I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he disappear?</p>
               <p>Edwards. I don't know that he did.</p>

               <p>Hammond. I don't justly know, I believe it was on a Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the Tuesday before the robbery?</p>
               <p>Hammond. I did not hear of the robbery till about a fortnight after; it answered to the time I believe, I imagine it was on that day, but I can't be certain.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it?</p>
               <p>Hammond. I believe it was about 12 o'clock at noon.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect whether it was the day before the 29th of May, there are a many oak boughs about then.</p>
               <p>Hammond. I can't recollect oak boughs. Harding left a message with me for his master, Mr. Rocket, a stone-cutter.</p>

            . I keep the Red-lion at Kilbourne, Harding and another person came on horseback to my house about 7 o'clock in the evening on the 28th of May, and called for a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the other person?</p>
               <p>Timms. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Timms. I can't take upon me to say it is. They both alighted from their horses and went into the house, and there called for a quartern of gin; Harding desired I'd drink part of it, I told him I never drank any at all, then he said bring a quartern of rum, which I did. Then he said to my spouse, I suppose you don't know that man (meaning the person that was with him) we both said we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175407170024"/> did not; then he said it is my brother-in law, he married my sister, and said they were going down to Watford to see his mother, and asked if she could make a bed up for us against we came back, which would be about 11 o'clock, for that they did not purpose to lie at his mother's, and that then they should be fresh to go to work in the morning. I remember when he came up to my house he turned back to the person with him, and said, d - n it, this mare will never do, she is too fat and too heavy for the lay.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did the other person make to that?</p>
               <p>Timms. He made no answer. In the mean time came Mr. Milking's two daughters from Edger riding by, and Harding went in a doors, and into the parlour, seemingly because he would not see them. They paid for what they had and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your wife make up a bed for them?</p>
               <p>Timms. She did, but they did not come, I have not seen Harding since.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did they go away?</p>
               <p>Timms. They went away about half an hour past 7 o'clock, after, they had staid about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe their horses and saddles?</p>
               <p>Timms. I took a great deal of notice of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had one of them a housing?</p>
               <p>Timms. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which rode that horse?</p>
               <p>Timms. The person that was with Harding did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Harding any Housing?</p>
               <p>Timms. No, he had none, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a housing was it?</p>
               <p>Timms. It was skin with the hair on.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the dress the man (he called his brother-in-law) was in?</p>
               <p>Timms. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that was the same mare that was stopped at the Red-lion?</p>
               <p>Timms. I am positive it was the same, I have seen her several times since.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Counsel. You say you, remember that Harding said, that man that was with him was his brother-in-law?</p>
               <p>Timms. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see them in company together ?</p>
               <p>Timms. I cannot take upon me to say I have.</p>
               <p>Court. What is your belief as to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Timms. Dress alters people much; I can't take upon me to swear he is the man.</p>

            . I keep the White Hart at Bushey; opposite to the Red Lion; Harding came to my house on the 29th of May, in the morning, between five and six o'clock, and told me he had had a damnable misfortune; he and a companion of his were coming down to see his mother; that they were both got drunk, and his companion's mare had thrown him in Stanmore pond, and was run away.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Harding's mother?</p>
               <p>Treacher. I do, she keeps an inn at Watford; I was born and bred there, and have known him from a child.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sisters has Harding?</p>

               <p>Q. What is his general character?</p>
               <p>Doleman. It was never stained as I know of; he bears the character of a very honest man; he maintains his family very well.</p>
               <p>Mr. Herne. I am broad clerk to Mr. Lebass; the prisoner was cooper; I have known him about two years, during which time he has been under my direction.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he in his business constantly after the 28th of May?</p>
               <p>Herne. I can't take upon me to say so; I did not observe him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Povey. I am a cooper by trade; the prisoner at the bar was servant to me three years. About five years ago he behaved like a very honest good servant; upon which I recommended him to Mr. Lebass, and he has been advanced by his master since he has been with him; he has made him his broad cooper.</p>

               <p>Halfpenny. He has the character of a very honest hard-working man, one that takes good care of his family. There has been hardly a day these four or five years but I have seen him. I do really think that I have seen him every day in my life in that time.</p>

               <p>Halfpenny. I can't say as to the particular days; I drank with him about an hour before he was taken up; then he was in his business, putting down some beer in a cellar.</p>

            . On a Monday night about 9 o'clock, I can't tell the day of the month, I was in my own room up 2 pair of stairs, at the house of Mr. Coombs in the <placeName id="t17540717-34-crimeloc170">Little Minories</placeName>

I went up to my room, and presently I heard murder cried.</p>
               <p>Q How long after?</p>
               <p>A. Lawless. I don't think it was much above a quarter of an hour after I came down and called to Mrs. Mills at her door, and asked what was the matter; she gave me no answer; soon after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175407170027"/> that she came to the back chamber door ( there are 2 rooms on a floor, they can go out of one into the other, and each have a door to come out at to go down stairs) I saw the top of her thumb was bloody. I asked what was the matter with her, she said she did not know what was the matter with herself, but her husband had stabb'd a man; then I went down stairs to call for help, and as I came up again I met Mr. Room coming out at the back chamber door; he looked at me and said Mills had stabb'd him; I asked him if he could come down stairs, but what answer he made I cannot tell. I went down before him, and he came after me as well as he could. When he got into the street he desired the people to fetch a surgeon, and said Mills had stabbed him; I saw on his right side, to the best of my remembrance, his bowels were working out.</p>

               <p>Q. Were his clothes unbuttoned?</p>
               <p>A. Lawless. I did not discern that they were.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of his bowels did you see?</p>
               <p>A. Lawless. About the bigness of a large walnut thro' clothes and all; then I went to tell Mr. Coombs, and saw no more of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see (when the door was open) the deceased upon me?</p>
               <p>A. Lawless. I did; this was after the murder was cry'd; he lay a-cross the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose voice was it that cried murder?</p>
               <p>A. Lawless. It was Mills's wife's as near as I can tell.</p>
               <p>Cross Examined.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Mr. Room?</p>
               <p>A. Lawless. I have a long time, and Mr. Mills too.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen them together at Mills's before?</p>
               <p>A. Lawless. I have in that room as I pass'd and repass'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they quiet till you heard murder cried ?</p>

            . I live up in an apartment in the same house, I heard a cry of murder, and went down betwixt 9 and 10 at night to see what was the matter; Mills's wife begg'd of me to go into the room. When I went in I saw the deceased holding Mills down by his two hands; he desired me to take hold of the prisoner, which I did, and held him some time; as no assistance came I took him up and sat him in a chair, he seemed to be very obstreperous and not willing to sit down; after I had got him in the chair, he called for his wife, she came to him, and said, do you know, my dear, what you have done? He said, what have I done ? She said, my dear. I am afraid you have stabb'd the man; he said, if I have I have not given him enough, then there came assistance in, so I quitted the room, and did not see the prisoner till now at the bar, nor did I see the deceased till he lay dead on the bed.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to think he was in liquor ?</p>
               <p>Jennings. Because when I first went to take hold on him, he did not seem to be resolute at all, and afterwards he was.</p>

            . On the 22d of April about 7 at night, the deceased and prisoner came to my house the Rose and Crown at Aldgate, they call'd for a tankard of beer. The prisoner said to the deceased. I'm going a little farther, sit down I'll come again presently. About 9 or a little before, I went up stairs, and the deceased came up to me and said, Mr. Mills does not come, I will have something to drink; we drank a pint of rum and water together, after that he said hang him he does not come, I can't think where he is got, I suppose he is got drunk some where, and went away about a quarter after nine o'clock, and about a quarter before 10 two men came in and asked for Mr. Mills; I said, what is the matter? they said they believed he had murdered a man, and that they had been drinking at your house tonight; then I went there and found the deceased sitting in a chair, holding his head on one side, and his 2 hands to his side. I laid hold on his shoulder, and said, for God's sake what is the matter? Who has done this? Mills, Mills, Mills, I can't say how many times he repeated it; then I left him, and came the next morning again, and found him laying on his head; I said, for God's sake tell me how this happened; he said, I will if I can; he took me by the hand and said, you know when I parted with you I went directly to see if Mr. Mills had got safe home. I knocked at the door, the wife came to the door, and directly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175407170028"/> said I don't thank you for keeping my husband out, and putting bad words into his head, whereby I am us'd ill. He said I have not seen your husband since he left me at Mr. Terry's at 7 o'clock: then Mills came and said, God d - n you, I believe you have been great with my wife; he answered no, no, if you was sober you would not say so. Then Mills locked the door, and put the key in his pocket, and said, I'll have a dram, the deceased said I don't care if I have one too. As soon as Mills had got the bottle he took it and flung it at his wife's head, but how he came by it he did not know: then words arose for two or three minutes, concerning being great with his wife (I asked him was there everany thing in it? he said no, it never was in his thoughts) after that he said to Mr. Mills, let me go home, I want to go home; no, said the other, you shall go home when I please; then he observed the pocket he put the key into; he got up to take the key out of the prisoner's pocket to let himself out, in so doing Mills put his hand into his side pocket, and took out a knife, and stabb'd him directly, and left it in his body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any account of some struggling in endeavouring to get the key out of his pocket, or whether there were any blows between them?</p>
               <p>Terry. He said there was not one blow.</p>
               <p>Court. I put you in mind of this, because there was some account given of a struggling on the coroner's inquisition.</p>
               <p>Terry. I gave the same account then I do now, he said there was no blow struck nor any scuffle.</p>
               <p>Cross Examined.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they seem to come to your house, as friends or not?</p>
               <p>Terry. They seemed to come as friends, as two brothers.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known them?</p>
               <p>Terry. I have known the prisoner about two years, and the deceased about a twelve-month, during which time they us'd to come very lovingly; they have breakfasted, din'd and supp'd together at my house; the deceased was a paviour, the other a turncock to the bridge water works, their business lay together. When the prisoner is sober he is as civil a man as ever was born, but liquor alters people to be sure.</p>

            . I was at my lodgings in a publick-house, the Sieve in the little Minories, on the 22d of April, my shop-mates and I were drinking a tankard of beer together; Mr. Room came into the house much about 10 o'clock all over blood, and there were a great many people about him; he sat down in a chair, and had his hand upon his bowels, I saw them out much about as big as a pint pot. I said, what is the matter with you? Said he, Mills the turn-cock man has stabb'd me, and said it is a very hard thing, though we have been particular friends, that he should not suffer the law, and wish'd some body would go and take him. I went up stairs and saw Mr. Jennings standing in the room, I said is your name Mills, he said no. Mills was sitting in a chair with his hat and wig off, I asked him if his name was Mills, he said, yes; I said, did you stab Mr. Room? he said, yes; why did you? said I; for a very good reason, said he. Then I took hold on his throat and said for that same reason you shall stab no-body more, and led him along, and in the other room threw him on his back and secured him. Then my shop-mates came with a candle up stairs; then Mills called for his wife, and said, Salley, my dear, will you not come and kiss me? She came to him and said, yes; she kneeled down to kiss him, and I observed her all over blood; I said, good woman, what is the matter with you? He said, ah, Salley, you see what is come on it, and I told you I'd do it. I said to her, pray what is the matter with you? she said, her husband had us'd her very ill, and she was afraid Mr. Room had lost his life by taking her part.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this in the hearing of Mills?</p>
               <p>Watkeis. It was; he then was down on his back. I saw some places thro' her petticoats bloody, as much on the top of a tankard; said she, my husband has stabbed me in 2 places upon my thigh, and fell a crying, and said, she did not know what to do. Then there came in the headborough of the parish, and insisted upon searching him; they pulled a sheath out of the side pocket of his breeches; she said, I have put by the knife he stabbed Mr. Room with; I said to her, you had better deliver it to me; she said she did not choose that; I said, if she concealed it, it would be worse for her; then she delivered it; it was all over bloody (Produced in court with a bloody rust upon it) then I pinion'd his arms with a bit of a rope, and brought him down stairs and into Mr. Brooks's at the Sieve; from thence he was taken to the Tower goal, going along he said, where are you going to take me? I said, you are going to goal. What have I done? said he; I told him he had stabb'd his friend; he said, well, what if I have. I said, are you sorry? he said, no. I said could you drink a drop of his blood if you had it? he said yes, he could. We took him to goal,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175407170029"/> there he seemed to be a little uneasy, we brought him a pillow to lay his head upon. The next morning, about 11 o'clock, we went with him before Sir

            , there the knife was produced; the justice asked him if he knew it, he said, yes: he asked him how he came to stab the man with it, he said they had a struggle together, and he, that is, Mr. Room, had kicked down a pail of water, and it might happened to him as well as the other; he had stabbed the man and was sorry for it. Going home, a person that is here said to me, Sir Samuel says it would be proper to go to the wounded person and hear what he says, and take it down in writing. Accordingly Thomas Mears, a barber,

               <p>Q. Was the paper read over to him after it was wrote?</p>
               <p>Watkeis. I can't say it was, but we read it by parts as we wrote it.</p>
               <p>Q. Give an account the best you can of what he declared.</p>
               <p>Watkeis. It was on the 23d day; he declared Mr. Mills and he had been drinking in company together the best part of the evening, and Mills parted with him at Aldgate. He being in liquor the deceased went after him home, and found him with his wife in his own room. When he entered the room Mills locked the door upon him, and put the key in his pocket, and said, I'll do for you both, and d - n you, you have insinuated something into my wife's head these three months, and then threw a bottle of water at his wife's head. The deceased strove to get out but could not, then he came and ran his knife into his belly, and the deceased pulled it out with his own hand, and with the assistance of Mills's wife, he being drunk, they got him down; then his wife opened the back door into another room, and let the deceased out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing more?</p>

I asked her what she had in her apron, she said it was nothing to me. I then asked her where the child was which she carried into the empty house, and she said she carried never a one in; I said I'd take my oath I saw her carry one in in her hand. She still denied it. My sister came to my assistance: she drove her back to the empty house, while I went to get farther help. When we came before the justice, he asked her whether she intended to go to the child again, she said, no, she did not.</p>

            . On the 28th of June, about three in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner go down with a child into this empty house, there are nine of them all on a row. I could not imagine what she did there so long.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any thing with her besides the child when you saw her ?</p>
               <p>Knapp. She had nothing but the child.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might she stay there ?</p>
               <p>Knapp. I believe she might stay about 3 quarters of an hour. When she came out she had no child, my sister, the other witness, being a little nimbler than I, ran down stairs to stop her. I seeing she was like to be too much for her, went down and took her back to the house where we had seen her carry the child in; still she insisted upon it she carried none in. I took the clothes out of her apron. At last she said, if you will do nothing to me I will bring you the child, this was after I had said she should fetch it; then I kept at the door while she went up stairs. She brought the child down naked, excepting a flannel petticoat, which the child said she had put round her neck, and shut her in a closet. We got a proper officer and had her before justice Lediard; he asked her if she had any design of going back to the child, she said no. The clothes as laid in the indictment produced in court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know whose child it was?</p>
               <p>Knapp. I did not at that time. We proposed to the prisoner, if she would tell us where she took the child from we would let her go, upon that she told us.</p>

I met a man, a stranger that came in to see a brother prisoner, who told me there was a woman fell down stairs, and he believed she was fuddled. Then I went with a lighted-piece of paper, which I had in my hand, to see who it was. Then I saw one Jourdan on the stairs; I desired him to fetch me a large candle, he said he could not. I asked what was the matter, he could not tell, and repeated the words several times. While I then stood by the woman she lifted up her head on one side as she lay at my foot. I jumped over the body and went into the ward for a candle, there I saw the prisoner standing at the upper end of the ward; I went to him and said, Finch, what have you done? done, said he, I know I have done it, and came up to me and gave me two letters; I said don't give me your letters, come down along with me. I went down into the cellar to light my candle, he went with me. I left him in the laundry. When I was below I saw Mr. Taylor, sitting in the bar in a fright. I stood to see what was the matter with him, he told me Finch had killed his wife, so I staid below while the gentlewoman, Mrs. Inskip, that keeps the tap, went up stairs to see if it was so or not. She came down and said he had almost cut her head off; then I went up, and when I came into the lummery I was ordered by the steward of the house to search Mr. Finch, who was there at that time; he immediately put his hand into his waistcoat pocket and said, here is the razor, and gave it me, it had blood on it. Produced in court with blood dried on it. Then I took off his neckcloth, garters, and buckles, and was ordered to carry him into the strong room by the steward and constable of the day. Then I said to him, Mr. Finch, do you chuse to see your wife as you pass by, or shall I put a handkerchief over your eyes? He chose the latter. Then I led him to the strong room, there I searched him again and took a penknife out of his pocket my reason for searching him was left he should make away with himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think he might do so from any disorder of mind, or lunacy ?</p>
               <p>Bates. No, none at all, but as he had done a desperate action, I knew not but he might do so to himself. I tied his arms behind him with a cord, and locked him into the room till we could get a pair of hand-cuffs, which were sent for from Newgate. When they were brought, we went to him; at opening the door he sat on the bench with his hands behind him as I left him. I asked him what he had been doing twice, but he gave me no answer. I laid hold of his arm, and said, Why you have broke the rope. He gave me no answer. I went and put the handcuffs on. When he came to himself, we began to ask him how he could be guilty of such a rash action; he said, nobody could tell the provocation he had to do it. When I have sat up with him in the night, he would frequently say, he would do it was it to do again, sooner than any man should enjoy his wife. He told me the time we left him he had tied himself up twice, and his neck appeared red, and shewed the mark of the rope.</p>
               <p>On his cross-examination he said he never look'd upon the prisoner to be disordered in his mind, there were no signs of lunacy all the time he knew him; that he appeared as a man in his senses; and that he was very well respected by the whole house.</p>

             Taylor. On the 23d of May, about 7 in the evening, I was coming up out of the cellar; the stairs front those where the murder was committed, I saw the deceased fall down within five or six stairs of the bottom. I turned round and ran to the bar, and told Mrs. Inskip that I was frighted out of my wits, and desired her to give me a little water, for I thought I should faint. When I came a little to myself, she asked me what had frighted me. I told her I believed Mr. Finch had thrown his wife down stairs, because as she fell she made no motion at all to save herself, but went with a dead weight with her head against the cistern at the bottom of the staircase. I sat in the bar while she went up. She returned in a very short space of time, and said he had cut her head almost off. Then I went up, and two or three persons having set her up on her breech, I saw her head was cut in a manner almost off. I went to the farther end of the lummery, there I saw the prisoner, Mr. Bates, and the Steward, they were searching him. Bates had the razor in his hand. I said to Mr. Finch, How could you be guilty of such a rash action ? He said, the provocations were so great, that was it to do again he would do it; for he was a dead man he was sure.</p>

            . On Sunday the 16th of June, about six in the evening, I was with a neighbour of mine at his door, I heard a noise at the end of the lane; presently they got into <placeName id="t17540717-45-crimeloc223">Salisbury-Court</placeName>

The prisoner said, D - n the scoundrels, we will lick them all round. The deceased would have nothing to say to him, but turned about and crossed the way towards the Swan. The prisoner pulled off his coat and waistcoat, and followed the deceased and gave him two or three knocks in the face. The deceased fell down, and to appearance lay for dead. I said to the prisoner, You are a scoundrel for using the man so ill that did not offend you. Then the prisoner ran away, and was taken near the steps in Bridewell-Lane, and brought to the Swan; the deceased was carried to Mr. Freak's, a surgeon in Salisbury-Court; there he came to himself a little, but was carried there by his arms and legs as a dead man. The gentleman pulled out a tooth or stump that the deceased complained of as either broke or loose.</p>

            . I was at my door in Shoe-Lane on a Sunday evening, about six o'clock, I saw a crowd of people, and went to them into Salisbury-Court. There were two men fighting: I heard the prisoner at the bar say, D - n the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175407170033"/> scoundrels, we will lick them all round; then he ran to the deceased, and struck him two blows. He fell to the ground; he received a cut in his forehead; it bled very much; he lay as if he was dead; he was carried to Mr. Freak the surgeon; there his wound was dressed. I saw him led home between two to Mr. Took's in Fleet-Street; on the Monday morning he appeared before the sitting alderman at Guild-hall; I was present; the alderman committed the prisoner to the Compter for want of bail.</p>

            . The first I saw of it was, the deceased was coming through the crowd, seemingly towards the White Swan, as the other two were fighting, and when he was pretty near the kennel the prisoner at the bar gave him a blow on the left side of his face with his right hand: The second blow brought him to the ground; he was taken up for dead, and carried to a surgeon in Salisbury-Court; then the fighting broke up.</p>

            . The quarrel began with me; I was one of the two men that was fighting; it at first began with the prisoner splashing and jostling against me. I took my hand and just touched my face afterwards. This was in Shoe-Lane. He began to curse and swear. There were about half a dozen of the prisoner's company. Then the others of his company d - d their eyes, and swore they would fight. One d - d my chuckle head, as he was pleased to call it, and swore he would sight me. I never saw him before. I said, Gentlemen, I don't want to fight; I have no concern at all with you. Words ensuing, they followed us over Fleet-Street. We were four of us in our company, but two of them went away when the quarrel began, and left only the deceased and I. One of the other company came into Salisbury-Court, and gave me several blows. I held an oak-stick behind me, and defended myself with my hand as well as I could. Two gentlemen came by, and said, Countryman fight away, you shall have fair play. I dropt my stick and fell to fighting. I was soon knocked down in the kennel. I never saw a blow struck between the deceased and the prisoner. When I got up they told me my partner was killed.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Freak, and dressed the deceased's wound that night. To the best of my remembrance, it was on the left side of his forehead. He was very bloody. He had two teeth knocked out, one I took out that night, the other was very loose, which came out the next day; he was very much in liquor; the flesh was divided to the skull, about an inch and an half in length. I found no fracture or ill symptoms, and thought it had a very good appearance. I came away, and the next day I went again; the wound looked well then. I continued dressing him for about eight or ten days; after that I heard he carried a load on his head. I had word came he was extreamly ill. I went and found he had a fever upon him; I dressed the wound, and bled him. After that he was willing to get into the hospital, he not having wherewithal to maintain himself. He was taken in the next morning, and died there.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think was the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>White. I do believe he died of that accident.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you find bad symptoms first appear?</p>

I got out of the way of the stick, and asked him what he struck me for. He said I called after him; then he struck me on the breast. One of my companions was standing by me.</p>

               <p>Davnell. When I came there I found the back window was all of it taken out, and the cross bar of the window was taken away. I went up stairs and missed my watch and 2 shirts; we have but one room above. Then I went in search of the person that robbed me.</p>

             I live at the Red-Lion at South Mimms; the prisoner came into my house, and called for a pint of small beer; he sat down in a chair while he was drinking the small beer, and said he had got 2 gowns to sell; I saw them, and were suspicious of his stealing them. I sent for the constable, and had him taken up. We took him before the justice, there he owned he was guilty.</p>
               <p>Q. What were his words ?</p>
               <p>M. Tull. He said, he stole the gowns.</p>

               <p>M. Tull. No; he did not.</p>

               <p>M. Tull. Because there was a man in our house that knew the gowns.</p>

I went to felt them to the prisoner at the bar; he desired to try them on, and when he had them on his back a woman came in, and they had a word or two together : I took hold of him, and said, pray let me have the things, I got the coat and waistcoat, then I said let me have the breeches; he would not pull them off; but said his wife would pay me for them. I said, I will not trust your wife nor you neither, for she is another man's wife. He took the coat and waistcoat up stairs, and lay in my house all that night. The next morning, betwixt seven and eight o'clock, I went up to his room, and brought the coat and waistcoat down, but I never could get the breeches; he lay in them. I put the coat and waistcoat in a box in my shop, and did not know but they were there till about three weeks after.</p>

             came into my house, and said, he met the prisoner very fine. I said, With what? He said with the coat and waistcoat upon him. Then I went and looked in my box, and found they were missing. I enquired after him, and found him in bed. I saw the breeches under his head. I took hold of them, and asked him where my coat and waistcoat were. He said, Don't make a noise, I'll go and get them.

I said, Have patience, and don't take a poor man's life away.

I live over-against the prosecutrix; she keeps a chandler's shop; I went in there for some things I wanted; she said she had sold the prisoner at the bar a suit of cloaths, (I have forgot the price, but she told it me then;) she said she supposed she should have no money for them, and she did not expect it; but if he did not pay her, she said she would swear a robbery against him. I said in answer, You say you sold them, and the man says he'll pay you for them how can you go to swear a robbery against him if that is the case ?</p>
