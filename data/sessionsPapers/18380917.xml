                  </hi>. I work on the rail-road. I saw Armstrong on Wed<lb/>nesday, the 22nd of August—Howland was with me—Armstrong asked us if we wanted a joint of mutton—I said, "Yes"—he asked what joint I should like to have—I told him a leg—he said, "You can't both have legs; Howland must have one leg, and you must have a shoulder"—he did not say when we were to have it—this was between three and four o'clock in the afternoon—next morning he said, "I have brought what we were talking about yesterday"—he went away, and came down the field with the mutton in a smock-frock—he opened it, there was one leg of mutton, and another joint—he took it across the road, and put it behind the hedge—I asked what he wanted for it—he said, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said, "Do you want as much for the shoulder as for the leg?"—he said, "We will make that all right"—he went away towards his work, after putting it behind the hedge, and between four and five o'clock he fetched the bundle away.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Eagle-street. On the 28th of August I went to the Bricklayer's Arms, and borrowed six half-crowns, and one crown-piece, of the landlord—the prisoner was present, and another man, who has been tried—they came and assaulted me—they pulled my nose over my face—I got up to hit at them, and as I was going out of the door the prisoner snatched hold of my waistcoat-pocket, and pulled it off, with my money—there was a crown, six half-crowns, one sixpence, and a half-penny—this is the waistcoat—in about two hours after he brought the pocket back to the landlord, and said he had picked it up—when he took the pocket he knocked me about, and when he saw the policeman coming. he <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> away with the pocket, the money, and the tobacco-box.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Hart's-lane, Bethnal-green, and am a master shoemaker. The prisoner came to me on the 5th of September, and inquired if his cousin, who lives at my house, was at home—his cousin was not at home—I had seen him frequently before—I saw a bag with him, and asked him if he had left his master—he said he had—I told him he had better go to his aunt's, and if he wanted to see his cousin, to call in the morning—he did call, but I was absent—when I came how he called again, and I questioned him as to the property he had, and he said he had left his master on the Monday morning—I told him I thought it would be prudent on my part to write to his master—he agreed that I should write, which I did on the 6th—he left the property with me, and the next morning he said one or two things were his master's—I should say that I did tell this to the Magistrate—my depositions were read one to me.</p>

I was in Long Acre, and Whitworth told me the prisoner had stolen a coat—I saw him running up with something in his arms—I pursued him, and in running through Wild-court, he threw the coat into the passage of the door-way—I took it up and then ran and took him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you sure he is the person? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I saw him do it—he had got about twenty or thirty yards before I took it up—there might be a child or a woman about, but there was no other man—I could not see his face—I am sure when I had picked up the coat, that I saw the same person running before me—because he had no tails on him coat—that is not the only reason—there was no man between me and him—he did not turn after I took up the coat—after I had brought him a short distance, he took a knife out of his pocket, and attempted to cut his on own throat, but I would not let him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Barton Lodge, near Preston, in Lincoln-shire. On Monday night last I was in Fleet-street, about ten o'clock, returning home, accompanied by my son, and between St. Bride's church and Temple-bar, near to Chancery-lane, I was met by a person who gave me a violent push in the stomach—I thought I felt my watch gone—immedia<lb/>ately put my left-hand to my side and found it was so, and at the moment the man who gave me the violent thump took to his heels as quick as possible—I immediately pursued him for about thirty yards before my son came up to me—he passed me, and I called "Stop thief," and continued to purse about fifty yards—he then turned to the left, and went up a small street, through which my son pursued him, and when he was within a few yards of him, I saw a gentleman stop him, and my son seized him—I am sure the prisoner is the man—I gave him in charge, and saw him give my watch up to the officer—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 69, Brook—street, Lambeth—I am not in any business. I was formerly in the employ of the East India Company—in 1834, I was pensioned off by the Company, after long ser<lb/>vice, at the expiration of their charter—I had a brother, named Willams Bricknell—he died at the beginning of 1834—at his death I came into per<lb/>session of a freehold estate at Stock well—it consisted of houses, with garden ground attached to them—they were underlet to Mr. Bricknell—I afterwards took possession of the premises, and was looking for a tenant for then—I was at that time acquainted with a gentleman, named Patten, who resided it Medway—street, Milbank—I was in the habit of visiting him—I because acquainted with the prisoner about the time I came into possession of the property—I first saw him at Mr. Patten's—he married one of his daughter—he is a surveyor, I believe—I told him I wished to get another tenant for my property, and he said he would take or purchase it—I had before that become acquainted with a person named Potter, who is a brick-layer and plasterer, in Clapham—road—I first saw him by his coming on my premises while I was there—he made me an offer for the premised, and I accepted it—that was in September, 1835—there was a written agree<lb/>ment between us, which was prepared by Mr. Kempster, Potter's solicitor—the paper was executed and signed the day after he made me the offer—I saw the prisoner very shortly after, and told him I had entered into an agreement with Mr. Potter, and had granted him a term for ninety—nine years, at 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—the prisoner said it was a very imprudent agreement on my part; that I had had advantage taken of me—I had received sixty guineas rent before for it—the prisoner said if he had taken them he would repair the place and build on it, and he said if I wrote him a letter, dating the letter before the agreement with Potter's it would do away with Potter's agreement—I have seen the prisoner write, and believe this (a paper) to be his writing—I received it, I suppose, two months after the conversation I have mentioned—when he presented it to me he told me this was the way my paper should be drawn out for my security, and it would then do away with Potter's Chancery suit; I should be quite safe—Potter had taken pro<lb/>ceedings in Chancery against me—I agreed to this proposal, and he said if I went to Mr. Moore I should get the necessary deeds prepared there—I afterwards received this letter—I believe it to be the prisoner's hand<lb/>writing.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The documents here referred to, were read as follows</hi>:)</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183809170053"/>
               <p>"1. A short agreement must be made, and dated in September, to show that the sale was effected at that time, in case any inquiry should arise as to the time of making the sale; this is not absolutely necessary, but it will look better.</p>
               <p>"2. An assignment must be made to enable me to grant leases, and to render me safe in making improvements, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>"3. A deed must be held by Mr. Bricknell, to secure to him a perpetual rent—charge, and also a penal sum of 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to secure to him the re—possession of the freehold in years. This term should be long enough to allow of the Chancery proceedings being brought to a close, or aban<lb/>doned.</p>
               <p>"4. The same deed must secure to me the granting of a lease for seventy years, otherwise the lease I grant would be bad."</p>

               <p>"Dear Sir,—I am sorry to hear that you have been in any trouble about Potter, in regard to your letting the Stockwell property to him. I have no idea that the Court of Chancery will compel you to confirm an im<lb/>prudent and injurious contract, entered into in an unguarded moment, and by surprise, and which must necessarily be highly injurious to the interest of your successors; and as far as I am concerned in the purchase of the property—I beg you to make yourself perfectly easy, for let the matter terminate how it may, I entirely exonerate you from any liability on my account, not doubting in the least that you have acted in the matter with perfect integrity throughout.

                  <hi rend="italic">re—examined. Q.</hi> Did he tell you, at any time, the use you were to make of the letter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—in case Mr. Potter should be very troublesome with me, I was to be sure he would take no advantage of it—that it would exonerate me for any trouble he (Mr. Stanford) might get into—in consequence of his directions I went to Mr. Moore, in the begin<lb/>ning of January, 1836—Mr. Moore was quite a stranger to me then—I had quite a difficulty to find his house out—I went there again a day or two after, on the 6th, and Mr. Moore then produced these deeds to me, which I exe<lb/>cuted at six o'clock in the evening—I paid him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to allow me to execute them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any other deed executed about the same time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, that was the only one, except the rent—charge deed, which was exe<lb/>cuted about a month after—(<hi rend="italic">this being read, was an agreement, dated 26th January, between Samuel Bricknell and the prisoner, conveying the premises to the prisoner, in consideration of</hi> 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—no portion of that 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was ever paid to me—(looking at some deeds)—I cannot precisely say the time I executed these deeds—it was after these time Mr. Moore moved from Harley—street to chambers—it was about a month after the other deeds, I believe—I went and executed them by Mr. Stanford's directions—he said he be<lb/>lieved they were ready, and I went, and by chance met him there—I un<lb/>derstood from him the object of those deeds before I executed them—he said I should be secured by a rent—charge—(<hi rend="italic">the deed was here read, dated 28th January, 1836, which set out that the </hi>850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had not been actually paid, And agreeing to lake in lieu of the same a rent—charge of 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per annum</hi>, &amp;c.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time you executed these latter deeds, in whose possession were the title—deeds of the property? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In Mr. Stanford's—he had ob<lb/>tained</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183809170054"/>
               <p>them from me the beginning of November, 1835, as soon as potter filed his bill—before that they had been kept in the Bank of England—I gave them to Mr. Stanford, because Potter filed a bill in Chancery against me—Stanford saw the bill, and in reading the bill he said they would take my deeds from me—I asked him how I was to save them—he said give them to him, and he would send them to his banker's—in consequence of that I took them from the Bank of England, and gave them to him—I had no conversation about outstanding terms at the time I executed there latter deeds—after executing the deeds I was told that Mr. Hele was in possession of the premises—I saw a copy of his notice to the tenants—in consequence of that I was advised to file a bill in Chancery against the prisoner and Mr. Hele.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Mr. Veal, from the Six Clerks Office, here produced the bill dated 9th, March, 1838, also Stanford's answer to the same, dated 26th June, 1838</hi>.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was it you first became acquainted with the contents of the answer to the bill you filed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know—it was two months ago I suppose—in consequence of that I went to the office of Edwards and Wormald to make inquiry, and was there shown the deed in question—this signature to it, purporting to be mine, is not my writing—it was not made with my knowledge or authority—I never executed any deed referring to this matter but in the presence of Mr. Moore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before the prisoner's answer was read to you, did you know of the existence of any deed which purported to be executed by yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, months ago, by telling the circumstance to a friend of mine, he told me I had absolutely conveyed my property away, because I had assigned the outstanding terms—that was, I think, some months before I filed the bill—I had never seen the deed till I went on the occasion I have named, after hearing the answer read—I went before the Magistrate, I belive, about a week after I saw the deed, and complained of this offence—I pub<lb/>lished bills on discovering this, offering a reward for the prisoner—I caused him to be sought for, and a warrant was issued for his apprehension—I after<lb/>wards received information where he was, and found him at the Lock-up house in Carey—street, a prisoner for debt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> By the answer which has been read, it is stated the deed was executed at Leicester, in April; where were you in the early part of April, 1836? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At home, in London—I was not at Leicester at that time, nor for years before—I was living at my accustomed residence in April, and was very frequently in the habit of seeing the prisoner about that time—the dispute between Potter and myself was arranged last June twelvemonths—I have not received any of the rent—charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR FREDERICK POLLOCK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have left the question unfinished about Potter—did you not pay Potter a sum of money to dispose of the suit? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I paid him his expenses, amounting to about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think—I did not give him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. besides—I gave him what was asked altogether—I believe it included the costs——I do not pre<lb/>cisely know what was paid—I have receipts at home for it—I will not swear it was exactly 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think I can swear it was not 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—it was above 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—part was for costs, and part to satisfy him—he said, "I have been to an expense, treating people, and so on, I will take a sum of money—and I paid him—I cannot say how many months I was acquainted with the assignment of the outstanding terms before I filed the bill—six or seven, or ten months—my bill was filed in March—I might have known of it ten months before—as far back as May, 1837, very likely—it was not</p>

               <p>so far back as 1836—it might have been twelve months back—I think not more because I lost sight of the gentleman who gave me the information—he was then living at Mr. Wright's, who is one of the trustees—my present solicitor, Mr. Hodgkinson, prepared the bill—the reason it was not come before was, they did not choose to go on with it—I was desirous—I saw the answer I suppose about two months after the bill was filed—Mr. Sanford, I believe, owns a house in Pall Mall—I have been there repeat<lb/>edly—I knew he lived there—he is a married man, and has one child, I believe—he has been married two or three years, I suppose—I knew him as a single man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now did not you go to his house in Pall Mall, and against the pillars of that house stick certain placards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They might be stuck there, I do not stick them—I went there with some in my hand, and gave one into the house—I do not think I gave more—I cannot tell what became of the rest—several were distributed—I have got some of them now by me—I do not know that I directed them to be stuck on Mr. Stanford's houses—they might do what they liked with them—they might be about the pillars—I dare say that was done by my directions.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, when before the Magistrate, did you make any charge against Mr. Stanford for forgery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—there were very few words said—the Magistrate advised me to put in bail—I told the Magistrate the circum<lb/>stances, and asked him for a warrant—he said it was out of his district, or else he should have no hesitation under the circumstances to grant it—it was Mr. Trail—I did not prefer an indictment against Mr. Stanford for forgray till after I was indicted for the placard, but I had the intention—I had no intention of doing so till I saw the instrument itself—I had been told of its existence, and I took steps about it months ago—I employed Mr. Watts, a solicitor—I do not suppose he is here—this is not my hand<lb/>writing—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the signature of a letter which was doubled down</hi>.)—I</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not exactly prepared to say whether I shall ex<lb/>pose my affairs—I only appeal to you as a gentleman—I have some in Commercial—road—there was at one time a notion that a rail—road might pass there—I did not consult Mr. Stanford on the subject—I had some conversation with him about it—I see in his answer he speaks of it, but I did not take his opinion about it—I had no occasion to ask his opinion about it—common conversation occurred that I had a house or two there, and should be glad, as it would better pay me, if they went over it—I have the ground—rent of four small houses there.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the latter end of 1836—it was because he did not pay me the rent charge, and I saw there was a deficiency somewhere—I went to his house in Pall Mall—I do not know when that was—it was the latter end of 1836.</p>

The draft of this freehold conveyance was prepared by Mr. Carter, who has chambers in the house; in fact, the whole house is his property—the prisoner came to make an apology, in having removed the draft from Mr. Carter's office—he said he considered there was a delay in the business, and had taken it to another attorney, and got it engrossed—I am not certain that he mentioned the attorney's name—he wanted to raise 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the estate—I had a client at that time of the name of Hele—I negotiated between the parties for Mr. Hele to advance the money—when the terms were agreed to, Mr. Stanford brought me the title—deeds, and I pro<lb/>ceeded to investigate the title—the draft of the freehold conveyance was prepared in our office—the rent—charge was not—I never heard of that for a long time afterwards—when I proceeded to investigate the title I found outstanding terms which must be got in—I told the prisoner they must be called in, and assigned to fresh trustees—he made some little objection, but at last said, of course, if I insisted on it, it should be done—the draft of the deed of assignment of terms had been prepared by Mr. Carter at the time of</p>

               <p>the conveyance, and finding that was not executed, I insisted on its being executed—I forwarded the draft to the solicitor of the trustees for his ap<lb/>oval, and afterwards, on its being returned, got it engrossed—it was then executed by the trustees, after it had been executed by Mr. Stanford, and thought to me as executed by Mr. Bricknell—I gave it into the hands of Stanford to have it executed by Mr. Bricknell—at that time it was not executed by either of the trustees—it was executed in my office by the prisoner, and witnessed by my clerk—he told me Mr. Bricknell was gone to Leicester, and the deed must be sent there to him—he told me Mr. Bricknell at Leicester on the same day as I delivered the engrossed deed to him—was all one conversation—it was first intended I should send it by coach, but in the course of the conversation, there seemed some doubt whether he had got the correct address of Mr. Bricknell at Leicester, and I trusted the to him, that he should go to Mr. Bricknell's house, to ascertain the correct address—I wrote a letter to Mr. Bricknell by his direction, as to how it was to be executed, and it was put into the parcel—I cannot be cer<lb/>tain whether I told the prisoner how it should be witnessed—I gave him he letter and deed, made up in a parcel—I did not know where Mr. Brick-lived at that time, except so far as the address said, at Lambeth—I had never seen him then—this was on the 21st of April, 1836—on looking at my papers, it appears I saw the deed again on the 25th of April, because on that say I forwarded it to Mr. Wright, the solicitor of the trustees, for execution—the prisoner brought it to me on the 25th of April, purporting to be exe<lb/>cuted by Mr. Bricknell—that was at my office in Gray's—inn—he did not tell one in what way it was executed—he brought it back, saying, "Here it is, executed," and, of course, I asked him no questions.</p>

                  </hi>/. I am a policeman. I was crossing St. John-street-road and Mizen delivered the prisoner and the coat into my hands, saying it was stolen—Hase came up soon after, and claimed it—the prisoner did not say Mizen stole the coat till he got to the office—he was taken nearly a quarter of a mile from where he stole the coat, as he ran a round-about direction—I saw Mizen collar him, but did not see him run.</p>

The prisoner was my journeyman, and was occasionally em<lb/>ployed in the shop to receive money—it was his duty to pay it to me or to my wife—on the morning of the 3rd of September, I told him he had sold a pair of shoes for two half-crowns, and he asserted that he had given my wife all the money he took—I told him he had not, for the man who bought them was there, and said he had given two half-crowns for a pair of shoes—the prisoner said he gave it to his mistress—my wife came in and said he had not—I sent for an officer and gave charge of him—he said he owned he was wrong, and if I would overlook it, he would give me the five shillings.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Kingsworth-place, Pimlico-walk, Hox<lb/>ton. I lived at No. 4 when this happened—Shaw and the man Midson lived on the ground floor of the same house—about half-past six o'clock, on Thursday evening, the 30th of August, I went up stairs—I had to pass the prisoner's room—the door was open, and I saw the three prisoners and the prosecutrix—the prisoner Shaw was drinking out of a quart-pot—I went up stairs and had my tea—about twenty minutes after, I came down, and went out of the street-door—the prisoner's door was open, and the street-door too—I went to No. 2, to a friend, and sat outside with him, looking—I remained with him till nine o'clock; but I went through my passage several times—I heard singing in the prisoner's room—about half-past eight o'clock I saw the three prisoners standing outside the door, talking together very slowly—I cannot say how Shaw was dressed—she had do bonnet or shawl on—George Midson had neither bat or coat on—they stood about ten minutes, and then went inside the door, and were no sooner in than they were all three out again, and walked up Pimlico-walk, leading to Hoxton—I passed by the room door again, and saw a widow's bonnet on the table—I went to bed, and was awoke about two o'clock in the morning by a noise—I then heard the prosecutrix—It told her to fetch an officer—I did not see her, as my door was shut—she made a communication to me that she had been robbed—I work at Chiswell-street, about half a mile, or three quarters from this place—I went there next day, and saw a cab with Shaw and the man Midson in it—I followed it as far as Finsbury-square—it stopped there—they got out, and Shaw asked me if I was going to <hi rend="italic">halloo</hi> and George Midson asked me if I was going to come it—I said I did not know what they meant, and he said was I going to split on that affair last night?—I said, I was on my own business, at Mr. Thwaites, the harness maker's, in Bishopsgate-street—they asked me to take something, and I refused three times—I subsequently went to a public-house, with a view of detaining them—I had some ginger-beer, and they had brandy; while there, George Midson asked if I knew how the window got on—I said I did not exactly know, but that she came and knocked at my door, about two o'clock—I said I understood that she had been robbed of a diamond ring and watch—he pulled out a mourning ring and said "This is the ring"—he then put his hand into his right-hand pocket, and pulled out three seals attached to a chain, and asked me whether they were good—he then pulled out the watch, attached to the end of the chain—Shaw then said it was an old-fashioned watch, not much good—I said there were thirty sovereigns—he said, "That was no more than you could spend in a day"—I told him a man in the back-room had been taken upon suspicion, and he said he must send him something to keep him the week he was remanded—he said it would not do for him to take him any thing or he should be taken, and while we were at the door they asked me whether the widow had a ring and pin about her—I said I did</p>

                  </hi>. I am a first-class foreman at the West India Dock Com<lb/>pany's warehouse, in Crutched-friars, and have been so four years. The pri<lb/>soner Warren was in the service of the establishment, as a labourer, for eleven or twelve weeks before this transaction-his hours of work were from eight o'clock in the morning till four o'clock in the afternoon, except when we were busy, and then we sometimes altered the hours to seven o'clock in the morning-from twelve o'clock to twenty minutes past is allowed for dinner—the men generally take their refreshment in the warehouse-none of the men can leave the warehouse between eight and four o'clock without a pass from me—it is impossible—this is the pass we give the men-(<hi rend="italic">looking it a paper</hi>)—on Wednesday, the 12th of September, Warren was at his work at the warehouse—I saw him-(<hi rend="italic">looking at a book</hi>)—this is a book of the labourers' time—it is kept by Thomas Thorn, who is here-Warren was at the warehouse from eight to four o'clock that day—he was with me all day in the tea warehouse.</p>

Case was in their service as groom—on the 11th of September, about half-past one o'clock, I saw him at their stable-door—a cart came into the yard to take some dung out—I saw Case take a bag with something in it, and put it into the cart-Pritchard, who was the carman, began to load the cart, and Case pulled the long dung over the bag—I let them load the cart, and as it was going I stopped them—I asked Case what was in the bag he put in the cart—he said, nothing but a little hay-seed that he had shaken out—I called a man named Scanlan to get the dung off, and the sack felt like oats—I had it pulled out, and found in it about a bushel and a half of oats, which I believe were the property of Mr. Braithwaite and his partner-Pritchard said he must go to his father—I went after him, and in the meantime Case took the bag up stain and emptied the oats into the bin again—I followed him and asked him what he did that for, and he said, "The best way too"-Pritchard was so near to Case, when they were put into the cart, that he must have Ken it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sixteen years old. I was in the ser<lb/>vice of Messrs. Davey and M'Murdo, wholesale drug-merchants, in Gould-square, Minories—the prisoner Smith was their porter—I live with my father, in Nicholl-street, Shoreditch—I first took things from my master's warehouse about six months ago—I was taken ill on a Wednesday, the latter end of August—it was the Wednesday before Smith was taken into custody-from the beginning of the six months till I was taken ill I took away goods from my masters' warehouse, about once or twice a week-Smith desired me to do so—I remember on one day taking some cochineal—I cannot say exactly what day it was-Smith desired me to do it, and I took about 10lbs. of it—I fetched it from the drying room, and put it into a canvas bag-Smith was at that time in the back yard of the premises, washing bottles—when I had got the cochineal into the bag I gave it to Smith—he kept it till the even<lb/>ing,</p>

               <p>I believe, in the magnesia room, and gave it me to take to the prisoner Clift, about seven o'clock-Smith called him Hutchinson-Smith told me to take it out, and give it to Hutchinson—I went out, and found Clift at the comer of John-street—he was not far from my master's pre<lb/>mises—I had seen Clift five or six times before—I had seen him with Smith-Clift used to come and meet me about dinner-time, and once or twice he met me at the same place in the evening-Clift did not give me any money when I took him the cochineal—he had before asked me to get him some things, unknown to Smith—I said, no, I would not get him any thing, unknown to Smith—he said he would give me the same price as he did Smith, and then I should not have to share half with him, but I should have as much again as Smith gave me—he said he would pay me on deli<lb/>very, if I would get him things unknown to Smith—on the day I took Clit the cochineal he did not give me any money, but said he would pay Smith—no charge had been made against me, or any proceedings taken, before the Wednesday on which I was taken ill, and on that day I voluntarily made a statement to my father—I then went before the Justice, and was examined as a witness on the Saturday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am turned of fourteen years of age. I live with my father in Phillip-lane—I am errand boy to Messrs. Davey and M'Murdo. On Saturday evening, the 1st of September, I saw the prisoner Clift in Crutched-friars—I had seen him before in a public-house with Thomas Whipps-Clift came right in front of me, and called out to the other lads, and then he said he thought I was Thomas—he asked me which way I was going—I said I was going home—he asked me whether Thomas was come out—I said, "Yes, some time"—I asked him what he wanted with him—he said he had got a ticket for the play—he then said he had been in a public-house, and he had heard a man say there was a robbery at Davey and M'Murdo's—that he asked him if he knew any thing about it, and he said "No"—he asked me if I knew any thing about it—I said "No"-Clift then said the man's name was Smith—I said, "Surely it is not Smith"-Clift then said he thought it very strange that I should be in such a firm and not know there was a robbery—he then walked; with me some distance and said, "I dare say you are an acute lad, do you go to that public-house for your dinner?"—I said "No, I go where I like"—he then said, "Between you and I, I want an article at present"—he mentioned the name of it, but I do not know what it was—he then asked what capacity I was in in the firm—I said, "The same as Thomas"—he said "Between you and I, if any thing should be done, you would not let any one know it, not let Thomas know it"—I said, "No"—he then said</p>

I said we always kept a good stock of them—he then said, "Out of two cwt. of opium, you could take about thirty pounds"—I said, "How?"—"Oh," he said, "put some into your pockets, some on your groin, and some under your arms, and bring it out by degrees"—he then said I could bring about ten pounds of saffron, and I could bring some Tonquin beans, and when it came to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, he would wrap it in a bit of paper, advertise it, and offer 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward, and I should take it to him and receive the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him what price he would give me—he said, the same as <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>—that was 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for opium, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for saffron—he did not mention the price for Tonquin beans—I said, "Two shillings for opium that is worth a guinea a pound?"—he said 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was what he gave <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, but he would give me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for opium and saffron, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt. for Tonquin beans, and I was to meet him at the public-house in Duke-street, with as many articles as I could get him—I told him I would talk to him on Monday-(this was on Saturday)—I was going to leave him, and he offered me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said I would not take it then; I would take it on Monday—he wished me to take it and drink his health—I said, "No"—he said, "Come and have a pint of beer"—I said, "Then you can give me the prices what you will give me"—we went into the public-house, and he wrote down on this paper, (<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>,)"3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for opium, 3<hi rend="italic">S</hi>. for saffron, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt for Tonquin beans"—he wished me to drink, and I put it to my lips, but would not swallow any—he wished me to finish it—I said, "No," it was bad—I asked him how he first came to know Tom—he said he was sleeping with a girl at his house, and then he said, "If you must know, I keep a b-y-house"—I then said, "Perhaps you can get us a girl?" on purpose to find out where he lived—he said, "That could be done;" where could he meet me on Sunday—I told him I bad some business to attend to—he said, "Could you meet me at the Half-way House, Com<lb/>mercial-road, on Sunday evening?"—I said, "Yes," and with that I left him—I went home and told my father, who took me to the foreman, and he to to the inspector—I met Clift on Sunday at the Half-way Houses—he was talking to a young man—I went and shook hands with him—he said." Excuse me for a few minutes"—he went and spoke to the man, and then he came to me, and walked down the road with me—he said he had been talking to <hi rend="italic">Poll</hi> about me—I said I had no money—he asked how much I had—I said, "A penny; that is all I am allowed"—he said, "Come on," and he took me down the road, and turned off down a turning to the right—he told me to stop there, and he would talk to some young women who were there—I heard one young woman say to him, "That can be done," and the young woman went into a house-Clift followed her, and they called me in-(the officer had desired me to go wherever Clift took me)—I went in, and sat down—I saw Clift give a shilling to another woman, and she went out—I came away, and made an appointment to see clift again on the Monday, about one o'clock, with some opium, corrosive-sublimate, ginger, and nutmegs—I mentioned that to the officer and to Mr. Davey, my master, and on Monday I was furnished with some opium. which was marked—I carried it to the place where I was to meet Clift—he ran up to me, and I said, "Take the opium"—he said, "Don't you be seen with me"—the officer then took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I have a distillery in Sun-street, Bishops<lb/>gate. On the morning of the 9th of September, when I went to the distillery, the tiles had been removed from the western gutter, and an ascending I found a great portion of the leaden gutter had been removed—it has taken about 4cwt. to repair the mischief done—I have seen the lead now produced, and compared it with the lead which remains in the gutter—it corresponds with it exactly—I know this to be the lead I lost.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fanner at Barking, in partnership with my brother. We occupy 500 acres of land there—the prisoner was in our em<lb/>ploy, off and on, for eight or nine years. On Tuesday, the 28th of August, I saw him before seven o'clock in the morning—he was going to work, and came for some beer with another man—they were to have gone is work that day in a field-in the afternoon I went to the field, and found they had not done above an hour's work—they were both lying in the field, and his mate was asleep—the prisoner rose his head up, and I spoke to him about it, and told them they had both better go, and not left me see them any more, as they were of no use—I then left him, and I did not see him again that day—on the following morning, about six o'clock, I heard something had happened to one of my calves—I went down to the cow-house with the man who came to give me the information, and found one calf with its throat cut—I found three or four men in the cow-house—I saw the pri<lb/>soner there afterwards—I had been told something about a basket, and when I went in I said, "Where is the basket you told me of?"—the pri<lb/>soner was behind the men, and said, "It is mine, master"—I said, "How came your basket here?"—he said, "I don't know, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> must have brought it"-(he has a brother named William who worked on the farm)—I said, "How could <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> bring your basket when he is at work in the barn, and you ought to have been mowing in the field; it could not be <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> "—he said, "Master, you don't suspect I cut the calf?"—I said, "Why, I don't know, <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>, it looks very suspicious, your basket being in this cow-house"-left the cow-shed and went and spoke to my brother, and in consequence of what passed, went with my brother in search of the prisoner—we found him sitting down in a field in about a quarter of an hour, and his mate with him—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>, you are the man that cut the calf's throat?" he said, "No, master, it <hi rend="italic">aynt</hi> "—I said, "Never mind, get up and let me see"—he got up and I saw blood on his trowsers and on his smock—I said, "Look here, here is blood about you"—he said that was through his</p>

                  </hi>. I am cowman to Messrs. Choat On the Tuesday night before this happened I remember leaving the calf in the cow-yard about nine o'clock—I know the prisoner's brother Bill—he was at work in the barn with me that night—I saw him leave his work about nine o'clock-before I left the cow-shed I shut the barn up, and he went right across the yard into the road—I saw him go off the cow-yard—I did not go into the cow-house myself that night—on the following morning I went to the cow-house about five o'clock—my son had got there before me—he showed me a basket in the cow-house—I noticed that a truss of straw which had been tied up the night before was opened and spread a little, as if somebody had slept there—it was untied—I fetched the cows into the field, and went to the calf-pen to fetch the calves, and found one had its throat cut-as I was leav<lb/>ing the cow-house I saw the prisoner walking in the cow-yard, about three or four yards from the door—I asked him what he was after—he said, "Me, I am looking for my brother <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> "-his brother had not come at that time—it was about half-past five—I do not know whether the prisoner went away or not, but I did not see him again till I saw him in the cow-house—on finding the calf cut, I went to master and brought him down to the cow-house—the prisoner was then there—I had told my son to take care of the basket which was found in the cow-house until I came back, and when I came back I saw the basket on the prisoner's shoulder-master asked him about it—I have heard his evidence—it is correct—the calf was obliged to be killed afterwards.</p>

I went to the cow-house about five o'clock in the morning, and found a basket in the cow-house up against a post—the calf-pen is about two yards from the cow-house—I noticed a truss of straw untied and littered about a little—that had been tied up the day before—my father came after me, and I told him what I had seen—he left the basket with me and went to fetch his master—the prisoner came into the cow-house with three more men—I told him there was basket—he said, "It is mine"—he took it and kept it till my father came in—the basket was not there the night before.</p>

On Wednesday morning, the 9th of August, I was called into the prosecutor's cow-house, and found the calf with its throat cut about an inch cross ways, with a blunt or short pointed blade to enter—it was then ripped up about the length of my hand, and jagged and torn up-(<hi rend="italic">looking at the knife found on the prisoner</hi>)—in my opinion this is the sort of knife that would make such a cut—there is no point to it.</p>

               <p>morning I was informed of this by Mr. Choat—I went and examined the calf in the pen—I put my fist into the hole—there was a deal of blood about the pen—I went to the prisoner who was in charge of somebody at the house, and asked him how the blood came on his trowser and said I suspected him of cutting the calf—the blood was on the front part of his trowsers, and on examining further I found blood on his right shoe—these was also some on the right sleeve of his smock-frock—I said to him "Are you a right-handed man or a left?"—he said, "I am right-handed"—the blood on the sleeve appeared fresh—I first discovered the blood on the corner of the smock-frock, and afterwards found it had run up into the gathers—I said to him, "It is impossible this blood could come from the bleeding of your nose, or it would be on the upper part of your smock-frock"—it was quite fresh—there was no appearance of his having a bloody nose—I then said, "Where were you last night? I understood you were not at your lodging; where did you sleep? you were seen to come from the field last night with your victuals basket"—he said, "Yes, I had my basket, and I went to Mr. Gray's field with it; I went to sleep there, and when I awoke it was gone; how it came into the cow-house I can't say, I did not take it there, but it certainly is my basket"—on searching him I found this knife which I have produced—when I saw the blood on his sleeve I considered he must have held the calf, so that the blood would come on the right foot, and I found blood on his right foot—it had been rubbed to get it off the upper leather, but it was left on the sole under the nails—I could not observe any thing on the knife—I said to him, "You have been eating before I saw you this morning"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "What have you been eating?"—he said, "Beef," and the blade of the knife was greasy as if he had been cutting meat—the blood on the smock-frock must have spirted and flown very much.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. John Alexander Mathews, a plumber and glazier, in Dover-road, in the parish of St. Mary, Newington. On the 24th of August I went to bed about ten o'clock—I was the last person up—I got up about five o'clock next morning—I am sure it was be<lb/>fore six o'clock-as I was getting up I found the prisoner in my room—she got up out of a chair, and looked over my bed-(I had heard a great noise in the kitchen about twelve o'clock in the night, but I thought it must be the mice, and went to sleep again)—I asked the prisoner what she wanted—she said "My name is only Patty," and went up stairs to go out—she had no business in the house at all—I gave an alarm, and found a small pane of glass broken in the kitchen window—she must have got down the area, broken the glass, unbolted the front kitchen door, and got in—the door was bolted when I went to bed at night—I missed two gowns of my own, which had been in the front kitchen overnight—she had taken them off a nail, and put them into the area—I also missed two caps belonging to Mrs. Matthews, which were lying on my bed overnight—these are them-(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—the prisoner had lived servant in the house, but was dis<lb/>charged, I understand, about six months before I went there—I have been there six weeks—she had no business in the house—I found my gowns in the area, and my bonnet on her head.</p>

The pri<lb/>soner is a waterman, and had been in the habit of coming to my house before this happened-about a month or six weeks before this, I refused him permission to enter my parlour—when the company left the parlour on that occasion, he was the last that left—I went in to put the lights out, and he said, "I will mark you for this"—on the night of the 26th of August, about ten minutes before eleven o'clock, he came to my house in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, accompanied by two females—he came into the bar, then went into the tap-room, and went out to the females, wishing them to come out—I went and told him he could have what he liked at the bar, or take any thing outside, but I could not admit him at that hour in the evening—he directly caught hold of one of the girls, who had got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and tried to pull her past me—I stepped between him and the girl, as he had hold of her arm, between my door-post and the door—he was behind me, pulling her—he had got over the threshold—I put myself between them to prevent them coming in—he then let loose of the girl's arm, and struck</p>

               <p>and I followed them in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—we all got out, and the other gentlemen went down the hill—Mr. Mirfin did not go down the hill—he waited at the top—Mr. Broughton went down in company with five or six gentelemen—they did not go down altogether—they followed each other—I believe Mr. Eliot went first—I think two others went with him; then Mr. Broughton, and somebody with him, and I followed—when we got down the hill, the first thing that took place was the carpet-bag was produced—I do not know who produced it—I did not know any of the gentlemen, except Mr. Mirfin and Mr. Broughton—Mr. Broughton, and some other gentleman, who I did not know, then tossed which was to have the choice of ground—I have not seen that gentleman since—I do not think it was either of the prisoners—Mr. Broughton won the choice, and the ground was then marked out—Mr. Broughton and some other gentleman stepped it—I do not think it was either of the prisoners—I believe not-twelve paces was the distance stepped—Mr. Broughton and the same gentleman then tossed who was to have the charging of the pistols—Mr. Eliot's friend won that toss, and the pistols were then loaded, both pairs, two belonging to Mr. Eliot, and two belonging to Mr. Mirfin—Mr. Mirfin had taken down his pistols in his gig himself, and I carried them down to the ground—I delivered them to Mr. Eliot's friend to load after Mr. Eliot's were loaded—after the pistols were loaded, Mr. Broughton went up towards the mill to bring down Mr. Mirfin.</p>

               <p>sufficient for that—that was communicated to Mr. Mirfin, but he said he would receive nothing but a written apology, and insisted on another shot—this was after the first shot had been fired—there was nothing said before the first shot—after Mr. Mirfin made this statement, another pistol was de<lb/>livered to each—the had parties never left their ground—I had told Mr. Mirfin he was shot through the hat, and he took his hat off, and looked at it—I am not aware whether he was conscious of it—he said nothing, but took it off, looked at it, and placed it on his head again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Higgs, he lives in Hanover-street, Peckham. The prisoner lived with me before she went to the last place—after she was gone I missed a great number of things-among the rest, two stockings, but being odd ones, I had no idea of their being stolen—these are mine-(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>.)</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. You rolled up a bundle of things the night before I went, and there was this pair of stockings in them, and you said if I did not like to keep them I might throw them away. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did, but not these things, and she went away and left the bundle there, and did not take them.</p>
