A Midwife likewise deposed, the Child was at its full Time; That examining her as to the Manner of its Birth, she told them that she was delivered in the Chamber, and that she got out of the Bed early in the Morning, spread a Gown and Petticoat on the Floor, lean'd upon a Chest of Drawers, and the Child came from her upon them; That there was a young Woman in the Room in Bed, with whom she lay, who was asleep ( she being a Quaker would not swear, and so could be no Evidence) and that she being very ill, went again to Bed, lay about 3 Hours, and then getting up, was carrying it down Stairs in the Gown and Petticoat, and was met by the Man. The Evidence deposed likewise that the Child was dead, and that there did not appear any Marks upon the Child of its having been hurt any where, except that there was a sort of a blackishCircle about the Child's Mouth (which a Midwife likewise deposed was usual to such Infants, tho'dying by a natural Death.) They likewise deposed that the Child was opened by a Surgeon, and that there did not appear to be any Water in the Body of the Child. In order to the better Information of the Jury in this Case, the Statute was read in Court, which was made to prevent the clandestine Births and concealing the Death of Bastard-Children, which enacted, That the concealing the Birth and Death of Bastard-Children should make the Mothers deem'd the Murtherers of them. The Prisoner, to put her self out of the Reach of this Act, alledged, that she was a married Woman at the time of her Conception, having been married to one

             , who died same time before last Christmas. To prove this she had a Sister in Court, who deposed that she saw her married to the said Edward Wingate at Enfield Church. And others depos'd, they liv'd together for some time at Clerkenwell , and that the said Edward Wingate upon his Death-bed expressed his Concern in leaving her six Weeks gone with Child. Tho'in Contradiction to this, the Deceased's Sister deposed, that she examining the Prisoner since the Commission of this Fact, whether she ever had been married to her Brother, she answered her, she had not. But the other's Evidence prevailing, she was deemed not to be affected by that Statute. The Matter then turning on another Hinge, it being the Prosecutor's Business to prove the Child was born alive and that she murthered it. She said it was Still-born, and that she neither perceived it to stir nor heard it to cry, and produc'd a considerable Quantity of Child-bed Linnen in Court, which was sworn she provided for her Delivery; and her Sister deposed she spoke to her three Months since to be her Nurse; and likewise a Midwife deposed, that two Months since, she spoke to her desiring her to come to her when she sent for her, telling her she look'd the latter End of July or beginning of August. And the chief Stress of the Matter then being whether the Child was murthered by her before putting into the Copper, or alive when she put it in: As to the first , the Evidences generally agreed there were no visible Tokens of any Violence offered to the Infant; and as to the latter, the Judge being of Opinion it was not alive when it was put in, because of what had been before testified, that at its being opened there was no Water found in the Body of it. A Surgeon being call'd to give his Opinion on the Matter, confirm'd his Lordship's Opinion, deposing upon Oath he was of Opinion that no human Body could be drowned without receiving some Quantity of Water into the Body, and consequently the Child could not be alive when put into the Copper. The Matter being thus, that there was no sufficient Proof that she had either murthered the Infant, or that it was born alive, tho' the Action was so unaccountably inhuman, for which she gave but little Satisfaction, the Jury <rs id="t17170717-18-verdict86" type="verdictDescription">

            , who keep the Derby Alehouse in White-horse-yard in Kingstreet, Westminster, do hereby affirm , that our Child was so very ill with its Teeth, that it lay (as we thought and expected in Sorrow and Tears) ready to expire. We sent for the</p>
               <p>ANODINE NECKLACE,</p>
               <p>Recommended by Dr. Chamberlen, sold at the Golden Key over against the King's Arms Tavern in Kingstreet, Westminster, and put it about its Neck: It had not wore it above half an Hour, but the Child got up upon his Feet to play, to our great Amazement, and has ever since so visibly recover'd and thriv'd that thro' God's Blessing he is now a brave healthy lusty Boy; of the Truth of which we are ready to satisfy any Person that desires it. July 16,1717.</p>
               <p>For the Good of the Publick.</p>
               <p>WHereas several Gentlewomen and others of that Sex, in this Kingdom, have contracted an evil Habit of Body, wherein the vicious Humours, at first dispers'd thro' the Whole, comeat length to be lodg'd in one Part or another, and many times, for Causes too long to be here mentioned, are thrown down upon the Womb, occasioning a dangerous Weakness in that Part, which being neglected, at last turns Cancerous, and often proves Fatal. I cure the Diabetes when gives over by all other Persons. This is to acquaint all such as may have occasion, that a speedy Relief is to be had from an Experienc'd Midwife, dwelling at the Sign of the Queen's Arms, a Watch-Makers, near Exeter Exchange in the Strand, who perform'd a Cure upon a Lady at the Bath, after she was given over by the Physicians, and since has Cured several Gentlewomen and others in the City and Suburbs of London. I should not have put my self in Publick Print, but to satisfy the Afflicted where they may have present Ease and Relief.</p>
               <p>THE most excellent BALSAMICK WATER, being the greatest Preservative of Health in Nature, that in 50 Years Study of Physick I could find out, needs not much to be said in its Commendation, for it will recommend it self; and I have no other Interest in making of it Publick, but for the Satisfaction of my Friends, and the general Good of Mankind, and that it may not die with me. I don't (like the English Quack) say that it cures all Distempers; but it infallibly keeps the Body in good Health, and defends it from all infections Airs and distempers, by taking 3 Spoonfuls of it in half a Pint of warm Ale, a Glass of White Wine, Tea, or any other Liquid. It may be taken by all Persons, of what Age or Sex soever, at any time of the Day, without Consinement or Hinderance of Business, according to the printed Directions given with it. It prevents Consumptions, and cures them if not too far gone ; it relieves she Tissick and Shortness of Breath; cures Ulcers in the Lungs, or in any part of the Body; it opens all Obstructions, and infallibly destroys all sorts of Worms in Young or Old. It cares the Yellow and Black Jaundice, Leprosy, Itch, and Scald Heads. It certainly eradicates that reigning Distemper the Scurvey; chears the Spirits, strengthens the Stomach, and creates a good Appetite. I recommend it to all Child-bearing Women, it preserving the Infant from those Infirmities that Children are generally afflicted with, purifies the whole Mass of Blood, renders the Skin beautiful and clear, and causes easy Delivery. Likewise I recommend it to Sea-faring Men that Trade to the East or West Indies, or those Countries where Fevers or the Piague are infections. When all other Remedies fail, this excellent Balsamick Water drives out the Small Pox or Measles, and keeps them from the Stomach or Throat, preventing that Soreness which generally accompanies, and often proves fatal in that Distemper ; and also prevents the Small Pox or any other infections Distemper, from spreading in a Family. It's excellent for Gentlemen after hard Drinking, far exceeding any thing; it discharges the Body from the Impurity of bad Wine, and cleanses it from all Scorbutick Spots, Scabs, or Boyls , by bathing outwardly; and cures all Old Sores and Green Wounds, by washing the Place with it; and all sorts of sore Mouths caused by inward Heat or Canker . It is also excellent for all Persons that drink the Waters, causing them to pass and evacuate whatever Humours offend the Body . This excellent Balsamick Water is put up in half Pint Bottles, at 2 s.6 d. each Bottle, with Directions at large for the Taking and use of it, which being close stopp'd, retains its Virtue in all Climates; for the older it grows, the better it is: It generally gives one Stool, and works off by Urine. This excellent Balsamick Water is made by none but my self; and, to prevent Counterfeits, is sold only at Mr. Parker's, Book-seller, at the Bible and Crown in Lambord-Street , near Stocks-Market, sealed with a Liew and Dagger.
