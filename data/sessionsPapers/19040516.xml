                  </hi>. I live at 4, John Street, Mayfair, and am an actress—on March 19th I went to New York for a pleasure trip—I did not go pro<lb/>fessionally—I have acted in the provinces and different places—I am of independent means, and have some valuable jewellery—on my return journey I sailed on the <hi rend="italic">Oceanic</hi>, of the White Star Line, to Liverpool—had with me my sister and maid—on my arrival at New York people had wanted to interview me, and on that account we returned as Miss E Crocker, Miss G. Crocker, and maid—it was well known on board who we were—when we were about four days out from New York I made the acquaintance of the prisoner—I did not know him before—I had seen him sitting down in the ordinary way at meals—I heard him addressed as Mr. Ralph, and he gave himself out as Mr. Ralph—he was rather noisy—before I spoke to him I noticed he was wearing this pearl pin in his tie (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—he wore it practically every day—in the course of conversation he said the Grand Duke Boris of Russia had given it to him while he, the prisoner, was in Russia—he said he was going to the war as war corre-spondent for the "New York Journal" on the Japanese side, and that he generally wrote for four or five newspapers—before we arrived at Liverpool, on April 13th, I asked him to come and see me, and I gave him my address—he said he was going to stay with friends, and that his address for letters was Brown, Shipley Co., Bankers, Pall Mall—I travelled with him, my sister, and maid, to Euston, where he left us—on the first Satur<lb/>day after the 13th he called and took away some of my photographs in evening dress—he said he would like to call again and interview me before he left for Russia—he called on Sunday, May 1st, about 6 p.m.—he was shown into my drawing room, and I went in there and saw him—I was going out to dinner and had had put out in my dressing room some of my jewellery for the purpose of selecting some to wear and for some to be cleaned—I said to the prisoner, "If you want to talk to me you must come upstairs and talk to me while I clean my jewellery"—my maid was in and out the whole time—amongst my jewellery was this diamond ring</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—it is worth more than £100—the prisoner was wearing this same pin in his tie—alluding to the ring, he said, "That is just the thing I want"—I said, "You cannot wear that, it is a lady's ring"—he said, "That does not matter; Tiffany's, of Regent Street, have offered me £225 for this pearl pin, and I would like to exchange"—I said, "It is not worth £225, it is only worth £125"—I meant my ring was only worth £125—he said, "That does not matter; I would like to exchange"—after some time I agreed—he took the ring—he wanted me to go to Paris with him; I refused—next morning I took the pin to Tiffany's and made inquiries, I consequence of which I went to Brown, Shipley's and made inquiries there—I then went to Scotland Yard, and Detective Curry was directed to accompany me and put the law in motion—we went to Marlborough street Police Court, where my statement was taken down—I swore to it, and obtained a warrant—I believed all the prisoner's statements about the Grand Duke Boris giving him the pin and its being valued by Tiffany's at £225—the statements induced me to part with my ring—I saw no more of the prisoner until he was at the police court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was a large amount of jewellery in my dressing room—the prisoner and I were not alone in the room—he could not have stolen anything if he had wanted to then because I was looking on—he was in my room for about half an hour—he did not tell me that the pin had been given to him by a Russian in America to whom it had been given by Duke Boris, or that the Russian had said that the pin had been valued by Tiffany's—I admired the pin. and said it was a very fine pearl—I did not ask him if he would like to give it to me—people do not generally give pearls away for nothing—the ring was given to me—I do not buy things like that—when I bought my passage at the steamship office in London. I explained who I was—I did not take return tickets—I last acted in London last year, and also at Brighton, where I was playing a leading part—I did not travel in my own name because people had written to me for interviews, and I wished to avoid it—my name is Clinton—I did not want to exchange the pin; I admired it.</p>

I am a clerk employed by Henry Maynard Carter, accountant, at 79, Wool Exchange—on March 28th, about two o'clock, the prisoner came into the office and asked if Mr. Carter was in—I told him he was out—at that moment the telephone bell rang—I asked the prisoner to wait while I answered it—he by that time had entered the private office, and was standing before the fire—the cash box was in the centre of the room on a desk—I attended to the telephone and went into another room to get some paper—the prisoner said he would go, and call in later—I asked him his name, and he said, "J. W. Walker"—I did not see him take anything—before he came in I saw the cash box on the table—I missed it about half an hour after he had gone—it con<lb/>tained 16s. 6d. in money, and three drafts, the property of my master.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at "Ravenswood, St. John's Wood Park—I have been married to Major-General Carter for about ten years—the prisoner is my brother; at the time of my. marriage I failed to dis<lb/>pose that fact to my husband—before my marriage, employment was bund for him, and for some time he continued in my husband's service—hat employment came to an end in consequence of something the prisoner did, and since then I have helped him whenever he asked me—in 1903 he made an application to me in consequence of an accident which he said he had had, and that he would be lame for life—I found out that he story was false—I sent him £1, and said I could not help him so much</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant M.</hi>) I am on special duty on the Brighton Railway—on July 5th,1902, Superintendent Warren handed me eight return half tickets, and, in consequence of information, I caused them to be put in circulation at the Grosvenor Road collecting station for Victoria—Richard Fish was then a collector in the service of the company—on July 8th I stopped him as he was leaving the Grosvenor Road Station—Warren was with me—after a conversation I took him back to the station—he had a private bag with him, which I searched—this envelope was in the bag, sealed—it is addressed, "Mr. H. Smith, 12a Brewer Street, Buckingham Palace Road, S.W."—I opened the envelope and found seven return half tickets, two of them being those which I had passed through the Grosvenor Road Station—one was a second half, Brighton to London Bridge, No. 8131, dated June 25th, 1902, and one a second class return half, Hove to Victoria, No. 3575, dated July 2nd, 1902—the five other tickets were, one from Brighton to Victoria, No. 0592, one from Sandown to Victoria, second, two third class return halves, Ports<lb/>mouth to Victoria, and one to Waterloo—the last four would be available from Portsmouth—the Brighton to London Bridge ticket would also be available to Victoria—those return halves were available for two months.</p>

I am Superintendent of the Brighton Railway Police—I was formerly a police inspector—in 1900 I received information which caused me to make an investigation as to the circulation of tickets from March, 1900, till Fish's arrest on July 8th, 1902—on July 5th, 1902, I gave Badcock eight half tickets from various places on the South Coast to be put in circulation on Monday, July 7th—I was present on July 8th</p>

               <p>when Fish was arrested outside Grosvenor Road Station on his way home at the end of his day's duties—in consequence of an interview with him, we suggested he should go back to Grosvenor Road—we found a hand bag upon him—an envelope was discovered, and he was taken to the police station—he made a statement to me, and I went with Badcock to 4, Grosvenor Cottages, his private address, where, in the front room fireplace, I found the fragments of this letter and envelope, which I pieced together: "Dear Fish,—I will send you the suit of clothes from Ports<lb/>mouth Let me hear from you to the above,—Yours truly, H. Smith"—the envelope was addressed to 12a, Brewer Street, Buckingham Palace Road—in consequence of the letter and the address upon the envelope in Fish's bag I went to 12a, Brewer Street—that was after Fish's statement as to the letter which I had found—12a, Brewer Street was a newspaper shop where letters are received—I there saw Emma Pearce, who gave evidence at the police court—she was then an assistant—the occupier of the shop is now dead—in consequence of the result of my inquiries I obtained a warrant-Fish was convicted before the Recorder and sentenced to
eighteen months' imprisonment in October, having <hi rend="smallCaps">

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I know of no collectors having been discharged in September, October, or November, 1902, in connection with these tickets—I have heard that these tickets have not been circulated since the arrest of Fish—a collector was dismissed at the time Fish was arrested, but not in connection with these tickets, but because he was with Fish, and turning out his pockets, he had tickets he should not have had—we could have stopped the ticket stealing months before, but we wanted the receivers—Fish was at Grosvenor Road before my time; I can only speak of the time since the early part of 1902—I saw Fish at Brixton with Inspector Drew—I was with him about an hour—there is no rule with regard to the com<lb/>pany's servants betting, but if they were found betting, probably their services would be dispensed with.</p>

Smith, 12a, Brewer Street, Buckingham Palace Road—this is like it—in consequence of this letter and this envelope I put tickets in the envelope—12a, Brewer Street 5 a newspaper shop—I had letters left there on business transactions, but not tickets, addressed to the defendant as Smith—I went there on the Monday night and bought a paper—I was going to leave a letter—I hanged my mind—in consequence of what Mrs. Pearce said I came away and went home—the envelope and tickets were found in my satchel the blowing day when I was arrested—they were Brighton and Portsmouth tickets.</p>

I did not put any beef, nor help anyone else to do so, in Cornell's van"—I said to Butcher, "It is said that you went to Earnshaw, the carrier, about carrying some meat"—he said, "It is entirely untrue that I went to Earnshaw or any of his men this morning to ask him or them to take a quarter of beef or any meat or packs to Waterloo. If Earnshaw or his men say so it is a lie"—Dexter was standing away while this took place—I then called him—Butcher moved away—I said to Dexter, "What is it you want?"—he said, "I have come to ask what is this about Cornell's men saying that I and Butcher stole two quarters of beef from Swift's this morning.

                  </hi>. I carry on a tailor's business under the name of Walker Co., at 38, Sackville Street, Piccadilly—in March, 1903, Pack<lb/>wood, whom I had never seen before, came to me and ordered between £11 and £12 worth of clothes—he told me he was recommended by Taunton, who was already a customer of mine—Packwood having given me Taun<lb/>ton's address, I wrote to him for information concerning Packwood, and received this reply on March 25th: "Dear Sirs,—I have known Mr. Pack<lb/>wood for some years, I feel sure you will find him all right. I may add that he is a tenant of mine for some of my farms in Scotland"—I there upon executed the order, and delivered the clothes to Packwood—I made the usual application for payment three months after, and again three months after that, but to neither application did I receive a reply—on March 11th. 1904, he came into my shop and said, "I owe you some money", and gave me a cheque for £8 drawn by a man named Arnold on Lloyd's Bank—it says "Pay self or bearer", and is endorsed "F. Arnold" (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—he asked me to take £4 out and to give him the balance in cash—I offered to give him a crossed cheque of my own, but he said that he was very much in need of cash, and that Arnold was a responsible man whom he knew well—I gave him £4 in gold and a receipted bill for £4 on account of the bill owing on the clothes—I sent the cheque to my bank, and it was returned to me marked "Account closed. Refer to drawer" and I have never had the value of that cheque—I had a letter from Taunton with reference to his own account with me, and also saying that he knew nothing about Packwood, but that he wished he did, that he had not seen him for some time and did not know his address—Taunton came to see me later, and asked me whether there was no way other than to take proceedings against himself and Packwood—I told him I had done everything I could, writing and informing them both of it, and that I had had no reply, so consequently I had given the matter into the hands of the police—he seemed very excited—he did not mention on that occasion what relation Packwood was to him or that he had any obligations to Packwood—he knew then that Packwood had been arrested.</p>

A. Prior Taunton" on the Middlesex Banking Company in favour of "P. Carter", and is endorsed by "P.

A. Prior Taunton" in favour of "H. C. Packwood", re<lb/>remarking that Taunton was his-landlord and owed him some money—I gave him £3 in cash and paid the cheque in to the bank next day—on the same day he asked me to cash another cheque for £10 drawn by a man named Hammond in favour of Taunton, which has since been destroyed—I gave him three sovereigns and a receipt—he said on that occasion that Hammond was worth thousands of pounds—both the cheques were returned to me, the £3 cheque being marked "Refer to drawer", and the £10 cheque "Payment stopped"—I showed Packwood the £3 cheque and he took it back again, and on showing him the £10 cheque he said he could not understand it, and took it from me, and I never saw it again—he gave me a written statement promising to pay me the amount on the cheques dishonoured that I had given him and the amount of my bill (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—he went out of the house and never came back again—I have never had my money back nor the amount of my bill—I have tried to find him and failed to do so—I also tried to find Taunton, but the manager at his bank could not give me his address.</p>

               <p>some money on account of what he owed me, but he said it was incon<lb/>venient to give me any just then—I asked Packwood, who was with him, also to give me some money, as he also owed me some, and he said it was inconvenient—it was then sugeested that I should draw a cheque for £10, and that Packwood should get a friend of his to cash it, but not to present it till the following week—I drew the cheque, but I do not remember whether I drew it in favour of Packwood or Taunton—I had just about that amount of money in the bank, but I did not want it presented till the following week, as I was then paying in £40 or £50—Packwood took the cheque and went off to his friend to cash it—I saw him a little later, and again in the afternoon, when he told me he could not get it cashed—I then told Taunton, when Packwood was away, that I should go to my bank and stop the cheque in case it was presented before the following week, which I did—about two days after Packwood came to see me, and told me that unfortunately my cheque had been put through—I asked him where it was, and he gave it to me and I tore it up—I take it that it was presented the day after I had given it to Packwood; it was considerably after I had told Taunton I should stop the cheque that it was paid in—before he returned me the cheque Packwood gave me £2 out of his own pocket, as he said, in payment of part of what he owed me.</p>

I do not know Miss Balcarras at all—she had come to the bank, I could have given her Taunton's address—he has had an account with us since April 18th, 1902, and he has paid considerable sums in during that time—he had an overdraft at one time according to an arrangement that was made—about the time this cheque</p>

               <p>was sent to us there had been some litigation, and Taunton, under a judg<lb/>ment, had to pay over £40, having stood surety for a man of the name of Payne—the last payment we received on account of this amount was in December, 1902—we did not debit his account with this amount; it only affected the discount account which he had with us—the account is still open, and shows a credit balance of £11 2s. 6d.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> On May 19th Taunton's cheques would not have been honoured unless by special arrangement, as he had a debit of £14 3s. 4d.—on September 18th, 1903, he had a credit of £9 7s. 8d., but his cheque for £3 in favour of Packwood was not honoured on account of the debit balance of his discount account—I should think about seven or eight of his cheques have been dishonoured during the last eighteen months—our books would not show how many cheques were dishonoured—the most his account was overdrawn was £14 3s. 4d.—it is not an absolute rule that when a customer's cheque is dishonoured we inform that customer of the fact; the man to whom he made it payable would do that, of course—I cannot tell whether it is usual for banks to give such notices.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Sergeant C.</hi>) On April 7th I arrested Packwood for obtainmg £4 by false pretence by means of a worthless cheque from Mr. Grunfeld—in reply he said, "Yes, I am sorry I have done it; I must have been a fool, as Taunton told me there was no money at the bank to meet it. and he (meaning Taunton) said"', If you get the £8, I want £5 or £6 out of it. I did not get it cashed where* I expected to, so I went to Mr. Walker where I obtained the £4; I expected the money the following day, and if I had got it, I should have returned the £4 to Mr. Walker"—on April 9th I went to 112, Leadenhall Street, and arrested Taunton at his office there—I read the warrant to him, and on reading the first charge, charging him with conspiracy to defraud the tailor of £4, he said, "That is not so"—with reference to the other charges, he said, "I admit I gave Packwood the two cheques for £2 and £3; those are the cheques of Miss Balcarras and Mr. Adams, in Whitechapel Road, and he got them cashed to carry me over till the following Monday. He brought me back the money, but I have since repaid him. No one has ever applied to me for payment"—I searched him and found in his possession 4s. 4d.—I searched the offices and found there forty-seven pawn tickets in his safe, twenty-seven being in the name of Packwood—I then told him he would be further charged with conspiring in obtaining money from Adams, of Whitechapel Road, and Miss Balcarras, to which he made no reply—after the first hearing, in he rear of the Court, he said, "Sergeant West, I wish to make a statement to you. With regard to the cheque for £2, I have had 25s. out of it, and Packwood 15s. As to Arnold; he owed me £30. On the 11th of March last I asked him to pay me off some of the money he owed me. He said, I have not got it now,' and I said, 'Give me a cheque, and I will hold it over till you have.' He said,' Hold it over till Wednesday; I shall then have plenty of money to <hi rend="italic">meet</hi> it.' He then gave me an £8 cheque, which I handed to Packwood"—on the strength of that statement another warrant was granted for the arrest of another man—I have made inquiries into the character of Packwood and Taunton—(Mr. Elliott <hi rend="italic">objected to this evi</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ELLIOTT</hi>. In consequence of the information which I obtained from Taunton I arrested Packwood—I believe that he came to Vine Street Police Court twice, in order to see us by our request—I know that Taunton used to rent offices in Palmerston Buildings, and that Packwood was his clerk there—I do not suggest that Packwood was, party to leasing the offices—I have been told that Taunton has relatives in high positions; that he was in partnership with his father in Birming<lb/>ham that he had an estate called Glendale in the Isle of Skye, and that Packwood was his tenant there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the employ of Woolf, Greenfield &amp; Co., manufacturing confectioners—I have known the prisoner for about two months as being a junior clerk in their employ—he left on April 16th—I worked in the same room as he did, where all the books, including the cheque books, of the firm were kept in a safe which was not locked during business hours, and to which the prisoner would have access—on April 18th Mr. Sabin, manager of the London and Provincial Bank, Roman Road Branch, came and showed me this cheque for £86 10s. (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—it purports to he signed by "W. Greenfield" and "J. Mark", who is a member of the firm, in favour of "Mr. Chas. Hinde", and it is endorsed "Chas. Hinde"; it had "Payment stopped" on it, and I think the figures I see at the back were upon it too—I know Mr. Greenfield's signature, and this signature is so like you could not tell the difference, but there is a slight difference in Mr. Mark's signature—Mr. Hind is the solicitor to the firm, and he spells his name without a final "e."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the prisoner.</hi> I arrived at the office at 10 a.m. on April 18th—the office opens at 8 a.m.—the first time I knew anything about the cheque was when the bank manager came—I did not receive any message from you that the cheque was going to be presented—Mr. Marks would receive the letter—I did not see you anywhere near the bank that day—from 9 a.m. to 10.30 or 11 a.m. you usually had sole charge of the office—your wife came on the 18th and asked for a reference for you, saying that you were ill—I gave her one, as I did not know anything against you then—she told me that you were going into another situation—your position in the office would allow you to know how the cheques were drawn—you used to draw cheques for the partners, but never for Mr. Hind, but you would have access to his returned cheques—there is no writing on this cheque similar to yours, and we usually draw the cheques to "Charles Hind, Esq."—the reason of your dismissal was that you wanted a full week's wages when you had stopped away a day—you <hi rend="italic">put in</hi> some overtime the week before, but you did not get paid for it—from the time you were dismissed at 2 o'clock till you left, you were in the office with myself and Mr. Green<lb/>field, jun.; you would not have had an opportunity of getting a cheque from the cheque book—I know Archer, and I know he trades under two names of "A. Brown" and "Kennyfred Co."—I do not know the state of the account at the bank when the cheque was presented—you would have access to the pass book, but you would to the cash book—Archer was very intimate with the partners—it was an understood thing that he should not be left in the office alone—the reason for our not producing the cash book is not to screen him; it has nothing to do with your case—he gave me 10s. 6d. to get a fountain pen with—I do not know why he did so I never gave him any information—the partners would, of course, have access to the cheque books besides you and myself—either you were or I was in the office all day, and when I was away ill you knew it was your duty to lock the door whenever you left the office with no one in charge, as you had seen me do it; I do not remember giving you specific instructions to do so—this is a true plan of the office (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—this door communicating between the offices is usually open—there are about thirty people employed,</p>

               <p>seven or eight of whom fire foreigners, and practically all of them Jews—none of them would have access to the safe, as there was somebody always in charge of the office—I have had no conversation with Archer as regards this case since you were arrested—Hyman is an employee working at the front just outside the door—I have complained about his coming in and out and doing as he liked—he has not complained to me that you ordered him out by my instructions—Archer has spoken to him once or twice, but he has not been particularly friendly with him—I am not aware that Archer gave him a sovereign as a wedding present.</p>

I am a member of the Corps of Commissionaires—in consequence of instructions I received on April 18th I went to the Great Eastern Hotel with a letter addressed to Mr. Hinde given me by the Sergeant-Major of Commissionaires—I saw the prisoner, and gave him the letter—he took me to the smoking room and handed me this cheque (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), and told me to go to the Roman Road Branch of the London and Provincial Bank and cash it, telling me in what way he wanted the cash—I had never seen him nor the cheque before—I went to the bank, and they refused to pay it, and I came back with the manager to the Great Eastern Hotel, where we failed to find the prisoner—I waited till 4 p.m. for him, but he did not <hi rend="italic">turn up</hi>—the next time I saw him was at Bow Street Police Station—I wrote down on a piece of paper at the time, in what way he wanted the cash; the cashier wrote these figures at the back of the cheque—the note that I wrote is at the Bishopsgate Police Station.</p>

I have been home all night"—I said, "I saw you near St. Luke's Church last night with Martin, and your movements will be inquired into"—I took him to the station, where he was detained, and with Detective Sergeant Lee I went in search of Martin, whom we found outside the West Norwood Hotel drunk—he was taken into custody by Sergeant Lee—they were both charged with the offence, and both burst out laughing—I searched Virgo—he produced a penny and said, "That is all the———money I have"—I found in his vest pocket one penny, two halfpennies, and four farthings.</p>

What is there against me? Who saw me do it?"—Martin said, "I was at Camberwell all night; I lodge in a lodging house at Camberwell Road; I was never near St. Luke's Church"—I said, "You were both seen near St. Luke's Church by Sergeant Wiggins last night.

                  </hi>. I am an examiner in the Bankruptcy Department of the Official Receiver—I acted in the prisoner's bankruptcy—I do not think I saw him before the statement of affairs was prepared and filed—in the first statement of affairs there is no reference to Mrs. Mitchell's case—I heard something in reference to her; I noticed the omission, and had a conversation with the prisoner in reference to Mrs. Mitchell's case on October 26th—I took down a short statement to the formal question as to whether he held any property in trust; he answered, "No"—he said afterwards that he had not complied with the terms of the Order of July 16th, 1900, but had advanced about £300 to Mrs. Mitchell, and the balance had been lost in his business—on January 21st, 1904, I had a longer conversation with him about Mrs. Mitchell's matter, and he made this statement, which I took down: (<hi rend="italic">Partly read</hi>)"In addition I owe the Mitchell Trust £500, contracted in the following circumstances, and excluded from my first statement of affairs because I thought it was a debt from which I could never obtain a discharge except by payment in full. In May,.1900, I was introduced to Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell, then of Camden Town, by Mr. Marman, a solicitor's clerk, of Brompton, formerly a bailiff in the Westminster County Court. I did not promise Marman any share of my costs. He said so, but it is untrue. Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell had, they told me, been advised by Messrs. Wontners, to whom they were unable to pay more money on account of costs in a Chancery action brought by them 'to recover funds held by W. M. Baker, of Gray's Inn, and C. E. Moore, of Gerrard's Cross, as trustees of a post-nuptial settlement, dated June, 1891. Baker was in gaol, and Moore was a bankrupt. Wontner's had practically arranged a compromise by which new trustees were to be appointed, who were to prove against Moore's estate (Davis trustee) for £650, and Mrs. Mitchell was to get £50 for overdue interest. I, after a great deal of trouble, carried out this compromise, which in July, 1900, was sanctioned by the Court, except that instead of new trustees being appointed (at the Master's suggestion), I was to prove the debt, and the moneys were to be paid to me. I to pay them into the Court within ten days. I to receive £'90 for costs. On September 5th, 1900, I got two cheques from the trustee for £325 and £162 10s., which I paid into my banking account in the Birkbeck Bank. I did not pay the money into</p>

               <p>Court. Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell requested me not to do so, and urged me to use the money in my business and for my clients, and pay them interest at per cent, instead of £2 per cent, as invested in Consols, and because Consols were then high, and would, they were sure, decrease in value. There is nothing in writing to support this statement. From time to time they applied to me for capital, which I let them have in the following amounts: May 16th. 1901, £25; June 9th. 1901. £2; July 11th, 1901, £1; August 1st. 1901, £2; October 18th, 1901, £10; November 8th, 1901, £5; December Kith, 1901, £5; February 10th, 1902. £9: March 7th, 1902, 10s.; March 10th. 1902, £1; March 11th. 1902, £1; March 15th, 1902, £2 10s. total £(54. By the end of January, 1902, my account was overdrawn, and I am unable to point to any specific investment of any part of the moneys. Signed, Frederick William Webb, January 21st, 1904"—the bankruptcy estate has received part of that £(550—in the course of the bankruptcy the prisoner's letter book passed into my possession—I find the original of Exhibit 2 in letter book 5 (<hi rend="italic">Deed of Settlement</hi>)—it is signed by him—I am acquainted with his writing—each of the cheques representing the dividends and other payments out of Moore's estate are endorsed by the prisoner, as well as the receipts—the writing on the receipt for £33 is not in his writing; he told me it is his clerk's—I have found no list of payments made to Mrs. Mitchell among the prisoner's papers, except Exhibit 24—I have made a list of cheques drawn to her from the prisoner's pass book—I find that, according to the pass book, giving credit for her having received the £33 mentioned in this receipt, that £74 14s. 6d. has been paid to her—I have no evidence of any money paid by him to her not by cheque—I can find no record of any such payments to her or to any Furnishing Company, or on account—there is no cash book at all—there were some diaries partly kept, but beyond that, practically nothing—he kept no. books of account—I cannot ascertain what the total amount paid to Mrs. Mitchell is other than the £71 14s. 6d.—as a rule, the counterfoils have on. them "Mrs. E.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was an earlier statement of account for £41—I think it was dated March, 1902, which with the £74 makes £116—when the prisoner first filed his statement of affairs it did not include the £650—he did not say that he had not included it because it would not be a question of dividends from the bankruptcy; he said it was a debt from which he could never obtain his discharge—it was included in the amended. statement on the Official Receiver's requirements, not on my advice—some £4,000 of the £4,800 deficiency is a family matter; it did not appear as a claim by the debtors in the original statement of affairs—I got a state<lb/>ment from the prisoner that this indebtedness had arisen years before to his brother, Colonel Webb, and other friends, and that they would no claim it—they have not done so—I should not say that, apart from that family debt, the prisoner owed practically nothing—the £269 assets did not exceed the liabilities apart from the family debt and the £650—there is a considerable amount due to the bank; it has been claimed—there has been no dividend paid yet—I know that the claim is disputed—apart from</p>

"I am only an agent myself, I do not know all the details of the business", and she added that in cases like mine, in which there was some doubt, they were allowed, to write on the back of the receipt that should there be any mistake the money would be returned—I then gave her an open cheque for four guineas—this is it—I wrote the same night to stop it from being paid. but was too late—she told me to draw it to "E.

I think, but I am not certain—I said, "What do we get for the two guineas?"—she said, "You can have as many labels as you like, and we shall pay the rewards twice in one year if keys are lost"—I paid her two guineas in cash—she gave me this receipt, signed "James"—I drew attention to the fact that the National Safe Deposit Company's name was not mentioned on the receipt, and she said the Key Registry was the new name under which the National Safe Deposit Company's registration business was carried on—I did receive labels enclosed in a letter signed "E. M.

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of W. I. Richardson Son, printers, of 4, Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields—I know the prisoners—I first made the acquaintance of Jackson in March, 1903—he gave me the name of Albert Jackson, of Greyhound Lane, Streatham—I first met Parker two or three months after that. when he came to my office with Jackson, who said he was a turf accountant—we did some printing for Jackson in the month before the Derby of 1903, which was run on May 27th—it was on April 30th that he first broached the business to me—he was with Parker then; that was the first time that I saw Parker—he did not say what he was, or say what his address was—Jackson gave the order; Parker said he would come and see the proofs when they were ready—this book (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is one of the articles we printed—Jackson supplied me with the copy—on the outside of the book is printed, "Twenty-one tickets for the Derby Sweep<lb/>stake of A. Jackson Son, Flushing. Holland. 300 prizes. Tickets 2s. Every horse a prize. See bankers' references enclosed. See Press notices enclosed"—contained in the book are twenty-one 2s. tickets printed in counterfoil—the couuterfoil has a space for the name and address of the purchaser of each ticket—they are printed numerically, but we did not do that; it was sent to a numerical printer—each ticket says, "This ticket is issued according to the terms of our circular, printed in green, enclosed. Anyone subscribing is welcome to attend the drawing. The result will be in the hands of all London subscribers on Tuesday evening, and every" country patron will receive it by first post on the morning of Derby Day "—Parker called in reference to that proof; I think both the prisoners called—I showed them the proof, and they corrected and passed it for press—one alteration was made by Parker; he put in the words, "Series B"—we printed enough paper to make 90,000 of those books—the numerical printer bound them—we do not print numerically—we did not print the 49, Hanway Street" on the flap of this envelope; it is done with a rubber stamp—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the green circular which is referred to on the back of the tickets—we printed it from copy supplied by Jackson</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190405160062"/>
               <p>with Parker—we printed the same number of these—I know the prisoner's writing; the ropy for this circular was in Parker's writing—I have not got the manuscript; when the circular was shown to Parker he had the manuscripts returned to him—on page three I see, "Therefore, to ensure our early receipt and acknowledgment, post as soon as possible, but not later than 6 p.m. Saturday, May 23rd, as the draw will take place on Monday, May 25th, at Flushing, Holland, and will be under the supervision of a committee formed, as usual, of the representatives of the principal Sporting papers, bankers, and well known men of business. Any ticket holder is at liberty to attend the drawing, and we shall make any and every patron welcome"—the proof was checked by Parker—this document, headed "Press Opinions," was printed from copy brought by the prisoners; part of it was printed—I believe on the copy there was "Advt." at the end of each paragraph, but it had been struck out when we received it—I do not know who struck it out—the portion in the large type, headed "Press Opinions," was in manuscript, and I believe in Parker's writing. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)—"When the average Englishman is in doubt or difficulty on any point, his usual procedure is to fly to his daily paper, and although perhaps unconsciously, his ultimate decision is usually moulded by the opinions of some popular journalist. Similarly, in business matters, there are skilled men on the staff of all leading papers, whose duty it is to inquire into and report upon the <hi rend="italic">bona fides</hi> of its advertisers, and when the business is of a speculative nature, it is a matter of common knowledge that no paper of repute inserts any kind of advertisement or notice without proof of the genuineness of the concern in question. Therefore, when reports of a distinctly favour<lb/>able nature are made, the reader is justified in placing that confidence in his paper to which we have already alluded, for he knows that in no age was the integrity of journalism so firmly established as in the present, and his experience teaches him that he can absolutely rely on the evidence of those who are among the most substantial and straightforward of his fellow-citizens. Messrs. A. Jackson Son. in the course of their long established business relations with the British public, have received an immense amount of favourable Press criticism, brought about by the inquiries of the readers of various newspapers. Naturally, in so small a space, there is no room for a tithe of the whole, but a few of the most recent, taken haphazard, will show the general tenor, and give some idea both of the magnitude of the business, and the manner in which it is con<lb/>ducted. from the <hi rend="italic">Newmarket Advertiser</hi>, May 1st. 1903: Messrs. A. Jackson Son are the only Bookmakers who execute commissions of a nature that usually requires attendance on the course on the part of the investor. This old-established firm is enabled to do this by the very extensive business which is entrusted to them, and every sporting man knows that these well-known club men are safe. From the <hi rend="italic">Walton News</hi>, May 2nd, 1903 One good effect of anti-betting legislation is that it must in time stamp out the hole-and-corner bookmaker (who is <hi rend="italic">non est.</hi> after a popular favourite has come home, and leaves his clients to whistle for his money, and compel backers to adopt the only sensible course of sending</p>

               <p>their investments to the reliable men on the Continent, of whom Messrs. A. Jackson Son are well in the front rank. From the <hi rend="italic">Middlesex Gazette</hi>, May 2nd, 1903: a firm in a gigantic way of business, while their stability stands an unquestionable, fact. From the <hi rend="italic">West Herts Post</hi>, May 1st, 1903: The reputation of Messrs. A. Jackson Son is second to none for fair treatment and prompt settlement. From the <hi rend="italic">Putney Observer</hi>, May 5th, 1903: Why do not sportsmen learn common sense and do their business with firms of proved reputation, such, for example, as Messrs. A Jackson Son. The fact that the principals of this well-known firm are leading club men is, of course, a guarantee to every customer. From the <hi rend="italic">Boston Independent</hi>, May 2nd, 1902:. This, however, can be obviated by doing one's business with reliable agents, such as Messrs. A. Jackson Son, who do a lot of system business, and not only deal with every branch of it, but, what is pre-eminent, pay up promptly in all. From the <hi rend="italic">Harrow Observer</hi>, May 1st, 1 903: Fifty pounds a day. This sounds a large order, and out of racing speculation, too. It is, nevertheless, what a certain nobleman is winning daily on the favourites from the well-known firm of Turf Accountants, Messrs. A. Jackson Son. But how can they pay it one may ask, until one reflects how small such a sum must necessarily be in the huge turn-over of a big business where the very heavy nature of the commissions and the many different methods of operation fancied by customers serve to protect the bookmaker from loss. The probity of Messrs. A. Jackson Son is assured, not only by their long standing and continued prompt payments but by the fact that the principals of the firm are all responsible men and well-known members of the best clubs"—we also printed 90,000 of these documents—it is a price list of A. Jackson Son; on it I see, "The postal service between England and Flushing is excellent, there being three mails each way daily, and letters posted in any part of Great Britain in time for the London night mail are delivered in Flushing by the first post next morning"—the original of that was printed in Holland, and we had the alterations sent over to us—we also printed 90,000 of this type-written letter, with a manuscript signature "A. Jackson Son"—we printed them from type-writer type—it refers to Parr's Bank, Streatham Branch; the London and South Western Bank, Belgravia Branch; and the City and Midland Branch, Charing Cross Branch. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that A. Jackson &amp; Son had held an annual sweepstake on the Derby for the past eighteen years, with prize money for division of over</hi> £5,000, <hi rend="italic">and that, there was an oppor<lb/>tunity of winning a really big prize with a trifling stake, and that the latest date to post was May</hi> 23rd!)—we also printed the heading of this stationery for Jackson—we also printed this paper, on Parker's instructions—it purports to be a Result Sheet of A. Jackson Son's 1903 Eighteenth Derby Sweep<lb/>stakes—it purports to contain a list of the horses drawn—I do not know if there are 300 horses—under the name of each horse there is a ticket number, in many instances with a letter prefixed—on page 3 there is The total amount subscribed for the sweepstakes is £8,296 2s., and the amount of prize money (after deducting our commission of £82912s.) for distributing is £7,466 10s., apportioned as follows:—To the drawer of</p>

To the drawer of the horse in the foregoing list which is Third in the Derby, £447 16s. There is £653")."I 9s. for division among non-starters. There is £.653 9s. for division among the runners other than the first three. The exact amounts due to each Ticket for runners other than the first three and non-runners cannot, of course, be assessed till the runners are known. There is £l,650 for division among the first and every 250th number drawn from the wheel, the holders of the following tickets each receiving a £5 note"—the copy for that document was brought on Monday, May 25th, by Parker—I saw him between 9 and 10 a.m.—he was alone—he said he had brought the result sheet, and wished it set up—it was partly in manuscript and partly in typewriting—the manuscript was in Parker's writing—I believe he did not bring the whole of the copy for that document at the same time—I think he first brought the first two pages—the compositors set it up soon after that; the rest was brought between twelve and one—I did not receive it myself—we printed 17,000—Parker checked the proof—for the whole of the printing we were paid £551—we were paid by cheque, signed by Jackson—there were cheques on account and it was finally settled—we procured the numerical printing on some of these tickets—there were 14,000 books, I think—the £551 included the numerical printing which we had done—we despatched them, the envelopes were already addressed, and the stamps were sent us by Jackson.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I knew Jackson two or three months before he introduced Parker to me—during that time we had done work for Jackson—I said at the police court that I did not know how Parker was paid, and that we had later on done printing for Harold Parker, trading as the Imperial Typewriting Company, 207, High Holborn—the whole of the—the. £551 was paid us by Jackson, whom we treated as the principal all through—I did work for Parker during 1903—I do not know when the account was stopped—I printed headings and so on for him, in connection with the Imperial Typewriting Company, in the name of Kingfield—I do not know if Parker also carries on business as a turf tipster—as Kingfield we did work for him for about £90—he paid it—the items making that up were quite distinct from the items making up the £551—it was subsequent work—my foreman told me he saw Parker at our premises on Monday, May 25th, 19O.'5, at 8 a.m.—I did not get there until nine—I do not remember having any conversation with Parker about there being any risk in doing the printing, or its being illegal in connection with a lottery—I do not remember saying anything about some German lottery in which a printer, a neighbour of mine, had got into trouble—I did not know when at the police court that by doing this printing I was rendering myself to be treated as a rogue and a vagabond—Mr. Muir told me so at the police court—I think Parker said he had not been paid very much by Jackson, and that he had a difficulty in getting his money—except the work which I did in connection with Jackson, I know of no other work that Parker did for Jackson—I remember doing a picture block for Jackson representing a jack underneath a sun, to make the name Jackson—I do not know if he said that was to make up his old</p>

I live at 23, Constantine Road, Hampstead, and am manageress to Messrs.

Richardson paid £28 10s. of that and £95 2s. 3d. by Jackson in several sums—we printed some tickets with a plain number and some prefixed by a letter—we printed a few short of a million with a plain number—we did not print more than 150,000 with a serial letter prefixed—the lowest number we began at with a letter prefixed was 5001—I do not quite know how many serial letters were</p>

                  </hi>. At the beginning of 1903 I was clerk to Brown, could Co., advertising agents—towards the end of March, 1903, I called at 181, Victoria Street, in consequence of these two letters which we received from A. Jackson Son: (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>) "February 21st, 1903. Dear Sirs,—Will you kindly favour us with your terms for a small advertisement in your 250 papers. We understand that by taking a series of advertise<lb/>ments it is possible to get notices inserted in some of the papers"—the other one is, "February 21st, 1903. We shall be pleased if your Mr. Stone will give us a call to-morrow morning about 11 o'clock with reference to the series of notices and advertisements we are now prepared to insert through your firm"—I went instead of Mr. Stone—I saw Jackson—he wanted to insert paragraphs in certain papers—he showed me proofs of a large number of paragraphs—I did not then make any final arrange<lb/>ments—I did not take the paragraphs away; I went and consulted my principal—on March 6th or 7th we got this letter from A. Jackson Son (<hi rend="italic">Enclosing an advertisement which they desired to have inserted.</hi>)—the advertisement is, "You can make racing pay, without the necessity of going to the course. Send for an up-to-date Book on Racing Systems, post free from A. Jackson Son, Flushing, Holland. A practical solution of Turf Investment as a Business, and every Sportsman will be profited</p>

               <p>by a perusal of its pages. Write now to A. Jackson Son, Flushing, Holland'—we inserted that paragraph in a number of country papers—I believe the proofs were sent us by post—we made some alterations, and added "Advt." at the end—that was not there when we got them—it is in my writing, and I wrote to A. Jackson <hi rend="italic">Co.</hi> about it—we got this letter, dated April 9th, 1903, from them (<hi rend="italic">Stating that they had no objection to the wording of the paragraph being revised to the extent that Messrs. Brown, Gould, Co. considered necessary, and they did not object to</hi> "Advt." appear<lb/>ing at the end of each paragraph if that was the rule, and were quite prepared to hand them a cheque in advance.)—we first returned the revised copy and then the proofs to Jackson—we refuse to insert advertisements without "Advt." after them—I believe the advertisement was published in about 110 provincial papers—Parker called at our office about ten days or a fortnight after the advertisement had appeared to take away the copies of the newspapers to check—that was the first time I saw him—I saw him, I think, altogether three times—I went to his office to take him a few papers—these (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) are copies of the advertisements we put into the papers, excepting that the letters "Advt." do not appear here—we did not insert them in the <hi rend="italic">Bristol Gazette</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Licensed Vic<lb/>tuallers" Gazette</hi>, or the <hi rend="italic">North Bedfordshire Gazette.</hi>

I knew Jackson had composed the notices, and they struck me as rather an insertion in the paper than an ordinary advertisement"—we were paid over £30 in one sum—every penny of that was paid by Jackson—I never got 1s. from Parker—although the letters "Advt." were after each notice, we had to pay on a higher scale because they were inserted amongst matter—we did not try to have any of them inserted with "Advt."—putting them amongst matter is to give them prominence, it is not to make people think that they are not advertisements—Parker did not give us any instructions with regard to the insertions.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an advertising agent, of Effingham House, Arundel Street, Strand—I first knew Jackson in March, 1902—I put turf advertisements or. his behalf in certain papers—he was then doing business as a bookmaker in the name, of Davis Jackson, from an address in the Channel Islands; I see this notice in the <hi rend="italic">Licensed Victuallers' Gazette</hi> of July 25th, 1902—we were the agents who procured its insertion as an editorial note: (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>) "A Successful Turf Accountancy Business. Members of the Anti-Gambling League, if they happened to take a glance inside the offices of Messrs. A. Jackson Son, of Flushing, Holland, would probably throw up their hands in pious horror at the business-like way in which the laying of odds is carried out. The efforts to stop betting have only succeeded in increasing the revenue of foreign countries. Like a good number of the London Turf Accountants' offices, whose places of business resemble banks more than anything else, Messrs. Jackson's offices are a model of respectability. There is a large clerical staff, and lady typists are busy throughout the day, the ticking of their machines</p>

               <p>going ceaselessly. All sorts of Turf business are undertaken, subject, of course, to the usual time limits, etc.; full particulars of which can be seen in the book of rules, ready reckoner, and other information, which will be sent free of charge to anyone making application. Double and treble events are executed at the best prices ruling in the market. There is no limit for S.P. transactions, and Messrs. Jackson make no charges or deductions of any kind, winnings being paid in full. Those of small mean are catered for equally with the large punter, and deposit accounts, from 10s. upward, are opened with anyone on receipt of P.O. Tele<lb/>graphic instructions for S.P. betting can be received at the London office. A price-list is issued daily giving the latest movements on important races and the prices current. A speciality is made of system working a form of investment which has greatly increased in popularity of late. First, second, and third favourites, jockeys' mounts, newspaper selections or, indeed, any feasible system will be worked by this enterprising firm. Any of our readers wishing to do business on the above lines will find Messrs. Jackson's terms to be most advantageous. The business arrangements are under the supervision of the principals of the firm, and a feature of the undertaking is the promptness with which cheques for winnings are sent off each settling day"—I did not personally come into communication with Jackson with regard to that notice before it was circulated—it is the practice to insert laudatory notices as editorial notes for firms of good repute—Jackson was of good repute at the time—I should say it is more or less a common practice for the <hi rend="italic">Licensed Vic<lb/>tuallers' Gazette</hi> to insert such notices; they are fairly highly paid for—they are more highly paid for than ordinary notices—that is because the public think the notice is by the paper proprietors and not from the advertisers themselves—I do not think it is a fraud, it is done by the daily papers—we get our commission, but we do not care for this kind of business—we closed the account when we heard of this—company meetings and so forth are all on a higher scale—I do not say that the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> would insert a notice like this, but all the other papers do—the <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi> put in an editorial notice even after this, but not through our agency—the state<lb/>ments are Jackson's; he would supply the <hi rend="italic">data</hi> in typewriting; we should post it on to the paper* for the editor to approve—we had done Jackson's advertising for about twelve months—we had some complaints about this; we got £20 for inserting the notice, and paid the <hi rend="italic">Licensed Victuallers' Gazette</hi> £10—I suppose Jackson would have been able to get it in without our assistance—we asked him what he was prepared to pay; he said £20—we told the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> what we had, and that we would give them half—if we had not taken the order he would have gone to the paper itself and had it inserted—the difference between an advertise<lb/>ment and an editorial puff is that the advertisement passes the advertising manager and the other passes the editor, and it is more expensive.</p>

               <p>came in by the morning post about 8.a.m.—I continued at Flushing until next day, Tuesday—I think I was at the office there most of Monday, and on Tuesday I went there just before catching the train for the Hague—there was no draw for the Derby Sweep—was in the office—the letter contained postal orders and tickets, and some of them referred to our ordinary business—the tickets remained in Flushing until Jackson sent for them two or three weeks afterwards, when they were sent to him in England—nothing was done with them with regard to any draw—their numbers were not entered in a book, and no record kept of their numbers—some telegrams were <hi rend="italic">sent</hi> to Parker—my recollection is rather hazy, but I think I wrote one or two under Jackson's instructions; they were pro<lb/>bably sent on the Sunday morning—I next saw Parker in London at the end of August or early in September, when I called upon him at his office at 267, High Holborn—he seemed to think that, having regard to the hard work which had been thrown upon him. that Jackson had not treated him at all well, and that he could do better working for himself than working for Jackson—I took it that he thought Jackson might have paid him a little more—he did not say how much he had been paid—in addition to the circulars for the Derby Sweep. I saw a book with regard to systems—I do not know that Parker ever told me who wrote it—this is one of them; we had thousands of them—I first saw one in Jackson's possession about the time of the Derby Sweepstake—I think Parker said it was an improvement on an old one which we had before, and that he had brought it up to date—I understood that he was the author of the new one—this document relating to the Cambridgeshire Sweepstakes is another thing which Jackson brought out—it is much the same as the Derby Sweep—Jackson on one occasion showed me a typewritten draft of this, and asked me what I thought of it—we were in a cab in Holborn—I cannot remember where we had come from, I think from Chancery Lane—the last time I saw Parker at his office was about the end of Sep<lb/>tember or early in October—the Cambridgeshire Sweepstake document was brought out about October.</p>

Jackson and Parker were absolute strangers—I went with Jackson to 168, Piccadilly, to get some sporting addresses which he was going to purchase and there saw Parker—after that Jackson employed Parker to write press notices for him and paid him for them—I did not know then that Parker was there carrying on a typewriting business and a tipster as John Kingfield; I knew he had a typewriting office at High Holborn—he was a tipster and sporting journalist—J heard that he was employed by Jackson to correct the proofs and circulars, and that Parker charged 5s. a visit to the printers for looking over the proofs—I know he had to work very hard—he had to be at the</p>

               <p>printer's sometimes at 6a.m. and work very late at his office—I never saw any account between him and Jackson, but Jackson told me that Parker had rendered an account of about £(60—I do not know that £40 of that was out of pocket—Parker complained to me that the work he had to do turned out much harder than he had bargained for—shortly before the Derby, Jackson told me that he had arranged with Parker to get out the result sheets at Parker's office by means of his typewriters—at High Holborn he had a typewriting business called the Imperia Typewriting Company—I may have sent telegrams from Flushing to Parker; during the whole of the time I was there Jackson was never out of my presence—we were working together in his room—I do not know how much he made out of all this—I believe he told me that he had had a telegram from Parker saying that he could not get the result sheets out at his office, and would have to place the work with Richardson—we employed one woman typewriter at 181, Victoria Street, and occasionally two, when we were very busy—as far as I know, Parker had nothing to do with that office—Jackson had offices at Nos. 181 and 116, but I had nothing to do with lift, nor had Parker—Jackson had nothing to do with Parker's office in Holborn—there was no connection between the two businesses, except that Parker was paid to do this work—I have the best of reasons for supposing that Parker did not get 1/4 d. of the money which was sent by the subscribers for the Derby Sweepstake.</p>

He told me he had had a Derby Sweepstakes for many years, and that this year, 1903, he intended to make a big thing of it, saying that the commission and the general business would produce him a big profit. I wrote the circulars for him, and corrected his various proofs at Richardson's, and I prepared the result sheet from numbers and details I received from him by post and telegram, and through Miss Ford and Mrs. Jackson.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Inspector.</hi>) On March 8th I received a warrant for Jackson's arrest—I arrested him on March 15th at Manchester, where he was carrying on a business—I brought him to Bow Street—I have counted the number of horses and numbers and figures in the result sheet—there are.'3,800 words which would have to be paid for if it was telegraphed—I also counted the numbers purporting to be every 250th drawer; there were.336 of them—the statements show that there would be at least 84,000 competitors—allowing four seconds for each coupon, I have calcu<lb/>lated that it would take three days twenty-one hours' continuous working to draw the 84.000 coupons, which is at the rate of fifteen a minute, without any refreshment or sleep—it would not matter how many persons worked, as only one person could draw from the wheel at a time, if there was one—I find that the horses in the result sheet are in the exact order of the Raring Calender of 1904, and they are arranged in the Calender, except that His Majesty's horses are first, alphabetically under the owner's names—in four instances I find that the same number is drawn against certain horses.</p>

               <p>and payments made on account of the business and salary to December, 1902, of which I.O.U.'s are held for £750—Shelford has" not produced any document in support of that claim, nor any entry in any book, nor any receipt; nor has Bell—proofs were admitted to the amount of £4,478 and further proofs have come in for about £300, making about £4,800—the assets realised were £1,708, which includes goods seized under search warrants—giving credit for all that, the deficiency is nearly £3,000, ex<lb/>clusive of Bell's proof, which I disallowed—the name Meek appears as a holder of bills drawn by the bankrupt, some of them accepted by Culling<lb/>ford—these have been admitted to be accommodation bills—Meeks roof amounts to £3,304 12s. 10d. in respect of bills—some are good trade bills—Meek's net proofs, after deducting bills, amount to £1,426 9s. 8d.—Bell was privately examined on March 2nd and 26th—between those dates I applied to the Registrar in Bankruptcy and obtained search warrants and took them to the tipstaff's private residence—on March 4th I went to Bell's house in Colebrook Road—I saw Miss Bell—there were Some pianos, baize, and other materials there—on march 23rd, after the Warrants had been issued, I had an interview with Shelford—he volunteered the statement that Bell was entitled to remove goods, as he owed Bell money—he mentioned that Bell had a judgment, and that he would like to remove the goods—in view of Bell's private examination and these statements, I wrote one or two letters to Bell for the purpose of making inquiries—on April 15th I wrote,'"I shall be glad if you will make an appointment for Monday next, the 20th inst., at my office to produce the receipts for the payments you said you have made to the Sheriff"—I never received them—I wrote again on April 21st, "With reference to my letter to you of the 15th inst., I shall be glad to hear from you thereon"—I received a telephonic reply that Bell was in the North, and would make an appointment when he came back—he made no appointment—when I was appointed trustee I went into possession of the factory at 9, Wedmore Street on February 3rd—I saw the stock—I instructed Messrs. Holmes Co., auctioneers, to realise it—it realised £492 12s. 6d.—I estimate the cost price of that stock at about £800—I also instructed Messrs. Holmes Co. to realise the stock which was afterwards brought to the factory when the search warrant had been executed—that realised £247 1s. 6d.—included in the stock realised from New North Road were three pianos, an organ, and some odd things valued at £45, so that the stock actually realised £202 1s. 6d.—that stock was not in the list of stock shown on January 8th—seventy-two Fletcher's piano actions were in the list—there were nineteen at Wedmore Street when we took possession, and eighteen in New North Road—some were in pianos being completed, leaving twenty-five—thirty-four piano backs—were in the balance sheet—we found fifteen at Wedmore Street and nine at New North Road, seven being in pianos—of the 250 music wires in the balance sheet we found 119 at Wedmore Street and eighty-seven at New North Road—the debtor's public examination was on July 28th—the transcript is signed by the debtor—some of the debtor's books were transferred to me—a good many of the entries are made by Bell—I</p>

On March 23rd, Shelford came and told me that he had given permission to Bell to take goods away, because Bell had paid money on his account, and had a judgment—I have no knowledge that Bell did so—he is not entered in the wages book for a considerable period as receiving any wages—I do not know his position—I believe ho was manager—I have had interviews with both Shelford and Bell—I do not know what took place between them prior to the meeting of creditors—a pony was not included as part of the stock—a horse and trap sold for £22 13s.—they may have cost double or three times that amount; they were bought some years ago—I have never heard anything against the way Shelford was carrying on his business until this matter—I never heard about his owing wages; I think he said Bell paid money on his account—I took it that Shelford came to me specially to make the statement that he had given Bell per<lb/>mission to take goods away.</p>

I do not think I have spoken to Bell about money owing to him—he put in a proof—I served him with the usual notice to prove how he made it up—his judgment for £750 14s. was obtained just prior to the meeting of creditors; it was simply a consent judgment, and as trustee I looked upon it as not evidence at all—he put in I.O.U.'s at his private examination—he did not tell me personally, but he said in his private examination that he had advanced money to Shelford—the figures in the pass books show cheques to Bell—he had wages up to a certain date—there are no entries crediting Bell in the books—Bell's was the master mind, in my opinion—I have no knowledge that he lost £1,500 over Shelford, or that he ever gave a penny to Shelford.</p>

               <p>pointed out by Mr. Souhami and other creditors to the tipstaff—the same day we went to 393, New North Road—I had been there before to make inquiries, and to come in contact with Bell—the premises are about five doors down New North Road on the right hand side out of the Essex Road—there is a shop front with lead glazed windows, and when the door is opened there is a kind of builder's shop with building material in it—the name "Smith" is up—there is nothing to indicate a piano business, and no name of "Wagner Pianoforte Company"—at the rear is a revolving shutter door, and another narrow door in the centre, which is opened by someone to enquire your business in reply to an electric button—I did not get in till I went with the tipstaff, Souhami and others—Bell was then standing inside—the tipstaff said, "I have come to search these premises"—Bell said, "You cannot come in; the premises belong to Mr. Hanff; he is not here; you will have to wait till he comes"—the tipstaff said, "My warrant is to search the premises of Wagner Co., Ltd."—Bell said, "Come on then," and gave us access to the premises—inside the revolving shutter the left hand side of the work shop was partitioned off with a new wooden partition, and on the right was an enclosed office—about a dozen men were at work in the shop; I took their names, and they all, in answer to my questions, said they had formerly worked for Shelford; they were John Doughty, Charles Strickland, William Prime, Frederick Pool, Frederick Agney, Charles Eldredge, H. Wood, H. Harrow, and Marshall—there was a very large quantity of material and pianos in different stages of con<lb/>struction—Mr. Fletcher pointed out some actions—I said, "Are those yours, Mr. Fletcher?"—he said, "Yes; I have never sold them to Bell, or to the Wagner Company; and materials were pointed out which had been sold to Shelford—subsequently Souhami said to Bell, "I want to go in here "; that was into the office—Bell said nothing—going in Souhami identified a very large quantity of veneer which had been sold to Shelford—as the goods were being removed Hanff came in, and said, "What's up now?"—Bell said, "I suppose they are going to clear the lot"—Hanff went out, not speaking to anyone—as the goods were taken away I made this list (Exhibit No. I)—it includes a large quantity of veneer and pianos partly made, also actions, planks, trusses, sections, and other materials for making pianos—the goods were removed in five vans—the same day we went back to Colebrook Row—the pianos and packing I had seen the previous day had gone—Mr. J. C. Meek, 14, Windmill Street, was a client of my firm—he died on February 3rd—he was a music smith, and manu<lb/>factured iron frames for pianos—he discounted bills for the piano trade only—I knew him for thirty years—on January 19th, 1903, ten days after the receiving order he gave me those three bills drawn and endorsed by Shelford Co." for £27, £27 and £25, with this covering letter of January 12th, asking me to discount them—I handed them over to the Official Receiver the same day—they have since been paid—Meek was a creditor in the bankruptcy for £1,400—I produce a number of unpaid bills to the value of £591 18s. 9d.—those include eight bills, receipted by Charles Cullingford,. for £273 5s. 9d.—some of these were dishonoured in December, 1903; for £43 2s. 6d., £49 5s. and £33 10s.—another bill of Meek's for</p>

I should liked to have settled the lot (but they arc all very, very good children); but think if Willy and Freddy get 10 years older they will look after their mother.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I questioned him as to his conduct—his recollection was not clear—his knew he had killed the children—now he knows he has done wrong—the only motive I could trace was from his statements, that when he was returning on his tramp between Chatham and London he felt exceedingly bad, with pains in his head and an idea to take his own life, and that it was better to take the lives of his children first, so as to make his wife's life an easier one—he had been in a depressed state for a considerable time, but latterly more than usual, and had drunk heavily, taking very; little food—when asked about the death of his children last year he said he felt it very much, and added. "I am not a chap to show much, but I feel it inwardly"—people charged with crime brighten up at times, but his depression was continuous—he said his cousin was insane, and his maternal grandmother also.</p>

Asnwer, No"—on December 30th, I surveyed the premises and estimated the value of the stock to be about £14 or £15; I reported to the office, and on February 9th the proposal was refused.</p>
