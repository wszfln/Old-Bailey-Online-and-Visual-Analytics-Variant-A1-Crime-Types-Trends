I am agent to the solicitor to the Treasury—I re<lb/>ceived information, and on 21st December, about 6.30, went with Inspectors Bryant, Brannan, Harnett, and others, to 6, Saville Row, Marylebone—the street door was open—we proceeded to the end of the passage, and descended four or five steps to a room on the right, the door of which was opened by Hands, and we went in and found the five prisoners sitting round a table—I told Waller I had instructions from the Solicitor to the Mint to look after him as a coiner, and that I had a search-warrant, signed by Mr. Knox, which he was entitled to have read—he said "All right"—I said to Norman "<hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi>, you are also suspected; what name do you give now?"—he said "Jeremiah Norman"—I saw Inspector Bryant find this basket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) by the washhand-stand—he handed me these ladles, and two single moulds, and one double mould for coining; also the packet containing twenty-five florins and three counterfeit crowns, unfinished—four <hi rend="italic">gets</hi> were found, and some metal which had been mixed in a ladle, a file with white metal in its teeth, a shilling attached to a piece of copper wire, which had been dropped in solution, a ladle, some plaster of Paris, and pewter, and a galvanic battery with this screw attached—this other screw was found in Welter's trowsers-pocket—here are all the usual and necessary implements used in coining—Inspector Brannan handed me some good half-crowns and three bad half-crowns, which Norman handed to him—Harnett gave me a port<lb/>monnaie containing a crown, which corresponded in date with the mould produced, and some other coins, and this duplicate of a silver coin pawned for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the name of Ann Weller, and which I afterwards got—we took all the prisoners to George Street Station—a young man came to the room—we searched him, but finding nothing sent him away—he is awaiting his trial for another offence.</p>

                  </hi>. This is an imitation crown, of Geo. III., and this is another of Geo. IV., 1821, which has been made from the crown pledged—here are three counterfeit crowns from that mould—this is a double mould for florins of 1858 and 1859; and these are 25 counterfeit florins, from which I have selected two which were cast on this mould, and I daresay there are more here—this is a double mould for half-crowns of Geo. III., 1818—these are two bad half-crowns of Geo. IV., of 1822; and here is the pattern of them—here is a battery and all the necessary apparatus for coining—the crown found at the pawnbroker's does not correspond with any of these moulds, but I should say that it has been in plaster of Paris.</p>

I am a brush hawker, of 13, Pitt Street, Old Kent Road—the prisoner is my son—he does not live with me, he lives with his mother—about two months ago I saw him receive four shillings from a gentleman in Peckham, for some shoe and clothes brushes, and among them there was a bad shilling—I cannot distinctly swear that this is it, but it is, to the best of my belief—it is one of the old-fashioned shillings—he put it in his waistcoat pocket, wrapped it up in a bit of paper, as I told him to keep it separate from all other money, in case he might give it away for a good one—I have been in his company since that, day after day, and to my knowledge, he has never been able to see the gentleman since—as far as I know, on the day he was taken in custody, the shilling remained in his pocket—he bears a good character, and is very kind to me and his mother—he has never been in trouble—he is my whole support, and I do hot know what I shall do.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sub-librarian of Lincoln's Inn, and as such, in conjunction with Mr. Spilsbury, the head librarian, I have the custody of the books—the members of Lincoln's Inn have access to the library; that is the rule of the Inn—others, who are not members of the Inn, but have chambers in the Inn, are also allowed to have access to the library, by benchers' orders—as a matter of courtesy a man, though not a student of Lincoln's Inn, if he has chambers near the library, has been allowed to come in and look at the books—Mr. Lamb is not a member of Lincoln's Inn, but of the Inner Temple—he has chambers at 25, Old Square, Lincoln's Inn—I believe I have on two occasions seen him in the library, as far as I can remember, but I am not always there—I am sometimes out on necessary business connected with the Inn; but the principal librarian is always there—at the end of July, last year, about the 29th, some books were missing from the library—they were five volumes of "Fisher's Digest," last edition, 1870; two volumes of "Shelford on Railways," 4th edition, 1869; "Addison on Torts," 3rd edition, 1870, a single volume; "Oke's Magis<lb/>terial Synopsis," 2 volumes, 10th edition, 1868; "Roscoe's Nisi Prius Evidence," 12th edition, 1870; "Chitty's Precedents and Pleadings," 3rd edition, 1868; and there were two other books, that had been missing for some weeks before that we have not accounted for—"Starkey on Libel," 3rd edition, 1869; and "Daniel's Chancery Practice," 4th edition, 1 volume—"Starkey" and "Daniel" had been missed for some week or so, and on the morning of the 29th I missed the others—most of them must have been in actual use the preceding day, became they were books that could not be</p>

               <p>missed for an hour without my knowing it; they would have been missed from the shelves—I made inquiries as to whether these books had been taken out under benchers' orders, and they had not—I immediately put myself in communication with booksellers and with one pawnbroker—among others I communicated with Reeves and Turner, of Chancery Lane, and from information I received from them, on 5th August, I took Sergeant Kerley with me, and went to Mr. Turner's, at the back of the Mansion House, and there I discovered the five volumes of "Fisher's Digest" and two volumes of "Shelford on Railways"—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the books—they were produced to me by Mr. Turner—I can clearly identify them as the property of the Inn, and our own copies—they are in the same con<lb/>dition as when I last saw them in the library, with the exception that they have had new fly-leaves put in, evidently by skilled labour, by a binder—I mean the brown paper—I can identify "Fisher's Digest" by tracing the arms of the Inn under the new fly-leaves—I can trace the arms underneath the new lining—the lining was taken up from the cover by Mr. Turner—I was not present when it was done, I saw it afterwards—this is the book—the arms are obliterated; but I trace a private mark there, which is made to indicate that the book is catalogued—that private mark is made in the first volume of each series—the two volumes of "Shelford" have been re<lb/>lined in the same way—I can trace the arms of the Inn there as clearly as in the others—I had previous to this made inquiries of Mr. Smith, a bookseller in Chancery Lane, and on the 10th August he sent for me, and made a communication to me with reference to "Gamble and Barlow"—whilst I was talking to him he pointed out to me the prisoner passing down the lane—I followed him, and came up with him just by the Inner Temple Gardens—I told him I wished to speak to him; I did not tell him about what, because there was another gentleman with him at the moment—I told him I had received information that he had offered "Gamble and Barlow's Irish Digest" for sale on the preceding day—he said he had—I told him such a book was missing from the library, and I requested him to show me the copy he had offered for sale—I went with him to his chambers—he did not object to show it to me—he took me to his chambers and delivered me this copy of "Gamble and Barlow;" these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the books—there has been an erasure in the binding, on the cover—there had been heavily written in ink "Lincoln's Inn Library"—at the date of the publica<lb/>tion of "Gamble and Barlow" the die was not in use—I used to write that in the books, and what remains here is in my handwriting—I identify this "Gamble and Barlow" as the property of the Inn—I told the prisoner when he produced it that I wished to take possession of it, and he allowed me to take it—I asked him where he had got it from—he said that he had bought it of a solicitor about relinquishing practice, whose name and address he could not give me—I took, the books away with me—these new editions are never sold by Lincoln's Inn—I did not say anything to Mr. Lamb about "Fisher" or "Shelford" at that time—I did afterwards, because I had frequent occasion to see him after that—I don't know that I said anything about it until I had received information from Mr. Turner—I then saw Mr. Lamb and told him that a gentleman answering his description had sold these books to Mr. Turner—he denied that he was the person—he told me he had never had any transaction with these particular books, "Fisher" and "Shelford."</p>

               <p>possession took place before we got to his chamber; as we were proceeding there—I had reason at that time to suppose they were our books; a copy of a book was missing, and was being offered for sale; it is a very scarce book; there are very few copies in England—the conversation may have been continued at his chambers—I saw Mr. Lamb on two or three occasions between then and the time of his letter to the treasurer during August—at no time did he mention to me the name of Mr. Langbourne as the person from whom he had obtained the books—the first time I heard the name of Langbourne, in connexion with this transaction, was when the treasurer handed me Mr. Lamb's statement to read—he did not mention to me that the person from whom he received them professed to be a person living at Saltash.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> A great many gentlemen come into the library of a day, to read and to consult the books—they sometimes bring blue and red bags, and black leather bags; ordinary brief bags; and papers are brought in them—the library is about 80 ft. long, and there are a number of recesses running in about 12 ft.—I do not sit in a recess, but a little forward, at the left hand side of the west end—Mr. Spilsbury sits on the right hand side of the eastern end—I am engaged in delivering books out, and putting them back, and attending to the general requirements of the members, and I have Parliamentary papers to arrange, and accounts to keep—I am frequently writing at my table, not for any length of time together, because disturbance is so constant—there would be no practical difficulty in a person conveying away books, one or two at a time in a bag, whilst I was engaged at my table, it would create no suspicion—I have seen Mr. Lamb in the library before the time the books were missed—I have only seen him on two occasions, I think, in the library—I did not know whether he had an order, or who he was; I know now that he had no order—when I saw him I think he was allowed to pass unques<lb/>tioned—I am not sure whether I said anything to him—after he had parted from his friend at the Temple Gardens, I walked with him to his chambers, up Middle Temple Lane and Chancery Lane—the conversation about the solicitor from whom he had the books occurred in passing up Middle Temple Lane, I think, and Chancery Lane—what led to the conversation, was being requested to account for the possession of these books—I told him we had missed such books—he said it was a very unpleasant business, a very serious business; that he had purchased them of a solicitor whom he could not get at now, a gentleman about to retire from practice, and he did not know his name and address.</p>

Sir,—I have been informed that some books have been stolen from the library of Lincoln's Inn, and I fear there is little doubt that I have been induced to become the purchaser of some of them. I have been asked to explain the circumstances under which these books came into my possession. Some months ago a gentle<lb/>manly-looking man called upon me and, handing me a card having upon it the name of 'Langbourne,' said that he was a solicitor giving up practice and shortly going to India. He informed me that he wished to sell his library, and among other barristers' names he mentioned that of Mr. Dixon, a gentleman with whom I am acquainted, saying that Mr. Dixon had bought some of his books, and had recommended him to call upon me. From time to time I bought books of this person, and now, nearly a month since, he called upon me again, and offered me for sale 'Gamble and Barlow's Irish Equity Index,' 'Fisher's Digest of the Common Law,' and the Equity Series of the 'Law Reports.' These books, he said, with the exception of three or four others, were all that remained of his library. I wished to purchase the 'Law Reports' and the 'Digest,' and asked him what he re<lb/>quired for them. He named a price, and said that as he would be in Lincoln's Inn on the following day, he would call upon me again. Next day a boy brought the 'Digest' to my chambers, and Langbourne, following soon after, told me that he would sell the work for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I said I could not afford to give so much, and requested him to take the books away, when he said he would send for them upon the following day. He also said that Mr.—(the name he mentioned I forget), he thought might purchase them, but if not he would see me again and try to come to an arrangement, as he was anxious to leave as soon as possible. The books were not sent for, but remained at my chambers for several days. In the meantime, as I was anxious to possess the 'Digest,' for the purpose of gaining a correct notion of the value of the work, I made several inquiries of booksellers as to what they considered was its proper price. Its value was estimated at 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or there-about. Among the persons of whom I made these inquiries was a Mr. Turner, who owns a shop at the back of the Mansion House in the City. These inquiries were made under the following circumstances:—The first occasion upon which I spoke to Mr. Turner, or someone in his shop, upon the subject was one day, I think, at the latter end of July, when passing the shop it occurred to me to inquire the value of the work in question. I entered the shop and made my inquiry of some persons present, who said that Mr. Turner was not there, but that he should be spoken to upon the subject, when he arrived, and I was asked to call at the shop again. This I should not have done had it not happened that upon Wednesday, the 3rd of August, I met a friend in Fleet Street; he was walking into the City to get change of a cheque, and he asked me to walk with him. I did so, and in going to and returning from the Bank we passed Mr. Turner's shop, and in returning it occurred to me to inquire whether the value of the 'Digest' had been ascertained, and my friend wishing to purchase a small book called</p>

               <p>the 'Bab Ballads' we went into the shop together. I ascertained what Mr. Turner considered to be the value of the 'Digest' and my friend being unable to obtain his book we both left the shop. This, sir, is the last time I ever entered the shop of Mr. Turner, with the exception of yesterday, notwithstanding that a person from his house pretends to recognize me as the seller of the books in question. Upon returning from the City I left my friend in Fleet Street, and went on to my cham<lb/>bers. According to appointment, Langbourne then called, when I told him that the book was a too expensive one for me to buy, upon which he said that he had a cab below and would take the books away with him, and I lent him a bag in which to carry them to the cab. When he was leaving, I think I mentioned to him the circumstance of my having called upon Turner, and I believe I gave him Turner's address; but upon this point I am not certain. Upon making inquiries of Mr. Turner I ascertain that he bought these books upon the 4th of August, the day after that upon which I had been at his shop, and the day after the books in question left my chambers; and he further says that the sale took place at about 1 o'clock. That I am not the person who sold to Mr. Turner the lost books, I most positively assert. That Mr. Turner is mistaken, I can prove by the evidence of a gentleman in whose company I was, upon the day in question, from half-past 11 or 12 o'clock until 3 or 4. I do not wish to suggest any motive which the purchaser of these stolen books might have in fixing upon me or any other innocent person as the individual of whom the books were bought. I will not attempt to theorize upon the subject, but will simply repeat that I am in a position to prove by one, if not two witnesses, that Mr. Turner is mistaken. Upon the 9th or 10th instant, Langbourne called upon me again, at about 12 o'clock at noon, and telling me that he had sold his 'Digest' and 'Reports' to a book<lb/>seller, whose name he did not mention, and obtained a good price for them, he again offered me the 'Irish Equity Index', saying he would sell it for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I at first declined, saying that the books could be of very little service to me; but afterwards I agreed to purchase them for a sovereign, but merely for the purpose of exchanging them for another, or of selling them again at a higher price. I paid him a sovereign, and he left the books. I think it was upon the same day that I ascertained of several persons in the book trade; persons whom I know, and who knew me perfectly well; that the book I had that morning purchased was of little value in England, and I then resolved to keep it by me and not to dispose of it at all. The morning after this I was in the Temple, when I was met by Mr. Nicholson, who re<lb/>quested to speak with me. He asked me if I bad in my possession a copy of the 'Equity Index' in question, to which I immediately replied 'Yes.' Mr. Nicholson then said that a book was missing from the library of Lin<lb/>coln's Inn, and I explained to him how it came into my possession, and taking him to my chambers, showed him the books. He asked permission to take these books away, which I, of course, accorded. Mr. Nicholson, after this, told me of the loss of the 'Digest,' and I made an appointment with him to meet Mr. Turner; but of this, Sir, Mr. Nicholson has doubtless told you. Since this time I have made every possible effort to discover the whereabouts of Langbourne, and I have reason to hope that these efforts will eventually lead to success. In making numerous inquiries some time has necessarily elapsed, but the necessity for making them must be my excuse, if any be needed, for the delay that has taken place. I have written,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187101090016"/>
               <p>to Mr. Dixon, but without any good effect. I have written to all the solici<lb/>tors practising at Saltash, and from one, the Town Clerk, hare received a reply, which leads me to hope that I have discovered a clue to the person whom I seek. In reply to a letter from me, Mr. Cleverton writes, 'I strongly suspect that the person intended to be referred to by you is a Mr. T. P. Wymond, late of Shields, and theretofore of London and Meath, who has been recently here on a visit to his father.' He says, further on, 'If this young gentleman has subjected himself to a criminal prosecution, kindly write me before taking proceedings.' In my letter to Mr. Cleverton I did not mention with what object I made my enquiries. I am still in communica<lb/>tion with this gentleman, and am waiting: to hear from him further upon the subject. No one else at Saltash to whom I have written has given me any information. I may inform you, Sir, that upon one occasion Lang<lb/>bourne asked me to settle a bill of sale for him, which I did, and I have found among some waste paper which was upon my table two or three draught sheets, upon which I originally drew part of the document, and there is an entry in my fee-book at about the date when I must have drawn this deed. I have also the visiting-card, with 'Mr. Langbourne, Saltash,' engraved upon it, which he gave me the first day he called upon me. I believe, Sir, I have now told you all I know upon the subject of these books, and having done so, I will only express a hope that I may yet be able to find out the person whom I seek, and if I am successful in so doing, much light will undoubtedly be thrown upon the subject. I have the honour to remain, Sir, your obedient servant,</p>

This letter of Mr. Nicholson was enclosed in Mr. Lamb's letter, and this is the letter I wrote to Mr. Lamb—(<hi rend="italic">Mr. Nicholson's letter requested the witness to afford Mr. Lamb the informa<lb/>tion he required</hi>)—Mr. Lamb called on me I think the next day, the 23rd—he merely said that he had come for the information he had asked for in his letter, and I told him the date on which the books had been bought was the 4th August, and as far as I could recollect about 1 o'clock, or between 1 and 2 o'clock in the day—no one was present when he came on that occasion; but my brother came in immediately afterwards, and said something to him—I have not the slightest doubt that the prisoner is the person who sold me the books on the 4th August.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first saw the prisoner two days before he sold the books—he applied to me personally—no other person in the shop had been applied to before that—at all events they did not communicate it to me—other persons are employed in my shop besides my brother—there was no one else in the shop but myself on the first occasion, or on the second, I think—it was on the third occasion that the sale took place—my brother brought down the slip of paper on which the receipt was given—he was on the next floor, which is a gallery above the shop, so that anyone speaking in the shop could be heard above, and I asked him to bring the paper down—the prisoner said on the third occasion that he had brought the books that he had mentioned to me before, to sell to me—the price was mentioned again—he said that he would take the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that I had offered—I had determined to give 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and had told him so the previous day—I should say the whole transaction occupied about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I looked at each volume to see that the dates agreed on the title page, and he looked at what I was doing—I think he was not looking round</p>

               <p>the shop—it was at the conclusion of the transaction that ray brother brought down the paper—the receipt was written at once, the money paid, and the person left—when I saw the prisoner again after this correspondence I did not say anything to him as to whether he was the man or not—I had heard that he had denied selling the books—my brother came into the shop immediately after the prisoner had left, on the day that he came to make inquiries, and he went after him and recognized him—I told him to go into the street and see if he could see any such person—the prisoner had then just gone up Bucklersbury—he was out of sight of the shop—I did not go with my brother—this matter has been the subject of conver<lb/>sation between us—my brother had seen the prisoner when he gave the receipt—we gave a description of him to the detective, I think—I think it is very likely that we compared notes as to what he was like—my brother came back a very short time after he went out to see if he could recognize the man—it is not possible that I am mistaken about the man who sold the books—I did not make any entry about the time at which the sale took place, only the day of the month—I did not make any entry of the hour of the day—I may have written down the hour for the prisoner when he called—I am not sure whether I said "1" or "Between 1 and 2"—I believe I did say it was 1 o'clock—I don't think it is likely that I put down 1 o'clock exactly—I should probably hive written "1" or "Between 1 and 2"—I gave the paper to the prisoner—as far as I recollect that was what I said to the prisoner—the way in which I recollect the time is that I generally come back from luncheon about 1 o'clock, and I recollect that when I bought the books it was soon after I returned from luncheon—I don't think it could have been long after it.</p>

I am the brother of the last witness—I was in the shop on the 4th August, when "Fisher's Digest" and "Shelford on Railways" was brought—the prisoner is the person who brought them—I was on the first floor when he brought them in, and I came down to bring a sheet of paper and a receipt stamp—my brother asked me to do so—I came down into the shop, and saw the prisoner there—I am quite positive of that—I saw him write this receipt—I had not seen him at the shop before. (<hi rend="italic">Receipt read</hi>: "Received 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for 'Fisher's Digest' and 'Shelford on Railways,' 7 volumes; Richard Kinglake, Saltash, and 23, Old Square"—I saw the prisoner again about one or two days after he had sold the books—in con<lb/>sequence of something my brother said to me I went out, and went down the new street, Queen Victoria Street, and there saw the prisoner—he was the person that I had seen on 4th August, the day the receipt was given—I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should think the selling of the books lasted about five minutes—I saw the prisoner come in, and saw him leave—I should think it was about five minutes, I could not be sure—I was not up in the gallery during the greater part of the time—I was there when he came in; but I came down immediately, at least as soon as the receipt was wanted—it was not wanted until the bargain was concluded—I waited there while he wrote the receipt—he left the shop as soon as he had written it—I should think it was between 1 and 2 o'clock—I should think it was nearer 2 o'clock, if</p>

               <p>anything; but I could not say exactly the time—I went to look for him two days afterwards, in consequence of what my brother said—he said that Mr. Lamb had just been to the shop, and he bad gone down the new street—my brother and I had talked about the person who sold the books before that, and when I came in my brother said "Go down the new street, and look for him"—I went down the new street to see if I could recognize him—my brother generally came back from lunch about 1 o'clock—on the 4th he had just come back—he does not always get back at the same time—I should think it was about 25 minutes to 2 o'clock on this occasion, as far as I can remember; it was nearer 2 than 1 o'clock—between 1 and 2 o'clock at any rate—I remember it was about that time—my brother did not tell me that he thought it was 1 o'clock, and that he had written 1 o'clock on the paper—I think he did say he thought it was about 1 o'clock—I did not say that it was 25 minutes to 2 o'clock—it was between 1 and 2 o'clock, I should think—I have no particular reason for fixing on 25 minutes to 2, more than 20 minutes after 1 o'clock.</p>

               <p>as to missing books from the library—I saw Mr. Lamb on that occasion, in the presence of Mr. Nicholson and the younger of the two Turners—Mr. Turner had just then identified Mr. Lamb, and, in my presence, he repeated his decided opinion that Mr. Lamb was the person—that was in Mr. Lamb's presence, and I then said an explanation was required—he admitted, and with apparent frankness, that the case seemed to bear a very uncomfortable complexion as regarded him, and he intimated his willingness to give all the explanation in his power.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective sergeant, of Bow Street—in conse<lb/>quence of a warrant, signed by Mr. Vaughan, on 16th November, I went to 38, Tollington Road, Holloway, and saw the prisoner—he came to the door—I told him that I was a detective officer, and held a warrant for his appre<lb/>hension, signed by J. Vaughan, Esq., the Magistrate of Bow Street—he said "What for?"—I said "For stealing some books: I will read the warrant to you"—we went into a back room—he said "Good God! what does all this mean? will you allow me to see my wife?"—I said "Yes, certainly"—we went into the front parlour, and he said to his wife "Don't be alarmed, this is an officer come to arrest me"—she said "What for?"—he said "For stealing some books"—she said "Where from?"—he said "Lincoln's Inn Library"—she said "But you never go there"—he said "Yes, I have been there on two or three occasions; I have heard about these books before, and I wrote to Mr. Walpole to-day"—and he said to me "Do you know anything</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187101090021"/>
               <p>about these books?"—I said "Yes; Mr. Nicholson, the librarian, found some of them at a shop, in the City"—he said "Where?"—I said "At a shop by the side of the Mansion House"—he said "Does the person say that I sold them there?"—I said "I can't say that he said it was you sold them, but he can identify the person that did sell them"—at the station he was searched, and upon him I found this letter—he said "That is a copy of the letter I wrote to Mr. Walpole—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I think it right to inform you, that since forwarding to you my explanation as to how the books stolen from Lincoln's Inn came into my possession, I have made every effort to ascertain something of the person of whom I bought them, but, unfortu<lb/>nately, without success. You, Sir, will perhaps not think it out of place if I afford you some information as to my private means, for the pur<lb/>pose of showing how improbable it would be for me, with a guilty know<lb/>ledge, to involve myself in such an affair as this;—although I am married, and not by any means rich, I enjoy a private income of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum; and for the last few years, from my practice at the bar, something over 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum. Besides this, I have near relations from whom, at any moment, I could readily obtain whatever I might, in reason, desire. I would ask you, Sir, also to bear in mind that, although all the information I can impart with reference to the person of whom I purchased these books is meagre, yet, whenever I disposed of a book so purchased, I invariably did so to a person to whom I was well known, and who could consequently have found me at any moment. Any questions you deem right to put to me will, I need hardly say, be answered with the greatest readiness;—nothing could be further from my wishes than that more light should not be thrown upon the subject, for of this I am convinced, that it only requires the whole truth to be discovered to entirely exonerate me, not from all censure, but from all that I now most fervently wish to be absolved from.")</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business at 25, Southampton Row, and am an expert in handwriting—I have had a very large experience in that way for many years—some time ago I received from Mr. Pemberton, the solicitor of Lincoln's Inn, this receipt for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the letter addressed to Mr. Walpole, dated "30th August," and these four letters, produced by Mr. Tarn, addressed to Mr. Shee, and marked "1," "2," "3," and "4"—I have looked at them with a view to see whether they are in the same or a different handwriting, and I am of opinion, without doubt, that the receipt is in the same handwriting as these letters—the first letter that was given me was that to Mr. Walpole—that I believe to be a <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> handwriting; but it is carefully written—the receipt does not appear to be carefully written, it is written in an extremely hurried manner—I identify the receipt from all the letters in combination—at first I was only shown the letter to Mr. Walpole—I believed it was in the same handwriting; but I declined to give a positive opinion unless I saw some writing that was ap<lb/>parently written under the same circumstances as the receipt, that is, in a hurried manner, carelessly, and not in the same set manner that the letter is; and when these other letters were put into my hands, I immediately identified the handwriting in a very short time indeed—I have not the least</p>

               <p>doubt that they are in the same handwriting—I have been engaged fifteen or sixteen years as an expert in deciphering handwriting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. I expect to find some characters of handwriting the same, whether the writing be studied or hurried; but not all—in some respects the character will be different, and different forma<lb/>tions will be substituted—there might be the intention to disguise; but if hurriedly written, it would be more difficult to carry it out—the receipt is written in a large hand, and that seems to me to constitute its principal disguise, being written large, and as quickly as possible, otherwise it is the <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> handwriting; but it has been written too quickly to effect any real disguise—in testing handwriting we endeavour to find out what are the habitual characteristics of forming the letters, not taking one individual letter, but the general habit—in the "S" in the word "Saltash," in the receipt, the top stroke is completely to the right—the "S" in the word "Square," in the letter to Mr. Walpole, is a totally different formation—I do not trace anything in common between the two, one is in a set writing, and the other in the careless writing—they are of a different character, certainly; but when persons write rapidly they change the formation of the letters—I can give you a very striking instance in this letter—when persons write rapidly they substitute, in some instances, different formation of letters—the letter "S," in the word "Sir," in the letter to Mr. Walpole, also differs—the "S" in "Square," in the receipt, is formed in the same way as in "Saltash;" and that also is totally different to the "S" in the words "Sir" and "Square," in the letter to Mr. Walpole—the "D" in "Dickson," in the letter is not exactly the same as the "D" in "Digest," in the receipt—it does not differ in character, only in size; there are trifling differences, not essential ones—the "h" in "have," in the letter, is not of the same character as the "h" in "Shelford," in the receipt; the differ<lb/>ence arises from the scribbling manner in which it is attempted to be written; it is different in every respect in size and in character; it is of the same character as the "h" in "Saltash," especially the final portion of it; it is identical; the final part of the "h," in the letter, forms an acute angle; in the receipt it is rather more acute; the upper turning is very acute, and the lower turning very round, and that is the case in both—in writing figures persons are very often off their guard—the figure "2" in the receipt and in the letter decidedly correspond in character; one is written in a very studied, careful manner, and the other rapidly—the figure "1" is much taller than the "8" in the dating of the letter of 30th August, and so it is in the receipt; in other respects the figure is different; but that arises from the rapidity of the writing—it is totally different in formation, and you may find differences in the same document; for instance, the "0" in "1870" is different from the "0" in "30th;" one is left open at the top, and the other is finished; but the character is the same—the figure "7" in the receipt does not bear the least likeness to the "7" in "1870," in the letter—a person would make that difference if he had in his mind an intention to disguise his writing—I believe the intention was when this was written to write it so that it should not be recognized—I mean that there was an intention to disguise the handwriting—I infer that from the size of the writing, and the scribbled manner in which it is done, and those trifling variations that would occur at the time—there are symptoms of actual disguise, which you point out to me—I infer that not from having formed a judgment about this case, but from a comparison of the hand<lb/>writing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187101090025"/>
               <p>—the difference in the form of the figure 7 is one effort at disguise, and a successful one; I assume, of course, that the writing is by the same person—I conceive that when the person wrote this receipt he intended disguise, but being written rapidly he could only disguise a letter now and then, if he had had more time to devote to it it would have been a very different production—without comparing the receipt with anything else, there is nothing on the face of it to show an effort to disguise—I have heard evidence given to the effect that the character of handwriting of itself shows whether it is natural or not, without comparing it with other writing, and I have given such evidence myself, but you cannot always do so—if the receipt was put into my hands by itself, I should say it was nothing tangible—I could form no judgment one way or the other—none of the "d's" that occur in the receipt are formed in the proper orthodox manner, that is, they are all turned over; but in the letter of 30th August they are formed in the proper orthodox manner; but when the prisoner writes rapidly, under the same circumstances as he has done in two of his letters, of 7th June and 15th July, there is not a single mistake made, as it is in the letter of 30th August, they are all turned over at the end like those in the receipt—when I say "under the same circumstances," I only judge of that from the internal character of the hand writing, that all the letters "d" there are made like the "d" in 'the receipt, and not only that, there are three different formations of the "d" in that letter, and they are all represented here; out of the four "d's" there are scarcely two alike; there are three essentially different, and all those variations are found in this letter—I will call attention particularly to the word "should," and compare it with the words "received" and neighbourhood" in the letter—there is a slight difference; the one is closed up at the top and the other not, but the general mode in which the "d" is formed is the same, and greatly dis<lb/>tinguished from the manner in which it is formed in the letter of 30th August—I have not studied the draft letter found on the prisoner so much—I have confined my attention to one or two of these letters that I have looked at, and that is all—the "1" in Kinglake, in the receipt, and the "1" in "reply," in this letter, are not the same character, but they might both be made by the same person—I will admit that there are a number of points that are not of the same character; there are many differences, and there always will be, but there are certain points of absolute identity to my mind, which I have not yet been able to explain; I have not said all I have to say upon it, you have interrupted me—the letter "d" in the word "Shelford" is generally represented by the "d" in the word "attended," in the letter of 15th July, and again in "finished," and in "proposed" in the letter of 7th June; they are both formed in the same manner, only the "d" in "Shelford" is written in a cramped hand, a restrained hand—I say all the three "d's" are made upon one plan, neither of them are identical; there is a considerable difference, but there is the same notion, and the same plan of formation very distinct from the other "d's"—are three distinct manners of forming one particular class of the letter in the receipt, and there are all those three manners in one of these letters—there is another formation of the "d" still more striking; the small "d" in the word "should," in the letter of 7th June, and the "d" in "Richard," in the receipt, are totally different from the other letters "d;" they are on the same plan, but they are not finished in the same manner as the letters "d" in this formal letter—they are all finished at the upper part of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187101090028"/>
               <p>letter, and none of them are so in the formal letter; that was one of the reasons why I would not give an opinion upon the examination of the formal letter alone—then the "y" in the word "reply," in the letter of 15th July, is nearly identical with the "y" in "Railways," in the receipt, and also in the word "July "at the beginning of the letter—I do not see any difference whatever—gentlemen in my profession do sometimes make mistakes—I am very cautious, I very rarely indeed make a mistake; un<lb/>doubtedly I have made a mistake now and then—I do not remember the case of "Vardon <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Ford," in the Probate Court; I do not remember being examined as a witness in that case—I don't remember proving a document to be forged which was afterwards admitted to probate—I don't remember that occurring in 1866; I can't undertake to say it did not happen; I have no memory of it—you must remember this, that sometimes, when I have given my opinion before a Jury, they have differed from my opinion, but another Jury has come after that, and supported me; so how am I to know whether I was right or wrong—two Juries have maintained my opinion against the decision of a first Jury—I do not remember the case of "Vardon <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Ford;" I think you must be mistaken; I can hardly think I was in that case, I don't remember either of the names, or the name of Eden, a solicitor, of Gray's Inn, who retained my services, or Dr. Wamby examining me—I assure you I do not remember any one of those circum<lb/>stances—I will not undertake to say that such things did not happen in 1866—you lead me to suppose it was so, because you seem to be asking me from some data, but I do not remember it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I remember the case of "Cresswell <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Jackson," in which such a thing happened—the first Jury said the documents were genuine, and my opinion was that they were forgeries; another Jury said that they were forgeries; it went through the House of Lords, and finally to a third Jury, and they said they were forgeries—there are some other similarities between the receipt and the letters which I have not yet pointed out; there is the "g" in "Digest," in the receipt, and the "g" in "again," in the letter of 30th August; they are particularly alike—then there is a very remarkable manner of making the letter "k;" you will find it in "Kinglake," in the receipt, and in "book," in the letter of 30th August—it does not matter whether the prisoner writes quickly or slowly, his cha<lb/>racteristic manner of making the "k" is the same; in the letter of 7th June there is a similarly formed "k" in "kindly"—in the letter "s" in "Fisher" and "railways" there is a peculiar touch, and I find the same thing in the letter of 30th August, in "barristers" and "books," in lines 12, 14, and 16 of the first page; it terminates abruptly, more like a strongly-marked comma—then there is another singularity in the "q" in "questions," in the letter of 17th August, and the "q" in "square," in the receipt—the receipt is written in a larger character than the letter, but that is not the only difference, there are a number of other differences, but notwithstand<lb/>ing those differences, they are written by the same person—if a person writes one thing in a hurry and others with care, there would naturally be differences—if I was shown the receipt alone, and nothing was said about it, I should sec nothing in it but a <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> receipt; but when I was told it might be written under suspicious circumstances, and that the person might want to disguise his hand, then I should say, comparing it with other letters, those differences that I sec are accounted for—I have formed my</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187101090029"/>
               <p>opinion principally upon a comparison of the receipt with the other letters; of course the letter of 30th August somewhat supports it.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business at 18, Golden Square—I am an expert, and have been so for thirty years—I have looked at this receipt, and also at the letter to Mr. Walpole, and other letters, and I have formed an opinion that they are written by one and the same hand—the letter to Mr. Walpole is written more studiously, more carefully, and would hardly bear comparison with some of the others at the first glance—some of the letters written by the prisoner differ from the letter to Mr. Walpole quite as much as from the printed receipt; I am speaking of style, not character—comparing the receipt with some of those letters, I find both style and character identical—the receipt is written much larger; but magnify one or two of the other letters, and then you see almost the same writing, without any disguise—the style of the seven-page letter is different; it is written more carefully and studiously; the receipt is more rapidly written—I did not hear Mr. Chabot's evidence; I purposely left the Court—there are about five lines in this receipt, and I have noticed sixteen remarkable characteristics; first, I will take the letter "d" in the word "Richard," and the letter "d" in "old," which follows directly—I find the same in the word "received" in this letter, and in the words "neighbour<lb/>hood" and "should;" the "d" in the word "received" corresponds with the "d" in the word "neighbourhood;" then there is the small "g" in "Digest" and in "Kingslake," the letter, instead of being made close together, is separated, so as to give it the appearance of "e j"—in the fourth paragraph of the letter to Mr. Walpole, in the words "originally" and "amongst," you will find the same characteristic—then the capital "R" in "Received," in the receipt, is perfectly similar to the word "Reports" in the letter, with the exception of its being written a little more apart; you will find even that the pen has caught at the bottom, exactly in the similar manner—it is formed exactly on the same principle; it has no loop, as an "R" generally has, and it comes down with a straight stroke—I notice also the connection of the letters "ol" in the word "vols." for volumes—that occurs in the word "following," in two places, and the capital "D" also, I find identical in the word "Digest"—there are three kinds of "r's" which I find throughout the documents; there is the "r" in the word "Fisher," in the receipt; that hag no head to it, it is made like an "i;" then in the word "Shelford," it has a head to it, and another in the word "square" has a top to it; and I can identify those different "r's" throughout the documents—I have marked sixteen of such characteristics as those in the small space of five lines—from those and other reasons, I am of opinion that the handwriting in the receipt and the letters is the same.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. The characteristics are the habits of the writer—style is whether the writing is upright or sloping, or whether it is written well or badly—you say a stylish writing, if it is written very<lb/>well, the same as you would speak of a stylish woman—the characteristics are the habits that man introduces, which he is unaware of himself, and which, when he writes, he introduces, and by which we find him out—it is the elements of handwriting, the distinguishing features which he always introduces—perhaps I speak professionally—I am a lithographer, and when a person comes to me and asks for a thing to be done in the best style, I understand what is meant—I include in that legibility, of course—in testing the handwriting of a person, I rely on the characteristics, and if on com<lb/>paring</p>

               <p>paring writing I don't find those characteristics, I should decidedly object to give any opinion whatever—I am able, from these five lines in the receipt, to detect enough to convince me that the letter to Mr. Walpole was written by the same person—I entertain no doubt whatever about it—the receipt is not in the same style as the letter—the one is written on the spur of the moment—I should say it was slightly feigned, because it is altered in places—it is touched up—the capital "O" is touched up; it is formed one way, and then distorted a little—it has been added to and altered—I allude to the letters "B K"—the initials on the receipt-stamp and the "O" has been added, too—it looks as if it was commenced and then altered—probably he was going to put a capital "O," and then altered it to a small one—that is what it looks like—I don't see anything else—with those two exceptions, the character of the handwriting looks like a natural hand—but for com<lb/>paring it with other things I should not say there was any effort to disguise—it looks like a natural handwriting, it is very slightly disguised—I should be sorry to give a strong opinion on that—I should say it would be an easy thing for a person writing in a hurry to disguise his handwriting—the more rapidly you write the loss chance there is of disguising—I have a note of the sixteen different characteristics that I have alluded to—this is it (<hi rend="italic">hand<lb/>ing it in</hi>)—the letter to Mr. Walpole is written more slopingly than the receipt—I don't say anything about the ciphers—I don't think that persons writing ciphers are more off their guard—I was first consulted about two months ago, before Mr. Chabot, and before the prisoner was taken into custody—I was not examined before the Magistrate—this is the first time I have given evidence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was first asked about Mr. Arthur Lamb's calling about two weeks ago—never till then—I see by the book, Mr. Arthur Lamb called on the 8th August—I should think he called about 12.30 that day—Mr. Francis Lamb generally went out to his lunch about 1 o'clock, and he was out at that time—I remember Mr. Arthur Lamb calling, about 12.30, and I remember Mr. Francis Lamb going out to his lunch shortly after—I am speaking of the 8th August now—he went out to his lunch generally about 1 o'clock—without referring to the book I can't say when Mr. Arthur Lamb called before the 4th August—he did not call between the 4th and the 8th—he called on the 1st—that was early in the morning I should think, because his name appears second on the 1st August—that is the only reason I hare—I remember that it was about 11 o'clock on the 4th that Mr. Martin called, because when I saw him and Mr. Bailey, a little while back, at the office, speaking about something, I remembered it—I mean a fort<lb/>night ago—Mr. Bailey and Mr. Martin were talking the matter over, and I heard them—I remembered what the time was when Mr. Francis Lamb spoke to me about it—I should not have remembered without being asked what time it was Mr. Martin called—when Mr. Lamb spoke to me about it I remembered it—that was after Mr. Martin and Mr. Bailey talked about it—it was Mr. Francis Lamb who spoke to me about it—he asked me what time it was Mr. Arthur Lamb called, and I said "To the best of my knowledge it was about 1 o'clock"—my attention had not been called from the 4th August till about a fortnight ago.</p>

               <p>Vere Street—the prisoner has been employed there some yearn—his duty was to examine the letters for the suburban towns—on the evening of 16th December he commenced examining letters at 5 o'clock—the fixed time for the bag to leave the office was 5.20, and it left at 5.24—after the bag was made up, I saw him leave the table with some letters in his hand—he went to the other end of the office, and dropped two into the dead-letter box, and put a third into his pocket—a letter, addressed to Leatherhead, should be put into the bag for the General Post Office, leaving at 5.20—the prisoner had examined the letters, and tied up the bundle for that bag—he then went to another sorting-table, and commenced sorting the letters for ex<lb/>delivery—he had been there two or three minutes, when I called him aside, and said "Mawe, you have just put a letter into your pocket, which is a very improper thing for you to do in the office, even if the letter is your own"—he muttered something—I understood him to say "I have"—he seemed very much confused—I said "Show it to me"—he took it from his pocket and gave it to me—it was this letter for Leatherhead, which should have been dispatched at 5.20—I said "You must go with me to the post<lb/>master's room"—it is addressed "Miss C.

I am clerk to Mr. George Powell, the solicitor for the prosecution—I went with Detective Watts to the prisoner's shop, some day in the middle of December—I had the prisoner's description, and saw him among others—I said "Is Mr. Smitheman in?"—he said "I am one of them"—I said "Mr. Thomas Smitheman?"—he said "My name is John"—I asked him where Mr. Thomas Smitheman was—he said "At Brighton," and he would not return for three days—I asked him if he knew Mr. Wilkins—he said that they were doing a great deal of work for him—I asked him who attended to the work—he said "Mr. Thomas"—I was at the police-station, and heard the prisoner ask Mr. Wilkins to withdraw the charge—he said that he merely placed the bills there as security, not for discount, and if it had not been for the banker it would never have been heard of, as he should have taken them up before they fell due.</p>

I know something about the bill; my brother has had some transactions with Mr. Wilkius, but he is at Brighton"—Curtis then left and returned with Mr. Wilkins, who said "That is the man, take him to the station"—I did so, and while in the dock he said to Mr. Wilkins "Do not go on with it, I only placed it there for security, not for discount; if it had not been for the bankers' clerk you would never have known anything about it, for I intended taking it up in two days."</p>

I am living at the Well Street Home—I was a seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Sarah Anderson</hi>, a ship under English colours, which sailed from India in September or October, and arrived in England in December—the prisoner was also a seaman on board—on the morning of September 13th the ship was on the high seas, the prisoner and I had a quarrel a few minutes before 12 o'clock on the evening previous—we had a fight, and the prisoner gave in and went below—I remained on deck—I heard the prisoner say in the forecastle a short time afterwards "I will have the son of a bitch's life;" and afterwards that he would cut my guts out—I was standing against the hatch, preparing to go down into the forecastle—the prisoner rushed up with a sheath knife in one hand and a billet of wood in the other; he rushed at me and attempted to stab me, so (<hi rend="italic">with the knife over his head</hi>)—he made a cut down, which cut my monkey-jacket here (<hi rend="italic">near his throat</hi>)</p>

               <p>he was doing, sharpening the knife—he told me the prosecutor had offended him, and he was determined to have his guts open before the morning—I told him to be quiet—he told me not to interfere—I then called to the prosecutor, and told him to keep out of the way—the prisoner got half way on the forecastle ladder—he had a billet of wood and this knife in his hands—I went half way on the ladder, and looked up and saw him throw the piece of wood up on deck, and it struck one of the apprentices—I lost sight of the prisoner, and a few minutes afterwards I was called by the cook to assist—I went on deck, and the prosecutor and the mate had hold of the prisoner, who had the knife between his teeth—his mouth was bleed<lb/>ing, and his thumb was cut—I asked the prisoner to loose the knife—he said he would not, and the mate <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> his arms down, and he let go of it—the steward called the captain—about ten minutes afterwards, when I was going to turn in, I saw the prisoner with a large table knife belonging to the steward; not this one; he was sharpening it—I asked him to put it down—he said he would not, but at last he turned into his bunk, but kept cursing and swearing all the time.</p>

               <p>"Come on, let the b——s have it"—McCarthy made sereral attempts to trip me up, but I kept him away by kicking; another constable came up, and I called upon him to take him—we took them to the station, and I found on West these matches, this rush, and these two latch keys; but neither of them fits the prosecutor's door—I saw this centre-bit found in the side of McCarthy's right boot, at the station-house—there were no marks of No. 22 being forced—I cannot tell how it was opened, neither of these keys fit the latch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk, and live at 2, Houghton Street, Clare Market—on Sunday, 1st January, I returned home about 1.15—when I entered my room there was a lamp alight, hut turned down very low—the fire was just out, and my wife was in bed and asleep, and a little child in bed with her—I sat down, and smoked my pipe, and drank some beer—about 1.45 I was going to light another pipe, as I was reading rather an interesting book, when I noticed the valance of the bed raised up—I went and pulled it up, and there was the prisoner underneath the bed—I pulled him out, and asked what he did there—he made some rambling statement, and pretended that he was drunk; that he did not know how be got there, but he thought his mother used to live there—when I went into the room I found my wife's things on the floor, entangled in a chair, at if they had been thrown down—there was money in the room, and several things belong<lb/>ing to my wife, which might have been taken—I did not notice that any<lb/>thing had been removed—I asked the prisoner what he was—he said he was a steward on board ship—I awoke my wife, and said to her, in the prisoner's presence, "What is the meaning of this, how did he come here?"—she said she did not know, and looked very frightened—he said he was drunk, and he was very sorry—he could not make out how he could have got there—I took him by the collar, and took him down stairs—he was not so drunk but he could walk down the narrow part of the stairs without stumbling—as I went down I called to my father-in-law, who lives on the first floor, but as I could not make him hear, I let go of the prisoner for a moment to knock at his door, and he hid himself in a recess; I got him again, and gave him in charge to a constable—I heard him give his address at the station, at Green's Sailors' Home, East India Road, and he was steward of a ship—I asked him what sort of steward—he said "A first-class steward"—he did not say of what ship—there is a window on the staircase, which had been broken, and a piece of cardboard put over it—in the morning I found that gone; a hand could then be put in to open the window—there were marks on the sill as if a person had sat there and let himself down.</p>

               <p>—it was in Brook's Market that I saw the prosecutor on the ground, and the men rifling his pockets—to get from there to Fox Court you go along Brook's Market into Brook Street, and Fox Court is leading from Brook Street; you do not turn round into Brook Street, it is a straight line—you have to turn a corner into Fox Court, to the right—I don't know what became of the other person, I kept my eye on the one—I only saw two men—I was the first policeman there—I did not see the prisoner's face until I caught him—I should say the prosecutor was not drunk—he was more excited than drunk—he was not sober—I should call him under the influence of drink.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I saw the prisoner's back, and kept him in sight as he ran—when he turned the corner I was near enough nearly to touch him—when I turned the corner I did not see any person in front, not till I got forty or fifty yards further—I should say the beginning of Brook's Market is about sixty or seventy yards from Holborn Buildings, where the prisoner lives—I searched him, and found on him about 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in farthings and half-pence, a comb, and a handkerchief.</p>

I am a public-house broker, and reside at 4, Brunswick Terrace, Commercial Road—I was employed by Taylor, Walker &amp; Co., the brewers, to let the "Sun," public-house, at Blackheath—I saw the defen<lb/>dant on that subject, in October, 1869—he had been down previously to the brewery, and had seen Mr. Sewell, the manager, and expressed a desire to take the house, and Mr. Sewell referred him to me—we met the next morning, at the brewery, and an agreement was prepared, and Mr. Fair-child, paid a deposit of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into my hands—he agreed at that time to pay 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the firm was to lend the other 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he signed this agreement in my presence. (<hi rend="italic">This was a memorandum of agreement, dated 26th October</hi>, 1869, <hi rend="italic">between 'William Henry Sewell and George Emberson Fairchild, and witnessed by Harry Jones, to assign over the "Sun" tavern, at Greenwich, in consideration of the sum of</hi> 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to be paid, and as tenant to Messrs.

Taylor, Walker &amp; Co., to which the equitable mortgage related—after signing the first agreement he called on me and said he could not make up the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—he wanted first 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he called and asked whether the firm would advance 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., more—the original understanding was that 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was to be given, and it was afterwards made up to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went to the premises in July, and put in a distress for three quarters' rent, 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., due at midsummer—I waited at the house about two hours before Fairchild came—I told him we were there for the rent, and wanted 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was in a very excited state, and said he had got the money in his cash box—I said if he would pay us the money, we would withdraw without charging the expenses—he said he should do nothing of the sort, he should allow the thing to go on; in fact, he took up the poker and threatened us—the broken remained in possession—I afterwards saw the defendant on the subject of this letter, which I received from Mr. Sewell, the manager to Messrs. Taylor, Walker &amp; Co.—on 21st July, I saw the defendant at the brewery, after the distraint was made—I asked him whether he was prepared to come to any arrangement—he said he would, if the firm would give him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and allow him to keep the furniture and pay his debt to Messrs. Sewell and Blackie—I said I would go and see Mr. Sewell—I went and saw him—I saw the defendant afterwards, and told him Mr. Sewell would give him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and allow him to remove his own furniture, and would discharge Messrs. Sewell &amp; Blackie's debt, and would forgo their claim—he said if they would allow him to remove the billiard table he would accede to it—I saw Mr. Sewell about that, and then saw the defendant—I told him that Mr. Sewell would not allow the billiard table to be removed—the defendant then said he would go home and smash every b——thing up in the place, if he suffered twelve months for it afterwards—I said if he did attempt to do anything of that sort, of course we should punish him for it, and I reminded him that the goods were mortgaged to Messrs. Taylor &amp; Walker—we then parted, and no arrangement having been made, I prepared to sell under the distress for rent—I posted bills about and advertised, and the sale was to take place on 25th July, at 3.30, at the public-house—the things were appraised before the sale at 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and they were offered to the defendant at that price, in my presence and in the' presence of a constable—he said we were to sell the things and do what we liked with them—they were sold for 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—my brother bought some of the things, at least they were knocked down to a man of the name of Redpath—after the sale the defendant conducted himself in a violent way—he took a mallet up, and threatened me, and attempted to rip my nose up with his thumb, and swore at me—when it got dark the men wanted to remove the goods, and the gas was turned on—he said he would not have any gas on, and turned it out—a clerk went for some candles, and he knocked them out of his hand, and would not allow them to be lighted, and he broke</p>

I am an accountant, and live at Greenwich—I have known the prisoner some five years—I never heard anything against his character, I have always heard him well spoken of—I remember his occupying the "Sun" public-house—in July I wrote one or two letters for him to Mr. Sewell, and posted them myself—I made copies of them at the time, and have them here—I could not say that the prisoner was not able to use his hand at that time, he had met with some accident, I believe. (<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>: "10th July, 1870. Dear Sir,—I am sorry to say that, although I have got nearly three puncheons porter in the cellar, I cannot use any of it, as fast as I draw and send it out all my customers return it, and in conse<lb/>quence, for the last two days I have been compelled to draw stout and ale, of which I am now aground. Please attend to this at once, as delay is simply ruin, and I must shut up the house if I have no beer to draw.")—The representation in that letter was undoubtedly true—Mr. Pratt, the collector of Taylor &amp; Co., came down after the first letter was written; I wrote two—I did not hear what passed between him and the prisoner—I was not at the premises when the distraint was put in—I was present at the sale on the 25th—I have no idea as to the value of the wine and spirits; his furniture generally, as far as I could judge, would be worth from 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the fixtures might amount to as much more—there were several protests by the prisoner against the mode in which the sale was carried on; he was very much put out about it, and was in a very irritable state all day—he said he considered they—had no right to hold the sale on his pre<lb/>mises.</p>

I am a hot water engineer and gasfitter, and live at 2, Plumridge Street, Blackheath Hill—on the evening of 25th July, I was employed by the prisoner to take some things out of the "Sun" public-house—I took them out carefully; there was nothing damaged; the place is not a wreck—I knew the house before the prisoner went into it, it had been empty about four months—I think the trade had improved to what it was at the last tenancy, and was well conducted—I have known the prisoner about two years, or a little more—I never heard anything against him—I took away the counter, the cabinet, and pipes—the counter was fixed to the floor, it was taken down very carefully, so as to be placed there or anywhere else without injury to the material that was there—the greatest care was taken, I can assure you, in taking all the things out, nothing was taken away recklessly—Mr. Eldred, a carpenter, who is now dead, was doing it with me, and was equally careful—I never heard any violent expressions or threats from the prisoner towards Messrs.

I am an Usher of the Lambeth County Court—I know the defendant by sight, and I believe the oath was administered to him on 6th December—it is customary to do so—as near as I can repeat, the attorney for the plaintiff asked him "Did you ever have any coals, either on your own account or your mother's, on credit"—he answered in the nega<lb/>tive; the question was put a second time, and he again answered in the negative—I do not recollect hearing the Judge ask the same question—it was the mode in which the question was put which called my attention to it, otherwise I should not have troubled my head about the matter, there are so many cases—I mean that the way Mr. Elworthy put his question called my attention to the case.</p>

               <p>were not paid for, because I said "How is it that you almost invariably pay cash for your coals, and that there are several other transactions for which you have not paid cash?"—I had not been long in the place then, and wished to know—he said that his mother was not in the way, and there were two or three amounts outstanding, and he would call in a few days and settle them altogether—he did not have credit for coals at all after 21st March—the tickets not marked "Paid" were collected in the evening, and entered in the day-book in the usual course of business—I personally ex<lb/>amined a number of tickets where coals had been purchased by the defendant—I found the word "Paid" on all that were paid—this signature "Ellen" is the name of the bargeman; he always marks them—I also examined the books with regard to the account between the defendant and his mother and Mr. Pass.</p>

               <p>simple reason, that the books were never produced; but he did say that our system of doing business was very irregular; you will find that it was not so—I differ from the Judge—I do not think I said at the County Court that the prisoner said that his mother had given him the money and he had spent it, for the whole case did not last three minutes—I did not tell Mr. Elworthy that—I gave him instructions to conduct the case, and con<lb/>sulted with him when the summons was taken out—to the best of my knowledge, I never told the Judge, or Mr. Elworthy, or the Police Magis<lb/>trate, that the prisoner said he had received the money and spent it, and promised to pay—I think I mentioned it to the Counsel when I had a con<lb/>ference with him here on Tuesday evening—Mr. Elworthy was not present—I did not tell Mr. Elworthy because there were so many little details which cropped up, and I did not attach the importance to it you do—the mother has dealt with the firm two or three years.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know whether I have ever made out a ticket to Mrs. London—I had to take all the money—I was always there except when I was at my meals, and then those who received cash would write it down in the book, and give it to me when I came back, and I look at the tickets to see that it is entered properly—most of these orders are in other people's writing—Mr. Pass's, Mr. Wilson's, Mr. Strickland's, and my own—Mrs. London did not cease to deal with me after March—the defendant came very often after that—I left in September—the prisoner also ordered coal on his own account; we have trusted him two sacks at a time, and I think half-a-ton—everybody's name who has an account is entered in the ledger—I think the defendant had an account—I should specify to Mr. Wilson when he made the ledger up, which were for Mr. London and which for his mother, and I would say "<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> has had these himself, and he is going to pay us next week"—I carried all that in my head—I never saw Mrs. London at the office—Mr. Pass came sometimes—I have worked for Mr. Wilson since he started, which was some time in September—Mr. Pass then let the wharf—neither he or Mr. Wilson have got it now—I do not know whether Mr. Pass is here—I do not think he was at the Police Court—it was Mr. Pass's business, but Mr. Wilson had the management—Mr. Pass came there nearly every day, and he used to take the money, and give it to me to take care of till the morning; that was a rule in the office, or he would give it to Wilson, and Wilson would give it to me—Mr. Pass and Wilson were both in the habit of receiving money, and so was Strickland, the first thing in the morning—if goods were paid for in cash they would not appear in the ledger—this is the cash-book—nothing was paid for on 21st March—on 24th February some money was paid, but that would not appear in the ledger, or if it does, it ought not—on 24th February, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was paid, and there are also two tickets on the 25th for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. paid, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. not paid—the clerk, Mr. Moore, kept the day-book—he is in America—I know his writing—I find the name of London twice here, on 24th February; the very last entry in the day is "London, H. H., 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—"H. H." means the kind of coal—the market might have changed</p>

               <p>that day—I only find two counterfoils on 24th February—there are not three entries, but the cash is carried out on one side of the book, and the credit on the other—three entries being charged when I have only two counterfoils is a mistake of the clerk's perhaps—coals cannot be obtained without a ticket, and a ticket cannot be obtained without being torn out of the counterfoil book—counterfoil No. 6, of 24th February, was torn out to show Mr. Chance, I think—I think we lost two counterfoils at the Police Court—I have only one in the book, now the other ia torn out—10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. being charged three times, when there are only two counterfoils, is a mistake of Mr. Moore's—it is pasted into the ledger, in which the man is charged—Mr. Moore was not charged with embezzlement, that I know of—I never heard that there was a complaint against him—he left when Mr. Wilson came—I think it was because there was not then enough for him to do—he did not leave at the same time, but some little time afterwards—I never heard that Mr. Pass complained of Moore, but he did of Mr. Glass, who was formerly manager, and who left in January—it was Glass who was charged with the offence, not Mr. Moore.</p>

I live at 13, South Lambeth Road, and travel in the coal trade—I was foreman and weigher to Mr. Pass for two years from the place being opened—I saw the defendant there many times, purchasing coals—when a person came to me for coals he brought a ticket from the office, upon which I put the name of the barge or wharf—when it was not paid I used to say "Halloa, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, credit again," and he would say "Yes, you b——, I am not such a b——y fool"—that happened several times—the tickets were collected, and I took them to the office in the evening—I enter them in a book; but I do not state whether they are paid for, I merely enter the quantity, so as to discharge myself for the coals—the defendant never paid me for any of these coals; he has paid me on the wharf, at times, and then I have always put "Paid" on the ticket; but not on the days in question—I was at the County Court on 6th December, and saw the defendant sworn—I heard the attorney ask him whether he had ever had any credit for his mother or himself; he said "No"—the question was repeated, and his answer was the same—I believe the Judge asked him the same, and he said "No"—to my knowledge he has had credit for his mother and himself; it may be fifty times, and it may be 100.</p>

Hill—I signed the notice before it was executed; it was about 26th September, that I signed it—I then left it in the hands of Messrs. Hill, and a man named William Pearce, in their employ, watched the premises—he had a duplicate notice, I believe—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a duplicate copy, and that is my signature—I was present at the County Court, at the action in which my partner and I were plaintiffs, and the defendant was the defendant then—he was examined as to the notice, and this duplicate was put in his hands; he was asked whether he had ever seen the duplicate of that notice, and he said "No;" he was then asked if he had ever had a notice, and he laid "No;" or whether he had read the notice, and he said "No"—he was also asked whether he ever saw the notice stuck on the doer, and he said no, but a policeman had told him there was such a notice.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Duke Street, Westminster Bridge Road, and am assistant to Messrs.

Hill, to serve on the defendant, on 26th September—I did not have an opportunity of serving in the course of that day; this is one of the notices I had—I posted the other one on the door of the workshop about 10.30 on the morning of the 26th—I remained in observation of the premises until the evening—in the evening, Thomas Nash joined me—soon after 6 o'clock—soon after 7 o'clock the defendant came to the premises; the notice was still on the door—I had fixed it on with liquid gum—the defendant went to the door of the workshop—he read the notice, as far as I could judge—there was a lamp about six feet from the door-way—after he had read the notice, he opened the door—two or three of his friends came, and after a short time, some water was fetched by a youth, and the notice was damped and taken off the door, by one of Mr. Pearce's friends—he gave it to Pearce—I don't think it had been torn at that time—the defendant and his friends went into the workshop, and closed the door—I then saw smoke issuing from the iron tube—they afterwards came out, and the defendant had a paper in his hand, similar to the notice—Nash was with me at that time, and during the time the notice was being taken down—we were both sober—I did not see the defendant again that evening—I saw him again on the 27th, about 7.30 in the evening, at the premises—he was there with his coat off, helping to load a van—I endea<lb/>voured to stop the goods from being removed—the defendant appealed to the parties present, and they tried to push the van on—he showed the notice, and said "Here is notice to leave, what am I to do; take the goods away or not?" and the parties there said "Go on, governor, we will give</p>

I live at 78, Great Suffolk Street, Borough, and am a tailor, and brother-in-law to the defendant—I know the workshop in Ebenezer Row—on 26th September I had some things there, being kept there by my brother-in-law—I went there about 7 o'clock on the evening of the 26th, with Mr. Corderoy and my son—we found Mr. Thomas Pearce, the defendant's brother, at the workshop—the defendant was not there then—I saw the witness Nash; he was quite drunk—the man Pearce had had a little to drink; but he was not so tipsy as Nash—there was a notice on the door of the workshop; I tore it down in pieces—I did not read it; but I thought it was a notice—I tore it down in bits—I believe it was put up with wafers—I went into the workshop—it was a chilly evening, and my son said "Let us make a fire"—I lit a match, and lit the paper, and lit the fire with it—the paper was burnt—the defendant had not come to the premises at that time—he came about an hour or an hour and a quarter after we got there—there was some furniture going to be removed that evening—I did not show the notice or read it to the defendant at all—I did not see him with any papers in his hand that evening—no water was brought out—there was no water there; we could not wash our hands—I don't think there was any water laid on.</p>
