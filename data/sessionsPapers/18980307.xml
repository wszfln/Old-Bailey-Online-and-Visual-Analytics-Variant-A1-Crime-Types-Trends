                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Rowlands of 38, Clinton Road, Mile End, and am a wardrobe dealer—on February 4th, about ten or eleven p.m., I was at the Little Driver's Arms—the prisoner, who I knew, was there with other men—he said that I was a b—y, <hi rend="italic">copper</hi> and clawed me with his hand and tore open my bosom and took my purse and my brooch—I had changed £7 and the change was in my purse—he tried to push me out, and took me by one arm—I said, "You have got my purse"—he made no reply, but went to the other end of the bar—I went out and fetched a policeman and gave him in charge—I suppose he knew where I kept my money, he knew where to find it, and my breast was all scratched.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were five or six men with him, I have seen some of them outside this morning—I have known him some time—I did not cut the top of his head open, nor did my husband. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner exhibited a scar on his head</hi>). I have only been married four years—I was not on this evening, drinking with a young woman in one compartment, nor did I leave and go into the compartment where the prisoner was, nor did he say, "You sha'nt pick another quarrel with me"—the landlady never asked me to go out, she said to the prisoner, "If my husband were here you would not say that"—when I came back with the policeman, I found the prisoner where I had left him—he did not say, "You have made a mistake, look on the ground"—that man (<hi rend="italic">Mills</hi>) was there and that man (<hi rend="italic">Barns</hi>)—I do not remember those two (<hi rend="italic">Roach and Gully</hi>)—I do not remember going into another compartment—we did not go out of one compartment and into another where the prisoner was—he told me to go out and I was not willing, I was waiting for my change—there was a scuffle between us, he got hold of me to put me out, and the landlady asked him to be quiet.</p>

I am the wife of John Charles Webb, the proprietor of this beer-house—on February 4th, about four o'clock, the prisoner and several men were in the bar—the prosecutrix came into the small bar—the prisoner was then in a different bar and she followed him there—I did not notice whether she was alone—she had some mild and bitter, but she went back to the small bar first and there was a scuffle—I asked her to go out and the prisoner opened the door try and get her out, but I did not see him touch her; she came back with a policeman and said that she had; lost her purse and brooch—I only saw the prisoner's hand taking hold of her shoulder to put her out—they were all struggling together—I did not hear her mention the brooch before she went for a constable—I did not</p>

I am a horse clipper, of 29, Albert Street, Mile End—on February 4th, I went to the Little Driver's public-house—I am not exactly a customer, I use it, I go in there for a drink at times—I have known the prisoner four or five years, I was in his company in that house with Ritchie, Burns and Gulley—the first I saw of Mrs. Rowlands was that Horncastle was pushing her out at the door, and he had hold of the door and said, "We don't want you in our company," and pushed her out, but there was a fight first—I did not see her in another compartment, but I heard that she was there—she came into the compartment by herself, when the prisoner pushed her out—she did not say anything that I heard—she came back in three or four minutes with a constable, and her neck all open, which she had not when she went out—she said to the constable, "I accuse this man with assault and robbing me of £13 Is and a brooch;" the prisoner said, "You have made a mistake, if you have lost anything, look on the floor," or something to that effect, she did not make any reply to that, but walked away, and we all sat in the house till it closed—the policeman said, "You will have to come with me," and took him away—if he bad taken the purse from her neck we must certainly have seen it—the bar is email—I was about one yard from him, when she was turned out, and I saw nothing of the kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My attention was first attracted to Mrs. Rowlands when I heard the prisoner say, "We don't want you in our company," and saw Horncastle pushing her out—I had been at the back to the urinal—I saw no struggle before that—I was only out for about two minutes, and after my return she came in—there was no female in the bar when I went out, but there was when I came back—if there had been a slight struggle while I was out, I should not have seen it—Mrs. Webb would have a better opportunity of seeing it, but if she says that the woman's dress was torn at the neck, she is speaking false—I did not hear Mrs. Rowlands make any remark about losing anything—I have known the prisoner four or five years—I was not called at the police-court—I was present when he was arrested—I went to the court, but did not give any</p>

I work for the Mile End Vestry—I have known the prisoner four or five years—I was in the Little Driver's public-house on February 4th, and saw Mrs. Rowlands—I saw her first go into the private bar and another woman with her—there was a quarrel between the prisoner and a man in the public bar, and she came out of the private into the public bar—they challenged one another to fight, and went out<lb/>side for about two minuites and came back, and the prosecutrix followed them in, she stood among eight or nine men and said to the prisoner, "I don't want nothing to say to you, and I don't want you in my company,"—the proprietress said, "If the governor was here, you would not have come among these men"—the prisoner said "Go out," and caught hold of her by her shoulder and pushed her out: to everybody's surprise she came back four, five, or six minutes afterwards with a constable and said, "I charge this man with taking £13 Is and a gold brooch," she did not mention a parse—the constable said, "Where was your money?"—she said, "In a purse"—the prisoner said "If you have lost your purse look on the floor for it,"—the prisoner was taken to the station.—I went to the police-court next morning, Mr. Dickinson was sitting then and the case was remanded for a week—the next week Mr. Corser was sitting and the case was began afresh—if the prisoner had taken the purse from the woman's neck I must have seen it, and if he had passed it to somebody else I must have seen that too—I have been working for the Vestry five years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Assistant Divisional Surgeon, and live at 41, Glengall Road—I attended the deceased man on February 5th—I saw him about seven—he was lying on the pavement insensible, and bleeding profusely from a wound on the left side of the head—he was almost pulseless—on his recovering a little I asked him where he lived, and found it was only across the road—I superintended his removal there, and washed and dressed his wounds—the left eye was quite closed and rapidly becoming discoloured—there was another small wound on the most prominent part of the back of the head—he also had concussion of the brain—in my opinion he died of compression of the brain, due to a fracture of the skull, dividing an artery on the left side, and to laceration on the right side, and rupture of a vessel on the right side—he died on February 23rd—I subsequently made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and found that the wound for which I had treated him had quite healed—I found a fracture extending for about four inches on the left side, running backwards and forwards—afterwards I found a fracture from a point on the top of the head to the ear, and I found it again inside the skull, in the middle fossa at the base—that was probably caused by the fall on the pavement—I found three small clots on the right side of the brain, but no laceration of the brain substance—I found a clot on the left side of the brain, and another on the right side of the brain, between the membranes of the brain and the brain itself—in my opinion the cause of death was compression of the brain from the rupture of arteries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not attend before the Coroner—I did not hear a man named Shannon examined—the brain was in a diseased condition—there were three clots of blood in the brain substance, and one outside the brain—that would have something to do with the cause of death, I mean that the large clot is what I should call the counter-stroke—that clot might have been caused otherwise than by a fracture—if the brain is in a diseased condition the blood vessels are much more likely to be ruptured—excitement will sometimes cause the blood vessels to rupture—sometimes in a prize-fight the fighting may cause the rupture of a blood vessel—if a man be over 40 years of age and not of temperate habits, ex<lb/>citement by itself will produce profusion of blood on the brain—when I picked the deceased up he had a smell of alcohol—I examined his heart—the liver was normal—the right lung was very much congested—he was a strong, well-built man—in a fight I should think the deceased would be the better man—he was not so fat—the statement I heard Mrs. Browning make was, "My poor husband got up during the night and fell down and struck the bad"—I did not hear her say that he had fallen out of bed.</p>

               <p>Kayser is assistant managing director—at Easter, 1897, I became acquainted with Mr. Pearson at the Palace Hotel, Buxton—<hi rend="italic">I</hi> was led to believe he was A partner because he gave me a card of R.

Smith <hi rend="italic">&amp;</hi> Company, Throg<lb/>morton Avenue as his business card—on October 18th I wrote to Pearson, addressing the letter to that address, with an order to buy £5,000 Midland Preferred Railway Stock, and stating that my brother might want £2,000 more for himself—I got this telegram signed "Pearson" in reply, stating that he had bought £5,000 Midland at 881/4 and that Market Trusts he could sell at 23 and 9 fully paid—that was followed by this letter of October 19th from Pearson enclosing contracts for £5,000 Midland 2 1/2 per cent.

B. Smith &amp; Co"—I also received this letter of October 22nd, enclosing a contract for the sale of 1,000 shares in West Australians from Pearson—both col tracts are for settlement on October 28th—on 23rd I wrote this letter, enclosing two certificates for 500 shares each in West Australians, giving the numbers and registering the letter—I received this letter of October 25th acknowledging receipt and stating, "As there may be some difficulty in being able to deliver thpse shares for a few days I shall esteem it a personal favour if you will oblige us with a cheque or cheques for the enclosed statements"—the statements shewed that £4,447 8s. 6d. was due from me for Midland Stock—the letter also stated: "We will forward cheque for West Australian Joint Stocks immediately we get them through"—on October 26th, Pearson wrote me, with transfers of West Australians to fill up, which I executed and returned, and on 27th sent him this cheque in this letter, which was registered, and which states: "Dear Mr. Pearson,—Your two letters of 25th and 26th to hand.

Please have the account discharged and returned to me, so that it can be passed into firm's books. <hi rend="italic">Re</hi> West Australian Joint Stock Trust and Finance, I enclose the two transfers duly executed.

Smith &amp; Co., or Order"—it is endorsed "R. B.

B. Smith and Co.," stating that Mr. Pearson was absent from illness, and on 29th another stating that he was still unwell—on December 1st I wrote to the firm thanking them for their letter of 29th, and hoping Mr. Pearson was getting better again, and asking for a cheque for the 1,000 West Joints—I got the reply on December 3rd, signed "R. B. Smith and Co.," stating that Mr. Pearson was still away—I then wrote this letter of December 6th, (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had written to Mr. Pearson at his private residence, he had received no reply</hi>) I was still under the impression that Mr. Pearson was a partner—on the 7th I received this letter from Mr. Pearson, stating that he would explain the matter—on the 9th I wrote to him at his private address, and afterwards put the matter into the hands of my solicitor—I never got more than 4,000 out of my 5,000 Midland Stock—I never realized one penny from the West Australian Stock—the amount is £3,682—I have had notice that the defendant has become bankrupt.</p>

I am a prisoner undergoing a sentence of 18 months' hard labour, which was passed upon me in September last for the share which I took in the restitution of these pawntickets to the prosecutor on the night of December 23rd, 1896—I pleaded guilty in May—I have known the prisoner between five and six years—he has gone under other names than Cliburn—one name was Harris—I knew him in the Spring of 1895, when the case of Lord Queensberry was tried, Mr. Oscar Wilde being the prosecutor—during that trial I left London in company with the prisoner, whom I knew intimately from that time until December, 1896—I saw him almost daily—I knew where he was living in the Fulham Road—I was then living at Severhurst Road, Clapham Junction—on the evening of December 21st, 1896, I was in Vigo Street, Piccadilly, with the prisoner—we met Marling and the two brothers, <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi> Woollams—we all went into a public-house at the corner of Vigo Street and Sackville Street—there Marling proposed a drink, and there was conversation between us—the prisoner took part in it—Marling asked me to go and see Mr. Dick in reference to some pawntickets which he showed me, with a view to selling them to Mr. Dick—I saw that the tickets referred to a watch and chain and a fur coat, or else a pin—there were three tickets, but one I did not get till afterwards—Marling's name was on them—he said he pawned the articles for a man named Saunders—I did not know Saunders at that time—he called him <hi rend="italic">Cloggy</hi>—I said I did not care to have anything to do with it—that was in the street going to the public-house—but afterwards, when Marling asked me to have a drink, he said he had heard I was hard-up, and that it would be a way to get myself a little money—I eventually arranged to go—he said if I did not choose to go he would soon get someone else—he said if I did not choose to go he would take the tickets to Mr. Barnard Abrahams, of 22, Great Marlborough Street, and no doubt he would get some money for them—I do not know that Marling mentioned the street—at the time I was very hard up, and I said to Marling I felt very desperate and would do anything to get money, and that is why I arranged to go—he said Saunders had another pawnticket and also a visiting card—he said he would see Saunders and make an appoint<lb/>ment for him to give me the ticket and the visiting card—before I left him an appointment was made to see Marling the next day, who was living in Castle Street, East, at the back of the Princess' Theatre—I agreed with Allen to keep the appointment, and we went our own different ways—I went with the prisoner—the appointment was for twelve o'clock the next day—I met the prisoner the next morning at the Queen's Head at the end of Burlington Arcade between one and two p.m.—we walked along Regent Street towards Marlines Place in Castle Street, East—when we got there Marling was out—later that same afternoon we met him—Marling asked me why I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189803070049"/>
               <p>had not kept the appointment—I said that I had been to his place but that I was late and found him out—he said he had an appointment with Saunders at the Cambrian in Glasshouse Street, and he was going to meet him about 6.30 or seven p.m.—he asked me to accompany him, and I did so with the prisoner and Marling—we waited some time at the Cambrian before Saunders and his brother-in-law, Robert Hine, turned up—I have never seen Saunders before—Marling knew him—a conversation took place which the prisoner heard—Marling told Saunders I was the man that would go and see Mr. Dick—then there was some talk as to how much I should ask Mr. Dick for the tickets, and it was arranged I should ask for £10—Saunders said he had forgotten to bring the pawn tickets and visiting card with him, so he sent his brother-in-law who went and got them, Saunders, Marling and the prisoner remaining in the porch of the Cambrian—we afterwards went and had a drink in the Cambrian and talked about the visit to Mr. Dick, and it was arranged that the money should be divided between Marling, Saunders, and myself equally, and that I was to go to Mr. Dick the next-morning—Marling then gave me 12 pawntickets which he had before shewn me—I then went to keep the appointment, leaving the prisoner and Saunders in the bar having made an appointment to go to Saunders" place at twelve o'clock after seeing Mr. Dick—the brother-in-law was away three-quarters of an hour when he brought the other pawnticket and the visiting card and gave them to Saunders—they were in a pocket book—Saunders handed them to me and we left and walked towards Leicester Square where we parted with Hine and Saunders—I went to the Empire Theatre with the prisoner we talked about the tickets—I said I thought I should ask him for £20 and perhaps I might get £10—I was then in the prisoner's debt about £5—we arranged to meet at Victoria Station at 8.30 or nine on December 23rd—the next morning I came from Clapham Junction to Victoria and walked towards Ebury Bridge where I met the prisoner who got down from an omnibus—we went to 115, St. George's Road—I got the address from the visiting card which Saunders gave me—he stopped at the corner of the block while I went on to 115 and saw Mr. Dick—I think in the dining-room we had a conversation and made an appointment for seven that evening outside the Underground Station at Charing Cross—I then left the house and rejoined the prisoner—I made a circuit and came round behind him and beckoned to him when he joined me and I told him the result of my interview with Mr. Dick—I told him of the appointment and that I would pay him part of the money I owed him if I got £10 from Mr. Dick—we then took a 'bus from Victoria to Bond Street and walked to Great Marlborough Street—the prisoner left me to go into Mr. Bernard Abrahams' office—I know the office very, well—I have been there often—I know Mr. Abrahams—the prisoner said, "I am going to get Abrahams to advance me a little money to get over Christmas"—I remained outside till he rejoined me—I believe Mr. Abrahams was out—the prisoner was away from me only a short time before he rejoined me—we then weak to Marling, in Castle Street East—we saw Marling and Saunders, and Bob Woollams, and told them of the arrangement with Mr. Dick and the hour of the appointment—these men had no occupation—I knew how</p>

               <p>they got their living—we arranged to meet at the Cambrian, in Glass-house Street, a little before seven—we all met there—we went up the staircase on to Hungerford Bridge—I left the four on the bridge when I went down to where I could see up Villiers Street—I saw Mr. Dick coming down Villiers Street with someone, and I went back to the others on the bridge, and told them I did not care about the look of the thing—I said I thought he was a detective—the prisoner and Bob Woollams came down to see who was with Mr. Dick—after some little time they returned up the staircase and I went down to meet them—they said, "That is Gregory, the actor, who is with him"—I said, "Oh, I don't care for him, I'll go down and see Mr. Dick"—then I went down the staircase to where Mr. Dick was standing—he spoke to me and we walked away together—Mr. Gregory was then standing on the steps at the station about 25 yards from where I was with Mr. Dick—after a short conversation with Mr. Dick I left him for a short time and then returned to him—during that interval Bob Woollams and the prisoner said while I was speaking to Mr. Dick, someone, who Woollams said he was pretty sure was a detective, came and looked hard at both of us, meaning at both me and Mr. Dick, and that they bad a good mind to come and tell me to clear off—then they left me and I returned to Mr. Dick—I gave him the pawntickets and card-case and he gave me £10 in gold—when Mr. Dick left me I joined the prisoner and Woollams, who were on the Embankment within my sight—Marling and Saunders then came up to us—they were on the bridge and the five of us went to a little public-house <hi rend="italic">off</hi> the Strand—we walked round by the Hotel Cecil—it is in a passage leading to the Strand—drinks were called for, and there was a division of the £10 which I had received from Mr. Dick—I paid for the drinks out of one sovereign and divided the remainder between Marling, Saunders and myself—we each had £3 and some odd shillings, and the remaining 2s. went in drinks—the prisoner drank—Saunders suggested that we should give Woollams and the prisoner some two or three shillings as they we understood not to have any money at the time—we gave them 2s. each—that kind of division is customary provided our friends are hard up whenever we were successful in getting anything—the sum depended upon what we got by blackmailing—we got money by blackmailing—all those I have spoken of £ot money in that way—I never knew them do anything else—I include the prisoner—that had been going on for some years—these men belong to one section of Blackmailers—I knew Coulton, Andrew Grant, and Albert Edward Thorpe as getting their living in that way—we were all one gang—that was another section—we left the little public-house talking about what had occurred—we walked as far as the Telegraph Office at Charing Cross, where the prisoner and I left the other three—we got on to an omnibus where I gave the prisoner part of the money I owed him—I think it was 25s. or 30s.—that was out of the money I received from Mr. Dick—in January, 1897, the prisoner told me that Marling had been arrested—he came to my rooms in the Severhurst Road on a Tuesday morning—the day after Marling was before the Magistrate—I was in bed—the prisoner asked me if I had heard the news—I asked him "what news"—he said "Marling is pinched"—I told him Mr. Dick had said he had been to the police—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189803070051"/>
               <p>said "They have taken Marling"—Mr. Dick did tell me that he had been to the police—the prisoner said "McCarthy has got him"—I knew McCarthy as a police inspector—he said he had been arrested at the New Inn on the Sunday night—that is a place frequented by blackmailers—then I said I thought it was time for me to clear off and said "I suppose they will want me next"—he said he was of the same opinion—then I said I was going to clear off—I got up and dressed myself—I had a lot of papers and things connected with what I had been doing, blackmailing men—I asked him if he would take care of them for me as I was going to leave my rooms in case the police came there to look for me and I handed them over to him—I have never seen them since—I left the house in his company and we went to Wandsworth Road station—on the way we arranged that I should be known as "Edge"—that is a name which is generally used when you make yourself scarce—I said I should go to Birmingham, and that he was to write to me at the post-office there—he went with me to the station and saw me in the train, and I went to Birmingham—I called at the post-office there and got letters from the prisoner, addressed to me in the name of "Edge"—he wrote me two or three times a week—I destroyed the letters—in that correspondence I learnt of the arrest of Saunders—I afterwards heard of the fate of Saunders and Marling—I went from Birmingham to Kilsby, near Rugby—I replied to the prisoner's letters at Kilsby—I was arrested by the superintendent of police at Daventry on April 2nd, 1897—McCarthy was communicated with, and on April 3rd I was brought up by McCarthy to Gerrard Road, and afterwards taken before a Magistrate at Westminster, and committed for trial here on April 8th—between my committal and the trial I was confined at Holloway—the prisoner came there to see me—I found a letter awaiting me at the prison saying he would come—I wrote him from Daventry after my arrest, and I had sent to him from Gerrard Road to come and see me—when he cime he seemed annoyed—he said his name was mentioned and that the police had been to his place—he said his name was in the papers—he said he had been to see a solicitor—Mr. Bernard Abrahams—and that both he and Abrahams were of opinion that it was best for me to keep out of the way—he did not say he was not going to do anything of the kind exactly, but I judged that he meant to clear off—he then owed me about £7, the balance having turned the other way—he said he would send the money to my wife—I was committed for trial, and tried on May 5th—after having heard the opening statement I pleaded guilty, and remained for sentence till September—after I had pleaded guilty I saw McCarthy in Newgate, in consequence of my applying to the warder, and I made a voluntary statement, which McCarthy reduced to writing—I was put back for that purpose—I afterwards made another voluntary statement on May 15th at Holloway, which was also reduced to writing, and at Pentonville I made a third statement to Mr. Wallis in McCarthy's presence, which was taken down by Mr. Wallis, a solicitor—at Holloway I also saw a man, whom I did not know, who was discharged from this Court, and who promised to come and see me, and he came twice—I also, saw Mr. Holloway—Mr. Abraham's chief clerk—that was after I had pleaded guilty—I had seen Mr. Holloway when before the Magistrate—</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I never heard that the £7 Cliburn owed to me was paid to my wife for my defence—I saw Mr. Wallis at Holloway once and three times at Pentonville in reference to my making a statement in this case—I pleaded guilty in May and was not sentenced till September—I do not know why—Marling's and Saunders' sentences were five years, mine was eighteen months—on account of my making statements, I suppose, his Lordship told me he would take it into consideration if I assisted the police—I was endeavouring to screen the prisoner and Mr. Abrahams when McCarthy came and said I was not the only person making a statement, and that he had been to Chelmsford—I was reluctant to do anything about it—I made a statement incriminating the prisoner—I knew Mr. Dick had been blackmailed—I did not consider it blackmailing, selling pawntickets—I thought it would be to his advan<lb/>tage—I did not consider the prisoner was risking his liberty—I do not know why he went with me to Mr. Dick, except it was to get part of the money I owed him—if he had not gone I would probably have paid him the next day—I am not a convict—I am undergoing eighteen months' hard labour—I did not tell the prisoner to clear out—I did not think that was necessary—I have destroyed the letters the prisoner wrote me—I do not recollect writing asking him why he did not come to see me, nor writing "Why have you deserted me?"—I wrote to him from police-station at Daventry—it did not occur to me that was entrapping him—I did not think it would do any harm—I am sure Mr. Dick gave me £10—he did not haggle me down to £5—I first asked him for £20—I said I told Mr. Dick that Saunders thought he ought to give me £20,. but I think I suggested £10—both Saunders and Marling said, "It is all right, it is Gregory, the actor"—we were standing together and the prisoner must have heard the conversation in the public-house at the corner of Sackville Street—I said at the police-court, "I will not swear that he heard all that passed, he may be deaf, and all sorts of things"—I do not know whether he said anything, he was standing there all the time—I daresay he said something, but I cannot recollect any sentence—I did not hear him say he would not have anything to do with the matter—he did not stand aside during the conversation—he was not to reap any advantage.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I saw Mr. Wallis—he was accompanied at Holloway by Inspector Downs and at Pentonville by Inspector McCarthy, and the third occasion was in the presence of the principal warder—since my sentence in September last I have been in Pentonville—between my plea and sentence I was at Holloway—I have not had an opportunity of seeing or speaking to Saunders since his conviction, except that I saw him pass my cell here, but not to speak to—no communication has passed between us since the date of his conviction, and now I did want to screen the prisoner—I had known him a long time; that was my chief reason—I did not want to say anything about Mr. Bernard Abrahams, I had known him nine years—I had visited his office—I should say he must have known my calling.</p>

                  </hi>. I am undergoing a sentence of five years penal servitude for robbery from the person of Mr. Dick, on the evening of December 19th, 1896, of a scarf pin, watch and chain, a fur-lined coat containing a card case and visiting cards, and a small sum of money—I was then living at 16, Lyons Place, Edgware Road—I left the property at that address on that Saturday night—the next morning I was walking with my family when I met Arthur Marling who came out of the New Inn—I told my wife to walk on and Marling spoke to me—I only knew him once before—in the result he told me to meet him at Castle Street East next morning—I kept that appointment with my brother-in-law—I took the property there and had a conversation with Marling—I handed him the property at his place—I then went away to get something to eat, after that I returned to Marling's—I afterwards went by omnibus with my brother-in-law to Victoria—we went into a public-house where Marling left us, taking away the jewellery—he rejoined us a short time afterwards and handed me the proceeds of pawning the jewellery and the ticket for the watch and chain and scarf pin and I handed him the money for pawning them—he took me into another public-house—he afterwards brought me the proceeds of pawning the coat and the ticket and he had his share of that—a man Bob Woollams whom Marling kept was waiting for him at the public-house I was going to tear the tickets up but Marling said, "You needn't do that, you may as well give me the tickets"—I said "No"—but he said "Don't do that," and I gave him two, and he said if I would bring him the card and the other ticket by to-morrow night, he would give me £2 for that and the card-case with the cards—then he told me to meet him at the Glasshouse public-house, Regent Street—then I left him and Bob Woollams—I did not trouble about the appointment, but I was. walking up Regent Street by accident when I met Cliburn, Allen,. Marling, and Bob Woollams—my brother-in-law was still with me—Marling asked me whether I had got the ticket—I said, "No, let it drop, I do not want to have anything more to do with it"—he said, "I brought the fellows up to buy the ticket"—and he took—me, Cliburn, Woollams and Allen to this public-house—Marling asked me to go home and fetch them, as I had left them at home—we had some conversation—the prisoner was present—I had only known Marling by speaking to him once—the prisoner and Allen said, "Why don't you go and get it, you may as well have £2 as chuck the tickets away and waste them"—I then asked if they had the £2 to give me then—they said, "No"—I said, "Do you think I am going to run home to benefit you?"—then they asked my brother-in-law, to ask, Hine, and we went into the public-house and had a lot of conversation and some drink—I did not know all they were saying—I did not trouble to listen—the prisoner was there all the time—my brother-in-law was away more than half an hour—he said he could not find them, the children had trodden them about—after an interval Hine returned with the ticket and the card-case and cards, which were given to Allen—they had been trodden on and damaged—Allen turned to Cliburn and Woollams and said quietly," These will fetch us a £50 note"—then Cliburn and Allen said "You can meet us here tomorrow night"—Allen was the actual spokesman—they told me to</p>

                  </hi> (167 <hi rend="italic">G</hi>). On Sunday morning, February 13th, I was on duty from about two to 2.10 in Lady Margaret's Road. I heard screams coming from down the road—I went in that direction, and I saw Mrs. Norris—she was in her nightdress, screaming in the road—she had this revolver in her hand—she gave it to me and made a statement—I took her into No. 93, Mr. Clifford's—I didn't notice the state her nightdress was in—Mr. Clifford accompanied me into No. 95, and we proceeded to a room on the second floor—the door was locked—I tried to open it, and said, "Will you open the door?"—the reply was, "Go away"—I said, What is the cause of this disturbance?—will you open the door?"—the reply was, "I cannot; I have cut my throat"—I then forced open the door, and saw the prisoner lying on the floor bleeding pro<lb/>fusely and in a pool of blood—a bloody razor was lying on the table—I took possession of it, and produce it—this is the revolver which Mrs. Norris gave to me—the pool of blood was caused by two cuts in Mr. Norris' throat—I called a cabman who was passing, and sent for a doctor—Dr. Wilson came, and by his advice I took the prisoner to the Great Northern Hospital—the revolver was loaded with six cartridges—two had been discharged—I searched the prisoner at the hospital, and found on him a box of cartridges which corresponded with those in the revolver—I handed the revolver over to Inspector Tomkins.</p>

I am an actor, and live at 93, Lady Margaret's Road—on the early morning of February 13th I heard screams from next door, No. 95—they were screams of a female—I immediately dressed myself and went downstairs—I saw Mrs. Norris standing in the street in her nightdress—the constable was there with her—I saw blood on the shoulder of her nightdress—I took her into my house—I then accompanied the constable</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The house to which I took Mrs. Norris was the prisoner's sister's—I had retired to bed about twelve—I was aroused by the screams between two or half-past—I think I tried the door before the constable—I should think he could hear the words used as well as I—I did not hear the prisoner say, when asked to open the door, "I cant; I've cut my throat"—I entered the house twice, first to get the boy out—I took him to his mother, and returned—the constable remained in the house—I had not then found where the prisoner was—the boy's cot was at the side of the bed in the front room—I realize the difference between what I heard and what the constable has said—I believed that the prisoner had shot his wife, from having seen her in the street.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S., B.M., Master of Surgery. I reside at 7, Dartmouth Park Road—on Sunday, February 13th, about 3.30, I was called to 93, Lady Margaret Road—I there found Mrs. Norris lying on a couch—I noticed some blood on her nightdress, and a small wound behind her ear—after a little while I took her to the prisoner's sister's house and dressed the wound—I afterwards saw her about eleven and made an examination of her—I came to the conclusion that there was a bullet in the wound behind the ear, and on Monday afternoon I extracted it—it was in about half an inch deep, and was such a wound as might be caused by a bullet from this revolver—it was lodged in the hard bony substance behind the ear—I think I can safely say that she is now out of danger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The wound is almost healed now—I have known Mr. and Mrs. Norris about 12 years—I have attended them professionally—I'm able to say that they have lived together on most affectionate terms—I know it from my own observations—I have attended Mr. Norris professionally—I don't remember being consulted about his want of sleep—my partner has visited at the house—I did not attend to the wound in the throat—I merely called as a friend of the family, and to tell his mother how he was—I saw him several times after as a friend—on the Sunday I found him in a wild irrational condition—he was also in that condition on the Monday—that was not a delirium resulting from the wound—overwork does tend to unhinge a man's mind, especially if accompanied by want of sleep—it is almost always so—when I find a person living on affectionate terms with his wife commit such a deadly act it does suggest that the mind must be unhinged—the condition in which I found him on Sunday and Monday tends to support that view—I've since seen the wounds—there were four separate ones—two were deep and two superficial.</p>

                  </hi>. I am divisional surgeon and live at Rom<lb/>ford Road, Forest Gate—on January 24th I examined the prisoner at the police-station—he was under the influence of drink and very excited—on the next day I saw Constable Hill at the West Ham Hospital—he was suffering from a wound below the right ear from which there was a dis<lb/>charge, and a discoloration round the wound, as if from a weapon fired close—we have up to now been unable to extract the bullet, but there is no doubt that a bullet is there, and it is proposed to do something—we have photographed the bullet and think it is in the upper jaw, somewhere in the neighbourhood of the nose—it went in behind and has gone for<lb/>ward, but it is thoroughly imbedded in the upper jaw—there is consider<lb/>able reason to fear that, even if the bullet is removed, he will suffer from facial paralysis, and may have permanent injury.</p>

It would depend a good deal on the strength of the powder behind what structures it would go through—the bullet has gone immediately above the palate—there is undoubtedly a broken bone—it could not have got there without breaking a bone—it has entered the upper jaw from the back—it has traversed the upper jaw without meeting any hard bone—the real difficulty is in locating it—the photograph shows that he has an injury to the nose and mouth—if it is in its proper shape it will be less difficult to extract it than if it is flattened out.</p>

I am married—I live at 48, Martin Road, Custom House—I have a grown-up son, George Carvell, who lives in the house—he will be 19 in August—previous to the 20th February I had been living with the prisoner for between five and six years—at 1.30 p.m. that day I was still in bed—I was sober, but was suffering from the prisoner's ill usage on the Saturday—the prisoner came in—my son was sitting by the fire—the prisoner said, "Are you going to get up?"—I said, "When I am ready"—he said, "I will give you 10 minutes to get up"—he went to the coal box and got the paraffin bottle and sprinkled it all on the bed—half-pint was in the bottle—he took a box of matches from his brown, coat pocket and set light to it—he got a sheet of paper and lit it by the fire and put that on the bed—he stood with his back against the front room door and defied anyone to go out—my son got up from the fire-place, walked across the room—the prisoner said, "You are not going out of here, all in here is going to be burnt"—I had not seen him since 7.30 p.m.—he had been drinking heavily all the week—other people were in the house up and down stairs—ours is the front top room—the fire was put out by Day, the lodger in the back room—the bed was half burnt, and the mattress and other things and the floor was scorched—when Gibbens would not allow my son to go out my son got the poker and struck Gibbens with it when he saw me in flames—I do not know whether my husband is alive, I have not seen him for four years—I was left with a family of children, and have worked for them and the prisoner, and could put a loaf on the table for his loaf—I feel ashamed and people blame me, but I stick to my children, and will a little longer.</p>
