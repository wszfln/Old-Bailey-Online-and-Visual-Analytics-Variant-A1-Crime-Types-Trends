               <p>29, Finsbury Circus—Mr. McCarty, of Athens, is a client of ours—he has a son, Alexander McCarty, who is in London now, and was on May 1st—I remember the boy messenger coming on that day, and giving me an envelope, which contained a draft on us for £25, to the order of Alexander McCarty—it was unendorsed and unstamped—I gave him a verbal answer, and returned him the cheque—in the course of the afternoon the prisoner came and produced this cheque for payment—it was in the same condition—I told him it must be endorsed if he wanted the money for it—he talked English—I gave him another document, marked "B," which I attached to the one marked "A," and required him to endorse it as it now appears—this is a crossed cheque—I believe he said it was no use, as he had no banking account—as it had to go through a bank and he wanted the money, he endorsed the original cheque—the draft attached to that order does not require endorsement—the original requires endorsement—he endorsed them both—I gave him a cheque then to the cashiers of the Bank of England for £25—I retained Exhibits A and B after I gave him cash—I am certain the prisoner is the man who endorsed this cheque—he did it at our counter.</p>

Caudrillier knew that he had no daughter, and the other did not reply—the prisoner said the money was to be paid in advance, as it was usual in France to pay for one year—he said the money had been paid to his brother-in-law, M. Caudrillier, who would send it to him—on Thursday, March 12, I received a letter from France containing some promissory notes—I told the prisoner the letter had come addressed to Cunnington and I had opened it, did he know anything about them; there was no letter inside; it was registered—the prisoner said they were for him; he Said that they were notes that he had received for the money for the pupils, and some of his own as well—he said he could not have the notes unless the money had been deposited for him already—he sat down and rilled in four or five of the notes with signatures; he signed "Caudrillier"—I only examined two of them; they amounted to £40, I think—I asked him how he could use his brother-in-law's name, and he said he had empowered him to do so—I asked him why he did not fill in all the notes—he asked me to do so; I refused—this note (No. 10) I saw him fill up to my brother; "Mons. Joseph Cunnington"—he asked me if my brother would see about his changing his money in Eng<lb/>land, because there was some difficulty about it—I said I was sure my brother would—the prisoner went to London by the mid-day express; he told me he was going to see my brother—he returned in the evening, and said he had seen my brother, but he did not say anyone else, that I re<lb/>member—the next day my brother came down to Devizes—I saw him give the prisoner a £200 Bank of England note—at this time the prisoner was very anxious to be married at once, and on January 23th I signed a marriage contract, which the prisoner wrote out</p>

                  </hi> I am a labourer, of 26, Kimber Street, Drury Lane—on Saturday, May 20th, I received my wages, and between. I and 2 o'clock I went to the Grapes public-house. Sardinia Street—the prisoners did not come in, to my knowledge, while I was there, but I went to the urinal at the back of the house, and Leonard followed me, and as I came back Donovan hit me with his firs 3 times and blacked my eyes, and Lyons put his hand in my trousers pocket and took my week's money, all in silver—Waller kicked me and took a piece out of my leg, which bled—I did not go to a doctor, but I am lame now—I drew a knife from my pocket, and stood in self-defence—Lyons tried to catch me round the body, and ran against the knife and cut himself after my money was taken—Waller tried to take the knife out of my hand, and cut to of his fingers—they went into the house and shut the door, and I got over a low wall to escape, and found the police, who took me to the station; and I told the police in the prisoners' presence that they had taken my money—I was perfectly sober; I had only had one glass of beer.</p>

I am a jobber and member of the House—I met the prisoner at the House on April 24th—he said, "What are Ivanhoes?"—I said, "They are 12 1/16 to 3/16"—he said he wished to<lb/>deal, and I asked him, "How many?"—he said £200, but he was unable to give over 1/8 for them—I sold him the shares at 12£—I said, "What name?"—he said, "Francis"—I said, "What initial?"—he said either "R. 6." or "A. G."—I booked them, leaving out the initial till I could "fish" it out next day—the indebtedness for the 200 shares was £2,42—I tried to check the bargain the next day, but was unsuccessful—I took up the shares on settling day at a loss of about £175—on the 19th I went, with other members of the House who had suffered, to the seeretary's office—I saw the prisoner there.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Peters, 16 Cox, p. 40); secondly, that there was, in fast, no contract between the prosecutors and the prisoner, as the misrepresentation alleged vxis as to the identity of the party to the supposed contract (see Lindsey v. Cundy, L. R. 3, Appeal Cases, p. 465); and further: that if any credit at all was given it was given not to the defendant, but to thepersons named by him, viz, Watts, Francis and Chambers.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ABRAHAMS</hi> contended that any credit obtained by false pre<lb/>tences was sufficient to bring this case within the section.

I am a grocer, of 2, Pinball Street, Camberwell—I know Canterbury Road there; it is three-quarters of a mile from Asylum Road, Peckham, and a few minutes' walk from me—on May 10th, about 9.1.5, I served the prisoner with a half-ounce of tobacco—he gave me a bad half-crown—I walked round the counter and shut him in. because he passed a bad 5s.<lb/>piece on me about 4 months ago, and I recognised him as soon as he came into the shop—I told him of his pre<lb/>vious visit—he said, "I think you are mistaken"—I gave him in custody—this is my tobacco (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>).</p>

I found some money there"—he said, "Oh, that is a rumour"—I said, "I saw it"—he spoke as if he did not know it was there—he had not said anything that evening to me about having lost any gold—between April 29th and the following Thurs<lb/>day his wife came and asked me for his coat, and I went to the Duke of Edinburgh to get it, and took it to her—there was no money in it then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of petroleum, employed by the London County Council—I went to 69, Cornwall Road, on April 25th, and in a room on the second floor I examined some traces of fire—I saw a small chair-bedstead, and above it I saw on the wall marks of fire, as from burning oil—about 2 feet from the centre of the bed I found a piece of a broken lamp—on the floor under the bed also a small oil can, containing some oil—I took away a sample—it is petroleum, known as American Tea Rose—the flash point is 78 deg. F.—the legal flash point is 73—I then went to Kennington Road Station, where I saw another portion of a lamp, which I took to be of the same lamp—it is a very common lamp—the reservoir would hold just over a pint if it was full—it would bum for about 14 hours if it was full—very nearly half had been consumed at the time of the accident—the marks on the wall were caused by the burning oil—I did not notice the burnt mantel-board.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I understood that the lamp had burnt about 6 hours—it would hold a little over a pint, and if it had been burning 6 hours it would have just a little over half a pint in it—if, in a struggle between 2 intoxicated persons and another who was trying to separate them, the lamp had been struck with sufficient force to drive it from the table against the wall, it would have produced the marks—it is a tiny little room.</p>
