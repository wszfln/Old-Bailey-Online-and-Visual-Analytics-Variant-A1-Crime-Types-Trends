               <p>Q. Did he give you the watch again?</p>

            , sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any thing?</p>
               <p>Stead. Yes, I lost my husband's watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it when you lost it?</p>
               <p>Stead. In a room up two pair of stairs, where I lay sick.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who took it?</p>
               <p>Stead. Yes, the prisoner took it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that he took it?</p>
               <p>Stead. He came and asked, whether there was not a sailor's wife lived there, and said he had forgot her name? The nurse that was with me, told him, yes, and that her name was Stead; he said he came from Capt. Johnson in Soho-square, who had brought a letter from the West-Indies from her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any thing?</p>
               <p>Stead. If your lordship pleases, I'll tell you. I was very ill; he said he had not the letter then , but would bring it the next day; he went out, and came back again in half an hour, and said the Capt. will not be easy till he sees you. I said I could not go, for I was so ill that I could not tell what to do; I said I would send somebody with him, and he said it was too late; but I ordered the nurse to go with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it?</p>
               <p>Stead. About half an hour after eight at night; I got off the bed , and saw the watch hanging up; he sidled up to the chimney-piece, and put one hand up, with his handkerchief in it, to his face, to hide what he was doing, and the other he put up to the watch; he had a sort of bundle in his breast, and I was afraid he had got pistols, and that he would shoot me; then he took the watch, and said your servant madam, and run down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the watch again?</p>
               <p>Stead. No, nor I never saw the prisoner till he went before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that?</p>
               <p>Stead. The day that Mrs. Jones took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see the watch in the room while I was there?</p>
               <p>Stead . Yes: I went to Newgate to see him, and found him out among the prisoners, tho' he was in disguise: I asked him concerning the watch, but he would not tell me where the watch was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had I the same cloaths on then as I have now?</p>
               <p>Stead. No; you had a duffle coat, a check'd shirt, and a colour'd handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Mary Blundell (the nurse.) The prisoner came and asked for Mrs. Stead.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed in the room the first time he went there?</p>
               <p>Blundell . I was not there the first time, but I was the second, and my mistress looked at the watch to see what it was o'clock; the watch was there when he was there; I went along with him, and he run away from me.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go along with him?</p>
               <p>Blundell . I was to go to the Captain's, and I went all over Soho-square, and enquired of all the chairmen, and every where, and there was no such person as Capt. Johnson.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174805260004"/>Prisoner to Mrs. Stead. Why did not you stop me if you saw me take the watch?</p>
               <p>Stead. I was afraid you had pistols.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I threaten you?</p>
               <p>Stead. No, you did not threaten me, for you run away directly .</p>
               <p>Prisoner . I never was at your house.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to ask her, whether you threatned her or not, if you never was at her house ?</p>
               <p>Prisoner . Because she said I had a bundle which she thought was pistols.</p>

               <p>Collins. Because we thought she was not honest: we turned her away on suspicion, before the things were found; we found them at Mr. Worral's, a pawn-broker.</p>
               <p>Mr. Glover . I am a lodger at Mr. Smith's; the Prisoner was suspected of being dishonest; I had missed some of my own things, and went to enquire after them, and these plates were at Mr. Worral's , and I heard the Prisoner say, that she took them out of Mr. Smith's house, and pawned them at Mr. Worral's.</p>

               <p>Worral . Yes: I took the plates and sheet in all together. Mr. Glover came to me to enquire for a shirt, and some other things, and I brought these plates down without being asked for them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Glover. Have you paid the money for these things?</p>
               <p>Glover . Yes, I have; because Mr. Worral was so very civil as to bring them down without their being asked for.</p>

               <p>Apleford . I suspected her honesty.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Apleford. She used to come to me on days, to go of errands.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got them again?</p>
               <p>Apleford. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find them?</p>
               <p>Apleford. I found them at Mr. Hewitt's, a pawn-broker in Aldersgate-street. I taxed her with it, and she owned it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you taxed her with these things, did you tax her with stealing them?</p>
               <p>Apleford. Yes; and I went to the pawn-broker's, and found them there.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they pawned for?</p>
               <p>Apleford. She said she had pawned them for 40 s. and the pawn-broker said they were pawned for 30 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take her along with you to the pawn-broker's?</p>

I thought she was tying her garter, and I turned my head on one side for two or three minutes; I turned about again, and asked her, whether she wanted to buy any thing? And seeing she had something, I asked her what she had got there? She said she had only picked up two or three rags; but she had got my master's coat and waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was she then?</p>
               <p>Crab. She was upon the threshold of the door, and I took them from her.</p>

I presently missed the wig, and ran after him: I saw the wig in his left hand: I cried out, stop thief! and then he dropt the wig: I collar'd him: a constable happened to go by at the time, and I charged him with him.</p>

             . I am a silversmith. The Prisoner at the bar came to my shop, the corner of High-Holborn , the 7th of May, about noon, and brought me a silver table-spoon, and offered it to sale ; she said she had half a dozen of these spoons , but had sold the other five; I asked her why she did not sell this where she sold the others. I examined her pretty closely, and then she said she found it in a tub of hogwash at the King's Arms Tavern in Pall-Mall. I sent my servant to know the truth of it, and he said, the people there told him they had not lost a spoon; I told her, if she would not tell me the truth, I would take her before a Justice of the Peace. I sent for Mr. Jones , a headborough, and had her before Justice Broadhead, and whilst the Justice was writing the Commitment, she took us to the house where she had the spoon.</p>

            . On the 14th of May I lost a silk capuchin, a white linen gown, a ruffled shirt, a cambrick handkerchief, and a pair of leather pumps; the Prisoner was taken that night, as I understood, and he did acknowledge the taking these things.</p>
               <p>Maltus Paine. I am a pawnbroker in Bow-street, Bloomsbury. On Monday, the 9th of May, the Prisoner brought me a silver hilted sword, and, on the 14th of May, he brought these things, and I stopped him and the things too. The sword was advertised on the 10th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the Prisoner say when he brought these things to you?</p>
               <p>Champion. He wanted a guinea and an half upon them. I examined him about them, he seemed to be in a confusion, and said they were his little girls.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I rely upon the mercy of the Court.</p>

               <p>Q. What have you to say against the Prisoners?</p>
               <p>Bolus. We had missed yarn frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you lose these goods?</p>
               <p>Bolus. The first was about three months ago, and the last on the 29th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose on the 29th of April.</p>
               <p>Bolus . Forty-one pounds weight of linen yarn, and it was taken upon two of the Prisoners, Dicker and Palmer.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this yarn taken from?</p>
               <p>Bolus. Out of our factory, where we employ a great many people in weaving, spinning, and sailcloth making. [The yarn was produced.]</p>
               <p>Q. Is this your yarn?</p>
               <p>Bolus. To the best of my knowledge it is, but Mr. Price is a better judge of that than I.</p>

             go by me, and she had got a bag upon her head. After she had passed me, I looked at it, and thought it looked like yarn, by the packing of it; I said, Palmer, what have you got there? it seems to me to be yarn, and she was not willing to shew it me; but I took it off her head, and said, I believe it is our yarn; and I said, do you work for any body else? but she did not say any thing. They both worked for me the day before, and that very morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you seized Palmer, and took the bag off her head?</p>
               <p>Price . Yes, and it is our yarn; I can swear to it; and I took the bag from Palmer, and for fear she should make her escape, I called out for help, but no body would take any notice of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pursue Dicker?</p>
               <p>Price. Yes, and took her. I said I would charge a constable with her; she desired I would let her go back to the factory, and she would carry it there, and she carried it to the factory; I had her before Justice Poulson, and she was committed, and about a week after I took up Palmer.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say against Brooks?</p>
               <p>Price . She said she was in partnership with all of them; I said, Mrs. Brooks, you have used me very ill, in stealing my goods, after I have trusted you with so much, and she acknowledged she had used me very ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing upon her?</p>

            (to Palmer.) What have you to say to your advising Dicker to take it?</p>
               <p>Palmer. I never advised her to any such thing. Dicker gave it to me to carry for her, as a poor person may do, and she sometimes gave me two pence for carrying it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you to carry it to?</p>
               <p>Palmer. To an alehouse, the corner of Hosier-Lane, and Dicker and Sharpless took it from me.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you lose.</p>
               <p>Silvester. I lost the things mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss these things before she went away?</p>
               <p>Silvester. Yes, I missed them all before she went away. I challenged her with them, and she said they were very safe, and should be forthcoming; she said she had sent the glass to be mended, but the other things were pawned. The goods were accordingly sent to my house by a porter, and left in the passage; but who sent them I cannot tell .</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he was a porter?</p>
               <p>Silvester . Because he had a white apron on.</p>
               <p>Q. When were they brought?</p>
               <p>Silvester . Last Monday.</p>

               <p>Q. What have you to say about the silver tankard?</p>
               <p>Humphrys . On Monday last I went to Honey-lane market; and when I came back, my tankard was taken away; and on Tuesday morning the tankard was advertised.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go out?</p>
               <p>Humphrys. About four o'clock, and I returned, I believe, between five and six.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss it?</p>
               <p>Humphrys. I did not miss it till half an hour after eleven at night.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the tankard?</p>
               <p>Humphrys. I left it upon the dresser about four in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do when you missed it?</p>
               <p>Humphrys. I could not do any thing; I asked my housekeeper where the tankard was?</p>
               <p>Q. Was it your tankard?</p>
               <p>Humphrys. Yes, and please your lordship.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of your tankard?</p>
               <p>Humphrys. The Prisoner took it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Humphrys. She confessed it before my Lord Mayor. I had a suspicion of her, and I asked my house-keeper, if such a person had been at my house? My house-keeper told me she had not been there; but my boy told me she had been there. I sent for the Prisoner on Wednesday, and she came to my house, and there she confessed the taking the tankard. My house-keeper told me, she came to borrow a cloak: What! said I, to steal my tankard!</p>
               <p>Q. What were the Prisoner's words when she confessed it?</p>
               <p>Humphrys. She said she had pawned it in East-Smithfield, and she shewed me the house where the tankard was pawned. I went and asked for it, but the tankard was not shewn to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house was that?</p>
               <p>Humphrys . Mrs. Heath's .</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mrs. Heath say?</p>
               <p>Humphrys. She is here in court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it at Mrs. Heath's?</p>
               <p>Humphrys. I did not see it at Mrs. Heath's; I carried the young woman at the bar to Tower-Hill, and there a gentlewoman that is here, and I, and the coachman we went with, saw the tankard.</p>

               <p>Q. What have you to say against the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Tod. On the 29th of April the Prisoner came to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you keep a publick house?</p>
               <p>Tod. No, a private house. He knocked at the door, and I opened it, and let him in; he enquired for my eldest sister, and he said to me , your servant, madam, how do you do? I have not seen you these fifteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do any thing to you?</p>
               <p>Tod. He said good morrow to me, and that he was come to take his leave of me, and insisted upon sending for some fine tea; he gave the child two pence halfpenny to fetch some, and when the child was gone out of the house, he took the poker from the fireplace, as I was going to make a toast, and threatened me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no body in the house with you?</p>
               <p>Tod. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a poker that was in the fire?</p>
               <p>Tod. No, it stood in the chimney-side. He came up to me and cursed me, and said, I am a decayed gentleman, deliver to me twenty guineas this minute; and he said, make no words, you b - h, give it me this minute; I said I had no such sum as that, and he knocked me down, and the blood run down very fast.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he knock you down before he made his demand, or after?</p>
               <p>Tod. He knocked me down upon the spot, just after he demanded the money, and held the poker over my head all the time; I was cut down the side of my face, and several places in my head; he stamped upon me too, and he wanted me to go up stairs to give him the twenty guineas, and he dragged me by the hair of my head to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174805260014"/> staircase, and he went to cut my throat; here is the mark, if it was day light you might see it; I lay on my back entirely, and as I lay in my gore he struck me with the poker, and gave me a cut in my head; the wounds are not quite well yet, but I have exceeding good flesh to heal. I had a matter of twelve wounds in my head and neck. [Mrs. Tod produced some linen she had on at that time, which was very bloody.] And he said, you b - h, don't cry out, or make any noise, for if you do, I will knock you down, and murder you afterwards. I got the poker from him, and threw it over my head, and it went into a closet; he kneeled upon my breast, and kept me down for six or seven minutes, I got from under him, and jumped into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he taken immediately?</p>
               <p>Tod. He was taken soon after, and I lost four guineas and an half, and three shillings and six-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you indict him for the robbery?</p>
               <p>Tod. I have indicted him both for the robbery * and the assault.</p>
               <p> * She had preferred a bill of indictment against him for the robbery, but the Grand Jury found it Ignoramus.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your husband?</p>
               <p>Tod. I expect him every day from Jamaica.</p>

               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Hardy . My husband is a carpenter of a man of war.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Hardy . I live about two doors from Mrs. Tod, I heard a cry of murder, and I heard that a strange man was beating Mrs. Tod. I do not say I saw it, but the rumour of it carried me out of my house, and I found her all in her gore .</p>
               <p>Q. Was she got into the house again before you got there?</p>
               <p>Hardy. Yes; she was all over blood , and I could not tell what she was made of , she was so prodigiously bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she able to speak?</p>
               <p>Hardy. Very little, she was almost murdered, and about ten minutes afterwards, news was brought that the man was taken; the people heard that he run down Queen's-head Alley, and down the waterside, to get into a boat, and they run after him and took him. He was very wet; he had ruffles on, and a neck, but when he came to be searched, he had no shirt; after that we endeavoured to get the gentlewoman to herself. There were six cuts in her head, and the least of them was an inch and an half long.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he brought back to the house?</p>
               <p>Hardy. No, he was not brought back to the house, he was carried to the cage; and he was so wet, that we thought he had tumbled into the water.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when he was in the cage?</p>
               <p>Hardy. He said he had drank a pint of gin that morning, and did not know what he did. We asked him what he went there for, he said he knew the gentlewoman's father and mother, and went to see her.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Hardy. This was not ten o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk then?</p>
               <p>Hardy . No, he was as sober as he is now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They are vile scandalous women; and when I have a little gin, I am crazy .</p>

               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Andrews. Just by Mrs. Tod, by the back of Wapping Chapel. A woman came to me, and said, for God's sake come, for Mrs. Tod is almost murdered by a man who has been at her house to day. I said to Mrs. Tod, who has been here? she said Mr. Rooke the lawyer. I went to six places before I could get a surgeon, and then we sent for Dr. Scot, and he sent for a barber, and the barber came and shaved those places on her head that were cut, and she was carried in a chair by two men, (for she could not walk after her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174805260015"/> wounds were dressed) to the Justice's, to see the Prisoner; and he lifted up his hands and said, Lord, what have I done to this woman!</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Prisoner give any account how he came to do this?</p>
               <p>Andrews. He said he wanted twenty guineas, for he was going to the city of York; and the Justice said to him, what did you do it for? he said he did not know, he thought the devil was in him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him before?</p>
               <p>Andrews. Yes, I saw him the day before. Mrs. Tod sent her girl to me, to desire I would come, for Mr. Rooke was there; I said I could not come; the child said I must come; and I said, I will come. When I came there, Mr. Rooke was sitting by the side of the table, and he said, Madam, will you please to eat any thing? and I said, No, sir, I have just dined; and he asked whether I would drink any tea, and I said no.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he treat you?</p>
               <p>Andrews. I did not want to be treated by him. We had some falmon, but he brought it in his pocket.</p>

             (Sister of the Prosecutor) sworn .</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Collingwood. Yes. About a fortnight before this affair happened, the Prisoner came to my sister's, and enquired after us. I had not seen him for fifteen years, and I said, Mr. Rooke, I thought you had been dead, and we made a little bumbo, and he said he would put us in a way of getting an estate. He asked where I lived, and said he would call upon me; I said it would not be agreeable for him to call where I was, for I was not much at home; and I desired he would call upon my sister.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of this fact? Did you see your sister in this condition ?</p>
               <p>Collingwood . Yes, I did, and I saw her before the Justice , and he said he had drunk a pint of gin that morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not I searched before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Collingwood . Yes, you was. He said he threw himself into the river.</p>
               <p>Prisoner . Mrs. Tod fell down, and struck her head against the stairs, and she struck me with the poker; and to shew the malice of this woman , she has raised up two boys to swear , that I threw this money into the Thames. She picked up a solicitor at Hick's Hall, and he said there were four guineas and a half thrown into the Thames by me; said I, do you know this? and he said, I have persons to swear it; and she said she would transport me or hang me. She had no money, for I was to lend her money till I could get a house out of the mortgagee's hands. I had the honour twice to be admitted an attorney , once by Mr . Justice Price, and once by Mr. Justice Denton. This is an artful laid thing. I lodged in her father's and mother's house, and spent a great deal of money there; and once or twice a week she and her sister went through my room when I was asleep, and took my money. There was a quarrel between me and the Prosecutrix, but I had no manner of intention to commit a robbery or any act of violence; for I went to enquire after her youngest sister, Polly, and she said I dare not let you see her, for if she is catched, she will be hanged [for her mother and she were transported.] I cannot say how I hurt her, for I never struck her with the poker; and that poker could not be bent so, if it was taken to any anvil; I have been robbed at their house, from time to time, of two or three guineas a week.</p>
               <p>Q. If these persons were of that character, what made you go there?</p>
               <p>Eliz. Tod. I was but a child when he lodged at my father's house.</p>
               <p>Jury. We should be glad to know what Mrs. Collingwood's husband is?</p>
               <p>Collingwood. My husband is master of a Guinea-man .</p>
               <p>Jury. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Collingwood. In Queen's-Square, Ratcliff-Highway .</p>
               <p>Jury. Why was it improper for him to come to your house?</p>
               <p>Collingwood. I thought it improper.</p>
               <p>Jury. For what reason.</p>
               <p>Collingwood. Why then, Gentlemen of the Jury, I will tell you. My husband has been gone these six years, trading on the coast of Guinea; and he being gone so long I was forced to take a lodging, and take in plain work, and go out to ironing. As to my sister, she lives in a very creditable manner, I do assure you.</p>

               <p>Jones. Yes, and I laid my breeches under my head.</p>
               <p>Q. So, though you was in liquor, you was so careful as to lay your breeches under your head.</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did the Prisoner go?</p>
               <p>Jones . I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss her?</p>
               <p>Jones. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. But did she take your breeches as well as the money?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, only my money; I had a watch in my breeches, but I got that again by a girl in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you chairmen use to carry so much money about you?</p>
               <p>Jones. Sometimes we do. Three or four days afterwards I went to the same house to speak to her, and I asked her, whether she took my money? and she said, if I would stay till the next morning, and not take her up that night, she would get a lawyer to give me the money again, or a note for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do then? did you take her up?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she confess any thing after that?</p>
               <p>Jones. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your money again?</p>

No; she had been in bed with him for some time, and got up and went away, and we had a quartern of liquor, and then we had some small-beer brought up in a punch-bowl, and she said I will go to bed to my husband again; I saw her pull off all her things but her gown, and go into bed; and I saw her upon her knees in the bed.</p>

I took them in my hand, and saw they were very poor things, and asked her how she came by them? she said they were her brother's things, and that he had been put out to nurse, and was almost starved, and that his mother must sell them for bread, and I bought them. (Mrs. Hughes's child has the things on now) Mr. Hughes seeing the stay hang up as she came along, said to me, that was her stay, and asked me if I did not buy a skirt and a frock with it? and I said, yes. She desired me, if I saw the person again, to let her know. On the Monday following, the Prisoner came and offered me a gown: I looked at her, and thought it was the same woman; and my servant said, did not I buy a frock and a shirt of you? and she said, yes: then, said I, that is the woman that stript the child. I sent to Mrs. Hughes, and she took her up.</p>

            . On the 30th of April last, between two and three in the morning, the Prisoner at the bar broke into the back part of my house.</p>
               <p>Q. What had the Prisoner been?</p>
               <p>Tufnell. The Prisoner had lived with me as a servant between three or four years, and had been gone about six months.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did he break into your house?</p>
               <p>Tufnell . He broke a pane of glass, unscrew'd the pin of the back window, and unbolted a back door that goes into the yard; from thence he went into a parlour, where there was a bureau, and broke two locks open, and out of that bureau took 212 guineas and an half, and a silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you?</p>

               <p>Q Was any body in the house?</p>
               <p>Tufnell. All my family, but myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know this?</p>
               <p>Tufnel. In the morning, when the servants got up, they told Mrs. Tufnell, and she sent a letter into the country for me; upon which I came to town, and when I saw the nature of the breaking open this bureau, I suspected this man, and knew it could be no other person but him, or one other person. I got a warrant, and went to his lodging in New-Tothill Street, Westminster, with Mr. Neale and the constable, and sent them up, but I staid below. They found the Prisoner, and charged him with this theft, and they found the watch and money upon him.</p>

             . On Monday the first of May, in the morning, Mr. Tufnell being out of town, Mrs. Tufnell sent for me, to inform me that her house was broke open, and to consult what was proper to be done, and I wrote to Mr. Tufnell. (I found a tool in the house, which belonged to some joiners, who were working hard by, and they owned the tool.) Upon which Mr. Tufnell came to town, and got a warrant, and we went to the Prisoner's lodgings ; he said he was surprized that I should suspect him. I saw him go to a trunk, which stood at the corner of the room, and he was fumbling about something; while I was looking into the drawers, he took something out of the trunk, and put it under his coat; I opened his coat, and there was the bag and the money: I said, are not you a rogue? this is your master's money; he made some little quibbles about it, which I do not very well remember; then I asked him after the watch, he denied it at first, but afterwards pulled it out from under some linen. He acknowledged the fact, and asked pardon.</p>

Mr. Neale taxed the Prisoner with it, and he denied it very much; we searched some drawers, and found nothing; and I saw an old trunk that he was fumbling at, and saw him put a bag into his breast. I said to Mr. Neale , he has put a bag into his breast, and Mr. Neale opened his coat, and took it from him. I asked after the watch, he denied it at first, but it was put under some linen that lay upon the table, and he delivered the watch to us. [The watch was produced.]</p>

               <p>Q. You did not stand passive all the while, did you?</p>
               <p>White. No, we were talking all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you talking about?</p>
               <p>White. She asked me several questions, how I lived, &amp;c. I said she had got my watch, and desired to have it again; and she said she had it not. Presently her husband came into the room, and then I did not make any more disturbance about it.</p>
               <p>Q I don't find you made any disturbance before.</p>
               <p>White. None at all. I went two or three times afterwards the same day, and I enquired for her in the neighbourhood, and she was not to be found. I went the next day to the room where she lodged, and her husband was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the room you was in before?</p>
               <p>White. They had moved their lodging, I got a warrant, and took the Prisoner's husband up, and asked, whether he knew where the watch was? he said he knew nothing at all about it, and desired me to be easy and favourable. I desired he would send for his wife, which he did; and before she came, I asked him whether he could give me any information about it? and if he did, it would be the better for him; and as I was going along, I met the Prisoner, and we all went to a publick house, and there I asked the Prisoner what she had done with the watch? she said she had borrowed 45 s. upon it. Then we went before a justice, and she declared, to him, that her husband was innocent of the fact, and swore so, and she said she was the person that took it, and borrowed the money upon it.</p>

               <p>Q. to White. You knew before that, that she had no hand in it?</p>
               <p>White. No, I did not, for it was in the dark.</p>
               <p>Q. So as to what you have said concerning her taking the watch out of your pocket, and bidding the other woman take it out of your hand; all this time you were in the dark?</p>
               <p>White. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bird. I am constable.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of this matter?</p>
               <p>Bird. Mr. White brought me a warrant to take up

             and his wife, and I took him up, and we went to a publick-house , and the Prisoner came to clear her husband; and she said he was innocent of the affair, and owned herself to be guilty, and Mr. White said, that is your Prisoner; so I took her into custody, and waited an hour and a half before we went before a magistrate; she owned it at the publick-house , and before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she own before the justice?</p>

               <p>Q. Was he sober?</p>
               <p>Glegg . He was a little cherry-merry ; he came to me the next morning, and said he had lost his watch: we went to the house, and they were moved, and he offered the gentleman a crown if he would let him know where they were moved to; and we got the man, and he told us where his wife was at work; but telling her that her husband was in hold, she presently followed him, and told us that she took the watch, and that her husband was innocent.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I might say what I did not do, for I did not take it, and know nothing of its being gone; but in my fright I might say that I took it, because my husband was in trouble; but I don't know what I said in the fright, for I know myself to be innocent; it was the other woman that took it, and not I.</p>

I had but one servant in the shop, and I heard two people there; I was busy writing backwards, and did not go into the shop; afterwards I heard a third person come in, it was in the dusk of the evening, and I thought three persons were too many for my boy to serve, and the Prisoner at the bar, or another woman, had some money in her hand, and paid for a handkerchief. A neighbour came in and cautioned me, that if such a person was not gone, to examine her, for she believed she was a shop-lifter . The handkerchiefs were all in a confusion, but the boy gave me a pretty good account, and I was satisfied; and I did not miss the handkerchiefs till the Friday following, and then I missed a piece. Mrs. Wycherly sent me word, that she had been searching after her goods, and had found her muslin, and that she believed she had seen some handkerchiefs that she had seen at my house. I went to Mrs. Wycherly, and she told me, if I would go with her in the evening, she believed she could find the people that had them; I told her I should take it very kindly. Mrs. Wycherly saw the two women [the Prisoner and

               <p>Flower. No, in the shop where the goods were found.

               <p>Loach . In Bow-street, Bloomsbury.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to see her there?</p>
               <p>Loach. The Prisoner and another woman brought some handkerchiefs, and they sold me seven of them for twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you buy them?</p>
               <p>Loach. Some time last week, but I cannot be sure what day.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the handkerchiefs to be out of your custody?</p>
               <p>Loach. I put them out to sale, and Mrs. Wycherly came and looked at them, and asked me the price of them, I asked her three shillings and sixpence, and she was to give me three shillings. I gave two shillings and sixpence for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Flower come afterwards?</p>
               <p>Loach. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say they were his?</p>
               <p>Loach. He did as good as say so, but he was not quite positive; he could scarcely say they were his?</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say?</p>
               <p>Loach. He said he could not swear they were his, but at last he was positive, and then he took them away.</p>
               <p>Q. So you are sure the Prisoner at the bar was one of the women that brought them to your house?</p>

               <p>Loach. I deal in clothes, as that gentlewoman does [Mrs. Esham]. I bought twenty yards of muslin of the Prisoner, it was but yard wide, and I gave her 3 s. 6 d. a yard for it; I have sold all the muslin, unless one yard that I kept for my own use.</p>

               <p>Q. Who is that?</p>
               <p>Esham. One Mrs. Wells.</p>

               <p>Wells. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sent by Mrs. Wycherly ?</p>
               <p>Wells . No, it was casually; I went in for some handkerchiefs, and she said she had got some muslin to dispose of; and I bought two yards and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Wells . I think it was Wednesday was sev'nnight, and I took it to Mrs. Wycherly's.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take it there?</p>
               <p>Wells . Because I sell goods for Mrs. Wycherly.</p>

I said, yes, and I should be here a fortnight, and if she had any goods in that time that would suit me, I would buy them. I shut up my own shop, and made it my business to detect them : I went to the shop, and found Kelly and Johnson in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the shop in Bow-street?</p>
               <p>Wycherly . Yes; I said they were shop-lifters, and kept them in the shop, and I was there for a quarter of an hour, and could not get any body to assist me; but at last I got Kelly and Johnson secured, and carried them before a justice of the peace: there is a piece of muslin that they had, which is in the hands of one Jones a constable; for they would have made it up with me.</p>
               <p>[Mr. Jones was called, and produced the muslin.]</p>

               <p>Coun. for the Crown. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, The Prisoner stands indicted for an offence, which is made felony without benefit of clergy, by a late Act of Parliament made in the 19th year of his Majesty's reign, and which the Legislature found necessary to make, in order to put a stop, if possible, to a practice so prejudicial to the peace of the subject, and to prevent the prejudice done to the customs, and to all honest traders; and the Act says, if any persons, to the number of three or more, shall, with fire arms, and other offensive weapons, assemble themselves together, in order to be aiding and assisting in running and landing uncustomed goods, and goods liable to pay duties, which have not been paid or secured , shall be guilty of felony, without benefit of clergy. Many have been guilty, some have been brought before you, and some have been found guilty, and the Government have done all that is in their power to find out the nests of these people, who do what they can to the prejudice of their country. Gentlemen, the Prisoner is one, who has been of a gang who have insested the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk; and on the 10th of September, 1747, the Prisoner at the Bar, with forty or fifty of them, were assembled together at Benacre in Suffolk; and there was a little smuggling cutter or vessel, which was expected to come to Benacre , and the Prisoner was one who was assembled with the others, in order to receive these goods, and they did receive from this vessel about thirty hundred weight of tea, and a large quantity of brandy, and it is for this fact that the Prisoner stands indicted. Gentlemen, we shall produce our witnesses, and if we prove this fact, I do not doubt but you will find the Prisoner guilty. Call

               <p>Branson. I have known him seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his character in point of honesty?</p>
               <p>Branson. I never knew any harm of him than only being intangled with the smugglers.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he live?</p>
               <p>Branson. At Benacre , within two miles of me; he was intrusted with things among the smugglers , and he was honest in that.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174805260031"/>Q. Had he a bad character in other things?</p>
               <p>Branson . It was reported, that he was guilty of a bad action once, but I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. Do you know any thing of his thieving?</p>
               <p>Branson. There was something said of his taking some eggs out of a nest, but I never knew any such thing of him in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear any body give him a bad character?</p>
               <p>Branson. No, only the smugglers, to screen themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he is a person that is to be believed upon his oath?</p>
               <p>Branson, Yes, I believe he is.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever hear any complaint against him till he turned against the smugglers?</p>
               <p>Welch. I never heard any thing against him before this, except the story of the eggs; to be sure he was but meanly brought up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he is to be believed upon his oath?</p>

               <p>Q. Do any of the King's officers give him a bad character besides the smugglers?</p>
               <p>Welch. No, I never heard any of them in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his character among those that are not smugglers, if you was to ask them?</p>
               <p>Welch. Who must I ask?</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Are there not a great many smugglers at Bonacre ?</p>
               <p>Welch. Yes, there are very few others; I believe I have seen 200 of them on the Beach at one time.</p>

               <p>Pros. Coun. What are you?</p>
               <p>Parr. I am a surgeon.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Parr. At Harrow. I was sent for to go to Pinner, but I could not go that night, and I sent word I would come the next morning, and the next morning the boy was dead; I waited upon the Coroner and the Jury, and examined the body, and there was a confusion just by the ear , and another near that; upon scalping, I could not find any other wound, but there was a vast quantity of extravasated blood between the skull and the dura mater .</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that wound was the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Parr . Yes, indeed I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it was a bruising weapon, or a sharp weapon, that it was done with?</p>
               <p>Parr. It was a bruising weapon, else it would have cut .</p>

               <p>Q. What did you drink?</p>
               <p>Lickley . Two or three pints of beer, and some drams; and three women came in, and pushed him, and pushed off his hat and wig ; and one of them desired me to go up stairs with her.</p>
               <p>Q. And did you go up stairs with her?</p>
               <p>Lickley . Yes, I did go up with her, and staid for about an hour or two.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it a bedchamber that you went into?</p>
               <p>Lickley . Yes, my Lord.</p>

               <p>Lickley . Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you lie there?</p>
               <p>Lickley . About two hours; and when I came down stairs , there were four staymakers came in.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Lickley . Because they told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it day light when you got up?</p>
               <p>Lickley . I believe it was about four o'clock, and then I went to drink with them, and the day light began to come in; I looked upon my watch , to see whether it was time to go home, and it was about twenty minutes after five ; and then the Prisoner got hold of me, and led me to another box, and said she would give me a quartern of rum , which she did, and she took my watch from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take it?</p>
               <p>Lickley . I cannot say I saw her; and she would have had me have gone to another house with her .</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you say she took it, when you did not see her take it?</p>
               <p>Lickley . Because I was in no other company; we went out of the house together; when I was got about ten doors down the street, she turned back again ; then she was got about three doors; I went back again, and followed her into the house, and she asked me if I had no money; I said, I would pawn my watch for a pint of beer; she said I had no watch; I said I had; but when I felt for it, it was gone. The landlord began to push me out of doors, and I said, keep your hands off me, or I will shew you something else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get your watch again?</p>
               <p>Lickley. No.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you miss the snuff-box?</p>
               <p>Fowler. In a quarter of an hour; I did not miss the other things then. My daughter met her a little after the last Sessions , and got her to my house. I cannot say that she took them; I only mentioned the box to her, and she absolutely denied it, and I let her go, and left it to God and her own conscience. I saw her afterwards at her master's, and there she acknowledged , that she took the snuff box off the ground, but did not take it out of the shew-glass.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give it you again?</p>
               <p>Fowler. I have it, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. You said she denied it.</p>
               <p>Fowler. She denied it, when she was at my house, but she could not do it at her master's, because there were so many people that knew of her having it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the ring?</p>
               <p>Fowler . Yes; she sold it that very day to buy her a bever hat.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say as to the ear wires?</p>
               <p>Fowler . I did not take any notice of them till she was committed, and then I took them out of her ears . I do not want to aggravate the crime, for she is but a young woman.</p>

             . Last Monday was three weeks I found an ass of my master's.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find it?</p>
               <p>Dimmock . In Bloomsbury-square, by my Lady Northampton's .</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the ass with?</p>
               <p>Dimmock. Mr. Read's servant, a lad was driving it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the lad was servant to this Read?</p>
               <p>Dimmock. Because he told me so. I asked him how his master came by that ass ; he said his master had bought her about three weeks.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174805260036"/>Q. Did he say of whom?</p>
               <p>Dimmock . He said he bought her of the Lord of the manor ; and I took the ass along with me.</p>
               <p>Q. So this boy was driving this ass among others.</p>
               <p>Dimmock. No , it was by itself .</p>
               <p>Q. So you took the ass away.</p>
               <p>Dimmock. Yes, I had known the ass 7 years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know this Read?</p>
               <p>Dimmock. Yes, he lives in Tyburn-Road, he deals in asses .</p>
               <p>Pris. Co. to Mr. Davis. Did you never hear how Mr. Read came by this ass?</p>
               <p>Davis. I was told , that he bought her at Kilburn .</p>
               <p>Pris. Co. Did you ever talk with Mr. Hayley about this ?</p>
               <p>Davis. Yes .</p>
               <p>Pris. Co. I ask you, whether Mr. Hayley did not tell you, that he sold the ass to the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Davis. I don't remember that he said so; but if it is a stray ass , must he sell it outright?</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun . So instead of bringing an action, you would indict him for a felony: Did not Mr. Montgomery advise you to this prosecution?</p>
               <p>Davis . I have no occasion to give any answer to that questi on .</p>
               <p>Mr. Hayley. I live at Kilburn , I belong to the pound and to the farm, and I sold the ass to Mr. Read.</p>
               <p>Pris. Co. Did you know Mr. Read?</p>
               <p>Hayley. I have known him twenty years.</p>
               <p>Pris. Co. How long had you the ass before you sold it to him?</p>
               <p>Hayley. I had it from about last Michaelmas to the 22d or 23d of April last.</p>
               <p>Pris. Co . How did you come by the ass?</p>
               <p>Hayley . It strayed into my yard, and I pounded it.</p>
               <p>Pris. Co. Did you ever tell Mr. Davis that you sold Mr. Read the ass?</p>
               <p>Hayley. Yes , I have told him so.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you sell the ass for?</p>
               <p>Hayley. I sold it for 4 l. - I don't know the value of asses, for I never had an ass before.</p>
               <p>It appearing that the ass was bought, it made it a case of a civil nature, and the Prisoner was honourably <rs id="t17480526-38-verdict218" type="verdictDescription">

               acquitted
            </rs>.</p>
               <p>Court to Davis. How came you to carry this prosecution on in this manner ?</p>
               <p>Davis. Because my servant found the ass in the Prisoner's custody . I would have made it up in any way, but I was bound over to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Court . You ought to ask the Prisoner pardon .</p>
               <p>Davis. Very well, my lord; I am mistaken; I know he is as honest a man as any of the trade.</p>

             . On Wednesday the 4th of May , about one in the morning, I lost my watch at Mr. Watson's, a brandy-shop in Peter's-street, Soho. The Prisoner asked me to give her a dram; I told her I had no money, and she gave me one; I pulled out my watch to see what it was o'clock, and the Prisoner snatched it out of my hand and run away , and there were two persons who took it from her; I run after her, and found her in Compton-street.</p>

Joblin] told me in French that the man who was talking to me had robbed me, and he said, there's nothing in it, Sir, there's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174805260037"/> nothing in it; which made me believe he understood French; I asked her again, and she said, he had stole some handkerchiefs , and had put them into his pocket; I said, what do you mean by coming to me in this manner? you are an impudent fellow, and I will know you now before I part from you, and I said I would search him, and when he found me positive , he took the handkerchiefs out of his pocket; these are the handkerchiefs; I believe he thought that the woman saw him take them , and so came in that manner to make her think he was acquainted with me.</p>

               <p>Murphy . To the 13th of last March; the reason of my suspecting the Prisoner was, that a person came and told me, that he saw the Prisoner selling a coat and breeches , and the Prisoner had my breeches upon his back; and he said , one Honora Nugent brought the clothes to him, and that he sold the coat to one Burn , in Broad St. Giles's , for a Guinea ; I went to Burn's , and he said, he had bought such a coat , but had it not; and this Honora Nugent told me, that the buckles were at Hoare's gin-shop in broad St. Giles's, but as to the hat and wig, he knew nothing of them.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know this Elgar?</p>
               <p>Travers. Yes.</p>

               <p>Travers. He was; he is a sheep-driver by business.</p>

               <p>Travers. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether his wife and children did not live with Elgar?</p>
               <p>Travers. My Lord, for a year and an half I was robbed of my wife, and this Elgar and my wife wanted to rob me of all I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it by your consent that she went there?</p>
               <p>Travers. No, my Lord; they found a way to lock me up eleven months in Ludgate, and robbed me of all I had; Esquire Davis knows the whole affair, and I have a note of 50 l. from Elgar to Mrs. Travers.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your wife now?</p>
               <p>Travers. My wife has been dead three or four months, and the two children were sent home to me. She sent for me about an hour and an half before she died, and delivered some old things to me, and there was a note of Elgar's hand, payable to my wife, for 50 l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This Elgar was, at this time, under arrest by Travers.</p>
               <p>Travers. No, my Lord, it was not so, there was one Nice arrested him upon his own account.</p>

               <p>Weaver . I know nothing of the entering the action; my partner told me, Blake has been here, and has sworn himself to be Elgar, for I know Elgar very well; so we went to Mr. Davis, for I believe he was a Prisoner with Mr. Davis then. I believe Elgar has ruined the man.</p>
               <p>Travers. I am told that Mr. Blake is sometimes crazy, and half mad, and I heartily forgive him, and I hope the Court will be merciful to him.</p>
               <p>Weaver. I know he was going to take seven pounds yesterday, in order to make the matter up, but my partner and I were determined to bring the affair to light.</p>
