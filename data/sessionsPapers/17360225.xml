I was sent to Church in the Afternoon: When I went out, the Box hung up in the Shop: When I came home, it was gone. Jack, says she, do ye know where your Christmas-Box is? I told her, no: I suppose, says she, your Master has put it by for you. I had set down the Customers Names that had put Money in for me, and by Calculation there was about 3l. in it. My Master was out, and no one was in the House that Afternoon, but the Prisoner: When he came home, he taxed her with it, and sent for a Constable; at first she said she knew nothing of it, but afterwards, she said, a Journeyman Apothecary had been there, and had taken it away; my Master was going to take him up, but at last she confess'd it.</p>

I paid him 6 d. and he took the three Half-pence too, and push'd me out of doors.

I sent for him, and he told me, she had not liv'd any where in Town, but if he was worth a thousand Pounds he would give that Security for her honesty; I told him, our Service required a trusty Servant; but as you are an honest Neighbour, I believe I may depend upon you; so upon his Character I took her. She had not lived with me above a Week, but I miss'd a pair of double Ruffles, which cost me 7 l. I desir'd Mr. Daffey to part with her, for I was sure she was a Pilferer; he said, we could not do without a Servant, and we must therefore watch her.

He tore my Coat off my Back; it was against Angel-Alley, in Leadenhall-street; I knew there was a Watchman's Stand in that Alley, and I went up the Alley to look for him, and to call the Watch to see for Cooper, and to get my Coat; the Watchmen that were with him told me, if I would go to the Watch-house, I should have my Coat; so I went without Opposition.</p>

The Prosecutor was very much surpriz'd when he came to the Watch-house, and after he had charged me with the Prisoner, he said, if he could get his Hat again, he should be acquitted: No, says I, 'tis out of your Power to acquit him now; you have charg'd him with a Robbery, and I must know for my own Security, where you live: He carry'd me to a Barber's in Mincing-Lane; but when we came there, he said, he must not disturb the Family: Then he said, he was <rs id="t17360225-8-viclabel50" type="occupation">Clerk</rs>

Upon his Promise to meet me next Day at Sir Richard Brocas's, I left him; but in the Morning I went to Mincing-Lane, but they had not seen Mr. Cooper they said. I went to the Bell, and enquired for him; the Landlord told me, he had been there just before, and the Woman said, he had not been there; I brush'd into the Fore-room, and saw him: Mr. Cooper<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173602250007"/> says I, you are very unhandsome; here is a Man committed on your account, and now you swerve from us, 'tis very unhandsome.

               <p>Joshua Thompson. The Prisoner and another Woman, came into my Shop on Monday last, and asked to see some Cloaks: They were at first for a Cloath-colour'd one; then they would have it Scarlet: After they had try'd on several, they bid me 10 s. for one, and we parted for 6 d. Mr. Turcan was at the Door when they went out: He came in, and asked me, if I had sold them any Thing; I told him, no; they have got something, says he; so I went after them, which the other Woman perceiving, she slept between me and the Prisoner, to give her an Opportunity of throwing the Cloak into an Entry. I did not see her throw it there, but as I followed her, I saw the Edge of it under her Cloak, and there I found it. I laid hold of the Woman, who I was sure had the Cloak, and while I was busie with her, the other got away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Turcan. I wanted to speak with the Prosecutor, but as his Shop was full of Customers, I waited at the Door, and saw the two Women trying on the Cloaks: When they went out of the Shop, I saw something red hang down about an Inch below the Prisoner's Cloak; I asked my Neighbour if he had sold them any Thing red, he said no: I told him what I had seen; he follow'd her, but as his Shop was full of People, I stay'd behind.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was my Landlady that was with me at this Gentleman's Shop: She wanted to buy a Cloak, and bid 10 s. for one; the Gentleman would not take it, so we came out; and as we were going along, See here, says I, what need we go any further? here's a very handsome Cloak lies here in the Entry, upon which up comes this Gentleman and seiz'd me, and the People told him, he must swear it downright upon me; his Wife, my Lord, promised my Husband, I should be kept in the Round-house only till next Day; and as soon as he was gone, they sent me to Jayl. <rs id="t17360225-9-verdict55" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Mary Pickering. The Prisoner and another young Woman came into my Shop, the 10th of February, about 4 o'Clock in the Afternoon, and asked for a Bit of Cambrick; they had not been long in the Shop, before I perceived they wanted none. The Prisoner put her Hand down, and dropped something; I saw her stooping to take it up. I had no Body then in the Shop, but before they went away, my Mother came in: I gave her a Hint to watch them: They bought a Quarter and Nail of Cambrick, and paid for it; then they went away. I miss'd immediately the spotted Lawn, and though my Mother saw them turn down the next Court, yet we could not find them: So I went to the Pawnbrokers to desire them to stop it, if such a Thing should come to be pawn'd. The next Morning one came and asked me, if I could swear to the Woman and the Lawn: I said, if the Woman was in the same Dress, I could, and the Lawn was very remarkable, for there were several Darns in the End of it: I knew the Prisoner again, and I value the Lawn at 40 s.</p>

I went to her, to the Blue-ball and Horse-shoe in St. James's Street: she own'd her Marriage, and said the Goods were neither sold nor pawn'd, but were under her Care, and she would deliver them to me. My Daughter was marry'd on Friday; on Saturday I heard her Husband had got another Wife; and on Sunday I found this first Wife at the 3 Tuns in Bishopsgate-street. I spoke to him about my Goods, for he had padlock'd them up, and had told his new Wife, that he would sell them all, and her Cloaths too, which he had secur'd with the rest of the Things; however, if I would give him 10 l. to enable him to disannul the first Marriage, he said I should have my Goods again. I took him upon the 26th, on the 27th I carried him to Newgate; and as he was going along, he gave the Key of the Padlock to the Constable; so I got my Goods again.</p>

               <p>George Pearce. I was going Home to Knights bridge on Monday Se'nnight, about 7 or 8 o'Clock, and upon Constitution-hill, I met 2 Men, who took the Things mention'd in the Indictment from me: They were wrapp'd up in a Handkerchief, and were my own. Mr. Grimes hit me with an Oaken Stick, made two of my Teeth loose, and cut my Gum: The Moon shone upon the Snow, and made it very light: Grimes was before me, and his Companion behind me. Grimes led me about 100 Yards out of the way, took my Things, rifled me, and then ty'd my Hands and my Legs together with my own Garters: They left me sitting within a Yard and a half of the Pond, by the Wilderness, and told me, they would either release me in a Quarter of an Hour, or bring me more Company. When they were gone, I got up with some Difficulty, and jumped along to the Keeper's House, where I was unty'd. I don't know how the Discovery was made of the Prisoner: I suppose the Robbery being put in the Papers occasion'd it: They sent for me when Grimes and the Prisoner were before the Justice, and I was order'd to prosecute the Prisoner. I can't swear to the Prisoner; he kept always behind me.</p>
               <p>Grimes. otherwise Graham. The Prisoner had been a <rs id="t17360225-13-deflabel88" type="occupation">Gentleman's Servant</rs>

Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday we took nothing but on Monday Night we went round Hyde-Park Corner, and met nothing that would do: Come, says he, let us go down Constitution-Hill, perhaps we may make something there. I went with him, and there we met this young Man, and took from him the Things mentioned, ty'd up in a Handkerchief, and ty'd his Hands and Feet: The Seals, I believe, were lost; the Buckles I know nothing of; but as to the Knives, one of them is in Court, the other is at the Justice's. It was I who took hold of the Prosecutor; the Prisoner had a Pistol. I had only a Stick; he kept behind in order I suppose, to conceal himself. He bid me attack the Man; I did, and giving him a Stroke in the Mouth with my Stick, for fear he should be Rusty, I made him come out of the Road towards the Pond.</p>

Accordingly the Prisoner came and enquired for Grimes; he immediately charged me with him, and before Justice Mitford, he made his Information of this Robbery. When Grimes charged me with him, he seem'd surpriz'd; and cry'd O Mr. Grimes.

I am a Laundress. and live by Golden-square; I came here on the Prisoner's behalf On last Monday Se'nnight I got the Prisoner to write me out a Bill for Washing, he did, and I desired him to come to Supper with me: He came about 6 o'Clock that Night, and staid with me till almost 10.</p>

               <p>Morgan. I know it was that Day, because I wanted the Bill to be wrote out.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose Bill was that?</p>
               <p>Morgan. One Mr Sale's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a Date to that Bill?</p>

               <p>Q. So the Prisoner was with you in the Garret from 6 to 10. Pray does any of Mr. Humphrey's People know any Thing of his being there?</p>
               <p>Morgan. I don't know that; there is an Entry, when the Shop is shut up for the Lodgers to go in and out through: When a House is full of Lodgers, they seldom take notice who comes to and fro.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Humphreys here?</p>
               <p>Morgan. No, if he was here, he could not but give me a very good Character.

               <p>Grimes. I was in Mr. Goodhall's Parlour; when one came and told me the Prisoner enquir'd for me: I went to him and wink'd at the Person that call'd me, to go back and call Mr. Good-hall, that I might charge him: Then I went into a Room, and left the Prisoner in another; he followed me, but I took up my Pint and my Glass, and went into another, and I never went out to him afterwards.</p>

At the Queen's Head in Ratcliff Hamlet, in White-horse-street, the Prisoner and I lay together; there was 3 of us in all; I lay in the middle. The Buttons were on my Cloaths when I went to Bed, and the Buckles in my Breeches; when I waked in the Morning. the Prisoner was gone and all the Buttons cut off my Cloaths. I had laid my Cloaths on a Chair close to that side of the Bed on which he lay. When he was before the Justice he said he went away from us in the Morning before we were up, because he had no Money to pay his Reckoning: But when his Mittimus was made, and he was going to Prison, he said if I would discharge him, he would work his Finger-nails off to make me amends.</p>

If she would tell us where we might take Cock-eye, but she would not consent to her being taken.

She said she was not, but at last I found she had been taken up, and left with us, for safety 'till next Morning.</p>

               <p>Holt. If I don't speak truth, I shall go to Hell. I was coming home from my Uncles, and by the Burying Ground I met this Gentleman, it was on a Tuesday Night, in January. I was going home to Old-street, but I ask'd the Gentleman if I should light him: He agreed to give me 3d. to Light him to the Ivey-House. I had but a little bit of a Link, so we got another, and at the Fox and Goose Door we threw away the bit and lighted the other; turning into another Field, we heard 2 Men coming; the Gentleman stood up to let them pass and bid them Good Night: immediately the Prisoner step'd up to him and said, G - d D - n you deliver, and struck at him with his Stick: He aim'd at his Head but the Gentleman bobb'd down, and the Stick lit on his Back: Then he struck at the Prisoner with the Link and miss'd him, but he gave him a Blow with his Cane; I knew the Prisoner, and said Dick Swift let the Gentleman alone, I know you; and he look'd at me about a Minute and then ran away: the other said why do you run? Damn it, can't we walk along the Path? and then he ran after him as hard as he could. The Prisoner had then a Green Apron on, under his Coat.</p>

I live in Old-Street, almost half a mile from Ask's Hospital, and sent my Son twice that Night into Field-Lane; He return'd the first Time and was at Home a little after 7, and the second Time he returned a little before 8: if I had had Time I could have fetch'd a Woman from Fleet-Lane, that I sent him to.

I had not been out more than an Hour and half, before the Boy came to me, and said, Sir, pray come Home as soon as possible: Why, says I, what's the Matter? He said there was no body at Home, but the Nurse up two pair of Stairs with the Children, to take care of the House. I asked him as I went Home with him, what was become of the House-Maid? He told me, she had sent him of an Errand as soon as I was gone, and before he came back, she had pack'd up her Cloaths and was gone. I ow'd her 5 Months Wages and wonder'd at her going without her Money: I thought she would come Home again, but seeing nothing of her at 9 o'Clock, I went to see if her Cloaths were left; I found she had taken every Rag, and her Trunk empty. Then I imagin'd she must have taken something, or else she would not have left her Wages. I looked about the Kitchen, but miss'd nothing there; upon searching for the Key of my Desk, I found I had left it in the Lock when I went out; and the Money mentioned in the Indictment, and which was there when I went out, was taken away. I advertis'd her the next Day, and a Butcher, (on Tuesday Morning) in Hungerford Market, came and told me, if I would give him the 3 Guineas I had promis'd as a Reward to the Person who apprehended her, he would tell me where the Money, the Purse and the Maid were to be found. I told him I would give him the Money, and so he carryed her before Justice Frazier, and sent for the Man who had the Money, who returned me the Purse with 18 Guineas and a half, and the Barbary Coin, and I gave a 50 Pound Bond to indemnify him. I went to the Woman who gave me a Character of this Servant, and asked her how she could give me a false Account of her? She said she thought she had been honest, and to show she was so, she assisted in finding her out. She confess'd the Fact before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Justice Frazier. She made a voluntary Confession before me the 20th of January; it was read twice over to her, before she sign'd it.</p>

               <p>Another Evidence. I keep a publick House in Hungerford Market; the same Night the Money was lost, the Prisoner came to my Maid, who had not then lived with me above 10 Days, and gave her a Guinea to fetch her Things out of Pawn; she had it, she said, from her Husband, and said, my Maid must go along with her to see him. The Prisoner call d for 18 Pen' worth of Punch; while it was making they went out; but when they came back, they drank it. She staid so late at my House, that she said she was afraid to go home, and desired she might lye with my Maid. I let her lye there that Night, and in the Morning, before my Wife or I were up, they came down stairs. and knocked at my Door; the Prisoner was in a Hurry, and said to my Maid. I thought you had lived in an honest House, and not in a House, where I must lose my Money. I told them, I knew nothing of the Money: They went down Stairs 2 Hours before me, and made a Noise below, and then went away. In the mean time a Butcher, who is a Tenant at the Door, had been out late with his Brother, and they came in, and desired I would let them lye down, for they did not care to go home; I told them, they might lye down on the Maid's Bed if they would; 'twas only a small Table-bed, but they made a shift to pig in any how, and lay 'till 10 o'Clock When they were gone, my Wife, (not expecting her Maid again) turn'd up the Bed, and there she saw the Purse; I call'd in 2 Neighbours to be present; they open'd it, and found 18 Guineas and a half, and a Shilling. and a Ducat.</p>

               <p>Mr. Hodges. They had been in my Shop just before; I discovered what they were, and clear'd my Counter, that there might be nothing near them. White came in first, and Jones followed her. I could not keep them together, they would be running one to one end, the other to the other end of the Counter. I had just laid 5 Pieces of Cambrick at one end. White had bought a Quarter of a Yard, it was tore off, and was abruptly going away without paying for it: I made her pay for it, and then they went away. As soon as they were gone. I miss'd a Piece of Cambrick, and pursued them to Mr. Davis's Shop. I let her come out a little way into the Street; then I carried her back into his Shop, and to prevent her conveying the Goods away, I held her Arms open; but she got one Hand at liberty, and shook her Petticoats, and I saw the Lawn drop from her, before it came to the Ground, and she endeavoured to kick and spurn it from her.</p>

            . I serve Mr. Nesbit, and had laid the Cloath in the Parlour according to Custom. There were on the Table 4 Salts, four/Salt-Shovels and four Spoons. I shut the Parlour Door, and went down to dress myself then I went into the Parlour again, to mend the Fire, and seeing the Entry dirty, as if somebody had been there, I went down to the Cook, and asked her, if any body had been in the Parlour; she said no: I went in again for something for my Mistress, and found the Salts, the Spoons, and the Salt-shovels were gone. I called the House-keeper, a we look'd into the Buffet, but nothing was taken from thence, nothing but the Plate that was upon the Table. We sent for the Silversmith who made the Plate, and advertised it; but before the Advertisement came to his Hands, the Spoon mentioned in the Indictment, was brought to his Shop, and he stopt it.</p>

            . After Mr. Nesbit had lost the Things, he sent for me, and I caused Advertisements to be printed, and left at the Goldsmith's. I offered two Guineas Reward and no Questions ask'd: About 7 o'Clock as the Man who gave out the Bills, was putting one into my Hand, Mr. Newsome came, and told me, he had stopt one of the Spoons, and said he believed he could help us to take the Person that brought it to him.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Newsome. The Prisoner at the Bar brought this Spoon to me to be valued; I asked him whose it was; he said it was his own. I told him he must bring somebody to make that appear, before he should have it again, he then went away, and I saw him no more till he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was drinking at Cow cross, and fell into Discourse with a Sea-faring Man: He pulled out a Pack of Cards; I play'd with him and won all his Money; then he pulled off a Ring and would have me play against that: I did not think it was Gold, so I refused; then he pulled out the Spoon, and desired me to lend him Money upon it; I lent him 10s upon it, and won the Money of him again; he said the Spoon was worth 14s. and wanted more Money, I would lend no more till I knew the Value: why then says he, as you live but over the way; I will entrust you with it, go, and see what 'tis worth: I carried it, to this Gentlewoman, and she stopt it. I told her, Madam, I am at present the Owner of the Spoon, but I will go and fetch the Man I had it of, in a Quarter of an Hour: I went back to the Alehouse to look for him, but he was gone. I never absconded but was taken at my own Door.</p>
               <p>Gilchrist. We were told by this Gentlewoman, that she had seen the Prisoner go by her Shop with a Woman she had some Knowledge of, and as we were talking about this Affair, a Grubber, one who sweeps the Streets, heard us, and said, if you are talking of Newgate Nan, or Pin Nan, you may find her at a Brandy-shop at Cow-Cross; so we went to Cow-Cross, and enquired for New-gate Nan, or Pin Nan; but the People told us, if we wanted her, it was not for any Thing that was good, and refused to let us know where she was. At last we found out the Grubber, and he said, when we described the Prisoner, he knew him well; a little tidy Fellow, who would spend 4 or 5 Guineas at Cards: The Constable said he had some Knowledge of him, so he got a Warrant and went to look for him, and saw him standing at a Door; I charged the Constable with him, and asked him if he did not know Newgate Nan, or Pin Nan; he said he did not, we carried him to an Alehouse, and presently Newgate Nan came in and asked for him, and said he was her Husband. I went to get the Warrant back'd, and they staid at an Alehouse till I came back, and till I could get a City Constable; then I brought them word to march; and while I was gone, they had drank half a Crown's worth of Liquor; I paid for it, and ordered them to march: G - d D - m your Blood, says Newgate Nan, he shall not sir, till you give me half a Crown's worth more. I went to Newgate, and gave him a Dram to persuade him to tell us where the rest of the Plate was; he said he would return it; say no more says he, a Word to the Wise is enough.</p>

On the 20th of January the Prisoner and 2 more came into my House and call'd for Drink; they went away without paying the Reckoning and took the Mug with them. The next Day it was offer'd to Mr. Bond a Silversmith, and we having had Advertisements sent from Goldsmith's-Hall to all the Shops, he sent me Word, and I came to take up Evans.</p>
               <p>Bond. Mrs. Evans, and Mrs. Parker came to my Shop early in the Morning, January 21st. Evans had got the Pot under her Apron, she pull'd it out, and Parker said, what don't you know her? 'Tis Mrs. Evans at the end of the Alley. I had a suspicion of them, but I weigh'd it, and told them it came to 4 l. 18 s. 9 d. Evans said if it came to no more she should lose Money by it, for she had lent 7 l. on it. I advised her to acquaint the Person she had it of, that it was worth no more; and so they went away. About an Hour afterward, Parker came and asked me if that was the most I would give for it. I told her, it was as much as it came to, at 5 s. an Ounce. Well, says she, Mrs. Evans has try'd, and she can't get more, so she desires you to send the Money for it. No. I told her I did not care to meddle with it at all: Why, says she, you don't think it stolen, do you? you don't hear me charge you, says I. As soon as she was gone. I search'd my Warnings, and did not find the Pot advertis'd But about out an Hour and a Half after, the Man brought a Notice of it: says I, the Pot was here about an Hour and half ago, a Neighbour of mine has got it to sell. I was telling another Neighbour this Master, and he say'd he knew Silvester, and would tell him, and bring him to me. He did so, and I told him, if I had had his Warning a little sooner, I could have stop'd the Pot. He was for having a Warrant to take them up, but I desired him to go and speak to them first. I went with him, and took Evans aside, and told her I had got a Customer, who wanted such a Thing; she said it was too late, she had sold it to another for more, and to one too who had asked no Questions. He got a Warrant for them; and Evans told us then that she had sold it to Mr. Green in the Minories I went thither, but he had it not: but at the next Shop, (Mr. Boddy's we found it.</p>

               <p>- Matthews. The Day Evans was taken up she told me, she had had the Mug 4 Years, and had lent 7l. upon it. I press'd her to tell the Truth, and then she said she found it in the Entry, as she was shutting up her Windows.</p>

               <p>Holderness. Lawrence the Constable on the other side of the Water, had been looking after Dumpling, and he desired me to seize him if I should see him. While I was at work in Leaden-hall-street, I thought I saw him go by; I went after him, and charged him with stealing a shew Glass, he desired to be made an Evidence and put Busk into an Information. I went to Kent street to look for him, as I had been directed, and searched the House, but could not find him: at last we made a Woman who was sitting in the Chimney Corner get up, and found Busk upon his Hands and Knees under the Woman's Petticoats; she had been sitting upon his Back. When he was carryed to the Constable, he desired to be made an Evidence: I told him I would speak to Lawrence about it, if he could do any thing to save his Life: Lawrence would do nothing without the Advice of Justice Lade; he admitted Dumpling to be an Evidence, and then Busk cryed, G - d - my Eyes I shall be jamm'd this time; I wish I might either lye in Jayl, or be transported, but I shall be jamm'd now. He mentioned this Robbery, but could not remember the Particulars, and confessed he had knocked a Boy down in Ratcliff-high way, and took his Hat.</p>

            . The Goods mentioned in the Indictment were my Mother-in-law's, Mrs. Gresswell. She has been confined to her Bed a great while, therefore could not attend here. The young Prisoner lodged at one Mrs. Grigson's, who keeps a Chandler's Shop, and she having a large Quantity of Candles, which she offered to Sale, the Officers of the Excise, suspecting them to have paid no Duty, seized them: They were found to belong to Mrs. Gresswell; upon Enquiry, Grigson owned she had them of Yates the younger: He sted from his Lodging, out at a Back-Do
or, but was taken afterwards in Farthing-Fields, Wap. ping, and before the Justice gave a very frivolous Account of the Fact. We then enquired after the Father; he was employed as a private Watchman by Mrs Gresswell and others, beside the publick Watch, to look after their Houses. Mrs. Gresswell's Cellar-Door had frequently been open'd in the Night, and the Watch-man never gave them notice of it: He was asked the Reason of his giving no notice when the Cellar was open'd, and he told us, he always shut it, and stuck it close with Clay, when it had been open'd: There were some Candles found upon him which he would give no Account of, and therefore the Justice committed him.

            . Now I am Apprentice to Mrs. Gresswell. We frequently found the Cellar Door open, tho' they watch'd for us. I saw 7 Dozen and odd Pounds which were taken by the Constable out of the House; I know them to be my Mistress's Candles, by the Colour, the length of the Cotton, and the drawing off. Young Yates confess'd he sold them to Mrs. Grigson for 3 s. and a Dozen; before Justice Martin, he said the Candles were brought to him by a Man on Tower-hill, but he could give no Account of him, but he own'd his selling them to his Land-lady.</p>

            , Constable. I have some of the Goods, taken upon the Old Gentleman; and at the Place where the Young one lodged we found 71 Pounds conceal'd in Paper. We found but 3 Candles on the old one. When Young Yates was carry'd before the Justice, he said he had the Candles from one Stevens a Watchman belonging to the Custom-house, and that they were Perquisites belonging to his Place.</p>

               <p>Yates, junior. I saw the Cellar Door open'd one Night by a Coach Wheel, and I thought there was no need of disturbing them. How the Candles came into my Room, I cannot tell. I found them under the Stairs, when I went to look for a bit of Wood to make a Fire.</p>
               <p>Yates, junior. I lodged in Grigson's House, and was out of Business. She asked me one Time to go along with her a little Way; I went with her to Tower-hill; we met a Man, she took a Box from him, and said to me Dick carry the Box home for me. I did, and left her with the Man; when she came home she bid me carry the Box up Stairs; whereof I did, it was full of Candles, and I weigh'd them.</p>

            . I was coming over Tower hill, I can't say for the Day of the Month, but it was about 5 in the Morning, and I met Yates the Younger: I asked him how he and his Father did; he desired me to lend him a half-penny for a Dram: This Grigson was with him, and had a Box which she desired Yates to carry over the Hill for her, and she said she would give him 6d. He asked her whether he must carry it up, or leave it belows Stairs; she said, carry it up. I don't know what was in the Box, but I believe she keeps a very disorderly House.</p>
               <p>Constable. We found the major Part of the Candles done up in Dozens in Papers, some few in a Box.</p>
               <p>Justice Martin. When the Boy, and the Witness was before me, he continued in the same Story, that they had them of a Watch-man, belonging to the Custom-house, and that they were brought to him, to a Bulk upon Tower-Hill, and that he carried them to this Witness to sell for him. I asked him if he could find this Man, and he said he could not.</p>
               <p>Yates, jun. Mrs. Grigson bid me say such and such Words before the Justice; whereof I being ignorant of any such Affair, did so. She hired me once when a Box came in, to carry a Letter and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173602250020"/> the Box to her Mother's at St James's; whereof I did so, and her Mother when she had read the Letter, paid me 18s.</p>
