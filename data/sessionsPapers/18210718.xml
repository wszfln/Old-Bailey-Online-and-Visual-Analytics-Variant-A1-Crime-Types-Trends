On Sunday, the 27th of May, about half-past five o'clock in the morning, I examined a box which was in my bed-room, there were 100 l. in Bank of England notes, among which was one of 50 l., also eighteen sovereigns, a 7 s. piece, and some wearing apparel, and at half-past five o'clock on the Monday morning. I found the box had been broken open, and they were all gone; the prisoner had lived with me for about a month, and did so at this time. As soon as my husband came home I told him - The prisoner had been taken up about a disturbance; she was brought home, and my husband gave her in charge for this robbery, suspecting her; she was searched, in my presence, by Read, and accused a young man, a gentleman's servant, with it; he was taken up, but discharged. She said if any body knew where the money was, he did. I have found none of the property.</p>

            . On the 27th of May, I lived at the Cock, and remember the money being missed; I saw the prisoner in her mistress's room between three and four o'clock on the Sunday afternoon (she was servant to Mrs. Hobson, who was there for her health); I went in, she had the box lid open, and directly as I went in she shut it down, turned her back to it, and then picked up a basket, and put it on the top of the box; I asked her what she was looking for - she said for her white apron; I asked her what she had on her arm. (she had an apron there.) She said that was one, and she was looking for the other, to lend to me, as I had greased mine; I said the one she had on would do for me - she said she did not like to see girls without white aprons on of a Sunday afternoon. She went up stairs about ten minutes before I did. I came down again, and she came down after me, almost directly, and went into the bar. I afterwards went up stairs with her to clean herself. She said nothing to me.</p>

When we were at the office I asked her if she knew where the money was; she said she did not know any thing about it, but that a young man, a cousin of her's, who had visited her that afternoon, about four o'clock, asked her if she knew where her mistress's money was, and she told him; that he went up stairs into her mistress's room, with a crow-bar, which he brought with him, opened the box, and took the money out.

               <p>COURT. Q. Was that the first thing they did - A. Yes; my Lord, and immediately after I felt my watch drawn from my fob, they rushed against me, and drove me back a considerable distance, and I then felt my watch drawn from me. I left the child with a person, and followed - I can positively swear to Summers and Edwards being two of them. Edwards is the man who was dancing about - he was within five or six yards of me; I do not know that he crossed over, or that he ran against me - nor did I observe Summers do any thing; I did not observe him till I went in pursuit of them, he was then within six or eight yards of me when I first saw him, which was immediately after I had been robbed, and he was one of the men who were running away. I followed Summers and some other men for about ten minutes. I observed him the moment I began the pursuit - he ran, and I followed. Reynolds, the constable, joined in the pursuit; we followed them into a court which was no thoroughfare, and there lost sight of them; we crossed Whitechapel, and returned and in about five minutes Reynolds took Summers in Wentworth-street, in a state of exhaustion, from running, and in a violent perspiration. I identified him, and am sure he is the man. I saw Edwards in custody with eight others, at Worship-street, next morning, and am sure of him; I had observed his features particularly, and the curious way his hat was cut. I had not noticed Emanuel in the crowd myself. I have not found my watch - it was safe when they rushed against me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. Was not Edwards very drunk - A. I observed him particularly, and do not think he was from the manner in which he acted - when the people pushed him he pushed them again. Several people rushed against me. My watch was gold.</p>

            . I am a constable of Christchurch. On the 21st of June I saw the three prisoners in company with twenty or thirty others - I knew them well before. I first saw them about half-past eight o'clock in the evening; Edwards was at their head - they called him the bull. I watched them, and saw Mr. Jennings come by on the opposite side of the way to them; when they got opposite to where he stood they all rushed across the road towards him - Edwards was the first that crossed, but they all crossed together, rushed right on Jennings, and immediately afterwards turned round, and ran away. All the three prisoners ran with the rest, I am sure. I pursued, and saw two of the men had hold of something, and saw the watch-chain between them, this was immediately after they separated from the prosecutor - I do not know what became of it, nor who they were - whether they were the prisoners or not; I came up with Summers, and stopped him, standing at the corner of a street, with two others; before I seized him, he turned round, and asked what was the matter - I said he knew, and pushed him into a house - he resisted, and called others to assist him. I was obliged to handcuff him. I took him to Spitalfields watch-house, Jennings came up, immediately as I stopped him, and said</p>
               <p>"That is the man." He made no answer. I went with Lickfold and Barrs in pursuit of the others; we took Emanuel in about half an hour, on the same spot, in Wentworth-street. They were searched, but nothing found on them.</p>

            . I am an officer. Reynolds brought Summers to the watch-house, and gave me a discription of Emanuel, and in consequence of that description, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182107180005"/>apprehended him in Wentworth-street - we met him. I afterwards went with Barrs, to look for Edwards, into Bell-lane, leading into Cox-square, and found him in bed with his clothes on, about twenty minutes after twelve o'clock, at night, he appeared to be asleep. I pulled the bed clothes off, and said</p>
               <p>"Here he is, take him." We told him we wanted him for the robbery that was committed in Brick-lane - he made no reply. I searched the room, and behind the door. I found his hat, which I produce.</p>

            . I am an officer of Christchurch. About a quarter after six o'clock on the evening of the robbery, I was in a hair-dresser's shop, and saw Edwards, come out of Rose-lane, into Fashion-street. and there make a stand; I believe the hat produced to be the same he wore at that time. I saw a mob after him throwing cabbage leaves at him - I did not see Jennings. I did not know any of the others who were with him, I afterwards went with Lickfold, and we took him.</p>
               <p>Q. When Edwards was being taken to the watch-house did he say any thing - A. I told him we wanted him on suspicion of the robbery of a watch in Brick-lane, he said it was hard he should be pulled for it, and that he had none of the swag. I said</p>
               <p>"Had you none of the swag?" He said</p>
               <p>"No, by God, I had none of it." (It means the stolen goods.) I then said to Lickfold,</p>
               <p>"He says he had none of the swag." We took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you first saw him he had a cap on - A. Yes and no shoes or stockings, nor had he when he was in bed. I wanted to bring him away as he was, but he got a pair of slippers from his mother below.</p>

            . I know Edwards. On the night of the robbery, I was charing at the Arches, public house, Osborne-street, he came in there about four o'clock quite insensible with liquor, his hat was not cut then. Several persons who were there were going to pick his pockets, they took his shoes off, I said it was enough for him to spend his money, without being robbed. He went out tumbling about the street, and a parcel of children followed hooting him.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Where do you live - A. At the Arches public-house, in Osborne-street. I have known him great while, but not in that neighbourhood. About two years ago, he lived at his mother's, in Bell-lane, Widegate-alley, that is about a quarter of a mile from the Arches. He left at half past four o'clock, I looked at the clock when he went out. The landlord and landlady were in the bar.</p>

            . On the 11th of June, about a quarter after eight o'clock, I was coming from Islington to the City, and observed the prisoner by the side of the New-river loitering about with another person, they were making motions, I suspected them, and watched them for a quarter of an hour. I saw them go to No. 10, Ashley-row, and look through the blinds, they then came back, and then went to another house, a baker came and they did nothing there. I went on the opposite side of the river, and looked through a large tree, I was about a hundred yards off. I could see that they were the same persons I saw before, I saw one of them open the window at No. 4, one of the two got in, I do not know which of them - the window was down before, I saw them lift it up, and one got in and brought out a writing desk, and a bundle, he gave it out of the window to the other, who took them while he got out, an apron was over the desk, they went down to the river, and crossed Canonbury-fields, I followed them at a distance behind, one carried the bundle and the other the desk, they shifted by turns, and went to the Rosemary Branch, I kept them in sight, and followed them to Queen-street, I saw Morgan, and pointed them out to him, I then went for a constable. They then had the desk and bundle. I returned, with a constable, and Morgan took the prisoner - he was one of them.</p>

A person putting part of their body in could take them. I heard somebody running away, and about eight o'clock that morning, we found four shirts and the gown.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live in Exeter-street. About a quarter before six o'clock in the morning of the robbery, I saw the prisoner, with another person, standing near the corner of Change-court, about ten yards from Horwood's house, standing under the narrow entrance, and saw the one who is not in custody, take an apron from the prisoner, which he had on, and both went up on tiptoe, towards Horwood's - shortly after I saw them both run down the court with something in the apron - I opened the door, ran out, and made an alarm, but being undressed, I could not pursue them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Where were you - A. On the first floor, directly opposite the court. I saw the other man there a quarter of an hour before the prisoner joined him; they went up the court about five minutes after he joined him. I knew the other before.</p>

            . I live in Southampton-place, Strand. On this day I saw the prisoner running through Southampton-place, with another person - I am sure he is one of them. My house is but three minutes walk from Change-court. They ran down into my cellar, I went down stairs, and saw them; the prisoner's companion asked me if I would allow him to leave the linen in the dust-hole - he was then sorting it. I said it was a very improper place to put linen in - he said it was of no consequence, that he had been out all night, having a lark. The prisoner was then going away, his companion told him to stop, and go and have some coffee first. I then went up stairs to work. I afterwards heard of the robbery, and told Jackson about it - he was in the court. I asked him to mind my door, went down into the cellar, and found the prisoner still there, the other was gone. I found part of the linen in the dust-hole, and part down the privy. The other man had asked leave to go to the privy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is your cellar always open - A. Yes; the prisoner did not speak - he heard the conversation. I should know the other again if I saw him.</p>

            . I rent a house in Salisbury-court, in the parish of St. Bride's. I saw the time-piece on the mantle-shelf of the counting-house, on the ground floor, about twelve or one o'clock. Between two and three Salter came in - I was in the one pair front room - she called out that a man had run away with the time-piece, and was gone up Shoe-lane. I pursued, and saw the prisoner in Shoe-lane with it under his arm - he was running as fast as he could. I cried Stop thief! and gained ground on him - he dropped the time-piece in the street; I followed him into a house, where I laid hold of him; he was then dressed quite respectable. I said I was surprised at a man of his appearance doing what he ought not to do. I think he said he was not the man; but I do not exactly know what he said. The time-piece was brought to me half an hour after. I sent for a constable, and gave him in charge. I went into the counting-house, missed the time-piece, and knew that brought back to be mine - it was worth 5 l. - it cost me 10 l.; I have had it eight or nine years; the glass was broken, and the hands were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182107180007"/>lost by its falling.

She went up with me, and showed me the box; I put it on my shoulder, and it fell off - I did not touch it again. I told them I was hired by a woman, but they would not go to look for her.</p>

I watched them and saw them go up to Mr. Knipe. White took hold of his coat, and took his handkerchief out. They then crossed the road, and went through Newport-market, together.

Poles', my bankers, with it - I am sure I sent the same note, but there might be other 15 l. notes among the money I sent. I endorsed it - (looks at one.) This is it - it has D 985 on it, in my writing. I put that on all notes I receive of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How much did he pay you - A. It was 60 l. I will not say he only paid me one 15 l. note.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Pole and Co. bankers, Bartholomew-lane. On Monday the 18th of June, Mr. Smith made a payment at our house - I do not know that I received it, but I marked the notes next morning and paid them into the Bank. I opened the enclosure, and marked the notes. (Looks at it.) This is one - it has No. 2, on the back of the Britannia, which denotes that the notes are taken from Mr. Smith. It was part of the payment made by him on that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have none of your books here - A. No; I examined them a fortnight or three weeks ago. I did not recollect the circumstance till I looked at the book - the entry is made by myself. I do no not know that I received the notes myself. They would pass through several hands before they came to be entered at night; but nobody would open them but the clerk who received them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you, from seeing No. 2 in your writing on the note, swear that it was received from Smith - A. No, I will not.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Alexander's. I attended Mrs. Alexander. The prisoner lived there at the time the notes were missed. I was never in the room the bureau is in, and knew nothing of it till Mr. Ray complained. Martha cleaned the room and made the bed. I have seen the male prisoner at the house two or three times. They are brother and sister. I saw him at the door talking to her twice within a week before it was missed - I never saw him inside the door, and cannot say whether he came in or not. Mrs. Alexander died, and was buried on the 6th of June - between her death and funeral I was up stairs making my master's bed with the prisoner - she said to me,</p>
               <p>"Here is a key, will you have it?" - I said, No, I wanted none but my own - and she threw it out of window. It was small, like a drawer key. I mentioned this to the Justice at the second examination.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. They took you up - A. No; I was not charged with it - I went before the Magistrate as a witness against her - we all went together - I was not confined. I did not remember about the key till the second examination.</p>

I received information and went to Hampstead on the 23d of June, after the prisoner Thomas - I did not find him there, but took him off the Chatham stage, at the Bricklayer's Arms public-house, and told him I took him on suspicion of a robbery at Islington. He said he knew nothing of it. Taylor searched him in my presence, and found four 1 l. notes and 10 s. on him - it was returned to him. We took him to Bow-street; he was remanded till seven o'clock, and before seven we took Martha, at her mother's, in Chapel-street, Pentonville - I said I wanted her to go to Bow-street, and asked if she had been there before - she said, Yes - I said I had her brother in custody. I searched her boxes, but found nothing.</p>

I looked very hard at him, and positively swear he is the man - he was alone; I cannot be mistaken. I have never found my things. The watchman was going his round, crying half-past ten.

            . I live in Rochester-row, and get my living by washing. The prisoner told me she did not think she could swear to the man; this was on Sunday, the day after the robbery. She said she could not tell what coat he wore.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long have you lived there - A. About three months. I never saw the prisoner. His brother-in-law, found me out last Friday, he did not apply to me before he came to my mistress, Mrs. Gibson, No. 1, Rochester-row, who employs him to carry out linen. I have worked there three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have known the brother three months - A. Yes he come there for linen two or three times a week. He lives in Peter-street, he only applied to me last Friday, he subpoened me last Monday night.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear the prosecutrix say, she should not know the man - A. She came the Sunday after the robbery, and asked if I should know the man - I said, I never saw his face, I had heard her call Stop thief! in the street, and saw a man in a long coat, ran down the street. My sister asked if she should know him, she said she should not. I did not tell my mistress, what she said till last Monday - it was known at our house, the day after the robbery that she had said she did not know him. The prisoner's brother, came to the house frequently. My sister is not here, I told his brother that she heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you saw the robbery, now tell me if you will swear he is not the man - A. He is not the man I saw run - I only saw his back, he had a long coat on. I positively swear he is not the man I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. The man you saw commited the robbery - A. I do not know. I saw a man run down Peter-street, I did not see the prosecutrix following him. I heard her call Stop thief! he ran into Duck-lane.</p>
               <p>SARAH WHEELHOUSE re-examined. I never told her that I should not know the man. I saw her on the night of the robbery selling matches, by the public-house door, she came up and said</p>
               <p>"Is it you that was robbed." I said Yes - she said, she should know the man very well if she saw him, and in consequence of her saying so, I went to her next morning.</p>

            . I keep the Green Man and Still, public-house, Pear-street. I remember the prisoner being in my house on the night of the robbery, before it happened; I do not know the day of the month; it was on Saturday, a month or five weeks ago; he came in about half-past nine o'clock with two others, and called for a pot of beer; I do not recollect his going out, but I heard a cry of</p>
               <p>"Stop thief!" in the street. I went to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182107180011"/>bar and heard a piece of work in the street, that a person was robbed of a bundle; and the people who sat there said they were glad they were there, for if they had been out it might be laid to them. I cannot say where the prisoner was then, as our counter is very high; but a minute or two after I saw him talking with them. It was about half-past ten. I cannot say whether he had left the house; I think he was standing up near the spot I saw him in before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far is your house from where the robbery was committed - A. Less than two hundred yards; a person might run there in two minutes. I think he was dressed as he is now; I will not swear it. I do not know when I was asked to come here; it was before last Sessions; my little boy was ill; I did not come; I had no order to come.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in Peter-street. I saw the prosecutrix run by my window, after the thief, as I stood in my shop. The prisoner does not answer the description of the man I saw pass - I thought him a taller man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Who had the best view of him, the person robbed, or you who only had a glimpse - A. I should think she had. I was not asked to come here till last Monday.</p>

            . I keep a lodging-house at No. 17, Duck-lane. On this night I went into the Green Man and Still, public-house, for a pot of beer - it is three doors off, and had returned about a minute, and heard a bustle in the street - I came out, and the prosecutrix said she was robbed of her bundle. I know the prisoner was in the public-house when I went there, smoking with the company. I heard the alarm six or eight minutes after.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know him before - A. I had seen him six or eight times; I know one of the men who was smoking with him - he cannot attend, as he has got a lamplighter's place at Westminster. I went home and laid my cloth for supper, and in less than ten minutes heard the cry. The prisoner was in the house when she came to the door; he had not been out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who applied to you to become a witness - A. A man came last Monday and brought me a paper. I happened to say, I wondered that woman could take such a false oath. I told two or three of the neighbours that he was in the house - I told Cotton, Bowyer, and Mrs. Mason so. I thought if I said much they would have me up, and so I told nobody else. I saw the prosecutrix with the officers on the Sunday looking for the man. Walters pointed her out. I just twigged her face at the public-house door on on the night of the robbery.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner at the Green Man and Still, public-house, on a Saturday night - I think it was four months ago. I had a pint of beer, and Trumble was there drinking. Between ten and eleven o'clock I heard a woman coming down Duck-lane, calling</p>
               <p>"Stop thief!" several times - Trumble was then in the tap-room - I had been there above half an hour or more; he was dressed as he is now.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where do you live - A. At No. 40, Duck-lane. I only knew him by sight - I have known him four or five years. I sell vegetables. I do not know where he lived. He was facing me in the tap-room; it is a small old room. I saw Winch that day at his own door. I did notice him come in. The prisoner was drinking with two more, who I knew by sight - I have seen them since in the street, A friend of the prisoner's asked me to come here last Sessions.

I saw the prisoner go and look into the cart, and then followed Rush to see where he went - he returned and took a basket out of the cart, and walked up Holborn-hill, as far as Field-lane. I went after him and asked if he belonged to the cart - he began to cry, and said he was not in his right senses. I brought him back.</p>

            . I am constable of Aldgate. On Saturday afternoon, the 7th of July, about half-past four o'clock, I saw the prisoner at the corner of St. Martin's-le-grand, with a person who I knew. I saw him try a gentleman's pocket there, but he took nothing. I informed the gentleman - he walked with me to the end of Newgate-street. I saw him try upwards of twenty persons' pockets - the other man was still with him, holding an umbrella over his head to cover him. They turned over to St. Sepulchre's church to the bottom of Skinner-street, and both went under the gateway of the George inn, and stood there some minutes. A gentleman's servant, in a blue livery great coat, went by - they instantly followed him, and opposite Ely-place the prisoner stepped forward, opened the pocket, returned to his companion, and followed the servant to <placeName id="t18210718-21-crimeloc118">Furnival's-inn</placeName>

The prisoner then stopped again, put his left hand into the pocket, and took out his handkerchief, put it into his left hand breeches pocket, and ran down Holborn as hard as he could. I crossed and stopped him, and took it out of his pocket. I saw him put it in. I do not know who the person was.</p>

            . I live at No. 152, Houndsditch. On the 15th of June, between five and six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner (I believe him to be the man) offered forty-two hats for sale, he had them in a bag. I gave him 10 d. each for them; they were new. It is a general price for common felt hats. They were in a rough state - they are very common felt. He was about ten minutes with me. I did not particularly notice him. I asked him who sent him to me - he said he brought them from a person opposite Whitechapel-church, I did not ask the name. I have very little doubt of his being the man.</p>

I found a dead body in the kitchen - I could not see it. I called for a light, and the first thing I saw was one of the heels of her shoes, just above the water; when I moved it, it smelt dreadfully; I pulled the body up against the foot of the stairs - it was the body of a woman, she had a straw bonnet on her head. Brown's brother helped me. I could not tell by the features whose body it was, as I never knew her. The surgeon saw the body.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. When was the body found - A. On the 7th of June; I found it by raking in the water with a clothes prop - the end of it was not pointed. I used it sideways.</p>

            . I am surgeon of the Marylebone Infirmary. I examined the body of the deceased on Thursday or Friday - I believe it was the day it was found. I went to the house when it was found; it was very putrid. I cannot say how long it had been dead, a long time, undoubtedly. I observed the face, the features were nearly removed, it could not be known by the features. I observed a great loss of substance all round the neck on each side, a great part of the flesh was removed by vermin. I saw no marks that I can swear were marks of violence - it appeared to me that rats had been feeding on it; the wounds were so extensive that a person must bleed to death immediately, but they were caused by vermin.</p>

I called for assistance and laid hold of Richards, he got from me in the scuffle, and threw his coat and handkerchief off. The watchman secured him. I am sure he is the same man. I only lost sight of him on turning the corner. Whitaker got behind me, and passed by me as I was scuffling with Richards - he was secured within fifty yards of the place.

            . My sister Charlotte keeps the Red Lettuee public-house. I slept there. I was up last on the night before the 25th of June, and fastened the house up; the back door was fastened with a bolt and chain inside - every thing was safe when I went to bed. I was alarmed about half-past two o'clock by the cry of Thieves! I jumped out of bed, and came down stairs, and found the back door open, and the bar window open. I found the back door had been opened by a small instrument, the chain could be unbooked by putting a wire between the door and post. There were marks inside the front door, as if they had tried to get out there; the clock laid in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the clock before - A. It was nailed up to the wainscot in the tap-room. It was hooked to the wall at the top, and nailed at the bottom with a nail three inches long.</p>

I found him down Well-street Mews on the 19th; he had been absent from them three days. I told him next morning that he had taken his master's pocketbook away - he said he had not seen it. I took him home to my house, my wife was talking to him; what she said I do not know - I think she said he had better tell the truth.</p>

On Monday morning, the 25th of June, I was awoke between five and six o'clock, by the nurse. I got up, and found the kitchen-window was forced up by some instrument, and the bolt forced off; a piece of the pannel of the inside window-shutters cut out, by which the parties were enabled to remove the bar, and get in. There were some embers of wood burnt out, laid on the kitchen floor under the window - it was loose wood, like matches; and there was the mark of a lighted candle having been placed against the wainscot. The wood I suppose was burnt there to give them a light - not to set fire to the house. I found a piece of candle on the parlour carpet, not half an inch long. I missed a variety of articles which were all looked up the night before. The kitchen window was safe the night before. This property was all gone.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. I took the prisoner on the 25th of June, at Mr. Lambert's, the Silversmiths, in Coventry-street, about one o'clock in the day - I found the plate stated in the indictment there. I asked him if he had ever sold any plate there before - he said he had, about six weeks previous. I asked whose it was - he said it was his own, and he had it from his father. I then asked him how he came by this which he was offering for sale - he said that was his own property likewise, and that he received it from his mother. I then searched him, and found a snuff-box in his waistcoat pocket, with the prosecutor's name in it; a gold seal, and a small metal seal; and a lock, apparently of a desk, in his breeches pocket, and three duplicates - one for the flute. He said he found them.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Lambert. The prisoner offered the spoons and forks for sale, on the 25th of June, between twelve and one o'clock - suspecting him, as he had sold plate six weeks before, we begged him to leave them to ascertain their value. He returned in half an hour - we had an officer ready, who took him. The plate is worth 6 l.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the property, on the 26th of June, of one Simpson. I had bought household furniture of him two months previous. I left it at this house for sale, as I wanted the money, to go to another sale. I pawned the flute, as I wanted money to go to market. When I went back I was detained - if I had stolen it I should not have returned. I paid for it in the presence of a respectable witness, named Bartholomew.</p>

I had pulled my brooch out of my neck handkerchief, and put it in my left-hand breeches pocket, where my notes were. I had four 10 l. Bank of England notes and one Bristol note in my left-hand breeches pocket - I was quite sober. I felt the notes at the bottom of my pocket when I put the brooch in it. I awoke at twenty-five minutes before five o'clock, and she was gone. I found the lining of my breeches pocket torn out, and my property gone - she had left her gloves and stays behind. I found her in White Lion-street, Seven Dials, about five o'clock that morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How came you out so late - A. It was nearly two o'clock when I drove my master from the Opera. They called the prisoner Mrs. Payne. A girl, named Fuller, told me where to find her. I am sure she is the woman - I had seen her before with a woman whom I knew.</p>

I cut half a yard, which came to 10 d. She then asked to see some lace. I fetched a box from the top of the shop - they both looked at it, and said it was not the sort they wanted; they wanted it to match. I said it was impossible to match without a pattern - they begged me to fetch another box, saying they knew the pattern. I fetched another box to them - they examined it (I had taken the first box away). I took one piece of lace out to show them, they took it in their hands, and then they took out two or three cards to look at themselves, and kept it sometime in their hands - I watched, and saw one card of lace drop on the lap of Hart, from the hand of Flannagan. Flannagan then took up another card, and said that was the lace she wanted; before they took up this card they put back the cards of lace which they had in their hands, except that which dropped in Hart's lap. Flannagan desired me to cut off three quarters of a yard - I cut it off the last card, it was worth 3 s. 8 d. a yard - I cut it off, put the lid of the box down, and put it away. I then told Mr. Copplestone (a person in the shop) what I had seen; he immediately took hold of Hart, I think, and took her into a room; and Flannagan was taken by another shopman into the room.</p>

A man came before me, apparently accidentally, I put my came up across myself and the lady, to prevent his coming against us, and he passed us, and just as he got by, the prisoner came up with his hands closed before him, he appeared to come against me accidentally, he unclosed his hands, and got hold of my chain and seals, and made a violent pull at them. I put my hand down to save them, and having a chain round my neck, and fixed to the watch, he did not get them away with that pull, he then gave the chain a twist, and laid hold of me by the collar, and swung me round, and at the same time forced the chain away and ran off. I pursued, and when he got about five yards, (I was close to him) he turned down a very narrow alley, at the end of which there was some steps, and at the bottom of these steps, he turned into another narrow alley on the right, it was only wide enough to admit of one person; and, at the corner, I was in the act of seizing him, when he knocked me down, and said,</p>
               <p>"You *** what do you want with me," and ran off immediately along the passage, and while I was raising, and nearly up, four or five of his gang kicked me on the loins, and on my back. I cut at them with my cane, and ran off after the prisoner, who was still in sight, the passage being so narrow, the gang could not get before me without knocking me down. I ran after him, he was turning round a gateway, at the end which led into Sun-street - I was nearly up with him, I there was seizing him, when one of the gang who had knocked me down, seized me, and said,</p>
               <p>"You *** what do you want with him, he has nothing of yours." I said,</p>
               <p>"You villain, let me alone." I struck him in the face with my cane, which was in my right hand, and with my left arm shoved him away and disengaged myself. I still had sight of the prisoner, and had hardly got under the bar which crossed the gateway, when he got under the bar into Sun-street, I after him, and hallooed out Stop thief! - I had not lost sight of him; he ran on, and got to the end of Sun-street - still in my sight. I was so close to him, as to keep cutting at him with my cane, and occasionally hitting him; he was crying Stop thief! as well as me, and at the end of Sun-street, a coach was passing, (it was at Bishopsgate-street end) which nearly stopped him from crossing Bishopsgate-street; he did however cross the street, and I after him, close by him, and still in sight, and at the end of Union-street, he laid hold of me himself, and said</p>
               <p>"You b - y villain, what do you want of me, don't follow me," and then let me go. I followed him, still crying Stop thief! will no one stop a thief; a man then seized him, and appeared in the act of letting him go, when I came up and cut at them both, supposing he was one of the party also - he did let him go. I still ran crying Stop thief!</p>
               <p>"You villain, will no one stop you;" he then ran down Union-street towards the church. I pursued, keeping close to him; a man came up and was going to seize him. I heard him say,</p>
               <p>"Don't stop me;" he was gone a-head, and the man let him go. I said,</p>
               <p>"That is the villain, why don't you stop him;" the prisoner, then turned down another street, I still pursuing and calling out; a quantity of people were round and alongside, down the street, which was Duke-street. I was again in the act of seizing him, when a man seized me by the throat, I fell down, fainted, and lost him for the first time, and he got away.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you declare safely on your oath that he is the man - A. I have not the least doubt whatever. I had him in view ten minutes or upwards, and have not the least doubt whatever of him; the chain broke from the watch in consequence of the violence of the pull. The metal chain round my neck kept the watch.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You did not call Stop thief! till you got down the turning - A. Yes, immediately as he took them. He was not out of my sight till I fainted, except in turning the alley for an instant.</p>
               <p>Q. When the gang were kicking you, you lost sight of him - A. Yes, but the passage was so narrow, I could not help seeing him, and there was nobody to be seen before me but him. I am sure I caught sight of the same man again. I saw him at the watch-house five or six minutes after I fainted, and recognised him among a number of people. I was led to the watch-house, in consequence of what the mob said. The constable produced the chain and seals. I claimed them in the prisoner's hearing, and found one seal was gone; one had my initials and crest on. When I said one was gone, the constable said,</p>
               <p>"I think I heard him drop something, and I will go and see;" he went and brought in the other seal covered with mud. I was very ill used, and bruised dreadfully. I am bruised now all over my body.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Are you sure I am the man who robbed you - A. I am, I positively swear it, I have no doubt of it.</p>

On the evening of the 10th of July, I was with Mr. Trust about half-past nine o'clock, in Sun-street, nearer Bishopsgate-street than Finsbury-square, a man crossed us, Mr. Trust put up his cane to prevent his coming against us; he passed us, and instantly the prisoner came - the lamps were lit. I am quite sure of him, he came with his hands folded before him, and with his right hand gave Mr. Trust rather a violent blow (it was more a push than a blow) and with his left snatched at his seals, which hung out visible, the snatch turned him round, and he directly ran down a passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whether he did any thing else - A. No, I was alarmed; he ran down a passage, the prosecutor followed him, and so did I a little way down, till I found myself surrounded by five or six men. I then returned, and afterwards saw some persons running out of another gateway, but could not distinguish them.</p>

I was coming down Union-street, about half-past nine o'clock at night, on the other side of Bishopsgate-street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182107180019"/>and heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw five persons, three of my side of the way, and two on the other side with the prisoner in the centre; they were running, and all crying Stop thief!</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive he is the person you saw in the centre of the five - A. I am - I stepped into the road and seized him by the collar, because he was in the centre, and pushed him to get him into Bishopsgate-street to the light; the party of five closed in upon me, and I saw no person near me but these five; there was a cry of floor him, serve him out. I was hit over the head and shoulder with fists, I kept still pushing him towards Bishopsgate-street, but they hustled me. I was then struck two or three times with a stick. I could distinguish nobody coming up, and thought it dangerous to persevere, and let go. I met Mr. Trust in Duke-street, he complained of being robbed, and afterwards went to the watch-house, he had a swelling on the hip where he had been kicked; the prisoner was there. I was quite sure he was the man I had hold of in Union-street, and told him so.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What induced you to fix on him - A. Because I knew all the party. They were running and appeared to be guarding him, and he was a-head of them. I had watched them in the streets before.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in Union-street, Spitalfields. On the 10th of July, about nine or ten o'clock at night, I was standing by my door and heard the cry of Stop thief! I saw a man go up Duke-street, which is about a hundred and fifty yards from my door. I went up Steward-street, thinking the party might come that way, and at the bottom of that street I saw the prisoner run by. I have not the least doubt of his being the man. I have seen him about before. I seized him; he was crying out Stop thief!" himself at the time. Directly I caught him he held up his right arm, and called out Charley! Charley! and at that moment, something fell from his hand, I could not see what it was. I thought he had something else in his hand, I forced his hand open and found a gold chain, and three seals, a key, a gold ring, and part of another seal. I took him to the watch-house, and in about twenty minutes, the prosecutor came in. There were six or eight people there. Directly he saw the prisoner he charged him with it, the moment he saw him. I showed him the property, and asked if that was all he had lost. He said part of a seal was missing. I said I heard something drop, and thought I could find it. I went to the spot where I took him, with a light, and in less than two minutes I found the part of the seal, where I thought I had heard him drop something. It corresponds with the part that remained. The prosecutor claimed it, he described it before I went after it. He said it had a white stone in it.</p>

            . I live in Steward-street. On the evening of the robbery I was standing at my door and heard a cry of Stop thief! coming down Duke-street, and Steward-street. I saw a tall man come a-head of the mob down the middle of the street, ten or twelve yards before the rest of the mob. I run and seized him and the moment I did so, a young man came up and said</p>
               <p>"That is the man" - he was then pointing to the person whom Miller had seized, I losed him, and directly went to Miller's assistance, and held the prisoner while he wrenched the seals out of his hand; he cried out - Charley, Charley! and, as I thought, wanted them to rescue him; there was five or six of the gang hallooing out</p>
               <p>"Rescue him" and using very bad expressions. We took him to the watch-house, I heard nothing drop. I afterwards saw the prosecutor at the watch-house. He complained of being much kicked. I put my hand to his hip and there was a bump as big as my fist; he was in a fainting state. I was obliged to hold him up to support him, he said the prisoner was the man who robbed him.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About half-past nine o'clock, I was walking down Paternoster-row, with another young man named

            , we were on the left hand side and heard the cry of Stop thief! and at the corner of Duke-street, we saw the young man running; he threw his hands behind him, and dropped the chain and seals. I picked them up, called Charley to run after the thief with me, and the gentleman took me. I said I am not the man, let me go. He let me go, and run after the man, and caught hold of me again. I said I have a right to keep them to give to the gentleman, to get a trifle, being a poor lad. I would not let them go without force.</p>

On the 18th of May, the prisoner came in and asked the price of cut glass decanters, and said he came from Mrs. Lee of the Stamp Office, Somerset House, and wished to see some, that she saw in the window on Saturday. I did not know Mrs. Lee. He wished to know the price - that he might let Mrs. Lee know. I said three guineas. He whistled, and said that would be too much, and went away. He returned in about half an hour, and said Mrs. Lee wished me to let him take them to shew her. I said I would take or send them myself, in a little time. He said they must come directly, as Mr. Lee was going to leave town, and Mrs. Lee wished him to see them before he left, as she had fixed her mind on them. I took them out of the window, and went towards Somerset house, he went before me. I found him at Somerset house. We went down the area into the door, and partly up a flight of steps, and there he said</p>
               <p>"I must take them to my mistress myself," and took the basket from my hand. I waited twenty minutes, or half an hour, but never saw him or the basket again. I could find no Mr. Lee there. On the Saturday, I found there was a Mr. Lee in the Antiquarian Office. On the 15th the prisoner passed my door in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182107180020"/>Northumberland-street, I walked behind him to Scotland-yard, and collared him, and said</p>
               <p>"You are the man who had my decanters, do not you remember me." He made no answer. I said</p>
               <p>"You cannot have forgotten me." He turned round, and twisted himself from me, leaving part of his coat in my hand. I pursued, calling Stop thief! he made a kick at me, I have been lame ever since. I secured him, and am confident he is the man; he put himself in an attitude to strike me, he doubled his fist but missed me.</p>

I said, Mr. Mann was not within, but Mrs. Jackson was, and I would deliver a message to her. On the day the decanters were taken I saw a man pass through into the shop, and thought he appeared like the man, but could not be sure. But I am certain he is the man who called before.</p>

On the 3d of June, I missed two snuff-boxes from my mantle-shelf, one a musical, and the other an agate one; they laid usually on the chimney-piece. I had not seen the prisoner at my house that day, but was informed he had been there under pretence of writing a letter to me - he had lately come from abroad.</p>

            , JUN. On Monday the 18th or 19th of June, in consequence of information, I went to the house of a friend, where I understood the prisoner was, and in consequence of what I stated to him, I received from him two duplicates which I delivered to my father. I went to the pawnbrokers with the duplicates with my father, to Flemmings, in Fleet-market, and there found one musical snuff-box.</p>

On the night of the 19th of July, we shut up the house and went to bed, about twelve o'clock - my husband was out of town. I fastened the door myself, and soon after twelve o'clock, I heard a noise of doors opening, and footsteps about the house, I sat up in my bed, and the noise continued for nearly two hours. I heard the watchman go half-past three o'clock, and heard the bar taken off the stair-case window, I got up in about ten minutes, and opened my bed-room door, and saw a man standing at the back door - it was then light; he endeavoured to escape and got into the area - I spoke to him. He called me very bad names, and said his name was James, when I asked him - he was about five yards from me - it was the prisoner, I am certain - he got out of the area. I heard the parlour window open, and called Watch! he got into the street, and in five or ten minutes, the watchman brought him back with another lad. I found all my tea-spoons strewed about a chair which I had left in a cupboard, my work-box was broken open, and a receipt taken out. I lost three silver spoons from the cupboard; a thimble and pen-knife from a small box near the kitchen drawers. I am sure the silver spoons were in the cupboard the night before - I put them there. All the drawers were opened in the kitchen, and the things strewed about; the fan-light of the area was broken - he must have got through there. When he was brought back he was searched, and my pen-knife and some receipts found on him, and a small lion's head, which an officer, who lodged with me, had given to my little boy - the spoons were not found.</p>

I went out and he followed me - I had been drinking freely, but knew what I was about, and what passed; he made a rush at me, took hold of my right-hand pocket and knocked me down, he struck me on the breast and thrust his hand in my pocket - I am sure he is the man; the blow knocked me down. He took a sovereign, two half-crowns, and three shillings, out of my pocket, and ran away.

A carriage came by, with a coachman and footman on it - he told them to take no notice of what I said, for I was a woman he had lived with. I never lived with him, nor ever saw him before that night. After the carriage was gone by, he said,</p>

They both came, and one of them almost rode on him before he would get off me. A poor man came by, took me up, and led me to Paddington. The prisoner ran off, towards Kilburn, with the money and handkerchiefs. I saw him next morning; I went to the public-house to look after him, and there he sat with thirty more men - he was in custody. I knew him to be the man - I am sure of him. He took a handkerchief out of his hat and said</p>

On Friday morning, the 15th of June, between seven and eight o'clock, I was at the private door, and saw the prisoner go in a direction from the shop door, between three and four yards from the door, walking at a middling pace, with something under his arm. I walked after him, and asked him if he wanted to see Mr. King - he said No, not particularly. I said if he had any thing to leave I would give it to him - he said No, not particularly, he was not at home. While I was talking to him I saw the corner of a piece of Irish cloth under his coat, and charged him with stealing it. He said nothing. I called Garland, and we took it from him, and gave him in charge. It measured twenty-six yards, and worth two guineas.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Jay. On the 5th of July, at night, as I came in, I saw the prisoner put a sack in the shutter-box in the street. He said it was sacks - I told him it looked very suspicious; that it was very wrong, and might cause suspicion. He said</p>
               <p>"I thank you, Mary; it will create suspicion, but I did not think of it." In about ten minutes I found the sack in the shop, and this hair in it. After he had shut up, he took it away; I followed, and made him bring it back. He begged me not to tell my master; but my mind was so hurt I told my master next morning. He went to work as usual, and was taken.</p>

He did not appear to be firing at any thing; he appeared firing across the field which has footpaths across it - he took from his pocket (apparently) a cartridge, and discharged the piece again; he appeared to put paper in; he attempted to discharge it, not in the same direction as before, but towards some palings about seventy yards from where he stood - the palings were different heights, none of them were higher than seven feet; I stood very near him; he said nothing; he had some children which he brought out from the place. The paling encloses Mr. Cubitt's premises - he is a builder. In a minute, or a minute and a half, there was a hue and cry, that a man had been shot on the other side of the paling. I went to the spot. In about half an hour I saw a man taken on a shutter. I went into the livery-stables, and saw them bringing a man by on a shutter, in a direction from Cubitt's yard. I stopped at the stables. The prisoner was about four yards from me in the field.</p>

            . I am a student of medicine. I was in the hollow of the field, between the gate of the stables and Bagnigge Wells, about 50 yards from the person who fired - I do not know who it was. When I got in a direct line between him and Bagnigge Wells, he fired, I turned round, and saw him fire the second time, as if he was firing at the paling - two or three people came running to me in about a moment, and asked who had fired the gun - I pointed in the direction he went - he had walked away into the stable-yard - they said a man had been shot; I went towards the place, but the wounded man was taken away. I observed the paling two or three days after, and noticed the marks of a ball having penetrated it, four or five feet from the ground.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The person who shot went quietly into the stable, not running away - A. No.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Cubitt, a builder. Between five and six o'clock in the evening, I was in the yard at this time, close to the man who fell. I should think there were twenty people there. I and the deceased were getting up bricks - the man fell down by my side, and knocked me down almost. I heard the report of a gun. He laid down on the ground; he was wounded in the hip-bone; he was in good health before; some blood came from him; I got assistance, and caught him in my arms; he bled very much. They took him on a shutter to the hospital. I did not see him after.</p>

            . I am a painter. I was working at the light horse livery-stables. I saw the prisoner there about six o'clock, with a carbine, and some children with him, playing; he fired the carbine once in my sight, outside the stables, between them and Bagnigge Wells; he then stood in a direction towards Bagnigge Wells, not towards Cubit's yard, but in a direction from the place. I went inside the gate, and heard the report of the piece again. The prisoner came into the gate, and appeared very unconcerned. Nobody then knew of any mischief being done. He had the carbine in his hand. In four or five minutes the people came running, and said a man was shot - the prisoner was not in my sight then. I am sure he is the boy who fired first. His father is head hostler to the stables - he assists his father, and bears a good character.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden office. On the 29th of June, about half-past six o'clock, I took the prisoner, and charged him with shooting the carbine off, and killing a man with it. He said he was extremely sorry for it, but that he did not see any body when he fired. I think he could not see over the paling, He said he shot down the field first, with nothing in the carbine; but the second time put in a ball cartridge, but did not ram it down, and shot it at the paling, to see if he could hit them, but could see nobody behind them. He seemed very sorry, and gave me the carbine.</p>

On the 23d of June, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to the shop, with a child in her arms, and asked the price of some sewing cotton, to sell again. I went to the end of the shop to know the price - several pieces of satin laid on the counter, near where she stood. I returned and told her the price, she gave no answer, but walked out. I missed nothing till the officer brought her back with it, it had our private mark on it - she had asked for none - she begged forgiveness.</p>

I had followed her from Mr. Simpson's door, and stopped her in the passage of a public-house, lifted up her shawl and found the satin, and asked where she got it, she said a person in the street gave it to her to sell for her.</p>

I saw the prisoner sitting on the left of Mr. Moseley - I was in the parlour after that, and went out about a quarter before eight o'clock, and saw the prosecutor sitting there, and the prisoner by him; there might be ten or twelve people in the house. I remained in the room five or six minutes, then left the house, and told Moseley to take care of his property, and give it to the landlord, as he was in bad company - he felt, and found his pocket-book safe then.</p>
               <p>MR. MOSELEY. When I got up, my pocket-book was gone, the bottom of my pocket was cut out. The militia were being trained.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was with two comrades at the time the property was lost. I offered to go any where with them, knowing myself innocent.</p>

I said "Do," and he did so; I put the window down and looked through the glass, and saw some soldiers beating a man, there were ten or twelve soldiers, our passage door was shut. The man they were beating under the window happened to be one of my lodgers, whom I did not know. I saw this man bend his back (he was very tall) and turn in at the door; the soldiers all followed the poor man in, and my husband and I got up, and the first thing they did was to knock me down. I was so stunned, that I saw no more till I saw my husband laying down on the floor with his hands stretched out, he was bleeding from his head - he could not say a word. I went for a doctor, he was taken away to the hospital. I was with him when he died - he died in four days.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What lodgers had you in your house - A. I cannot say. I take in poor people - match makers and that sort. I had seven or eight lodgers; the man they beat had lived two years with us, backward and forward - he is now absent: he was one of Mr. Saunders's shewmen. One of the lodgers had opened the door to see what was the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. You was knocked down by the rush of the door against you - A. No; my room door always stands open. I was knocked down in the parlour, with my head against the fire-place. My husband was in another room, facing the parlour, on the other side of the passage - we call that the kitchen, or travellers' room, where the nightly lodgers go. There are three wooden steps which lead up to the street door.</p>

Some had red jackets on and some white; there was a drummer in full regimentals - it was the prisoner M'Carthy; I was looking out of my window, they were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182107180027"/>in the Almonry, running all manner of ways.

            . I am a private in the 18th regiment of Hussars. On the 18th of June, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I was in Dean-street, above fifty people were collected (inhabitants and soldiers together). I could not observe what they were about till they got into the Almonry. I saw the soldiers and the inhabitants quarrelling and fighting together. Some of the inhabitants, met the soldiers on the top of the New-way, a great disturbance took place between them at the time they were moving towards Orchard-street, which is between the top of the New-way and St. Ann's-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Would they have to pass Cagle's house from the New-way to St. Ann's-lane - A. Yes; I went as far as the top of Orchard-street, and stopped just by the public-house there, three or four doors from Cogle's house, but not in sight of it, and saw several of the Queen-square police officers bringing some soldiers back - they were very much cut about the head - they brought them down to the watch-house, and remained there some little time. and then there was another riot between the soldiers and inhabitants, and some of the soldiers were put in the watch-house, they then dispersed, in different directions, peaceably, and I went to my quarters. About half an hour after the people were in a bustle in the street. My quarters are the Hoop and Grapes, Queen-square. I stopped in the Broadway, and remained there during the evening. I saw no more.</p>
               <p>Q. From the first of what you saw, until the officers taking the men into custody, did you see any one you knew - A. I saw M'Carthy among the rest, he was in his full dress, with his side-arms hanging by his side, and he had his sword across his two thighs, sheathed - it hung in his belt in the scabbard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was M'Carthy in the midst of them, or how - A. He was in different parts with the soldiers; I did not see that he was more officious than any of the others. When I saw him last he came out of Tothill-street, down through the Almonry; there was a number of soldiers and inhabitants with him - he was going in front, and I suppose a hundred soldiers and inhabitants following him. I believe none of the soldiers had side-arms. I saw two or three of the mob with sticks, one with a brown stick, another with a piece of paling; they were carrying them in their hands, going through the mob together.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in the hands of the soldiers, or the inhabitants - A. Both; but the inhabitants dispersed as quick as they could when the riot began again. Sometimes the inhabitants followed the soldiers, and sometimes the soldiers followed the inhabitants. I saw one man struck by a soldier, but I do not know who the soldier was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the five prisoners in the course of that evening, while the disturbance was going on - A. I saw M'Carthy; I do not recollect any of the others. He was in full dress, with the soldiers - sometimes with the mob, and sometimes not. I heard him speak in Tothill-street, when he was walking in front of the mob, but what he said I could not tell - he appeared to me to be rather intoxicated. He was walking on, with his sword across his thigh. I saw one inhabitant struck by a soldier, on his head, in the New-way - I do not know his name. I do not think I should know the soldier again, he was so disfigured and bloody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BROADRICK. Q. How long do you suppose all this occupied - A. About two hours; a great deal of it was after some of the soldiers were put in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q.M'Carthy held his sword in his hand sheathed, was it not the best posture he could put it in to prevent any one snatching it from the sheath - A. I should think so.</p>

            . On the 18th of June, I lived in Orchard-street; Cogle lived at No. 62, in the same street, on the same side of the way; about eight in the evening I was at my door, I heard a noise and went into the middle of the road, and saw a mob of soldiers come up the New-way towards Cogle's, there were eight or nine of them, they were running up the New-way - a man named Rowbottom, in a white jacket, was the first that entered Cogle's house, he had a piece of paling in his hand, that is the man, (pointing him out) I am positive - the others all followed into Cogle's house - I went on the step of my door to move some things which I had there, and went into the middle of the road - in five or ten minutes, in view of Cogle's house, a few people had then collected about the house, some of them were soldiers - I then saw Rowbottom come out of Cogle's house with a piece of paling in his hand - there was a poor man running along the street, and Rowbottom ran after him; the rest of the soldiers came out of Cogle's - I cannot say that I took such notice of any one so much as Rowbottom, because he had a black eye - I know M'Carthy, I saw him standing on the step of Cogle's door, with one foot on the step; this was before Rowbottom came out, he stood on the step with a sword drawn in his hand, waving it backwards and forwards over his head - I do not know what became of him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him standing on the step of the door after you removed your things or before - A. Before, and afterwards the soldiers had entered the house, when I returned, he was gone - I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You were absent five or ten minutes from when you saw the soldiers enter till you returned - A. Yes.</p>

            . I live at No. 12, Orchard-street. Between seven and eight o'clock, I was at home and heard a noise, I went to the corner of the New-way, and saw the soldiers running up New-way - eighteen or twenty of them - they came up into Orchard-street; they had sticks and pieces of wood in their hands - a great number of people stood there, and when the soldiers came up, they all gave way - I returned and went to Cogle's house, and there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182107180028"/>they knocked a man down at Cogle's door - I cannot say which was the man who did it - the man got up and was knocked down again; they all rushed into Cogle's house after the man, and then a man in drummer's clothes came up and ran in also - I had seen the drummer coming up the New-way, with the others behind; he entered Cogle's house, he made a stand at the door with a sword in his hand, across his thigh, and then went into the house; it was drawn; a man ran out, and the soldiers after him, and then the drummer came out and stood for a moment, and after looking to his right and then to his left, went after the soldiers who were beating the man - he had his sword drawn in his hand, and ran up the street after the others - I remained at the door; I saw him return afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What are you - A. A butcher; my shop is not far from Cogle's and on the opposite side - I think I saw Timbrell at her door - there was a considerable number of persons collected at the top of New-way, the people were all as quiet as possible.</p>
               <p>Q. No fighting or expressions against the soldiers - A. Not the least; they were blaming the soldiers among themselves for the manner they acted - I was in the middle of the people at the top of New-way, none of them had any thing in their hands - a young man ran into my shop with something in his hand, he was not a soldier - I was not in my shop half a minute before the soldiers came down Orchard-street - when the soldiers came up we all gave way; the man that was knocked down got up and ran into Cogle's, (I believe he lodged there), and the soldiers followed him - M'Carthy just made a stand at the door, when he came out, but when he went up, he went straight in - I did not see him move his sword over his head, I saw it across his thighs, and he went straight in.</p>

            . I live in Orchard-street, just opposite Cogle's; I heard a noise in the Almonry, about five o'clock, it lasted till about eight - I was looking out of my one pair of stairs window at a quarter before eight o'clock, and saw the soldiers enter from the corner of New-way, (which is three doors off) into the street with great fury, with sticks and pieces of paling - I saw a drummer with a sword at Mrs. Cogle's door, but I lost sight of him by the others coming up and beating one of Cogle's lodgers - I saw the soldier go in and come out.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was the drummer when you last saw him. - A. On the step of the door - I did not have him in sight a moment, he had a sword drawn in his hand, and was holding it over his head, some of the soldiers ran in and a great many ran another way, that is all I know - I saw all the prisoners there, I know them by their looking up at me while they were in action - the left side of Rowbottom's face was very much beat; I saw them all five before my house, and saw them next morning in custody, and did not know them there exactly in the flurry, but when I went before the jury, I knew them better.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BROADRICK. Q. Besides the soldiers, did you not see a great many loose characters with shovels, pickaxes and different instruments - A.

               <p>Q. Did you not see Cogle at his door - A. No; I heard him reading the death of Abel, as he read loud - there was very great confusion; every one was obliged to close their houses.</p>

            . I lived in the same house with Cogle. I was in Orchard-street about eight o'clock, and saw the soldiers coming down the New-way, towards Orchard-street, with sticks and staves in their hands - the people were running before them, and they were running in a brutish manner; I made my way from Cogle's, to get home, and when I got there, some of them had got up to Cogle's house before I got there; a man in a drummer's dress stood in the centre of the lobby, over against the door leading to the kitchen, inside the passage. I went forward, he made a cut at me, but missed me, and cut Mr. Cogle on the side of the head, Cogle fell down by the side of the drawers. I went through the kitchen door into the yard, I got over a railing and got away. I do not know what became of the drummer, I left the door open when I ran in. M'Carthy must have entered before me. I cannot say how many went in before me, nor do I know whether any one but M'Carthy entered before me. I cannot swear to them - I do not know who the drummer was.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been mentioning M'Carthy by name, why did you call him so - A. I heard people calling him M'Carthy. I should not know him again, they called the drummer M'Carthy - I cannot point him out.</p>

I was in custody on a charge of desertion.</p>

            . I am a private in the West Midlesex Militia, and lived at the deceased's house. I was standing at the door between seven and eight in the evening, and saw a great mob come up the street out of the New-way. I observed Rowbottom and M'Carthy among them - I am sure of them, they were about the centre of the mob; they came down towards where I stood. When they came to the door, I heard some of the soldiers, whom I do not know, say,</p>
               <p>"These are the very ****, we will let them know this is Waterloo day."</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect yourself, did you hear any thing else said - A. No, not to my knowledge. I know M'Carthy and Rowbottom by sight, but was never acquainted with them. I believe Rowbottom said something, but I forget what it was. I saw Rowbottom enter the house, he had a piece of railing with two sharp edges to it, and I believe, one or two followed him. M'Carthy was in his drummers dress, and had a sword - most of the soldiers had sticks. M'Carthy followed into the house with his sword drawn. The kitchen is on the right, and the parlour on the left. I saw Ashton standing in the kitchen, near the door, and saw M'Carthy cut right over his shoulder with his sword, it missed him and cut Cogle on the head. Ashton got out of the way, but M'Carthy made a second blow at the deceased, but whether that blow struck him I cannot say. The first cut produced blood, and as he was falling, M'Carthy struck at him a second time. The soldiers kept rushing in, and I made the best of my way up stairs, and fainted away on the bed. I was cut on the head, and was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182107180029"/>ten days under the doctor's hands. I produce the hat I had on - it is cut.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you state to the Magistrate all you have now said - A. No, I was not asked to state it. I had been out of Cogle's three or four minutes when the crowd came towards there. I saw none of the disturbance before they came up. I did not state about M'Carthy before the Magistrate, because he was not brought up. I did not mention about Cogle being wounded. I was ordered to attend in the evening, and M'Carthy was not then taken, so I went away. Rowbottom had a black eye and some scratches - he was not much bruised.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. When you were examined, was the man dead - A. No, I was obliged to go to Uxbridge with the Militia for twenty-one days, or I should have been taken for a deserter, so I could not attend the next examination. I attended at Queen-square when I returned, but was not examined.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Cogle was dead when you returned - A. Yes.</p>

            , we live in Orchard-street, on the same side as Cogle. I first saw them coming into the street about twenty minutes before eight o'clock; there was a great many persons indeed, they came with sticks in their hands, beating a man up the narrow part of the street - I did not observe any of their faces, the man they were beating, ran across towards Cogle's; he went up the steps, and the soldiers followed him. I saw him go into the house, three soldiers followed him up the steps, and went in - I went away. I do not know how many more went in - I did not know them. I was in Well's the butcher's shop. I returned to Cogle's in about three minutes - I know none of them but M'Carthy, I have known him many years, but do not know him to be one.

            . I live in St. Ann's-lane, some distance from the Almonry. I lived at the deceased's house twenty-two months. Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening I was standing looking at the soldiers fighting down the Almonry; they came out of the Almonry right up the New-way, into Orchard-street. I told Mrs. Cogle she had better shut her door - it was not shut; I had hardly spoke the words to her, before several soldiers came up; I saw

             then, they followed a man into Cogle's house, and beat him about the head, and Lee had a stone in his hand, which he held up to heave at me - I said,</p>
               <p>"My dear fellow, don't knock my brains out as you are knocking the rest out;" he then dropped the stone out of his hand. Mrs. Cogle said,</p>
               <p>"My dear men, there's nobody want's to hurt you in this house;"

             shoved her down and said,</p>
               <p>"You d - d infernal old ****, what do you know about it," and pushed her down with both his hands; a man about five feet eight or nine inches high stood there, in the centre of the passage, beating a man over the head; the deceased stood there, with his hands extended up, he never spoke a word to any person whatever; the tall man, after beating the man, whipped his hands round from that man, and struck the deceased, and down he fell; he had a white jacket on, with a blue cape and blue cuffs, and had a stave in his hand. I will not say whether it was the stave of a cask, or part of a fence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Cogle in the kitchen while he was being struck - A. He stood against the kitchen door; they were beating Patterson on the arm, it so stunned him, he ran up and down stairs, and into the street. I escaped also, and saw nothing further pass in the house; I jumped over a fence, and over two walls into another street, and saw Cooper take a man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BROADRICK. Q. How long had you been in the streets - A. Not long, three quarters of an hour, I went from my lodging in St. Ann's-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you drank much to day - A. Not much, about a pint and a half pint of porter, nothing else. I had not a light long coat on, I was dressed as I am now. I had nothing in my hand. I had come out to walk in the Park, came down Queen-street, up Tothill-street, and saw three or four soldiers fighting, I then went into Orchard-street - I was not in the Almonry. I got into Orchard-street, about half-past seven or eight o'clock, and was there about ten minutes. I saw a crowd down in the Almonry, and soldiers fighting there - I was not nearer than seventy fathoms to them.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure Cogle was knocked down by a stave or stick - A. That I cannot say, for he fell almost at the same instant as his wife - there was nine or ten people in the house, and five in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your way of life - A. I am a porter in the Haymarket - I have been a British seaman.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you saw Cogle knocked down with a piece of wood - A. I did not see it.</p>

            . I live in the front parlour of Cogle's house, and remember the party of soldiers coming there; some of them were inside the door before I came out of my room. Mr. Cogle came into my room on the right side of the kitchen where I was, the soldiers were in the room, and he came in after them, to ask what was the matter - I do not know how many there were. Cogle asked what was the matter, but a man in drummer's clothes, with his sword backhanded, in his hand, he knocked me backwards in drawing it - I fell, and he hit Mr. Cogle on the head with the sword, and he fell with the blow, but I cannot tell on what part of the head he hit him - I was not sensible from the blow I received.

            . I am one of the surgeons attending Westminster Hospital. I saw the deceased on the 20th of June, in the morning, he was then alive, but died on the Friday following - the fracture certainly caused his death.</p>

               <p>MEREDITH DOLBIN. I am a private in the second battalion of Grenadier Guards. On the 18th of June, about seven in the evening, I was in company with Rowbottom, at the Marquis of Granby public-house; as we were going away towards Tothill-street, we saw some boys playing at marbles - about twenty or thirty people were looking on. Rowbottom was tipsy, he went through the ring of marbles, and happened to kick one of them - one of them called after him,</p>
               <p>"What did you kick my marbles for? you b - y lobster, or s - d" - I do not know which, I was three or four yards before Rowbottom - one of the men struck him, I turned back to try to get him away - a man said,</p>
               <p>"Do you call yourself a man?" I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes;" he struck me on my face directly - I fought him in my own defence, and there was four or five on me at once; they got me down, the man who struck me was in front, and the others behind and on my side - they struck me, and knocked me down four or five times - I fainted away, and do not know what became of me - I was struck by fists, and kicked on my forehead, when I was down; the mark is left now - I do not know what became of Rowbottom, somebody took me away to wash myself.</p>

            . My husband is a labourer, and lives in Jeffery's-buildings, near the Almonry. On the evening of the 18th of June, I was at home, and could see into the Almonry, some persons were there playing at marbles, and ten or twelve others looking at them - I saw two soldiers coming from the bottom of the Almonry, from the Marquis of Granby public-house - I know one of them, it was Rowbottom - I saw him kick the marbles accidentally, and immediately a young man, named Jem Cummings said</p>
               <p>"You b - dy lobster, what did you kick them for?" he gave some answer to Cummings, I do not know what it was; Cummings rose off his knee, and struck the soldier violently on the mouth, the soldier tried to strike him again, but was so much in liquor, that he could not, every time he offered to strike him, he fell - a great many people were collected, which caused a confusion, and some of the girls of the Almonry carried the soldier away; he bled very much, and went to the pump to wash himself, as many as thirty persons came up, he was stopping washing his face - Cummings struck him violently on the head, the people said they would murder the b - s; several struck him violently - some kicked him with their feet, and some struck him with their fists - he was knocked into a cellar, I and my nephew dragged him out and took him into my parlour, we found him very much bruised and bleeding; he was in liquor - after being some time with me, he went away - Cumming's friends live in the neighbourhood now, but I have not seen him since that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what made Rowbottom go from your house - A. A crowd of people ran by crying murder, and saying, a man was murdered in Orchard-street; he threw up the window, and out he jumped - I never saw him before that day, he is the man who was in my house - I washed the blood from his face, and saw him for an hour and twenty minutes, and can swear he is the man; he was treated in a very brutal manner, and would have lost his life if I had not interfered.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. What way of life are you in - A. I wash and iron; I am married, I did not know the deceased - Rowbottom was at my house from seven o'clock till twenty minutes past eight - I can see the Almonry from my lodging - I have no clock or watch, but my neighbour Davis, has a clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into his house to see the time - A. Yes; because Rowbottom said he was for guard; he jumped out of the window immediately as I told him what o'clock it was, he had asked me the time - he jumped out on hearing the cries of the people - several people were in the room, none of them had watches but Mrs. Davis, and she lives down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How nigh is your window from the ground - A. It is the ground floor, I had fastened the door that he should not go out to the mob - when I first saw him, he was so drunk he could not return a blow; he was an hour and twenty minutes at my house - I did not attend before the Magistrate, I did not know when the examination took place.</p>
               <p>MR. BROADRICK. Q. Did you give him any tea - A. Two cups; he had recovered a great deal with that, and being washed - he was unknown to me before.</p>

            . I am a private in the second battalion of Coldstream Guards. On the evening of Waterloo day, I went through Wright's passage into the Almonry, and saw Dolben and Rowbottom, and several inhabitants fighting; several people were on each of them, perhaps four, five or six on each - another soldier came up and got fighting with another man, the soldier got rather the best of it, and a great many of the inhabitants who stood there said, what a shame it was, and d - n their eyes, the bl - dy lobsters, they would kill them if they did not leave the Almonry; several of them struck the soldiers with their fists, and then more fell on; they said they would go and get some sticks and kill them - they went away and came again in a few minutes with sticks and stones, some of them were broomsticks, some faggots, and some thicker - there were very few soldiers there, I think about five or six; they cut in among the soldiers as hard as they could with these sticks - some of the soldiers ran through Wright's passage, I went out before them; the last two or three that came out, came into Tothill-street; their heads were cut - when the passage was clear, they returned into the Almonry, and the inhabitants threw some sticks out of window to them.</p>

               <p>Q. I suppose some inhabitants are friendly to the soldiers, and some not - A. Yes; the mob then ran away, and the soldiers after them, up the Narrow Way, they turned to the left and I to the right - I saw M'Carthy go down Wright's passage with his sword by his side; some soldier, who had received a blow in the eye, came running across to him and wanted to draw the sword out of its sheath, he would not let him have it; he pulled it to himself, and said he should not have it - he drew it out of the sheath and kept it in his hand, saying, that would not do, and he should not have it - the man went away, and M'Carthy sheathed his sword again - I afterwards saw a great many soldiers running up the New-way, and M'Carthy was behind them, running towards the crowd of soldiers; the other people were before him - I suppose the soldiers were running after the chaps who had been kicking up the row - I did not see M'Carthy strike any one or interfere; he was behind the rest of his comrades - I went home and saw no more.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. At first Rowbottom and another soldier were fighting with some more people - A. Yes; five or six people at each of them; I suppose he gave as many blows as he could, he did his best - I do not know whether he was drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this - A. Between seven and nine o'clock, it was nearer eight than seven when it began I think.</p>

            . I live in Peter-street. I have been a soldier, but am discharged. I am a pensioner in the Coldstream Guards. On the 18th of June, about half-past seven o'clock, I was in the Almonry; I observed a quantity of people scattered about there; I saw no soldiers among them. In five minutes time a set of men collected themselves together in a body, with sticks and staves; I heard one man say</p>
               <p>"Here goes one, go it!" I looked round and saw the whole mob rush up Jeffrey's-buildings. I pushed on to see what they were at, and saw a soldier knocked down; he was doing nothing; when he was down they beat him with their sticks; they then returned by me and saw another soldier, and knocked him down, and beat him with their sticks; he did nothing, he was only looking on, the same as me; they left him, and ran across the Almonry, and there caught another soldier coming across from Wright's passage, and beat him likewise. He had given them no provocation. A party of soldiers hearing the noise were making into the Almonry, and were met in Wright's passage by the mob, and there they had a severe attack. I suppose there were three or four soldiers. More soldiers came from Dean-street - they had nothing in their hands; the mob had sticks and staves. There was a skirmish between them right through the Almonry - a great mob collected: there was double the number more than the soldiers. I saw the officers come into the Almonry to disperse them. They were fighting at that time. I considered the soldiers in great danger of their lives.</p>

On the 18th of June, from six till past eight o'clock, I was in the Almonry, and saw a great crowd of persons collected, soldiers and inhabitants, fighting together - the soldiers were without arms and the inhabitants without sticks, at first; I afterwards saw them with sticks, like the backs of chairs. I saw a man come out of a house with a stick, which he took up in both his hands, and knocked one of the men down. A person named Andrews hit a soldier over the left eye. I saw a great many soldiers knocked down - I cannot mention their names. The soldiers ran out by Wright's passage,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182107180032"/>and were followed by eighteen or twenty men with large sticks. I knew three of the men very well.

Some women were in the mob, with sticks; a woman pushed me in the passage. There were about six soldiers, or more, there. I saw a drummer in Tothill-street, and in the Almonry afterwards, but did not know who he was, or whether he was the same that I saw in Tothill-street.

I went back to the recruit-house, returned about seven o'clock into Tothill-street, through a passage out of the Almonry, and into the Marquis of Granby, public-house; and as I returned from there, they were running after soldiers up the Almonry, with great sticks.

             - he struck a soldier with a stick - he was then a watchman, but is now broke. When I saw this, I made to go through Wright's-passage, and was knocked down by the blow of a stick at the back of my head. They took my shawl off, and the ring half-way off my finger. My husband came up, and begged for mercy for my life, and a man struck him on his head, and knocked his cap off (my husband is a soldier), he struck him with the stave of a tub. I soon after recovered, got up, and pulled my husband away - he wished to return, to pick his cap up and my shawl; I would not let him. He was much injured with the blow.</p>

            . I am in the Guards, and live in the Almonry. I was in my own room, about two hundred and fifty yards from the Marquis of Granby, Some men were playing at marbles close under my window; two soldiers were passing - whether they kicked the marbles or not I cannot say, but the men said something to the soldiers which I did not hear - the soldiers did not answer. In a short time they spoke again, and one of the soldiers turned back, and asked if they were talking to him - they called him a b - y-backed ******, up with their fists, and knocked him down. He was in liquor, his comrade went to pick him up, and they knocked him down. The men kept kicking and beating the soldiers on the ground - more soldiers same up, and a fight began; the mob increased, and the soldiers drove them out (the soldiers were not armed); they were away about ten minutes, then returned with sticks and staves of casks. I believe there was then only two soldiers in the Almonry - when the mob saw them, They said</p>
               <p>"Here is two of the *******, let us start them." One of them ran up the buildings, the other remained. I could not see what the mob did to him, as they were out of my sight. I saw the prisoner Jones afterwards, when they returned from pursuing the one into the buildings - he came through the passage; he was doing nothing. One of the mob struck him with a stick. I saw M'Carthy with the rest of the soldiers, not doing any thing.</p>

            . I am a private in the Coldstream Guards, and live at No. 60, Orchard-street, within five doors of Cogle's. I was in the Almonry, and saw the people fighting with the soldiers; I stood there about five minutes, and got knocked over the eye and chin; they knocked me down in the mud. I went towards the watch-house, and saw a parcel of people running; they surrounded M'Carthy with great sticks; he drew his sword, or I thought he would have been murdered. I was so frightened I returned home; my house faces down the New-way towards the Almonry; I went up stairs to wash the blood off my face, then went down to a barber's to get my hair cut (he lives just below Cogle's on the opposite side), when my hair was cut I came to the door and saw a parcel of inhabitants running from the New-way along Orchard-street into Cogle's, four or five of the inhabitants ran into Cogle's, and four soldiers after them, none of them had regimentals; if a drummer had ran in I must have seen him. The soldiers came out in about a minute and a half, and were going towards the New-way, and a soldier in a red jacket said</p>
               <p>"Right about," then one of the inhabitants went out of Cogle's and went towards Dean-street, the soldier pursued him and knocked him down, the drummer never went, even on the cill of Cogle's door, I went home. I did not see the drummer in the house.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. What time were you at the barber's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182107180033"/>- A. It might be half-past seven o'clock, when I came away, the constables were then taking Jones to the watch-house. I then went up stairs, came down in about five minutes, and saw a parcel of inhabitants and some soldiers about the watch-house. Some inhabitants were about Cogle's door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any drummer that afternoon - A. Yes, I saw M'Carthy in the Almonry, the last time I saw him was at a baker's shop, next door to Cogle's, about half-past seven o'clock. I could not see what happened there while I was in the barber's.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you speak of time as you guess - A. Yes, I cannot speak to a minute or two. I saw the people go into Cogle's after I was shaved; M'Carthy was not among them at all. I stood at the barber's door, and saw them go in and come out.</p>

            . On the 18th of June I was at the top of Union-court, Orchard-street, and saw a crowd of people and soldiers among them - the crowd were among the soldiers with a great many sticks - the soldiers had nothing in their hands - one of the crowd had a pitchfork, he struck a soldier of the 3d regiment, in full regimentals, across the shoulder, and knocked him down, the man ran into Mrs. Cogle's house, I could see plainly what passed at Cogle's - M'Carthy stood in the street, and I had hold of his arm all the time, when his comrade was struck he rose his sword above his head, but did not strike any one, the crowd then rushed towards Mrs. Cogle's house - M'Carthy did not go in at any time - a crowd of people went in before any soldiers - I had hold of M'Carthy's arm from the time he came up the New-way till he ran down St. Ann's-lane, which was before the soldiers went into Cogle's, I did not see him strike any one, I saw a constable strike him - when the crowd came out, I heard a cry that Cogle was murdered. M'Carthy did not return before they came out.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. What is the time you have been speaking of - A. I cannot say the time, it was between seven and nine o'clock, I had been home, and came out to get something for supper, that must be about eight o'clock - I first saw M'Carthy come up the New-way, there was a great many soldiers among the crowd, when I first saw him his side arms hung in his belt, my husband is in his regiment - I went up to him in Orchard-street - the rest of the soldiers were in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took hold of his arm, had any one gone into Cogle's house - A. There was a man in a long tailed coat and smock-frock came out of Cogle's with a stick in his hand, ran down the steps, and began fighting, it was Jenkins. I held M'Carthy at that time, wanting him to come away from the crowd to keep him from them - he left me and ran down St. Ann's-lane, a crowd of people ran down before him - there was a great many people round Cogle's - I stood there till he was taken to the hospital - M'Carthy never returned.</p>

            . My husband is in the second regiment of Guards. On Waterloo-day I had been to wash at the Black Horse, public-house. I live in New Peter-street, as I came home I was in Orchard-street a few minutes before eight o'clock, and saw a great many jackass boys, costermongers, and prigs, as the call them; I went to the White Horse, public-house, and saw a woman holding a soldier indoors. When I was in Orchard-street I saw Cooper taking some soldiers - I saw Suggen with a poker, they were running after the soldiers. I saw M'Carthy come up the New-way, and in Orchard-street, but not near the pavement at all; he was in the middle of the street, and not near Cogle's door. Mrs. Bullen had hold of his arm - I went across - he pulled his hand from her, and ran across St. Ann's-lane, and down Pike-alley. I saw a man come out of Cogle's, with a whitish coat and a stick about the length of his arm - he ran in among the soldiers and struck them; one fell, I believe he was a light infantry man - his foraging cap fell off - the man picked it up, and either put it under his arm, or in his bosom, and ran into Cogle's - he was one of Cogle's lodgers - they have twopenny and threepenny lodgers. Two or three of the soldiers ran towards the door, and into the passage, I believe; and these costermongers ran in after them with sticks, the soldiers had nothing but their fists; the mob were laying on to the soldiers with their sticks, they came out in two or three minutes. M'Carthy had passed the door, and ran down St. Ann's-lane seven minutes before that, and never came into Orchard-street again.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Be cautious, did you attend before the Magistrate - A. They would not suffer the soldiers' witnesses to attend - I did not attend. I had finished work about quarter past seven o'clock, went home, my husband was out, I went to look for him to get the key; I found him in the Almonry about nine o'clock. I have known M'Carthy from the breast, there are two brothers in the same regiment, the prisoner is the man I speak of. I am positive not one soldier had a weapon.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not the drummer his cutlass - A. He had his sword, he is not a soldier; I only saw one man in a white jacket, and that was Jones. I know none of the prisoners, except the drummer.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is the man here who ran out with the stick - A. That is the man (the witness Jenkins).</p>

            . I am drum-major of the third battalion of the first regiment of Guards. On the evening of the 18th of June I saw M'Carthy when the drum-beat was called over at quarter before nine - he was present, and was calm, collected and sober.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Where is the roll-call - A. In front of the barrack gate, at Knightsbridge, opposite the Park-wall. I call over the drum-roll, there are two drummers named M'Carthy, I cannot say whether both were there, they belong to the same battalion, but are not alike in person. I always count the men and inspect them, to see if they are sober and capable of duty. I do not call over their names, the barrack is a mile, or a mile and a half from the Almonry.</p>

            . I am a Lieutenant-General in his Majesty's service. The prisoner was eight years and a half in my service; he left me in March, 1814. I have a married sister named Simpson, the prisoner married her servant, while he was in my service. On being married, his wife and him both came into my service, and went down to Plymouth; and about eight months after, they both left my service together; this was in 1814. From that year, to the present time, I have been mostly in England, except last year, when I was abroad; the prisoner's wife returned into my sister's service about two years and a half ago, as near as I can say - I came to London on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182107180035"/>the 31st of May, and went to my sister's, and on the 3d of June the prisoner came to the house about four o'clock in the afternoon, and had some conversation with me on the subject of his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. After that conversation, did he go away - A. I opened the door, he was ringing at the door very violent, and told him to go away, but he continued to ring the bell. He was in a state of intoxication; I ordered 
               <persName id="t18210718-63-person621">Hamilton</persName>
             the servant to send for a constable, which he did, and he was taken away, I went out of town to the races, and on the 14th of June, I was at my sister's, and about half past ten o'clock in the morning, I was told the prisoner was there - I went into the hall, and saw him, I went up to him, Hamilton, my sister's servant, stood behind, he looked very wild in the face, but was perfectly sober - I said</p>
               <p>"What do you want with me," he said,</p>
               <p>"You have seduced my wife, and I have proof of it"; I said,</p>
               <p>"On my word and honour, it is false, and if you have proof, produce it." I then told him to go away, and was retiring from him, with my face towards him, and when about three paces distance, I saw him with a long butcher's knife in his left hand, in consequence of which, I stood where I was, and put myself in a posture of defence, with my face directly towards him (I am left-handed and so is he); he then rushed at me with the knife with great violence, rose his hand, and thrust the knife into my right breast, about three inches and a half - it rather stunned me, I did not fall; I recovered again before he made a second thrust; he made several more thrusts at me, which I parried with my hands, and got both hands cut; I was cut in one hand, and stabbed in the other - after that, Hamilton came behind, and pinioned him; we then all three closed and fell together - Sir

             and another servant came, and he was secured.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Describe the injury you received - A. I was stabbed in my right breast (here the General shewed his wound), cut on my right hand, and stabbed in the left; the stab in my breast stunned me a little, but I did not suffer from any of my wounds - I laid down on the bed that afternoon, from the loss of blood, but was not at all unwell from it - I lost twenty or thirty ounces of blood. The whole thing did not last more than a minute and a half - after it was over, he said he was sorry for it; I first saw the knife when he was going to attack me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. He served you in India several years - A. He served eight years and a half altogether. I never saw him from the day he left my service, which was in 1814, till the 3d of June. I gave him a written character in 1816, but did not see him then; I was at Plymouth. He married in 1813, his wife and sister both live with my sister - I reside with my sister now; I cannot speak to the state of his mind for the last six years; he parted with his wife two years and a half ago - I do not know the cause. I heard he called on the 3d of June, I saw him on the 3d, 13th, and 14th; his language was very clear and sensible, on the third he was beastly drunk - when this happened, he was sober, he made no attempt to go away, and expressed great sorrow for what he had done. I used no coarse language to him. I might, or might not, have reproached him as a drunken fellow. I understand he has been out of employ some time.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was his contrition expressed after he was secured or before - A. After, and when he saw me bleeding. I have the knife - (producing it).</p>

            . I was at my aunt's, Mrs. Simpson's; heard a noise; came out, and found the prosecutor was on the ground, in the hall, struggling with the prisoner, and Hamilton behind, endeavouring to draw Patmore off - they were almost flat on the ground, and the prisoner was pushing forward towards my uncle on the ground. He was on his body. I could not see whether he had any thing in his hands - he was pushing them forwards, making an attack, striking. I took hold of his right arm, and, with the assistance of Hamilton and another servant, pulled him up. My uncle picked the knife off the floor.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Simpson. On the 14th of June, the prisoner came to my master's house. I opened the door; he came in, and asked if the General was at home. I said he was. He said he wished to see him. I went into the parlour, and told the General 
               <persName id="t18210718-63-person625">Patmore</persName>
             wished to see him. He desired me to tell him to go about his business, he would not see him. I told the prisoner the General would not see him. He said he wanted an answer, Yes or No. I said, the General's answer was, No, he would not see him. The parlour door was not shut too; our voices could be heard. The General came into the hall; the prisoner immediately accused him of seducing his wife. The General said he knew nothing whatever of his wife. The prisoner said he did. The General said he did not, and that he accused him of a thing he knew nothing at all about, and without any proof. The prisoner said he had plenty of proof. The General desired him to fetch his proof, and immediately on that he rushed at him, and struck him on the right side with his left hand; it was a thrust, or punch. I did not see what he had. I seized him by both arms behind - he repeated the thrust several times, perhaps more than three; and, after a short struggle, we all three fell together. Sir

             came out of the parlour, and assisted in getting the prisoner from the General. I did not hear him say any thing after I got him by the arms. When he sat in the hall, after it was over, and the servants were holding him, he said,</p>
               <p>"It has come to something at last." When the General got up, he said</p>
               <p>"He has stabbed me in three places." He was taken into the front hall, and then said</p>
               <p>"It has come to something at last." I did not hear him say he was sorry for it. I fetched a surgeon. The prisoner was taken to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. His wife lived with the General's sister - A. Yes; and his sister too. He came sometimes to see his wife - I remember his coming one Sunday morning; his wife was denied to him several times - she was out of the house. My mistress occupied the General's cottage, at

            , in the summer; the female servants were never taken there but once. The prisoner's wife once went to the lying-in hospital. The General never ordered me to tell the prisoner when he came, that I did not know where his wife was.

            . It was not true, but she had desired me not to let him know where she was. He said he should go to Ham after her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not his sister come up and say,</p>

               <p>"You need not go, it is all a fudge" - A. Not that I know. I believe the sister has a child. I do not know how how old it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say, on more than one occasion, that he had heard reports about his wife, and was determined to see her - A. He has said so, and seen her afterwards. He saw her the day after the Sunday that he enquired for her - she was big with child before she left my mistresses house, and was absent a fortnight or three weeks He never asked if the General had ordered me to prevent his seeing her. I never saw his sister's child - I have seen his wife's.</p>
               <p>Q. Who supplied his wife's place while she was absent - A. A woman was hired, and when his wife returned she remained in the service. He never said to me that he wished to see her, to know who put her in that condition.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. At the time your mistress occupied the General's cottage, where was the General - A. I think he was abroad. Patmore's wife went to the lying-in hospital about last December. I think the General left England in June or July. The sister laid-in four or five months ago, to the best of my knowledge; it may be less. I never denied his wife, or said a word about her by the General's order. He never spoke to me about either of the women. Sometimes Patmore's wife herself, and sometimes her sister, told me to deny her, and sometimes my mistress told me not to admit him into the house, as his wife desired not to see him. She never went to Ham till after this affair. I mean after the stabbing. The Sunday morning that the prisoner came was in the same month that she went to the lying-in hospital.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When he saw his wife were they ever together - A. Sometimes in the kitchen, and sometimes in the hall - he staid with her about an hour, and sometimes more - they were sometimes alone. He has come occasionally for more than twelve months, and sometimes twice a-week. He frequently saw her after she was pregnant, and must have known she was so. I never heard him accuse her of behaving amiss.</p>

            , ESQ. I am a surgeon. I was called in and saw General 
               <persName id="t18210718-63-person630">Eden</persName>
             in his bed-room. He said he had not examined his wound. There was a great deal of blood on the stairs and on his clothes - it appeared to have flowed down to his breeches; he was agitated. A very considerable swelling had taken place round the wound on the right breast - it appeared to have taken an oblique direction towards the breast-bone. I passed my little finger in, and conceive the wound to be between two and three inches deep - It apppeared that a knife had struck on the ribs, and glanced towards the breast-bone. From the direction it took, it appeared to have been inflicted by the left hand. Had it been struck with the right hand it would most probably have been fatal, as it might have struck the heart - had not the rib obstructed, it would have wounded the lungs, which would have been fatal. The wound on his right hand passed across three fingers, and laid bare the joint of the little finger. The other wound was a stab on the opposite wrist, very near the principal artery of the hand, but it was not opened. Generally speaking, the wounds in the hand would not be dangerous - it depended on the state of body.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The wounds on the hand were probably occasioned by the General endeavouring to get the knife from him - A. They might. I was called in about eleven o'clock, and saw the prisoner sitting on a bench in the hall, and two persons with him. I examined his head, having understood he had a severe would in the head. I spoke to him - he declined answering my questions.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Can you form a calculation of the effusion of blood - A. About two pints had been lost. I compared the knife with the wound - it was capable of inflicting it, and the point appeared to be turned as if by striking on the rib.</p>
               <p>GENERAL EDEN re-examined. Q. Have you directly or indirectly had any share in his wife being denied, or in being the cause of it - A. I had not. I was out of England at the time. I never saw his sister till I arrived in England this time. I was absent eleven months the last time. I was never in my sister's house since Patmore's wife lived with her this last time, till I came to England in May last; and while she lived there before I was not there twenty times, and never slept there, and dare say his wife did not see me six times all the while, and that was when she opened the door to me. I never had any intercourse with his wife or sister whatever.</p>

In about quarter of an an hour Palmer went to the door and called Evans, she came; and I saw Palmer put something into her hand, I went to my breeches and missed my money, she then ran away; Evans remained. I followed Palmer to the end of the court and stopped her, but found nothing on her, I have never found it. I took Palmer to the watch-house, and afterwards found Evans there.</p>

I missed about 5 cwt. of mixed metal and lead. Next day I went with the officer, and found it at Bridgewater-gardens, at a house. Lack was there. She said she lived there. It is an iron shop - she said it was her shop, and she wanted to know what business we had there. I found some new pewter, which was not mine. She said we had no business to search without a warrant. We found two hundred and fifty lbs. of my metal, covered over with straw, in different places, under the foot of the bed. She said she bought it, and had had it three or four days, and we had no business with it. It was stolen from my premises on the night of the 14th or 15th of June, and this was the 16th. I asked of whom she bought it - she made no reply. I am sure it is mine. We asked her if

There were nineteen ingots of metal, the same as was stolen. The coat belonged to our carman. I went for a cart, and on returning found Taylor there. I know the basket by the handle, which I had mended myself.</p>

            . I am a City officer. I went to this shop, which is in the City. We found Lack there. I searched, and found nineteen ingots and a piece of one on the floor, with a little straw over them. She said she bought them three or four days before. Taylor came up the street directly after, Vann asked if his name was Taylor - he said Yes, and that lived there, in the shop, and had bought the metal of one Smith, a plumber. Vann<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182107180039"/>asked what he gave for it - he said he could not answer that. There was only one bed in the shop.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to Bridgewater-gardens with the other officers. We asked Lack if she bought any metal - she said No. We went round the counter. She asked if I had a warrant - I said No. I found the ingots under a table, and some by the fire-place, covered with straw. She then said she bought it three or four days ago or more, but refused to say who from. She said Taylor did not lodge there; and, while we were waiting, Taylor came up, and was passing by, we took him. Armstrong asked if he lived there - he said he had lived there two years, in that room; there was only one bed. The metal was on the counter, Armstrong asked if he knew any thing of it - he said</p>
               <p>"Yes, I bought it of a man three or four days ago, or longer;" and that he bought the coat as old rags. I found a mould for casting ingots there - these ingots were three sizes.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutors. I saw the prisoner at Old Ford, at eleven o'clock, leaning on the bank of the field the serge was in; he must climb over the bank and paling to get it. I went with Arnold and found him laying in the field, and said that is the man I saw leaning on the bank, Arnold asked how long he had been from Old Ford. He said he had not been there that day. I found the serge covered with corn; there was a gap on the bank just by him, I called to Arnold, and he ran off; we followed and took him.</p>

            . On the 30th of June, Hall came to the office, and complained of his lead being stolen; the prisoners were then under hail for a disturbance; I asked them where they had lived, Keppell said he lived at No. 4, Wheeler-street; and Redman said he lived at No. 10, Old Nicholl-street. I went to No. 10, Old Nicholl-street, and found five pieces of lead in the cellar, under the staircase; two or three females lived there. Redman's parents live in the first floor; the door is left open at all hours. The knife appears to me to have been used in cutting lead.</p>

On Friday the 6th of July, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was looking at a boot-shop, in Middle-row, Holborn; Turner came up and entered into conversation with me; he represented himself as a cattle-dealer from the country. We walked together into Southampton-buildings, went into the <placeName id="t18210718-96-crimeloc558">Blue Posts, public-house</placeName>

In a few moments Hawkins came in, and sat himself down by my side, and called himself a tradesman from the country - he said he had been poorly, and came to London for advice, and was going back next morning. Soon after, in came a third, with a glass of liquor, and sat on the other side of the room. We three were at one table. Hawkins and the third man began laying bets, and in about a minute, the third man said we were all poor fellows - the prisoners appeared angry at that, and asked what he would bet that we could not shew 10 l. a-piece - he said he would bet us each 1 l. Hawkins then asked if I could produce 10 l. - I said I had no money about me, but I had 10 l. at home, and both the prisoners said they had not got it, but could go home and fetch it in the course of two hours. We all went out to fetch our notes, and were to meet directly. I went home and got a 10 l. Bank note, and put the number on a piece of paper. I returned to the Blue Posts, public-house, in about an hour and a quarter, and found them all three in the tap-room. They came into the same room to me. The prisoners shewed their 10 l. notes - I do not know whether they were notes, they only shewed them in their hands. I then produced mine in my hand, and put it in my pocket again. The man said he had lost his bet, but never offered to pay. Hawkins and him betted double or quit with all three of us - I did not understand what it was about; we lost it. A 10 l. note was to be put down to bind the bet. I put my 10 l. note into a hat with theirs, as they proposed it to bind the bet. They sent for a dictionary to decide the bet, and said I had lost it. I said I had only lost the double or quit - I never meant to bet the 10 l. note. I caught hold of the hat, to take my note out - I took a piece of newspaper out of it, which I thought was my note till I opened it. I then asked for my 10 l. note - they said if I gave up the hat I should have the 10 l. I did so - they then all said I should have 5 l., and all run away together. I stopped them all in the passage for a few minutes, to prevent them getting out, and called the landlord - nobody came; a man said he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182107180046"/>would fetch a constable, but none came; and seeing I could get no assistance, I ran over to the next public-house for assistance, and, in the meantime, all ran away. I went with a constable, and found the prisoners about two hundred yards off, in a court, and am sure they are the men; the third man was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have I not seen you here before - A. Never. I had been in the City, to enquire for a situation. I did not intend to gamble - if I had won, I should not have taken it. I did not give them the note to get change. I had received it from Mr. Graves of the Strand. I think I should know the third man if he was dressed as he was then. I asked nobody to get change. I am a Scotchman.</p>

            . I belong to the watch-house. On the 6th of July, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was at my second floor window, in Northumberland-court, Southampton-buildings; and heard some boys cry out,</p>
               <p>"This is no thoroughfare." In a few minutes, I came down, the prisoners were then at the top of the court, and Ashness had hold of them; Cooper was there - I took them to Hatton-garden, I had one in each hand - Hawkins turned round for a necessary purpose, and I saw a piece of paper drop from him; Alseft picked it up, opened it, and said it was a 10 l. note.</p>

               <p>HAWKINS'S Defence. I deny having the note or dropping it; the prosecutor agreed at the first examination that he was with a set of sharps, and had agreed to take 5 l.; and a young man took the note to two houses for change, but could not get it.</p>
               <p>TURNER'S Defence. I wish the people to be called from the Blue-posts and Three-tuns public-houses, as I understand the note was offered there for change; I saw Cooper looking at some forged notes which were stuck in a window, he said he was Scotch, I said. I came from Hertfordshire - I was the last that left the house, and did not run away, I fell on my knees, and begged the man to restore the note.</p>

I put it in the box and she went away, but returned in ten minutes, and asked me to fetch her something to drink. I called my girl to fetch a quartern of gin; she told me not to send the child, it looked so foolish, but to go myself. I went to the public-house, two doors off, returned, she drank it, and went away in a hurry, and said she would call about two or three o'clock. In about ten minutes I missed the cap; next day I saw her pass and stopped her - she denied it; a gentleman came up, she then called me aside and said she did take it, and gave me an affidavit of it.</p>

            . On the 30th of June, about nine o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoners pass my house at Battle-bridge, one had a basket, and the other a bundle of wood. Taylor came by and said he had been watching them some time. I could not leave my house, but in an hour and a half they all three came back. Wilson and the others separated at the turnpike. Douglas kept on the right side with the basket on his shoulder, it appeared bulky, and ran through the turnpike; and opposite the Belvidere, public-house, he stopped, and Wilson stood opposite. I said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got here?" he said,</p>
               <p>"Nothing, but a little waste;" I found this coat over some shavings, with his basket. I called after the two, and Wilson was stopped by a carpenter, and brought back to me, he had run off. I found a latch key on him.</p>

I was continually being robbed, and discharging my men on account of it, but did not suspect him. On the 5th of May, I discharged five men and the prisoner also. I told him I would give him work to do at home, as I had confidence in him. On Thursday afternoon I was coming through Hanway-yard, and saw his wife in a shop offering figures for sale; I went in and asked how she came by them; she said one of the workmen gave them to her husband. I took her to Marlborough-street, and went to the prisoner's lodging, and asked if he had any property of mine; we searched, and in a drawer found the articles stated in the indictment. I said, "How could you rob me in this way, when I kept every thing shut up?" he said his wife gave them to him out of the store-room; his wife chared at the house.</p>

            . I am a bottle-dealer, and live in East-street, Manchester-square. On the 21st of June, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I was going to No. 46, Baker-street, and saw the prisoners standing between there and No. 45. I went in, and on coming out they still stood there. I went on towards Dorset-street, turned my head round, and saw Main going down the area steps of No. 45. I turned back, and found him coming up, but doing something up in his bosom. I tried to lay hold of him, but he ran back down the area passage, and into a little room in the house. I ran down, and called out</p>
               <p>"House!" The cook came, and we secured him coming out of the room - he said he had nothing, and we might search him. I said,</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you have nothing now, but I am sure you had something" - he said he had not, he had been to ask for Mrs. James. The cook locked him up, and I went home. Yaman passed me before I took Main. They were close in conversation when Main went down, and on seeing me turn back, ran off. I rather doubt whether Yaman is the other, as I now perceive that he squints.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police officer. On the 18th of July, about six o'clock in the morning, I was in Rosemary-lane, and saw the prisoners together - Piper appeared bulky, and Mitchell, had a bag; Piper crossed the road, I stopped him, and asked what he was carrying - he said a few bottles of ale, that he was a carter, and had been carting all the day before. I found three bottles of ale in his shirt, and two under his coat.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoners in Rosemary-lane - Mitchell had a bag, Piper appeared bulky, and had a great coat on. I took Mitchell, and asked what he had got - he gave no answer. I took him to a public-house and found ten bottles of ale in it. Piper said they had been carting ale, and it was a little they took. We took them to the office.</p>

The stable was locked, but there was a hole above the door large enough to get in. About half-past eight o'clock in the morning of the 15th, I missed eight dozen and nine bottles of ale. I found the prisoners in custody with this, it is of the same description of ale. The Scotch ale is all of the same flavour. I found marks on the bottles which corresponded with those left. Piper's cart stands in my yard. I cannot swear to the bottles.</p>

I asked if a pot-boy's place would suit him - he said, Yes, thanked me, and went down stairs. He came up in a few minutes, and said he had a waistcoat to sell, and wanted me to buy it. I refused. He offered it to me for 3 s. Seeing he was so distressed, I gave him a shilling in part of it - he was to come for the rest a little after seven o'clock. When he went away the first time I looked out and saw a suspicious man, with a bundle, waiting outside, which made me suspect the waistcoat was stolen, and I followed them to Gee's-court, where they offered something for sale - this made me suspect something. I lost them. I went to Marlborough-street, and then went home, but missed nothing until towards evening, when we missed these things. I went to the shop in Marylebone-lane, where I saw them go, and asked if they had such things - they said No, but I found the ring-handles. The boy said he bought them with other metal. I asked to see it, and it was my other things.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police surveyor. On the 16th of June, in consequence of information, I landed at Lambeth stairs between three and four o'clock in the morning; I was in Fore-street, and looked down one of the alleys, and saw a quantity of loose corn laying in an old barge's head, called the King, and some spilt on shore. I borrowed a sack and gathered it up, it was about a bushel and a half. I searched the craft, and went to Dunkley's back door in my own boat, to see if his boat was stowed there, and found she was not. I then crossed the water, and went to Lack's wharf, and found a punt there belonging to Bradbury, covered with tarpauling, named the Friends, and found the four outer sacks had been taken from the bulk; the sternfast had been cut, to make the barge turn round, so that on coming up the river the vacancy would not be seen. In the fore part of the barge I found four sacks of oats between the bulk, partly in and partly out, they were marked</p>
               <p>"Knight, Oxford-street," one of them were very muddy; all the other sacks were perfectly dry; there appeared about two bushels of corn taken out. I produce a sample of the bulk, and of that I found at Lambeth. I found Dunkley's boat at Church-stairs, Rotherhithe, about nine o'clock that morning, and at the bottom of it was some loose oats, I took them away; the boat appeared to have been recently washed. There was a pair of sculls in it, belonging to Dunkley, and one with the name of

             on it; one of Dunkley's sculls was broken about four feet of the blade, it was broken in two parts and tied together with two sack tyers. About eleven o'clock in the morning, I went with Dalby and Blyth to Armstrong's house, close to the Europa, public-house, Rotherhithe, and took the prisoners; I waited at the back of the house - they denied the charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. About two bushels appeared to be gone from the four sacks - A. Yes, I found the four sacks at the end of the barge; they must have been brought back, and put in the barge again; I cannot say they were ever taken out. Dunkley's scull appeared to be mended with sack tyers about a foot long, which is the usual length; they appeared the same sort as the sacks were tied with.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police surveyor. Dalby and I went to apprehend the prisoners about eleven o'clock in the morning; we knocked repeatedly at Armstrong's door, they would not let us in, and we entered at the window, passed through the front room, and went into the kitchen; the prisoners came down stairs. Armstrong then said, you bl - y - , what do you want here? They appeared to be going to resist. We secured them; Armstrong asked what he was taken for. I said, on suspicion of stealing four sacks of oats. They denied knowing any thing of it. I asked Armstrong if he had been above bridge that night; he said, yes, he had, and that Green, one of the other officers, had seen him; they said, they had done nothing they were afraid of. I said,</p>
               <p>"Then why not let us in when we knocked;" he said,</p>
               <p>"You did not give us time to put our things on."</p>

On the 16th of June, about half-past two o'clock in the morning, I saw Armstrong laying on the gunnel of a barge, at the back of Dunkley's door, apparently asleep, and I saw Dunkley in his boat, which then laid between the craft and his door, he is a druggerman; I have frequently seen them together.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Look at the samples of the bulk, that which was found in the prisoner's boat, and that found in the alley - A. I have been sixteen years in the corn trade; it is impossible to speak to that found in the boat - it being wet and dirty; the other two appear to be samples of the same corn. The four sacks of oats cost me 33 s.</p>

I met Edwards in Broad-street, with this lead; I followed him to Old Gravel-lane, and asked what he was carrying, he said, it was new lead, which he brought from Mr. Lewis's, and was going to take it to Blackwall, on board the ship, Venus - I found it was old lead. I took him to the office, and asked him who the person was, he said, he did not like to tell, as he would lose his bread; he said, he would send for a friend, and consult him whether he should give him up or not, he sent for a person who keeps a public-house in the neighbourhood, and consulted him, the publican pointed out Watts to me, he is French's servant - I told Mr. French, and set men to watch Watts; he was apprehended - Edwards said, he was the man who gave him the lead, Watts then said, Edwards asked him for a piece, and he gave it him.</p>

I was very sick indeed, and she told the landlady I was her brother, or I should not stop. I laid down on the bed and fell a-sleep. I had 5 s. in my breeches pocket, and my watch in my fob; and when I awoke, which was between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I missed my watch from my fob; the 5 s. was safe. I got off the bed, and an old woman in the room said she did not know what became of the watch. I waited till five o'clock expecting her - she did not come.
