                  </hi>. I am articled clerk to Mr. Eden, and am ac<lb/>quainted with Mr. Lawrence, a very highly respectable gentleman, and his family, at Hammersmith—he was a conveyancer formerly, but is very old and infirm, and has retired from practice. In April, last year, I was introduced by him to the defendant Fuller, who stated to me that he was in difficulties, that his father-in-law, Mr. Chamberlain, had cheated him out of about 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which be was entitled to by his marriage, and bad got him also to sign a something for 1600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a release of some property which he was entitled to, and that he had sold the property, and let him have 1600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he first lent him 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and afterwards 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I understood, in the whole, 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he had employed Saunders and Woolley, the assignees under his estate—that they had agreed to fit up his shop for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but afterwards induced him to give accommodation-bills, promising to take them up, if he could not, when they came to maturity, to the amount of about 1300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said Mr. Reeve, of the firm of Walters and Reeve, who were relations of Saunders and Co., had served writs for the amount of two bills, one of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and one of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and they had also served him with notices in bankruptcy, but be said, "Instead of serving me, I expected something of the sort; my brother was in the shop, and they served them on my brother instead of myself"—he said he was at variance with his father-in-law, and requested me to see Mr. Chamberlain, for the purpose of seeing if I could bring about a reconciliation between them—I went to Chamberlain—I did not succeed at that time—he requested me to call again, and he would give me a different account of the whole transaction—before I called again I had an interview with Fuller's father—I accompa<lb/>nied him to Reeve, on the 10th of April, to the best of my recollection—Fuller made a very fair proposition, as I thought—Reeve said, "I am on the</p>

               <p>right side of the hedge, I shall not accept any such terms; I shall go on, and obtain judgment and execution"—but I had been informed by Fuller the defendant, that the notices had not been served on him, and I said to Reeve, "The notices you have served are of no service, they are not legal"—Reeve said, "Then I will send an officer into Mr. Fuller's house, and he shall not leave till he serves him"—I said, "Very well, that convinces me what Fuller has said is correct, that these bills were accom<lb/>modation-bills, placed in your hands for the mere purpose of suing for them"—I saw Chamberlain again a day or two afterwards—he said Fuller had sent his wife to him, and told her to say that he was about to be made a bankrupt, and unless he (Chamberlain) sent in an execution on the se<lb/>curities he held, he would lose the whole of his money—in consequence of what he said, I went down to Sleaford, to see Mr. Holding, an attorney—Chamberlain said he was not aware of what securities he had, and I went down to ascertain—I know Capes and Steward—they are agents to Holding—on the 19th of April, after seeing Holding, Capes and Co. issued an execution—Mr. Eden was engaged after this by Mr. William Fuller, the father of the defendant, <hi rend="italic">to</hi> strike a docket—I went from Mr. Eden's then, in company with Mr. Fuller, to strike the docket against the son on a bill—there was an assignment made to the Sheriff on the 29th—Chamberlain took possession of the premises in Regent-street, where Fuller had been carrying on business as a shawl-dealer—on the day possession was taken of the premises, Fuller went to Mr. Lawrence's, at Hammersmith, and Hoad was left in possession—the shop-goods were sold by tender, by Mr. Cham<lb/>berlain, such as shawls and silks, to Hitchcock, in Regent-street, and afterwards there was a sale by auction—I remember the second fiat being issued, on the day the sale took place, by Mr. Bingham, on the 2nd of May—I was present at the sale—before the bankruptcy I was admiring the shop, and Fuller said, "Any thing you wish to purchase out of my shop, you shall have at cost price"—that was not after the commission was issued—I bought various articles of him—to the best of my recollec<lb/>tion, there was Robson's Directory, and the Royal Blue Book—I did not buy a pair of snuffers and a tray, or a slab before the bankruptcy—I bought two mouseline-de-laine dresses for Miss Lawrence, which I was after wards charged with stealing—I called on Miss Lawrence—in conse<lb/>quence of what she said, I went to Fuller, to bring down for her the two dresses she had been looking at—I told him they were for her—I paid him for them—I had no receipt—I took them to her—on recollection, one was 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the other 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—one was a sort of drab dress—I paid the money to Fuller—I cannot tell exactly the date of the transaction-it was in April, 1841—it was certainly before the levy was made, before the 19th of April—on the 6th of May Mr. Bingham sold the household goods and furniture, which had been assigned by the Sheriff—I bought a sundry lot at the auction, which included a marble slab, about 9 inches by 14—the umbrella-stand was a separate lot—I also bought a door-mat—I believe that was at the second sale, I cannot say—I did not buy any sheets—I have a list of the articles I did buy—I showed it to Chamberlain—I have a list of the articles I bought from Bingham—there were some hassocks, a glass, an umbrella-stand, a mat, and a piece of marble—I have been charged with stealing those articles—I showed this list to Mr. Chamberlain, I believe on the day, or the day after I received it from Bingham—I showed it to him at Mr. Lawrence's, in October—Chamberlain said I had given too much for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184209190007"/>
               <p>some of the articles, and made some alteration in the price—that was the next night, on the same night as I received it from Bingham—Hoad was left in possession of the premises in Regent-street—Mr. Chamberlain met me one morning, I believe it was the 23rd of September, 1841, at Mr. Lawrence's, and asked if I would have the kindness to call at Regent-street, to pay Hoad his wages, discharge him, and desire him to pack up what trifling articles there were about the premises, and send them down by the carrier—I paid Hoad, and told him he was to leave on Thursday, and to pack up the articles, and send them by the carrier to Mr. Chamberlain, who had taken a house at Hammersmith, and I told Hoad to send me down the marble slab and um<lb/>brella-stand at the same time—after I had paid the man his wages he said, "There is something more due to me for washing"—I said, "Make out your bill, I will pay you"—I did so—he said, "There is a pair of snuff<lb/>ers and tray on the dresser, will you take them to Mr. Chamberlain?"—I said, "Yes," and he gave them me—I put them in my pocket, and went down to Hammersmith in the evening in the omnibus, and called at Mr. Law<lb/>rence's, where I met Chamberlain—I took the snuffers and stand out of my pocket, handed them to Chamberlain, and said, "Here is the snuffers and tray Hoad has sent you, and the other articles he has sent down by the carrier"—I gave them to him and he put them, as well as I can recollect, on the dumb waiter in the corner of the parlour, and took them away with him about half an hour after—a day or two after the carrier had brought some things to my house, I called at Chamberlain's, and told him the carrier had brought some of the articles which should have been left at his house, to my house—I bad not given the carrier directions to call at Regent-street to get the things in the first place—Chamberlain bad in my presence—that was, I believe,-about the 24th or 25th of Sep<lb/>tember—it was on the 23rd I had brought the snuffeid down, and the next day or the day after I was at Chamberlain's, one morning—he told me he had sent his servant down to the carrier to inquire if he had brought the articles, and while I was there the carrier called—Chamberlain told him to bring the articles down—a list was given—I can<lb/>not say whether by me or Chamberlain—I cannot tell how it was they were brought to my house—it was not by my direction—they were after<lb/>wards sent to Chamberlain's—I called the same morning and told him the carrier had left them at my house, and requested him to send Hooper, his servant's brother, for them, and he did call, and while I was at his house that night I saw them brought up, and Mrs. Chamberlain came up and. said they were all right—out of those articles I was afterwards charged with stealing the umbrella-stand, and a bag which contained the sheets—I had bought the umbrella-stand, but Chamberlain said he had purchased an um<lb/>brella-stand at Fuller's, and had desired him to send it to him, and he had not—I said, "Very well, you shall have it," and I let him have it—it only cost a few shillings—I had bought it, but gave up my purchase to Chamber<lb/>lain, and he had it—I had advanced money to Chamberlain—I had paid various sums on his account—I paid 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—altogether 630<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid for and advanced to him—one evening Chamberlain said at Mr. Lawrence's, "What you wish to purchase out of the sale Mr. Bingham will value; if you take them at his valuation I shall be perfectly satisfied, it will save me the auction duty, or, if you prefer it, buy them in for me, and you take them at the bought-in price"—he then said, "You are the only friend I have in</p>

               <p>the world—after I have sold my reversionary property I will pay you what I owe you, and will make you a present of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of plate into the bargain"—it was in consequence of his telling me I might buy at Bing<lb/>ham's valuation that I purchased the things I have named—I thought they were going very cheap—I bought the hassocks and things in this list, and have them now, except the umbrella-stand, which was sold to me at the first sale—the mat, the piece of marble, and the umbrella-stand, which I was charged with stealing, are in this list—I received this list from the auctioneer, signed by him—the last time I advanced money to Mr. Cham<lb/>berlain was in the latter end of last November, I believe—he wanted me to lend him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I refused to lend him any more unless he would give me security for the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and also for the sums I had advanced—he said, "I shall be enabled to pay you 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a month"—I said, "If I lend you 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you will be able to pay me 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a month"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You will accept a bill for the amount"—he said, "Yes"—I took it to him and he refused to accept it—I commenced an action against him in December—I had not seen Fuller for a length of time before I brought the action—I do not know where he was, he was not to be seen—after I com<lb/>menced the action he and Chamberlain became very intimate—I saw them walking about the streets together—I remember my house being searched on the 3rd of January—I had not been before the Commissioner of Bank<lb/>ruptcy before that—it was immediately after I sued Chamberlain that the house was searched—I was not at home then—I was at Mr. Lawrence's, very dangerously ill at the time—while I was there Fuller, Reeve, and a messenger, as he called himself, from the Court of Bankruptcy, came to search Mr. Lawrence's house at Hammersmith—about seven or eight o'clock in the evening there was a very violent knocking at the door—they took away a book which Fuller had given me—it was the Analogy of the Old and New Testaments—also some little tassels that appeared to me like bell-tassels, and a piece of mouseline-de-laine, part of one of the very dresses I had bought of Fuller—there were some muslin curtains brought down which Fuller said were in the house—Mrs. Lawrence said, "Yes, there is," and desired the servant to go and fetch them down, which she did—Fuller said they were not his, and they did not take them away—they were white muslin curtains—I should think on that oc<lb/>casion they were at Lawrence's house two hours or more—they gave no intimation whatever to me that they had a search warrant for my house—I was in conversation with Reeve—the next step they took was to go to my house, and search—I was not present—after the 3rd of January summonses were served—I was summoned to the Bankruptcy Court to give evidence a few days after—I went before Mr. Commissioner Merivale, and was examined—there was an adjournment first—Miss Lawrence was examined—that was about the 12th of January—at the close of the exami<lb/>nation Fuller was examined at my request—I heard him give his evidence—Reeve was present—Fuller was examined on the 26th of January, and in consequence of what took place I indicted him for perjury at the January sessions, which commenced, I think, on the 30th—after I preferred the indictment against him, I saw no more of him—he was gone out of the way—I heard he went to Ostend—I did all I could to find him, but could not—in the very same month Chamberlain filed a bill in Chancery against me—It was postponed by some means till the 18th of June, when it stood for trial by a special jury, in the Court of Queen's Bench—I saw all the defendants</p>

               <p>there, except Mrs. Fuller—it was not tried that day—it was afterwards fixed by the Court, at the application of Mr. Kelly, my counsel, and appointed for Thursday, the 23rd of June—Saturday was the 18th, as well as I can recol<lb/>lect—the defendants left me early in the afternoon, and I went to Hammer<lb/>smith, and that evening saw the male defendants, and one not in cus<lb/>tody, and two or three policemen, and a crowd about them—it was the very day the trial was expected, and was postponed till the 23rd—in consequence of what I heard I went to the Kensington Police Court on the Monday—a person calling himself the clerk of Reeve appeared against me, and applied to postpone the examination till the following Wednesday—I appeared then, and Reeve, Fuller, and Chamberlain preferred a charge against me—Reeve said he should defer the charge on which I was apprehended that very morning, (for the officer met me, and said, "You are my prisoner,") and charged me with felony—I was apprehended on the Monday as I was going to the office—Reeve then charged me with stealing from a box the mouseline-de-laine dresses, and the pomatum-pot—I had been apprehended on the charge of obtaining goods by false pre<lb/>tences—the articles were produced—that was one of the dresses I bad obtained from Fuller, and paid him for—the pomatum-pot I know no<lb/>thing of—it was not the pot which had been taken by the messenger from my house, and which I had seen before on the table with the other ar<lb/>ticles, before the Commissioner of Bankruptcy—I had never seen it be<lb/>fore—the one before the Magistrate was not the one which had been at my house—I believe they had changed it—the one taken from my house was my property—I know which pot they took from my house, because it was mentioned, and I missed a china pomatum-pot—at Kensington, before the magistrates, I took it up, looked at it,"and was persuaded it was so, as I knew nothing of it, and began to think they had changed it—I missed one which was mine, after the search—I believe it was the one I saw after<lb/>wards before the Commissioner—the one before the Magistrate I believe was not the same—I am sure the one before the Magistrate was not the same as that before the Commissioner—it was not anything like the one taken from my house—Mr. and Mrs. Fuller and Mr. Reeve were examined in sup<lb/>port of the charge, and I think Miss Lawrence was examined—I have seen Fuller write, and know this—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the deposition</hi>)—to be his hand<lb/>writing.</p>

               <p>saw the same box, opened it, and found it apparently in the same state, that it was sent to Manchester, where he afterwards saw it at his father's premises; that the property in it belonged to his creditors; that he Saw the pomatum pot found in Jones's house, marked it, and had it in his pos<lb/>session ever since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Lawrence</hi> deposed, that he recollected sending three or four boxes from his house, by Jones, to the railroad.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Lucy Lawrence</hi> deposed, that in April, 1841, Jones gave her the dress produced, with another; that she had previously requested him to bring her two dresses from Fuller's; that she repeatedly wore those dresses in Fuller's presence, particularly after his return from Manchester, and that he told her he thought the buff dress would not wash; she also swore that the china pot was not the same as the one she had been previ<lb/>ously examined about at the Bankruptcy Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">George Fuller,</hi> being recalled, deposed, that it was the same pot Miss Lawrence was examined about at the Bankruptcy Court; that he had had the things in his possession since January, and that he had kept the pot in his portmanteau till he gave it to Mr. Reeve within the last month; that he did not recollect whether he gave it to him on the 22nd of June, or whether he took it to Ostend; he believed it was his wife's before they were married; and had heard her say a Mrs. Gundry gave it to her."</p>

I should decidedly have said, "No'—it may be mine—allow me to see the contents—the only reason why I would swear to my belief about its being my handwriting, is the dash underneath—the signature is no more like mine than yours would be—I cannot swear it is not my signature—from the character of the writing.

I knew that the notices had been served by Mr. Reeve, and writs also issued—Fuller stated that they had not been served on him, but only on his brother; that they were accommodation bills; he did not owe a farthing on them—when I called on Mr. Reeve he suggested that a surveyor should go—Mr. Reeve said, "I am on the right side of the hedge, and I will take care and keep so; I will make him a bankrupt"—after this I purchased these things—I purchased the directory which was taken out of my house, from Fuller, in April, I cannot tell what day—there was also a royal-blue book—I gave 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the two—be made me a present of the religious book—that is the book he swore I took away without his authority—he swore he never sold the others, and I indicted him for perjury—I did not indict Mr. Reeve for perjury—whatever I had. of purchased of Fuller was after I had had the notice which he said had been badly served—he told me that the very first day I saw him—I got two Nouseline-de-laine dresses of Fuller for Miss Lawrence in April, 1841—she said to me, "Mr. Jones, will you have the kindness to call at Fulter's for me, and bring me down the mouseline-de-laine dresses I have been looking at?"—I said, "Certainly, with great pleasure"—I called—Fuller packed them up in paper—I said, "What are they? '—he said one was 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I think, and the other 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I paid him—I had no account for it—do; you suppose I would have asked Mr. Fuller to give me a receipt for two</p>

               <p>mouseline-de-laine dresses—he might have put "paid" on the parcel but I do not think he did—I believe they are entered in the books which are filed in the Bankruptcy Court—Fuller cannot produce them, they are in the Bankruptcy Court—I have given a subpoena to the registrar to produce the whole proceedings—I also had a shawl and the banding of shawls—I paid for those too—I paid for everything I had of him—I have got no bill—there was a beaver shawl—I will not swear whether I paid for that—it was a beaver shawl which he made or offered to make a pre<lb/>sent of to Miss Lawrence—Fuller stated at the time, at Mr. Lawrence's, that his lease was worth 1,600<hi rend="italic">l,</hi> and Saunders and Woolley were suing him—Mr. Lawrence said, "If that is the case, don't be made a bankrupt, I will get or obtain the money for you"—the fiat was not then in my possession—it was before I saw it—it was about the 8th, 9th, or 10th of April—I did not procure a fiat against Fuller—his father came up, and said he was determined to make his son a bankrupt, for Saunders and Woolley, he was quite certain, were nothing but swindlers; that they never intended to make him a bankrupt, but merely to obtain judgment on their bills, and go in and sweep off all he had—I thought it for the interest of the whole body of the creditors for his father to make him a bankrupt—I wished no bankruptcy should take place; but when the father was determined to do so I was not sorry to hear it, for I found Saunders and Woolley would not then be enabled to have gone in and sweep off the whole of the pro<lb/>make perty—I did not give notice to any of the creditors that I was about to him a bankrupt, it is not necessary—I never heard of such a thing-Mr. Charles Lawrence got a waistcoat from Fuller's shop—I did not buy or pay for that—I do not know who did, or how many he got—I know he had one, because I saw it myself—I had one of each colour myself, a sort of cheni which came up about that time—Mr. Fuller said, "They make very hand<lb/>some waistcoats, I will give you a piece for a waistcoat"—I said, "I am much obliged to you"—he sent for a tailor while I was at the house, who came and measured me for a waistcoat—when I went for it, there were two waistcoats instead of one, but not the same pattern—one was light, and the other dark—I did not want the waistcoat—I never asked for it—he made me a present of it—I was then striving to bring about a recon<lb/>ciliation between Fuller and Chamberlain—Chamberlain gave me a gold chain—that was at the time he was getting money out of me though, he called on me one morning, took the chain from his pocket, and said, "Your chain is a small one, not like mine, mine is larger, would you like this?"—I said, "I don't know, it is a light chain"—he said, "Very well, never mind, will you accept of it?"—I said, "I am much obliged to you"—it was rather a surprise to me, but I see it was a bait to cheat me out of my money—I had no velvet dress—I have heard about one—I have not seen it—I swear that—it was the subject of inquiry at the Police Court—Miss Lawrence admitted she had had it—I did not pay for that—I know no<lb/>thing about any lace—I heard that Mrs. Fuller had made a present of some trifling Jace to Miss Lawrence—there are several daughters—I am engaged to one of them—she had the mouseline-de-laine dresses to pay for—she did not have the shawl ends—I believe I have them myself now—I know nothing of my own knowledge of the velvet dress—the articles I bought are set forth in my examination at the Bankruptcy Court, and you have a copy of it—I bought various articles—I will not state what they</p>

               <p>were—I do not know who first took Miss Lawrence to Fuller's house—I did not, that I swear—she went there before I took her there—I do not know that I ever took her there—I will certainly swear that I have not taken her there half a dozen times, or gone with her—I have been with her perhaps once or twice, and with Mr. Lawrence—Chamberlain told me that as soon as he had sold his reversionary property, he would repay me the money I had lent him, with interest, give me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and make me a present of a service of plate—he was at that time borrowing money from me, and inducing me to pay large sums for him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you go away with the silver spoons of the bankrupt in your pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A small packet was given me by Mrs. Fuller, who said, "Will you take care of these for me?"—I afterwards gave it to Mrs. Chamberlain, by her request—she opened it, and it contained silver spoons, and that I stated at the Bankruptcy Court—it is impossible to say when that was—I do not know how long I kept the silver spoons in my possession—I kept them till I was asked for them—it may be a month or two—I cannot say whether it was three months, I will swear it was not six—I cannot tell in what month I received them—it was in April that Fuller was a bankrupt, and about November that I ceased to have any thing to say to Chamberlain—it was while Mrs. Chamberlain was residing at Hammersmith, that I delivered the spoons to her—they came to Hammersmith in June—I delivered them to Mrs. Chamberlain—it might be a month or two before I had nothing more to do with him—I will not swear it was not very close to the time at which I discontinued to have any thing to do with the matter—she had them long before Fuller ab<lb/>sconded—I delivered them before I sued Chamberlain for the money—I took them home with me after receiving them/ emdash/whether I put them in my cheffioneer, in my plate-basket, or where, I cannot say—when asked for them, I took them to Chamberlain directly, and he gave me at the same time a note for Mrs. Fuller—I have not got that note—I dare say it is among the proceedings—it was in Chamberlain's handwriting—I got a small picture from Fuller—he made me a present of it—it is a small thing not worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., perhaps—I would not give 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—it would not fetch 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if sold—I was admiring it, and he said, "I will make you a present of it, for I don't want it to hang up here"—I cannot tell how long that as be<lb/>fore his bankruptcy—it was shortly after I became acquainted with him—"was a picture of Potiphar's wife—it was a painting in oil, on a small piece of canvas, in a gilt frame, but the gilt was all off—I have seen a copy of Mr. Bingham's catalogue—the umbrella-stand was the very list article brought on to the table by the auctioneer's man—I will not swear whether it was in the catalogue—when it was brought on the table, Mr. Bingham said, "I believe it is not in the catalogue, here is an umbrella-stand, what say you for it?"—I said, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not believe there was another bidder, and he knocked it down—the room was crowded with pur<lb/>chasers—all the things were stopped—nothing was delivered that day, for the messenger came in directly after with the other fiat—I believe the marble-slab was in Mr. Bingham's catalogue—I have seen it—that I bought at the sale in a lot of sundries—the sundries were afterwards taken away and I refused to take it—the lot, to the best of my recollection, was 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said I would not give 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—he said. "it cant be helped, if you like to take it at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., do," and I said I would—I asked him to put a value on it, at the request of Mr. Chamberlain—he had repeat<lb/>edly</p>

               <p>said to me, "Whatever you wish to purchase, ask Mr. Bingham to put a value on them, and take them at his valuation, and it will save me the auction duty"—the mats, which did belong to Fuller's estate, are not in my cottage—they are in the catalogue, I believe, not as sundries, but by themselves—I am almost certain of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you at any time receive from Fuller a sum of money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, while he was in business—it was in April—I cannot give the date—I cannot tell how much, about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will swear it was not 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said to me, "My next door neighbour has borrowed some money of me, I think he will let me have it if I go for it"—he went in, came into the shop, handed me the money, and then went to serve a lady in the shop—I af<lb/>terwards returned it—on another occasion he said to his wife, "I want some money"—she gave him, I think, about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he handed it to me, and I gave it to her afterwards.</p>

               <p>me the liberty that I took with the different things at the same period—the authority from each to deal with the property was long after—Chamber<lb/>lain's execution was put in on the 19th of April—that was put in with my concurrence—I knew of it, I counselled it, and proposed it—there was a warrant of attorney—I went to Mr. Holding, Chamberlain's attorney—I think the notices on Fuller were on the 6th of April—they were earlier than my introduction to him—I was lending my assistance to Fuller and Cham<lb/>berlain to defeat the other creditor ultimately—the other creditor was suing as well as serving notices, with a view to the bankruptcy—they were pro<lb/>ceeding at law, and would in a very few days have obtained an execution—I think it was not Saunders and Woolley who were suing—the bills had been paid away to the attorney—I think they were the drawers of the bills—they were also proceeding at law—I was advising the parties merely as a friend—it was not until September that the authority was given me to buy what goods I liked, at the price Mr. Bingham put on them—in the mean time Chamberlain had been borrowing money of me, and inducing roe to lend him to a large amount—altogether I advanced him 637<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—out of that I received from Mr. Bingham the proceeds of two sales, which was, I think, 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. something, and 102<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 103<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received those amounts it Chamberlain's request—I received of Mr. Chamberlain 205<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think, to pay tome of Fuller's creditors, to whom Chamberlain gave a guarantee to secure them in a sum of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they sued Chamberlain for the amount, Chamberlain requested me to pay that amount, and I did so—I gave it to Mr. Eden/and he paid it to the attorney who was suing Chamberlain, and the receipts and vouchers are now in Mrs. Chamberlain's possession—I left them at her request with Messrs.

               <p>into his reversionary property, which he was then selling, he would pay Mr. Jones the balance and make him a present of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of plate, for he was the best friend he had in the world—he also asked Mr. Jones to call at Fuller's house in Regent-street, and pay his man his wages before quar<lb/>ter-day, because he did not want to pay another quarter's rent by keeping on the house, and to tell Hoad to pack up whatever things had been left at that house for his accommodation, and any other loose things that might be in the house, and to send them by the carrier to Hammersmith to Mr. Chamberlain's, as they were trying to dispose of the lease—in the course of that same evening I saw Mr. Jones again at my father's house—Mr. Chamberlain was there too, taking tea at our house—Mr. Jones took out of his pocket a pair of snuffers and tray, and said to Mr. Chamberlain, "These are your snuffers and tray that your man Hoad thought inconve<lb/>nient to pack up with the things, and I put them in my pocket"—Chamberlain took them, and laughed at the idea of Mr. Jones bringing a paltry pair of suffers and tray in his pocket—Chamberlain took them away with him after staving the evening—we were then intimate—Chamberlain asked Mr. Jones if he had told the man to send down the other things that he had mentioned in the morning—he said, yes he had, and that he would do it—I remember a few nights after, taking tea at Mr. and Mrs. Chamberlain's—Mr. Jones was there, my father, and sister—while there the servant came into the room, and said that her brother Hooper had brought some things from Mr. Jones, that had gone there by mistake from Regent-street—it was mentioned what the things were, but I cannot remember particularly what they were—there were many mentioned—Chamberlain said he was glad he had got all his things back again—this was in September—some time in October Mr. Jones again met Chamberlain at my father's house—(Cham<lb/>berlain was in the habit of coming to our house I should say, on an average, five times a week,) and after Mr. Jones came in after tea, in talking he pulled out a list of the accounts of the sale, and gave to Chamberlain—that was after the second or third sale—it was a little list that Mr. Bing<lb/>ham had written out, of his own things that he had bought—Chamberlain looked at it, and remarked that some of the things he thought were valued higher than they were worth—this is the list—Chamberlain asked me for a pen and ink, and altered, I believe, a glass from 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was a large pier glass—he then returned the list to Mr. Jones—he remarked that there was a marble slab in the list—he said he should like to have it, it would make a nice little bracket between his windows—Mr. Jones said, "You are perfectly welcome to have it if you send a servant for it; "here is a piece of marble 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. down in the list—on the 9th of June last Mr. Reeve called on me at St. George's Hospital—I made a memorandum of it at the time, which I have with me—I had never seen Mr. Reeve before then, that I am aware of—he asked me if my name was Lawrence—I said yes—he said his name was Reeve—he said, "I have called on you to ask you whether you were in Regent-street on Sunday, the 12th of April twelve-month, and removed goods from Fuller's"—I said, "No, I was never in Regent-street on a Sunday in my life"—he was very cross at my denying that, and told me that a Mr. Preston had written a letter, telling him that I had done it—he then said, "Do you know a person named Thomas Alley Jones?"—I said, "Yes, perfectly well"—he was very cross—he said he was a scoundrel, a villain, and a thief, that he had not any thing in his house worth 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. except what he had stolen from the bankrupt George</p>

               <p>Fuller—he said, "I know he is not worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the world; if you have not been to his house, my dear Mr. Lawrence, I hope you will go, and see for yourself"—(he was then very friendly with me)—"you will find in one cupboard a lot of miscellaneous property and other suspicious things, plated goods, such as candlesticks, &amp;c.; I hope that you and your father will take care that your sister does not marry such a <hi rend="italic">scamp,</hi> but I will take care she shall not, for we are determined to transport him for stealing pro<lb/>perty from Fuller's creditors"—I said, "Really, Mr. Reeve, you must be mistaken, I know Mr. Jones to be a man of high respectability and pro<lb/>perty; it is only a day or two since that I saw his bankers' book, by which it appears that he had paid about 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into his bankers' account this year"—Mr. Reeve said it was all stuff, it was no such thing, he knew better; he could prove it was no bankers' book at all, but a mass of forge<lb/>ries—he said Mr. Fuller was below stairs, should he call him up, and he would state the same—I said no, I did not want to have any thing more to do either with Mr. Reeve or the bankrupt, and he then left me—I was examined before the Commissioner of Bankruptcy in Fuller's case—I did not there make the same statement as to the conversation at the hospital as I have now—I said in Mr. Reeve's presence that I had made a note of this, but as it was not in the matter in question there, I did not tell him it—on the 18th, about nine days afterwards, about half-past four o'clock, I was riding on the top of an omnibus, on my way from the hos<lb/>pital to my father's, and as we were passing through Hammersmith toll<lb/>bar, Mr. Reeve stopped the omnibus, and asked me if I had seen Jones—I said, "What do you mean?"—he then said, "Mr. Jones"—I said, "No, I hare not"—he said, "I have got a warrant for him, to apprehend him for felony" I was on the seat with the driver—I do not think there were any other pas<lb/>sengers—he said it quite loud enough for persons to hear—I went on to my father's house, and after I got there I saw Mr. Reeve again with Fuller, Chamberlain, and two policemen—they came to our house, and Mr. Reeve came and rang our bell, and asked for Mr. Jones—I should say there were nearly fifty people collected—I saw Mr. Jones's servant stand<lb/>ing in the middle of the road among the people, and Mr. Reeve said to one of the policemen, "Take that girl into custody, she is Mr. Jones's servant"—the policeman said he could not do it—Mr. Reeve said, Then watch her well, because when we take Mr. Jones we shall search his house," and he was pointing to our bouse, at the same time saying "That is a house that property is concealed in; they have stolen property"—he said this in the presence of all the people—I believe he only rang the bell once while I was there—they were walking about the Broadway and the street till I do not know how late—I myself put on a white jacket, and went among them—I do not think they knew me—they remained there till very late in the evening—Mr. Reeve was stopping every omnibus that passed—I do not know whether the policemen interfered so much, but Reeve, Chamberlain, and Fuller ran to look at every omnibus, and was stopping them while they were passing—I did not hear them make any inquiries—this was on a Saturday—I think I had been to Westminster Hall that morning about Mr. Jones's action—that was the day on which Mr. Jones's trial had been appointed for the 23rd—I went to the Kensington Police Court on the Monday following, and saw Mr. Jones there, in custody, on some charge—I do not recollect whether I saw any of the defendants there then—I think the hearing was adjourned till the Wednesday—I went again on Wednesday</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184209190028"/>
               <p>a note of it afterwards—I did not, on Mr. Reeve further questioning me, say that it had nothing to do with it, and therefore I would state it—I did not answer in that way—I said, "Other circumstances occurred between us, the import of which has nothing to do with this, consequently I shall not now state it, but on arriving home I wrote down all I recol<lb/>lected of the conversation"—I stated but very little of what I have said to<lb/>day—everything was put in question and answer, and I could not go into things not asked me—I swear that the two waistcoats was all the property that ever came into my possession from the bankrupt's estate—to the best of my knowledge I never had any other property of the bankrupt's at any other time—I cannot think of any thing else—I firmly believe I never had—I cannot give a stronger answer—I do not consider I am bound to swear positively, but I am certain I had not—the next day I was off by the coach to Tenterden, and I never heard anything more of the parties till I returned some months afterwards—I left on the 20th of April—it was before the bankruptcy that I had these waistcoats—I did not think I was doing wrong in accepting them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not the day before you went to Tenterden, that you took away the goods in the cab? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but I have never admitted that I took goods—I took some linen for Mrs. Fuller, who was coming to our house to visit, and I believe some books—I went on that occasion to fetch my waistcoat home—I had only known Fuller for two or three days then—I did not go there to breakfast, but breakfast being on the table they asked me to take some.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Fullers Defence.</hi> In April, last year, I was possessed of a house and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184209190046"/>
               <p>premises in Regent-street, for which, in the previous November I had paid a premium of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on an annual rental of 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I had a stock worth 1800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., furniture worth 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, and expended 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and upward in additions; I had credit everywhere, money at my banker's, and at bright prospects of doing well as any man. From the detail I am about to lay before you, you will find much to condemn; perhaps, for myself, little to pity. Messrs. Saunders and Woolly were employed by me to make the decorations; I gave acceptances for their debt, and had a right to expect they would be met, having to receive a considerable sum from Chamber<lb/>lain, my father-in-law; the loan was postponed on account of some delay in completing the sale of the estate, and my acceptances were dishonored; I explained to Mr. Saunders my situation, and he had such an opinion of my honesty as a tradesman, and my faith as a man, that he was content to forego any further security, relying on the character I had earned by yean of honest servitude. In April, 1841, I received from Chamberlain 1600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. It was rather less than the sum I had been led to expect, and it was accompa<lb/>nied by a demand that I should give a warrant of attorney; perhaps it was right to require it, but it was unexpected on my part, and this, accompa<lb/>nied by a diminution in the loan, led to a quarrel; I was unable to take up the acceptances, and on the 6th of April, 1841, I was served with I writ and demand of payment within twenty-one days; it was the first and last writ I ever received; I was astounded and knew not what to do, and in an evil hour I went to Mr. Lawrence, of Grove-cottage, whom I had known in my early days, to seek advice how to act; I told him my case; on the following day Miss Lawrence came to my bouse, and said she had a friend, a gentleman to whom she was engaged, a barrister, who would see me safely through the matter, and no money out of pocket. Can it be won<lb/>dered that inexperienced and embarrassed as I was, I should gladly accept such an offer? securing, as I thought, the services of an eminent barrister, the nephew of Mr. Alley—little did I then know that he was an attorney's clerk. I was introduced to this friend, who was to set all ray difficulties straight—it was Mr. Jones, the prosecutor—I am precluded, from my situa<lb/>tion, from giving evidence on oath, but in the presence of God, before whose bar I must one day appear, I solemnly assert, that the first thing this man tried to persuade me to do was to get my brother Charles to declare he had been served with a process instead of me; as, however, he could not per<lb/>suade me to this, he stated he would hit on another plan, whereby Saonden and Woolley should be defeated, at the same time telling me my scruples were ridiculous, and that such things were done daily. How was it, you will say, that I did not at once repudiate not only the advice but the ad<lb/>viser?—well, indeed, would it have been for me, had I done so; but those only placed in commercial embarrassment can estimate the difficulties that surround a man, and make him listen to any mode which he hopes may serve him. It was then suggested that I should give a bill for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to an auctioneer, a friend of his, who should strike a friendly docket, and carry me safely through; as, however, I felt some diffidence in placing my<lb/>self in the hands of a stranger, it was arranged that I should write to my father, give him a bill of exchange, and that he should strike a docket on it; this was on the 12th; on the Friday after my father had an internet with Mr. Reeve; from that Monday Mr. Lawrence and his daughter were constantly at my house, dined at my table, and on each evening carried away some articles from my shop, the old gentleman saying Lucy might take what</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184209190047"/>
               <p>she pleased, and pay me when my troubles were over. On Saturday the 17th, Jones came to my house from the country; he said Mr. Chamber<lb/>lain would put an execution in next Monday, and begged me to pack up some things which he could take away and secure for us; on that occasion he took a yellow painted box full of goods, among others two mousse line-de<lb/>laine dresses, various little articles of the toilet, also some curtains, both damask and muslin; on the following day, April the 18th, I saw him at Mr. Lawrence's house; he then stated that he had ascertained that Chamberlain's execution was not so much to be feared, as the docket being struck by Walters and Reeve, and advised me to secure so much of my stock as would enable me to start in business again; my scruples were overruled by Mr. Law<lb/>rence, who said it was of every day's occurrence; he instanced several per<lb/>sons who had followed the same plan, and were now worth several thousand pounds, and said that my credit would be better than ever. I was beguiled by his advice, seconded by the arts of Jones, and I executed the fatal deed on the following day. On Monday, the 19th, Charles Lawrence break<lb/>fasted at my house, and afterwards removed upwards of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property at one swoop; silks, satins, and costly shawls, in a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and the account now in possession of the solicitors to the fiat, and which, I declare, I received from Jones himself, charges me with the very <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-hire on that day which conveyed away my property; about twelve o'clock on that day Chamberlain put in his execution. On the 29th April, early in the morn<lb/>ing, Jones told me in a great hurry that Walters and Reeve had obtained execution against me, and I must leave my house, or I should be put in priaon; I was then entirely under his control, I implicitly believed what be told me, and I left my house, never to return to it—yes, within sit months of my expending 1187<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the premises, without anything to induce my departure but the lies of this Mr. Jones, I was frightened away from my house, and became a broken man. I have since ascertained, and if it is needed it can be proved, that his statement was utterly false; that Messrs. Walters and Reeve had no judg<lb/>ment against me, and that this was a mere pretext to get me away from my house, and leave my valuable property to his plunder. Previous, however, to this, my father had returned to town; an old stamp was supplied by Jones, and a note of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., drawn by my father on me, was executed at the Burton coffee-house, in Cheap side; a docket was struck on this; the act of bankruptcy being, that Jones and my father should go and knock at my front-door, inquire if I was at home, and that this should be denied. Jones and my father having parted from me in my par<lb/>lour, went through my shop, and knocked at my private door; as previously instructed, one of my young men, named Preston, denied me; they then gravely passed through the shop again, and returned to my parlour, laugh<lb/>ing heartily at the forms of law; they then went to the Bankrupt-office, and struck the docket; when my father returned, he told me how Jones had ken puzzled to describe himself, and that at last he had put himself down as clerk to Mr. Eden; which, he said, he supposed was some <hi rend="italic">humbug,</hi> Previous to that, I believed him to be a barrister, and a person of fortune, and was disposed the more implicitly to place myself under his control. I can ask myself now, how I could be such a fool? but I used to listen to the stories of this man and of his grand relatives, and little knew his <hi rend="italic">real history.</hi> On one occasion he wished me to dine with him at the Temple-hall, where, he said, champagne would be flowing in quantities;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184209190048"/>
               <p>he was previously aware that I was engaged; he afterwards taid his health had been drunk by the Solicitor-General; he pointed out house in Hammersmith, which he said belonged to him; and was believed by myself and family to be a person of great importance; and the assurances of Mr. Lawrence and his daughter, that he was a man of fortune, induced me to place myself in his hands, and to plunge myself into that vortex by which I have been brought to destruction. I left my house on the 29th of April, and then went for a short time to old Mr. Lawrence's; I was there three days, with the bulk of my property, there concealed, and I then removed, by Jones's desire, to Manchester; while there, I saw in the papers that Walters and Reeve had got a fiat against me. I was asto. nished, and so was my father. We had been assured by Jones that hit fiat would prevent any other proceedings. I returned to town, and, by Jones's advice, it was arranged that I should be introduced to some soli<lb/>citor in the City, whose name would carry some weight, and support me in passing my examination—he pitched on Mr. Alderman Wood; an in<lb/>troduction was effected, I know not how; I saw the Alderman, and my balance-sheet, sketched out by old Mr. Lawrence and Jones, was laid before him; he took care never to let me see the Alderman alone. I understand now how it was that I was never trusted by myself. I begged Jones to allow me to restore the goods to Walters and Reeve. I said, now, as his fiat had failed and been set aside, the goods had better be given up to the creditors. Mr. Lawrence, Miss Lawrence, and Mr. Jones, prevented this; my scruples were ridiculed; and when I said it would be perjury to pass such accounts as sketched out by him, he said, for that matter, all bankrupts did it; he mentioned instances that he had knows, of men who had property concealed, and were afterwards successful in business; and when this seemed to have no effect, Miss Lawrence flung herself on the sofa in hysterics, exclaiming, that they had done all they could to serve me, and now I should get them all transported; (I should have mentioned that Miss Lawrence herself is half an attorney; with ber own hand she engrossed the affidavits in support of the fiat; she, Jones, myself, and my brother Charles's wife, met at Mr. Charles Anslip's apartments, and there she took as active and energetic a part as Jones him<lb/>self; that affidavit is now in the Court of Review; I have seen it; it would have gpne to Mr. Anslip's stationers, but there was not sufficient time;) at length I consented; I appeared before the Court, and passed my accounts; now his snares were completed, and his victim wsi secured—what mattered it to Mr. Jones and the Lawrence. however I re<lb/>sisted? I had sworn to my accounts—my property was then, and is now, in their possession. Jones had been hitherto dressed so shabbily, that it was the subject of remark; but "he is an eccentric man," was the explanation; now he makes a different appearance. Miss Lawrence, who, until then appeared dressed very plainly, suddenly appeared dressed in satins, the plunder of my creditors; while the very body-linen of my wife, taken out of kindness, as she said, was, without scruple, appropriated to her own person; my suspicions that they meant to leave me in the lurch were ex<lb/>cited by this. A short time afterwards I encountered a younger sister of Miss Lawrence's in the streets of St. Ives, and recognized on her shoulders a valuable shawl of mine, which I say plainly was and is stolen from my creditors; I had never sold it. I mentioned it to several parties with me; I gave information to Walters and Reeve, the solicitors to the fiat: they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184209190049"/>
               <p>have written to Mr. John Lawrence, of St. Ives, charging his sister with being in possession of goods stolen from my estate; and all the explana<lb/>tion they could obtain from him was, that if I chose to subpoena any of the family, and pay their expenses, they would come up; when I have not a farthing in the world. In September, 1841, part of the goods were sent to my father's, in a box removed by Jones; it arrived apparently in the same condition, but, on opening it, a mousse line-de-lain dress had been removed; and a little china pot, a present to my wife in her childwood valued on that account; these form this subject of the first count in the indictment; these articles were missed, and again until found in the houses of Miss Lawrence and Mr. Jones. I most solemnly assert that they were removed from the box given to Jones, and taken away from my house on Saturday, 17th of April; I missed them immediately I opened the box; my wife was angry at finding them gone, but I said she must say nothing; we were in Jones's hands, and could not complain of the loss of such trifles; as, however, I had, as I believed, from 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods still re<lb/>maining in his hands, I sent to him to inquire what his demand against me was; his letters are now open to your inspection. I afterwards met him, and said if he would give me what goods he had I would give them to Messrs. Walters and Reeve, and never disclose to them what part he had acted in the matter; he laughed at me, and at length plainly said, that if I dared to <hi rend="italic">split</hi> it should be my ruin; he, perhaps, might get a short im<lb/>prisonment, bull that the assignees should never get their goods, and they would be sure to proceed, and transport myself and him. I made the only reparation in my power; I went to Mr. Alderman Wood, and told him all; by his advice I went to Messrs. Walters and Reeve—I confessed all that had been done, and, as they can bear me witness, without making any sti<lb/>pulations for myself as to mercy. I made a statement and signed it, leaving myself entirely in their hands; the consequence was that search warrants were obtained; the houses of Miss Lawrence and Mr. Jones were searched: in the former were the remnants of property once con<lb/>cealed; but in the latter, the house was filled with furniture that had once been mine. This Mr. Jones, professing to be a barrister and a man of for<lb/>tune, turned out to be the resident of a small cottage, value about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week, and the costly furniture which once decorated my premises in Re<lb/>gent-street, was there discovered; in the bed-room I recognized my door mat, and several other articles equally out of place, and the china pot was in the cupboard. As to the examination that took place by the solicitors to the fiat, that will speak for itself; and if, as men of business, you can read the examinations of Mr. Jones and Miss Lawrence and say that they are inno<lb/>cent, then I must submit to your verdict, only saying, that in this case vice would be triumphant. It may be as well to state that Mr. Jones, when be obtained this true bill against me, and got process on it, dared to appear at the house of Mr. Chamberlain at half past ten o'clock at night; my wife and Mrs. Chamberlain were preparing for bed, partly undressed, they were dragged to the station, Mr. Jones, accompanied by four policemen, personally superintending their capture; and he even dared to come to my house clad in my own clothes, the plunder of my wardrobe; I taxed him with it, and he did not, and dared not, deny it. I am charged with endeavoring to injure the character of Mr. Jones; if either he or Miss Lawrence had had a character, I should not now be standing at your bar but should have been a respectable tradesman, a respected master,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184209190050"/>
               <p>and, I am sure, a prosperous man. Much was said yesterday by Mr. Bodkin about the indictment for perjury preferred against me by Mr. Jones. I am glad he did so, as it affords me an opportunity of account<lb/>ing for the delay which took place between the search warrants in January and the proceedings in June. I accidentally heard that I had been in<lb/>dicted; (in fact, I saw one of the Grand jury;) I knew not by whom, I fan<lb/>cied it was by my creditors; and until a copy of the indictment could be obtained I went to Ostend, having a cousin there, who keeps the English hotel; I was there three weeks, and a copy of the indictment was for<lb/>warded to me, and when I found that the two witnesses against me were Mr. Jones and Miss Lawrence, I returned instated, and walked the streets of London for months. Mr. Jones never intended to indict me for a shilling; I was still in the same apartment where he once called, and where one of his let<lb/>ters was addressed, No. 5, Waruick-court, Hol born. Mr. Jones told me that the creditors would take no proceedings against him until I had given them the opportunity of testing the truth of his statement by putting him into the witness box. I had no funds; I could not raise enough to defend my<lb/>self; I told Mr. Reeve that I was ready and anxious to be tried; I ob<lb/>tained an order for the <hi rend="italic">certiorari</hi> by Mr. Reeve's advice; I met my trial, and knowing myself to be perfectly innocent, gave Jones the opportunity of clearing his character. The indictment for perjury was under proceed<lb/>ings in bankruptcy; it became necessary, therefore, that the fiat should be proved; this could only be done by Mr. Reeve, and <hi rend="italic">to</hi> prevent any <hi rend="italic">chance</hi> or pretext for Jones saying that the case failed on technical grounds, Mr. Reeve served the notice that I would take my trial personally at once, and gave him a pledge that any evidence which was necessary from his office, as solicitor to the fiat, should be forthcoming; he did this with my full knowledge, consent, and wish, for I was as anxious as he could be that the case should be tried fairly and openly on its merits, Mr. Jones called at Mr. Reeve's office the following day, and said he wished him to write him a letter; Mr. Reeve immediately sent the following letter; notice to pro<lb/>duce the original has been served on Mr. Jones, and the copy can be proved:—"Sir, I can have nothing to write to you about; to prevent any pretence for the case against George Fuller breaking down oo technical points, I give you notice that I will take care that any witness you require from our office shall be forthcoming, and that the residence of any others whom you may require shall be furnished, if known to us. I write this to prevent any mistake; the cause is entered on Monday—it stands No. 2. To Mr. T. A. Jones, 12, Villiers-street, Strand." Now, will it be believed, that on preparing for my trial at great expense, on the case being called on, Jones slunk out of Court, and it turned out that he had issued a <hi rend="italic">cer<lb/>tiorari,</hi> and this was his pretended anxiety to vindicate his character. This happened on Tuesday, the 14th of June. Mr. Reeve then said, "Now I have put you and Jones to the test, he is afraid of the encounter, and I believe all that you have told me. The same week a warrant was obtained against Jones, as deposed to by Mr. Clive, so that the delay which had occurred was not five months, but three days, and the statement that that had anything to do with the trial of Mr. Chamberlain is false. Mr. Reeve can prove what I have said is all true, and that so far from Chamberlain and myself being friends as soon as Jones commenced his ridiculous action against me, we were not even on speaking terms when Jones and the Lawrences' houses were searched—he can prove that all the proceedings of the assignees had been totally irrespective of Chamberlain,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184209190051"/>
               <p>and that so far from his having anything to do with them, he never ap<lb/>peared in the case but when compelled. The china pot, which there has been so much said about, was never produced at the Bankruptcy Court at all on any occasion. Mr. Reeve sent a person out of court for it; it was in my possession; Mr. Reeve allowed Mrs. Fuller to reserve it; the other articles produced were all marked by Mr. Commissioner Merivale as ex<lb/>hibits; the mousseline-de-laine dresses were only bought a short time pre<lb/>viously; the black ground one I bought of Messrs. James and Co., of Friday-street, they cost me 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each; is it likely I should sell them for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.? No article ever left my shop to any customer without a bill being made and examined by a young man, and it was always stamped by the cashier in the books; the official assignees possess every book of mine. and the receipts show no such account; I most solemnly declare that they were never paid for.</p>

Dear Sir,—I am really surprised I did not hear from you, in answer to my letter of Thurs<lb/>day last. However, I am still unwilling to believe any thing to your pre<lb/>judice; I therefore trust I shall hear from you by return of post; and as you stated in your last letter you could not depend on your father to send you money to take you to him, if he has not, I will send you the needful. They state they intend to go before the next Grand Jury, but I will watch their movements, and let you know. If they should at all apply to your father, tell him not to be frightened, but immediately write to me, and I will see to it." "T. A. J."</p>

I went out at twelve o'clock at night, to night-duty at the Docks, on the 17th of September, and on returning, at half-past two in the morning, I found the door of the house ajar—I had left it quite fast, so that it could not be opened without a latch-key, and as I went up stairs I heard a noise—I knocked at my own room door—my wife let me in—I went into another room, hearing the noise, and saw the prisoner standing in the middle of the room, dressed all but his shoes—I asked who he was, and what business he had there—he said he did not know how he came there—I gave an alarm—the landlord fetched a police<lb/>man, who took him—I examined the room, and found a bag, containing a shirt and a shift belonging to my little girl, and a window-blind of mine—the articles now produced are them, and are mine—they had been in the same room before, but loose, not in the bag—the door had been locked witn a latch-key.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 31, Great Queen-street, Lin<lb/>coln's Inn-fields, and am in the employ of Baring, Brothers, and Co. On the night of the 20th of August I had been to see a friend in Heroming's-row, and left his house at past one o'clock in the morning, and was pro<lb/>ceeding towards home—when I got to St. Martin's-place, the prisoner accosted me—he appeared to have been loitering about there, and as I passed by him he muttered something to me—I did not hear what he said—I passed on without noticing it, and when I got to the end of St. Martin's-place I crossed over obliquely to St. Martin's-Iane, and find<lb/>ing him following close behind me I said to him, "What the devil do you follow me for?"—he made no answer, but turned back to Hemming's-row, and left me—I went on through New-street into Covent-garden, and saw nothing more of him till I got to the piazzas, and half way along the piazzas, between James-street and Evans's hotel, the prisoner came behind me, and said, "If you don't, I will charge you with the police with an unnatural offence"—this was said in more than a whisper—I did not notice any per<lb/>son about him at the time—I still walked on, and my exclamation was, What?"—I was entirely taken by surprise—I said, "What?" and he came up to me, took hold of my arm, and said, "Then I will," and gave me immediately in charge of a policeman who was at the corner of James-street—I had not seen the policeman before I got to the corner of James-street—he said, "I give you in charge," and said to the policeman, "I give this gentleman in charge for an indecent assault," as near as I can remember, for I was excessively confused—the policeman took me to the station, the prisoner going with me—he there made a charge against me—I this was Saturday night—I was locked up thirty-six or thirty-seven hours till Monday morning—there were two intoxicated persons in the cell with me at first—they were bailed—there was two other persons, one</p>

                  </hi>. I am a basket-maker, in Leg-alley, Long<lb/>acre. I heard a disturbance in the neighbourhood on this night, and went into Bow-street to see what it was—I saw a man in custody of a policeman, and a crowd of persons assembled—I saw Sweeney knocked down by something thrown at him—I was standing by the side of the person who threw it—the prisoner is the man—I said it was a shame and others of the mob began to get round me—I pointed out the prisoner to Woolf—I did not lose sight of him till the policeman came up, not till Woolf took him—he slipped behind one or two men directly after he threw the stone, when I called out it was a shame—I did not lose sight of him recognised him afterwards at the station.</p>

Q.</hi> Did not you go to the station with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did, but the crowd was so great that they would not let me in—I saw him at the station two hours after, and recognised him—he was next to me when he threw the brick or stone, I cannot say which it was—I saw him throw something heavy and cried out it was a shame, and the people came up—some of the mob wanted to know what odds it was to me—it was not more than a minute or a minute and a half at most after that, that I gave him in</p>

               <p>custody—it was about half-past ten o'clock—I was at home and hearing a noise went out—I did not know Woolf or Sweeney before—many people did not come round me, because as soon as I gave him into custody I ran to the station—there was several round me before, and they shoved me about—I had got out of their way when the policeman came up, and was standing opposite them with my face towards them, but sometimes I was shoved about—the policeman came running up the street—I did not see him before—the policeman did not speak to me before I spoke to him—he came up in front of me, and I said, "That is the man that knocked the man down"—I was close to the man—I was touching him, in fact—I was afraid he was going to give me a blow, and I held his hands—I was doing so when the policeman came up, as I had seen him raise up his hand and was afraid of his striking me—that was not half a minute before—I was in front of the crowd the whole time—I had never seen the prisoner before—I do not know what coloured coat or hat he had on, it being dark—I did not stop to take notice, I came up alone.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Francis-street, Old-street-road. I know the prisoners—I know Smith only by being in company with Coleman—I have only seen him in his company—on the 19th of August I saw then together from half-past one to two o'clock in the afternoon—I was talking to a neighbour opposite my place, and saw them together—I asked Cole<lb/>man what brought him down there—he said he had come down there, as he had given a young man some spoons to put away for him—a little boy was there—Smith said nothing for some time—he then said, "You had better send the boy away, or else we may be found out"—Coleman showed me a handful of silver—I asked how he came by it—he said he had entered the place of Mr. Blundell.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 20th of August apprehended Coleman—I told him it was for committing a burglary at his master's, Mr. Blundell's—he said he did not know Mr. Blundell, and did not know any thing about the robbery—I asked what he had done with the money—I neither threatened nor promised him—I cautioned him, told him he need not tell any thing unless he liked, and it might be pro<lb/>duced in evidence against him—he said they parted the money, and the other one had the spoons—that was the next thing he said after saying he knew nothing of the robbery.</p>

I am the prosecutors's forman, and was employed at Lower Seymour-street—Thomas Harvey was there and had charge of the lead to cut it up to the best advantage for his work—in the evening of the 31st August, about six o'clock, I was at work just over the entrance I hallooed "<hi rend="italic">plumber,</hi>" he did not answer—I hallooed "<hi rend="italic">Plumber,</hi>" again, he looked up and made no answer—I said, "Stop, I want you"—I ran down but he was out of sight—I turned down Seymour-mews, came up with him, and then Thomas was with him—I followed, and said, "Har<lb/>vey, you have got something which don't belong to you, I suspect you have got lead"—Thomas said, "No, I have not"—I said, "Come back"—he said. "I have nothing in my bag but some solder and my tools, and what belongs to me"—I brought them back and shot this lead out of the bag—I said, "Are you not ashamed?"—he said he was going to make a bell-trap and a sink or something—he said, "Put it by, and don't say anything more, for God's sake"—I said, "I must tell master"—I begged him to go away and come and see the master in the morning—I had to go home to Finchley I got wet and did not get back next morning until eight o'clock, and my master was there—Thomas came in with a bag of solder on his back—he went to the door which I had the key of—I went to open it and my master told me to get a policeman—Thomas went after him and begged of him not to do it, and said he would settle it—my master insisted on my going, and before I got back he was taken—this is my master's lead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant inspector of the General Post letter carriers. The prisoner was a General Post letter carrier for the Temple division—on the 30th of August, in consequence of suspicion, I obtained the sanction of Mr. Bower, clerk to Mr. Thesiger, to have a letter directed to him, containing coins—I made up a letter, containing a sovereign, half-a-crown, and shilling, directed it to "Mr. Bower, F. Thesiger, Esq., Temple, London"—I marked the coins myself with a broken-pointed penknife, and am quite able to swear to the marks again—I showed the letter to my superior, Mr. Kelly, and showed him the marks I had made on the money—I put a wafer in the letter, and handed it to Mr. Kelly, who affixed a stamp to the wafer—I afterwards had it, kept it in my possession till the following morning, when I gave it to Mr. Clare—Mr. Boyden, another assistant inspector, was with him—I afterwards went to the Temple, and saw Mr. Bower—I got back to the post-office about twelve o'clock, and saw the prisoner about one—he was brought to the office by Mr. Boyden in custody, taken into Mr. Kelly's room, and questioned—Mr. Peacock was present—he was told a letter had been missed on his walk that morning, and was asked to account for that letter—he said he had delivered all the let<lb/>ters he took out that morning for delivery—he was afterwards searched by Tyrrell, the officer, who took out of his pocket some silver—I saw among it a half-crown piece, which I immediately recognised as the one I put into the letter—he said he had brought it from home that morning—I am quite positive the one now produced is it, by a slight mark at the termination of the hair at the nape of the neck—it was made by pressing the knife on it, and moving the coin round—it is almost a circular hole—I made a si<lb/>milar mark on the sovereign and shilling, all in the same place—a shilling and sovereign were afterwards produced to me, which I knew again by the same mark.</p>

I took tike prisoner for stealing a couch—he said he had purchased it of a gentlenman in the baggage warehouse about three months ago, and it was at his house in Mile-End-road—I went with him, found the couch, and brought it away—this is Mr. Broderip the Magistrate's handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—" The prisoner says,' This is a couch that had remained since September last in the baggage warehouse; it was landed as part of the luggage of Mrs. Duggan, a pas senger, and was left behind, as not belonging to her. About three month back, a person stating himself to be Mr. Beavan, who came home as a surgeon in the <hi rend="italic">Dartmouth,</hi> inquired for a couch belonging to him, and identified this as his; he made some inquiry of me as to what was necessary to be done; I replied, his own order would be required, and the payment of charges; he requested me to write him the form of an order; that individual signed the order, and took it away with him, stating he would send for it; some time elapsed, perhaps a week or two, after that, and the same individual came <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the baggage warehouse, and presented the order for the purpose of sending away the couch; he made a remark even then, that it would be almost useless to him, that he scarce knew what he should do with it, or words to that effect. I asked him if he would part with it; he agreed to do so, and the price was arranged for it; I handed the money to him, and in return he passed me the order; this has been lying from that time up to last Friday amongst other papers of a similar description; the order was passed over by me to Scott to receive the couch, and ultimately <hi rend="italic">to</hi> leave it at my house.'</p>

I am clerk to Mr. Richards, of New City Chambers-On Sunday evening, the 4th of September, I was going along Whitechapel, and at the end of George-yard I was taken hold of by the collar of my coat, dragged up George-yard, and knocked down at the end of it—I was tripped up, and thrown violently on my back—I am not certain whether the person came up to me behind or before—he was at my side when he tripped me up—he caught hold of my collar, and threw me on my back—I am not quite certain whether there was more than one person then—there was two when I was down—one put his hand on my mouth while I was down, the other tore open my coat and waistcoat, and with force took away my watch, which was suspended by a guard from my neck—it was a silver, double-cased watch—the guard was quite broken—they both immediately ran off—I cried out for a policeman—my head was cut very much, and I was very much hurt on my loins, so much so, that I could not rise for several minutes—that was from no other violence than the fall—when I got up there was a little boy standing, who saw the whole transaction—a policeman came up—I got up and went to the station with him and the boy—on the Friday following I saw the prisoner Rowan in custody—I cannot swear to his being one of the persons that attacked me, but I believe him to be the person whose hand was on my mouth, for I felt his jacket rough—I have some slight knowledge of seeing him at the time—my hat was rather over my eyes—I did not see Allen till last Wednesday—I am of opinion that he is the man that took my watch—I am confident of that—he stood in front of me, wrenching at my waistcoat—I had an opportunity at that time of seeing his person—the place was not very light—there was no gas near it—I have no doubt of his being the man—I believe I saw the prisoners in a public-house before the robbery—I am not quite certain, but they are like the men I saw there—I was not quite sober at the time this happened—my watch has not been found. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi>

On Sunday night, the 4th of September, about twelve o'clock, I was in Whitechapel—I go out with physic from a doctor's shop, and was going home after doing my work—I was at the shop till near midnight—I saw two men knock a gentleman down in George-yard—they tripped him up behind, pulled him right up the court, laid him down, and one of them kneeled down and put his hand on his mouth while the other took the watch off his neck—I saw them do it—it was the prisoners—I have often seen them about Whitechapel—Allen sold apples—I have bought apples of him—I had seen Rowan before that night with Allen—one had a corduroy jacket, and the other something like a black coat—I did not do anything when I saw this—I stopped till the gentleman got up, and then went to the station with the policeman, and gave a description of the men—the prisoners, ran away up the court—Rowan tripped the gentleman up, and the other took his watch—I saw Rowan at Lambeth-street-office on the Wednesday after the robbery, and Allen last Friday—I have been there twice to see</p>

On Sunday night, the 4tn of September, I was on duty in Whitechapel—I heard a noise, went to George-yard, and found the prosecutor had been knocked down and robbed of his watch—he was the worse for liquor, and all over dirt and blood—he was just at the entrance when I came to him, just in the street—he was standing up—I saw a boy there, but did not notice it was Howard till we were on the way to the station—Howard went there with the gentleman and me, and gave a description of the men.</p>

I received information on the 5th of September, and on the 9th I saw the prosecutor—he had been confined to his bed till then—I went with him to the Red Lion and Spread Eagle in Whitechapel—there were about ten people in the room—I told the prosecutor to go in and look about him—there were five or six young men about the same age as the prisoners—the prosecutor pointed out Rowan, and said he believed he was one, but be should not like to swear to him—I took him—I saw Howard next day—he gave me a description of two people, and of their dresses, in consequence of which I apprehended Allen at the Founders' Arms, Brick-lane—when I went in he held his head down for seven or eight minutes—I took Howard next day to Lambeth street office, and opened the cell—there were from ten to twelve men there—I asked him to look round, and see if he knew anybody—he looked round, and pointed out Allen, and said, "That is the one that knocked the gentleman down, and the other one held his hand over his mouth"—I do not think Allen heard this—it was said just at the door—he might have done so—on the night of the robbery I was in White chapel from seven to half-past nine o'clock, and saw the prisoners go into the Red Lion and Spread Eagle—I saw them about three times in the street, going in and out of that house, which. is about twenty yards from George-yard—I knew them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Rowan.

                  <hi rend="italic">Rowan's Defence.</hi> Last Friday week, about half-past seven o'clock, I was in the Red Lion and Spread Eagle; Foay, two other officers, and the prosecutor, came in and looked round, the officer said, "Stand up," and we all stood up. The prosecutor looked round, and said, "No, I don't see any body here," and was going out; Foay called him back, pointed to me, and said, "Don't you think it looks something like him?" he said, "Why I don't know, I can't say;" he said, "Will you give him in charger?" he said, "I can't say it is him." He said, "I shall take you in charge". I said "Very well;" he said he could prove where the watch was taken to, and what it was sold for; he took me, and next morning he brought Howard to the station; as soon as he saw the policeman putting the hand cuffs on me, he said, "That is him." Howard stated, at first, that it was two men in white jackets; and afterwards, he said one had a black coat on, and I was the other. He denied ever having said that both had white jackets on, till Bull was called in and stated it; and then he said he could hardly see in the dark. The prosecutor told the policeman he</p>

On the morning of the 25th, about twenty minutes before nine o'clock, I saw Mr. Robinson, who also lodges in the house, go out to his work—I wished him good morning—directly after I saw the police-sergeant go into Bayes's shop—(Bayes is a man who has not been caught)—I turned up stain to my own room—about five minutes before ten I was sweeping the stairs down, when Bayes came to the two pair front, where Hills lodges—he asked her a question—I cannot say what it was, but the answer she made was, "I dare not take anything in; I am not allowed to take anything in or out of Mr. Robinson's room in his absence"—Bayes, I believe, had two carpets in his possession—Hills lodges with Robinson—she has been a servant, and always appeared a very nice young woman—Bayes returned down stain—in about a minute he came up again, knocked at the door, and said, "Mary, if you do not take this carpet I shall be transported; they will not come to look into anybody's place, only mine"—Bayes owns the bottom part of the house, and lets the second-floor front—Hills looked very pale and frightened, and went down stairs—he said he would make her a present—she called another woman, a lodger in the same room—they took the carpet out of the first-floor front, and put it into Mr. Robinson's room, in his absence—directly afterwards she locked the door and went out—she returned at a quarter to one—at one Robinson returned to his dinner—it was as much as I could do to tell him anything about the carpet before the policeman knocked at the door, and the carpet was found in his back-room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Henry Bradshaw Fearon, a wine merchant, in Bond-street. The prisoner was in his employ—on Monday, the 28th of March, I saw a bottle in one of the cellars, where it ought not to have been, which excited my suspicion—I marked the cork of the bottle, and when the men bail left the cellar, I went and the bottle was gone—I left directions to watch the prisoner—I saw him afterwards, followed him, and took him back to the counting house—I asked him, if he had any bottle or bottles about him—he said, "No, I have not"—I insisted on searching him—he objected, and retreated from the counting house backwards through the warehouse, till he got to the door—I then put my hand on his wrist and right shoulder to prevent his going out—he broke from me, and ran across the street, and back again—I ran after him down a gateway towards Grosvenor-mews, through Sadler's livery-stable-yard, and up Brook's-mews—I there saw him pull a bottle from under his leather apron on the left side, and dash it to the ground—shortly after I saw him pull another out, and dash it to the ground—I got the corks, and one was the cork I had marked—I believe the bottles and brandy to be Mr. Fearon's. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Everett, of Fetter lane. On Tuesday, the 30th of August, I received this note by the hands of the prisoner Crispin—he said Mr. Adams had given it to him—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Dear Sir, In consequence of the misconduct of Messrs Everett's man in calling and making such a disturbance in the street, I shall decline opening your shop; therefore I send you the key"—Crispin said he had let the shop to Adams; that he had taken it in the first instance for him-at self, but he could not get goods as he thought he should; and having been some expense, and the rent coming shortly due, he had let it to Adams at 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week; he had paid him one week's rent, and there was another due—he said he had no reference at all with Adams, and he should be very glad to find him, so as to get his rent—he did not offer to help me to find him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Durham-place west, Hackney-road. The prisoner Crispin occupied a house of mine, No. 20, Holy well-street, Strand,—he took it some time previous to Lady-day—the rent was to commence on Lady-day—I cannot tell how long he lived there—I gave him some time to put the windows in, and he got a man to put them in for him—I had had a very bad tenant there before—Crispin referred me to some person in Doctors' Commons, a Mr. Steel, I believe, and I received this letter answering my inquiries—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Knowing Mr. Crispin, who was lately a tenant of mine in the country, I can have no hesitation in saying that anything he promises or engages will be paid and attended to—he has paid me, and I entertain a high respect for him"—I went about this person but could not see the man—I have not got my rent of Crispin—I have not got my house, and do not know who has—I suppose it is some of the parties in connexion with Mr. Crispin.</p>

I am an ironmonger, and live in Chiswell-street. On the 27th of August a person calling himself Mr. Adams, came to my shop—I have not seen him since—I did not attend to him myself, but I just caught sight of his face as he was in the show-room—he was a good-looking man fresh-coloured, and had rather a round face—he was stooping when I saw him—he looked out four sets of fire irons, some fenders and stoves tope sent next morning—after he was gone I inquired who he was, and had the name and address given me—I think it was, "No. 21, Holywell-street"—I went the next morning with the fire-irons, and to measure for the stoves, with my porter—Crispin opened the door—I requested to see Mr. Adams—he</p>

               <p>said he was not at home but would be in shortly—after I had spoken to Crispin, Smith came in—I said to Crispin, "I have come to measure for some stoves in this house, by direction of Mr. Adams"—I went into the parlour to measure for the stoves there—there were two persons in that room, but neither of the prisoners—Crispin said, the stove in that room was to be a register stove—I said, "What is Mr. Adams going to open this shop as?"—Crispin said, "As a shoe warehouse"—I said, "He has been in business before, I presume"—Crispin said, "Yes, in the country"—I said, "What part?"—to which I got no answer—I then said to my man," These fire-irons are too good for this place, take them back again"—Crispin said the fenders were expected to be brought that morning—I said, "Surely you can't want fenders before the stoves"—I then said, "Give my compliments to Mr. Adams, and tell him I can't think of sending these things without he gives me two respectable securities or a deposit"—I went home and sent no stoves.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Hosier-lane. On the Saturday previous to Adams and Nott opening the shop in Holy well-street, I was at the Queen's Head, Red Lion-square—(Crispin had opened it before, and I had been there when it was in his possession)—I had been at Mr. Maton's, the Sugar Loaf, in Bell yard, Fleet-street, and we adjourned to the Queen's Head—I had been introduced by Mr. Nott to Henry Adams, in Bell-yard, Fleet-street, four or five weeks previous to the opening of the concern—Mr. Adams, I should say, is thirty-two or thirty-three years of age, a little taller than I am, with sandy whiskers, and, as near as I recollect, brown hair—he told me he was employed by Mr. Smith, down at Bristol, for eight years, as a ship-joiner, and Mr. Nott stated he was a respectable man, and worked for his brother eight years—we had several meetings afterwards, but on the Saturday previous to the opening of the shop there was an appointed meeting, to determine as to what the shop should be opened as—it was to be opened on the Monday or Tuesday following, provided we could get the cards printed, and the name up—Adams asked me what I could suggest best for them to call themselves—I suggested to call themselves general salesmen—it was agreed to call themselves" Colonial Agents and General Shippers"—this was settled when we got to the Queen's Head—Mr. Nott said, "You had better put,' <hi rend="italic">Nott Bene,</hi> Manufacturers of the best French Hats'"—I said that seemed an analogous sort of concern, they had better not put that—he said, "Yes, because I am a hat-manufacturer"—I wrote this on the cards for them, by their direction, but I do not think the cards were printed—Crispin was not there at that time, but I knew him before, and had seen him with Adams at the Sugar Loaf two or three times, and had seen him casually, about fourteen months ago, with Mr. Pack, a leather cutter, in Brick-lane, Old-street—on the Friday after the meeting at Red Lion-square, I saw Nott and Adams at the Sugar Loaf, in Bell-yard, Fleet street</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184209190146"/>
               <p>—Adams said to me, "We got some blacking in to-day, do you know anywhere where we can sell it?"—I said I knew a party in King. street, Minories, and another in Bishopsgate-street, who would be likely to give a fair price for it—he said, "What do you call a fair price?"—I said blacking was now a drug in the market—I did not sell it, but I saw Martin the next day, who came out of a public-house, where he had been in company with Adams and Nott—Martin told me the blacking was sold—on the Saturday night after the blacking was received, I was drinking with Adams at the Sugar Loaf, and Smith came in—she said, <hi rend="italic">"Harry</hi> Adams, I want to speak to you"—Adams said, "There is something up, come out"—we went to the bottom of the court, and there Smith aid there was a b row—there were two policemen and the carman then, and they were going to break in the bulk—she said, "I started the carman off, because I told him the blacking was all there, and Mr. Adams was a highly respectable man"—she said, "I am not going to take all the blame on my shoulders for a lousy 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that was all we had"—I said Adams was afraid he would be taken—she said, "<hi rend="italic">Harry</hi> Adams need not be afraid of me, I will never <hi rend="italic">split</hi> upon him"—Adams told me to go down and see hot it was, and tell them it would be paid on Monday—I asked Adams who ordered the blacking—he said, "Nott did, and when the blacking came I told the carman Adams was just stepped out for ten minutes"—I went to Holy well-street with Smith—I found the shop was shut up—Smith said, "I have told the carman the goods are still on the premises, Mr. Adams is a highly respectable man, and he can get his money on Monday"—I went back to Adams, and said, "There is a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> at your place, you can do at you like about going down"—he said, "I shall not go, d the blacking, I wish I had had nothing to do with it; it only fetched a lousy 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; Nott went to order it, without saying any thing to me; in fact, I was taken quite at a <hi rend="italic">non-plus"</hi>—he said it was sold, and had fetched 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and it was divided between him, Nott, and Mr. Crispin—Crispin told me the reason he abandoned Adams was, that Adams said he had taken it, and could do as he liked; and said, "I am going to put up my name on Monday, and make it look <hi rend="italic">bona fide;"</hi> and he said, "What is to come in is to be divided between Nott, Adams, and me"—Crispin stated he had got all he could get, he could get no more, and now there was a <hi rend="italic">stink</hi> about the sashes and stoves that had been measured for; he could go on no further on his own account, and Adams must do what he could.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of John, Charles, and Richard Wade, drapers, at Deptford. On the 2nd of September, between five and six o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop and asked me to show him some silk handkerchiefs—I did so, and soon after I missed one pattern which I had shewn him—I called a young man and asked him if he had taken one—he said he had not—I said it was very strange where it could be—the pri<lb/>soner said I must have put it in the drawer—to convince him I pulled out the drawer again, and then I saw him draw one handkerchief out—I pulled the drawer back, and then I observed him draw these two hand<lb/>kerchiefs out of his trowsers—I am certain of that.</p>

I have known the prisoner in that office about eighteen months, and have seen him write almost daily—I believe all these orders to be his hand-writing, and also the letter of advice—we have a book in the office in which the clerks enter their attendance—they sign the tine they come, and the hour at which they leave—on the 24th of August, the prisoner applied to me for leave of absence, which was granted-be left at two o'clock—I have the book here with the entry made by him as to the time he left—it was originally entered "four," and subsequently altered to "two," by himself—he entered the "four," on the 24th—I saw it on the 25th, and on the same day I saw it altered to "two"—it is my practice to examine the book in the morning, and finding he had put four, and left at two, I called on him to explain it—he seemed reluc<lb/>tant to explain, but mumbled something that he did not know it was of any consequence, or something—I said it was my duty to report it, which I did, and he was made to alter it—I then affixed my initials to show that he had my leave to go at that time.</p>

               <p>—these orders, and the letter of advice are in the handwriting of the prisoner, to my belief—I should say, from the post-mark, that this letter was posted at the head office in London—it purports to be from Sittingbourae to Cam<lb/>berwell—it has the stamp of the 24th of August, eight o'clock at night—we keep blank forms of letters of advice, and money orders in the office—they are delivered out in quires for the use of the office, and forwarded to the post-masters in the country when applied for—the prisoner had access to them, and also to the books, so as to know what money orders come from the particular offices in the county—this letter purporting to come from siittingbourne, appears to have been put in the twopenny post at the Ge<lb/>neral-office, on the 24th of August, but I am not conversant with the twopenny post-marks.</p>

I was thirty years physician to St. Luke's hospital, and am now consulting physician—I have had my share of practice in cases of insanity—I was first called to see the prisoner on Friday the 16th of September, in prison—I had a consultation with Dr. Philip and Mr. M'Murdo, and they were present at the examination—I was introduced to him by Mr. M'Murdo as a person wishing to submit a few questions to him—I asked him about his health, which he said was very good—I re<lb/>gretted the position he was in—he said he had been guilty of no crime, that he had acted for the good of the state, that he only required to see Lord Lowther, that everything would be made satisfactory, and that he ex<lb/>pected promotion in consequence of this act—I asked him at to his edu<lb/>cation, and whether he had been trained to the military profession—he said he had, and he held a commission in the army, that he was a colonel in the 16th Lancers—I asked him if he had ever worn the uniform of a Colo<lb/>nel—he said he had frequently—I produced a dress which I had taken with me, and which he recognized as having frequently worn—he told me it had been given to him by Colonel Belie, that the epaulets had been bought in Paris, that he had a right to wear them, for he was a colonel in the 16th Lancers—I took the dress with me to ascertain whether be recog<lb/>nized it—I had got his hand-writing from the family and submitted it to him, asking if it was his hand-writing—he said it was—I said, "Surely, you cannot mean what you have written here, you have written Colonel James Brown"—he said, it was his, and he had a right to the signature, he was Colonel James Brown—I asked if he objected to give me his designa<lb/>tion in writing, and he wrote in a good, bold, firm hand, "Colonel James Brown, 16th Lancers, 16th September"—and under the letter "S" he wrote "24" in small figures—I asked what that meant, he very adroitly replied, "Oh, I mean to dine out that day, I am engaged to dine with Mrs. Ducrow"—I asked him if he knew the little boy, young Ducrow—he said he did, that he was very fond of him, and had given him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to buy a pony—I asked if he recollected being angry with the little boy for not answering a question, and whether in consequence he did not threaten to throw a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note behind the fire—he said he re<lb/>collected the circumstance, but he did not throw the 5<hi rend="italic">l,</hi> note behind the fire, but he lit his cigar with it—I asked him if any other person had done that in his presence whether he would not conceive it was an act of mad<lb/>ness?—he said, "No, I should not, there is nothing in that"—I said, "It is stated that you thrust your hand into boiling lead, is it so? what made you do it?"—he said, "I only did it to try if it would hurt"—he afterwards said it was so like quicksilver that he was tempted to try the experiment—he admitted that he was hurt by it, and was attended by Dr. Brady—I wished to know whether he had any intention of altering his situation in life, I heard he was going to be mar<lb/>ried,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184209190172"/>
               <p>and begged to know to whom—he mentioned to a countess with money—I asked if he had not invited lady Branscomb to the wedding, and mentioned to her ladyship that the Countess's fortune was 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he said, "It might be so"—I said, "You told me you expected pro<lb/>motion at the Post-office; what promotion is it?"—he said, "I shall not return to the Post-office, I shall join my regiment in India"—I said "You were once disappointed in not receiving promotion at the Post-office, had it any effect on your spirits?"—he admitted that it had—I said "Was it to the extent that made you attempt to commit suicide?"—he admitted that he had taken laudanum with that intent—I asked him about the blow he had received from the brickbat, which he explained was done by accident by his brother, since which his eyesight had been affected, one eye particularly, and that he had had fits; that Dr. Philip had attended him in a fit about two years ago; during this examination I was intro<lb/>duced by Mr. M'Murdo to Mr. Britten, the Under Sheriff, who had come in, and my name was mentioned—until then the prisoner did not know my name—we felt his pulse and examined him, and recommended that he should take aperient medicine—we then made another appointment—at my second examination I recapitulated all the questions, asked him whe<lb/>ther he was in sober seriousness in answering them all as he had before; and having heard that he was a perfectly moral person, not at all addicted to falsehood, whether, if those questions were submitted to him to take his oath to them, he would swear they were correct—he said he was perfectly ready to do so—my feeling is that he is labouring under a misconception amounting to unsound mind—I have no question about it, that he is of un<lb/>sound mind—Dr. Philip was present the whole of the first examination, and part of the second—I believe he came to the same conclusion—Mr. M'Murdo, Dr. Philip, and myself, all came to the same conclusion—convulsive fits are occasionally incidental to this state of mind, where it is induced through external injury—I have heard of the injury he sustained when nine years old—I should expect that fits would be the consequence of the state of mind induced by such a blow—it is frequently so, not always—I think he seemed to speak to me perfectly seriously.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You had been apprised on all the points on which he had committed any absurdity before this by the family, and you directed his attention to those circumstances one after the other? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not examine his hands—I examined his head—there is a mark over the right eye—there is an indication of a serious injury hav<lb/>ing been received some time before—it did not appear externally of that character to produce epilepsy, or the description of fits which he afterwards had—the injury must be internal—I should say the external injury did not fully correspond to the history of the case; there was not sufficient, but on examining the eye, and perceiving partial amaurosis, it ap<lb/>peared to correspond with the injury—I understood him to be subject to fits after the injury—the only description I had of him from Dr. Philip was that he exhibited a maniacal character at the time of the fits—I was aware that he was under a charge of felony at the time of my examination—I did not suspect anything like guile in him, nor anything at all insincere in his replies—he was excessively candid in his statement, which corresponded with everything I had heard—I could not doubt he was sin<lb/>cere in his answers—his designating himself a colonel in my presence I thought a continuance of the delusion.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you any means of judging whether the statement of a person is asimilated or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is merely from coupling his description of the state of things with what was communicated to me—he confessed to not being able to sleep at night, and going to bed in the day-time—that was one thing which struck me as a proof of his condition of mind—if I had not seen him at all, and heard nothing but what the witnesses have stated to-day, assuming it to be true, I should conceive it was a case made out of unsound mind—I think there is certainly an imbecility of mind; the mind being highly susceptible of erroneous impressions, the delusion will establish itself, and the mind cannot get rid of it; I mean his adhering to being a colonel in the 16th Lancers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Under what delusion do you suppose he laboured at the time he committed these frauds on the Post-office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> His having signed himself antecedent to that as Colonel James Brown, is a proof of that opinion; and the reason he gives, that it was to assist the State and get promotion—his not being able to stand the disappointment on a previous occasion, and having taken laudanum, is another, proof his mind was not capable of con<lb/>taining itself after the disappointment—I think he laboured under a delu<lb/>sion at the time he committed this offence, which tempted him to do it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How often has he been under your examination? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say three or four times—I first examined him within the last month, after he was committed to prison—but I conceive when I was first called to him, rather more than two years ago, he was then in a great measure in his present condition—I can give but an indistinct ac<lb/>count of what passed then, because I was much engaged in the practice of medicine, and never made any memorandum of what passed—but I know that I declared his to be a case of insanity at that time, and the name I gave it was monomania—I cannot speak positively as to the point on which the monomania showed itself, as it is so long since—but I have no doubt the impression on my mind at that time was, that, on a particular subject, his mind was diseased, I do not recollect what the subject was—if I had not used the term monomania, I should not have known that I considered his case a madness of that particular description—I conceived, from the conversation I had with him at that time, that his derangement was on one particular subject, but then, in that conversation, we might have happened to turn to that particular subject—he was not in a fit when I was first called in—I do not recollect saying, if the surgeon had bled him he would have killed him, but I am told I said so—I think I saw him several times, but I cannot remember.</p>

I am a carter in the employ of Mr. Poulter—I went to the prosecutors', which is called Carpenter Smith's Wharf, to fetch some goods on the 8th of September—after I had got my load Byrns asked if I would take a bag up the lane (Atkinson was close by at the time)—the bag was lying there and I agreed to carry it—both the prisoners to<lb/>gether put it on the cart, and I went with it—Atkinson came after me, and when I got to the end of the lane, he took the bag on his back off the top of the barrels, and went away with it—it was just such a bag as the one now produced.</p>

On the 29th of August, in consequence of information, I was on the look-out as to what Wilmot might be doing—the dinner hour was one o'clock—the men went to dinner—I did not go that day—I and Wilmot were on the same floor where the barley-stones are—we were grinding, and the furnace was lighted that day, as there was to be brewing going on that day under Wilmot's direction—he did not go to dinner that day—it was his duty to attend to his furnace—he is'the brewhouse foreman—there is a seat and a table for him between the two furnaces—it is the usual place for the brewhouse foreman when tne furnaces are lighted, to take his dinner at—I take my dinner near the same spot, and have in full view the barley stores on which I am working—on that occasion Wilmot took his dinner at the top against the stain, at a considerable distance from the furnace where be ought to be; and from the part where be sat to take his dinner, he could command a view of when I was, and could see through an opening down below stairs—he could see any person who might enter the premises on the ground-floor—just before dinner I had occasion to leave the room in which land Wilmot were, and go down stairs to wash my hands—when you get down it brings you to the pavement yard, on the ground-floor—there were some empty hogsheads and casks standing on the pavement—just by there is the fermentiog-tun<lb/>stage—when I went down I noticed these casks—there was no sack on any of them, or on the pavement floor, nor on the tun-stage—I washed my hands and returned—there was no sack there then—I found Wilmot up stairs then—my dinner was brought me, and he called to me to go and have it—some time afterwards his dinner was brought—I began eating—Wilmot sat down for a moment, and then he left me and went down—thit would lead him to the tun-stage—he could step on the-tun-stage—it is about five feet from the paved yard—there is a canvas funnel descends from the bins—by putting an empty sack, and untying this canvas funnel, a sack is filled instantaneously—Wilmot returned to the room up stain in a few minutes—during his absence he had sufficient time to draw two sacks of malt from the canvas funnel—I went down stairs again after he had returned up, and there was one sack standing on a hogshead, and an<lb/>other on the tun-stage—they were quite full—I am quite certain that neither of these sacks were there when I went down before—the one on the hogshead was tied up—I found there was malt in the two sacks—in the floor immediately over the pavement there is a well for the purpose of putting up the sacks—I took my station in the room above, after I returned; and while I was leaning over the rope-rail there, Stemp came with a horse and cart in front of the door—there were four full sacks in his cart—Stemp came to the door of the brewing-house, and turned the tail of his cart round to the door—there is an outer gate, about sixty yards from the brewhouse—the well which I was at was just over where these</p>

               <p>sacks were, which I had seen in the brewhouse—the door is about forty feet from where the sacks are—a man on the ground could have seen the cart and the casks—Stemp could have seen the sack which was on the cask—he got off his cart, and walked into the brewhouse, and unloaded the sacks from the cart—I asked him if he had got some barley—he said, "Yes, I have got a quarter of barley, a quarter of oats, and a quarter of malt"—that would have made six sacks, and I am confident he only brought four—he placed the four sacks on the pavement floor, about six feet from the sack upon the hogshead—I said he had got no malt there——he said, "No, there stands one there," pointing to the sack of malt that itood on the hogshead—I said, "Yes, I know there is"—he made no answer, but talked about his barley meal, and asked if it was ready—(he had before that brought us some barley meal to grind)—I said, yes, I bad got it ready for him—he then passed out of my sight, went up into the brewhouse, in sight of all the sacks—I heard voices while he was out of my sight—they were Stemp and Wilmot's voices, as if speaking together—I then saw Stemp up stairs—I went with him to the room where we were grinding the barley—I then went back, to convince myself that then were but four sacks which he had brought, and they were exactly as he left them—I then got his meal ready for him—I went with him up to the meal-trough, in the room where my barley stores are—they are in the same room as the furance is, and about twenty yards off—Stemp went with me to the end of the room to get the meal, which I weighed, and gave to Stemp—Wilmot was not there—I heaved the meal on my shoulder, and came down with it, accompanied by Stemp, for the purpose of patting it into Stemp's cart—I came down stairs to where I had left the sacks, and there was then a sack of malt pitched down, just by the four sacks which Stemp brought—there were five sacks there then, and the one was removed from the hogshead—Stemp said he wanted to have his barley, oats, and malt ground—I said it would be ground on the following morning, and said be had not brought any malt—he said he had left it in the morning, as he was going by after coals—he gave me a sixpence, and went off—I found the second sack standing in the same place—after Stemp was gone I told my master.</p>

                  </hi>. I am brewer at Mr. Beaufoy's. I had the sole charge of the malt—Wilmot was foreman, under me—it was not his duty to draw off any malt from the canvas funnels without a written order from me—the bin, No. 1, contained about 100 quarters at this time—after I had heard about Wilmot and Stemp, I looked at the top of the bin up stairs, it presented the appearance of a conical shaped hole—I should think there had been rather more than two sacks of malt gone, four bushels to the sack—I saw the sack on the tun-stage—I looked, and found it contained malt—I afterwards saw a fifth sack of malt, with four others, containing oats and barley—I saw samples taken from these sacks, and compared with the malt in the bin—Mr. Darby and Mr. Beaufoy ex<lb/>amined it in the middle of Tuesday—I heard Mr. Beaufoy tax Wilmot with drawing down the malt without an order—Wilmot said he had drawn it down (referring to the sack on the tun-stage) in consequence of something that I had said in reference to cats dirtying it—the policeman was then sent for—I afterwards looked into a closet used by Wilmot—it contained two sacks, which did not belong to Mr. Beaufoy—I had some conversa<lb/>tion about cats with Wilmot—it had no reference to the bin No. 1—it was another bin at the further end of the premises, thirty or forty feet off; there are other bins between them—there had been dirt on the surface of that bin, but that had no reference to No. 1—if there had been dirt on the top of No. 1, it would not have been a likely manner to get rid of it to draw it by the canvas shoot—there is a hopper to bin No. 1—there was some loose malt spilt round the top of this hopper—I said if Mr. Beaufoy came round, he would be displeased at it—it was only a few shovels full spilt—Wilmot could not have got two sacks from what was spilt—I found</p>

               <p>no deficiency there, with the exception of what we cleared up—I bad not given Wilmot any order to draw one or two sacks of malt from No. 1—my attention was drawn to the four sacks that Stemp brought between nine and ten on Tuesday morning—I afterwards saw them sealed by Mr. Beau<lb/>foy, and they are here now.</p>

I told him that the malt had been shot into the bin until it would go no further; Mr. Cooper told me I had better take it up, and said if Mr. Beaufoy came up he would not like to see it lay there, because he objected to the cats dirty<lb/>ing in it; that was all that passed then between Mr. Cooper and me. In the course of the day Mr. Skeet found fault of the cats dirtying in the malt, and said that unless it was took up it would stop his roller; that is all that pasted between him and me; and accordingly I went down stairs and took a tack from about fifty, some with one mark and some with another—after I had drawed it down I placed it against the wall at the back of the tun; there is a mark on the sack "M" in red, and I think it is marked "24" in red, that is all I have to say; the sack I refer to is the one that stood on the stage floor; the malt I drew was from bin No. 1."</p>
