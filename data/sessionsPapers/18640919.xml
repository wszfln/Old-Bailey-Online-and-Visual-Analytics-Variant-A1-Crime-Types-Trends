                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Pinkerton—the prisoner was at one time in my service, managing my business—my husband received some imprisonment during that time—the prisoner has from time to time asked me for money, and frequently annoyed me—I did not give it him—he was paid for his services while managing my business—he has made use of threats on many occasions—on 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi> August, I had been collecting rents as usual, and as I was coming down Cow-cross-street I saw the prisoner—he spoke to me—I asked how he was getting on—he said he was doing very badly; he had no work, and he asked me for money—I said No, I should give him none; I had to work hard, and he must do the same—he said, "I will knock the front of your b——skull in"—I was trying to escape from him, but before I could do so, he came on my left hand side and struck me with a brick on the bead—he struck me several times before any assistance came—I became insensible—I was taken to the hospital, and continued a week an out patient.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How many years have you known me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About four<lb/>teen or fifteen years—my husband was tried here about eight years ago—I afterwards put you in a shop to manage it—I bought everything—I did not pay the rent; you did—it was next door to mine—I had nothing to do with it after you got possession of it; you took good care of that, to do me out of the money I had laid out on it—after my husband came out of prison he accused me of being too intimate with you, from your assertion; the people in the neighbourhood did not tell him so—you wrote a letter to me attempting to extort money—I did not think it worth while to vindicate myself from the charges you brought against me—I had business dealings with Mr. Coward, of Guildhall-chambers, and you sent him an anonymous letter containing the same charges—I took no proceedings to vindicate my<lb/>self—I can't remember what the charges were; it might have been the crime of abortion—I never wrote any letters to you, or appointed to meet you—you have occasionally met me, and have many times tried to extort</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEWIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any truth in the insinuation that you procured abortion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not; or in the assertion that I ever had criminal intercourse with the prisoner—I never heard anything of it till he was out of the business—he has ceased to manage that business for seven years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital—the prosecutrix was brought there on the evening of 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi> August—she had a small scalp wound just above the forehead; just below it was a severe bruise, with considerable extravasation of blood underneath the skin, like-wise a black eye—she remained an out-patient till Saturday, 27th, when I found her much worse—she had symptoms of inflammation of the mem<lb/>branes of the brain coming on—she remained an in-patient for a week; she then got much better, and was discharged, and again became an out-patient—she is much better, but still remains in a very weak state—the inflam<lb/>mation was caused by the wounds—they were such wounds as might have been inflicted with a brick-bat, or some blunt instrument—the wounds them-selves were not severe—if remedies had not been promptly applied the inflammation might have been fatal—the wounds were slight, and nearly healed when the inflammation set in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you apprehend any danger at first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; not till five days after—the inflammation would not be caused by excitement.</p>

I took the prisoner—I told him the nature of the charge—he said he would do it again; he would do for her; he did not care if he got six years for it; he should have satisfaction—I saw the prosecutrix before she was taken to the hospital—she was bleeding very much from the head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Who gave me into your custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two young women had got hold of you by the collar—I received the brick from a witness named Rickman, who is absent—the prosecutrix appeared stupified—she came to the station and charged you—she did not hesitate about it—I don't remember her saying she would be too clever for you in the end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence, stated that the prosecutrix was desirous of getting him out of the way; that he only struck her with a small piece of brick, not the large piece produced.</hi>

I am the wife of William Nealan, a labouring man—on 30th August, about 6 in the evening, I was walking along Swan-place, Mile-end, with my baby; I was speaking to a neighbour of mine, a Mrs. Tap<lb/>pendon, who made some remark about my little boy's boots, and the prisoner came up and said if I was talking to her instead of Mrs. Tappendon, she would job a knife in my eye—she then struck me twice with something—I did not know it was a knife till I had the second blow—she struck me twice over the eye—when I received the second blow I put my baby down, and said, "It is a knife"—I did not see anything in her hand at the time; the blood came into my eyes, and mouth, and nose—I saw no one at that time—I do not remember any more after that—I became insensible—I forgive her for what she has done—I have got well—I have never been in prison, and I don't want any one to be in prison through me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-officer attached to the Post-office—in consequence of instructions, I watched the sorting of letters by the prisoner and Panton on the morning of 6th August—they began about ten minutes before 9—the sorting-table is a long table with separate places for each sorter—after they had been sorting about five minutes, Panton left the table, leaving the prisoner there—the prisoner's back was then to the table—as soon as Panton was gone, he turned round, and took two or three letters from Panton's table, and took them to his own seat—I saw him go out of the office on his delivery about 10 o'clock—in consequence of instructions that afternoon, I went to the prisoner's house, 61, Cumberland-street, Hackney-road, soon after 5 o'clock—I searched the back-room, a bed-room—the prisoner's wife was present—I got up on a chair, and looked on the top of a cupboard, where there were two hat-boxes and a bonnet-box, and underneath the hat-box I found this letter concealed—it was in the same state it is now, open at the end—I took it back to Mr. Gardner, and heard the conversation he has related.</p>

                  </hi>. I was assistant-inspector of letter-carriers on 6th August last—when the French mail comes in, about half-past 6 in the morning, it would be opened about 7; there would be two sortings—this particular letter would be left till 9 o'clock to be sorted, to go out at 10 for delivery—the letters would be left from half-past 8 on a table opposite my desk in the letter-carriers' office, under my own supervision—the letters are placed on two or three seats for the letter-carriers—there were only two that morning, Panton and the prisoner; they commenced sorting about ten minutes past 9—the prisoner had no right to remove any letters from Panton's table—the table where the prisoner was sorting is not the table the constable alludes to when, he speaks of seeing him remove the letters to his seat; that is where be arranges his own letters for delivery—no letter-carrier sorts his own letters—the City is divided into four sections; A, B, C, and D—these letters were on the table in the A section—there had been a previous sorting in the Inland-office, commencing soon after 7—most of the Paris letters were sent out for delivery at 8·30—these letters were placed in the A section to be sorted into walks, and they are collected by a man who takes them to the seats in the A section, where the letter-carriers arrange their letters—the prisoner and Panton were sorting letters for the A section, but they deliver in B section, in a different part of the City alto<lb/>gether—a letter for Ely-place would, in the ordinary course, be among the letters which Panton and the prisoner were sorting—the prisoner would have no right to take from Panton two or three letters, and take them to his own seat; it would be entirely contrary to the regulations—Wilson-street, Finsbury, is in the prisoner's district, Ely-place is not—if he received a letter for Ely-place from any one who had picked it up, it would be his duty to bring it back to the Post-office; it would not be contrary to the regulations to take it borne if he was going home, especially, if, as he said, the letter was open, but it would be his duty to give it up the first time he came to the office.</p>

I said, "Come back and see"—I went back, spoke to Miss Paull, and asked her whether she knew the men—she identified Howard or Page as passing this bad shilling (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which she handed to me—I took them to the station, and found on Howard ten sixpences, seven groats, six threepenny pieces, and fourpence, a small bottle, and some pins, two of which have obscene pictures in them—they had been drinking, but Page was more sober than Howard—the barmaid gave me another bad shilling.</p>

               <p>me, as she had done several nights before—I did not see the prisoner again till 12 o'clock that night, when I entered the room, the second floor front—I heard his voice on the stairs about 12—he came up to my door, the back room, second floor, and asked if his wile was there—I said she was not—he then pushed the front room door open and went in, and in a very few moments I went in, almost as soon as the prisoner—when I went in the deceased was on the left-hand side of the bed, kneeling on her knees, and her chemise all torn—Mrs. Turn bull was in the room—I went round to where the prisoner and deceased were, and he struck her three blows about the head—he appeared to be very angry; he was swearing very much, using very bad language; he was in the height of passion—I took a clean chemise out of my aunt's drawer in the room, and put it on the deceased—during that time the prisoner sat on a box close to the deceased, and when he gave her a blow she said, "For God's sake, don't kill me"—that was while I was putting the chemise on her he gave her the three blows I have spoken of—they were such blows as a man would give when he was in a passion, just as if he was very cross and angry, and did not mind how hard he hit; they were with his clenched fist—he then got up off the box and kicked her; I only saw one kick with his right foot, in the side, just between the stomach and lungs—I saw the mark afterwards—she never rose up from her knees during the whole time—I said to her, "Are you much hurt?" and she said, "I am very bad"—I said, "Has he hurt you very much?"—she said, "Oh, he has given me my death-blow"—those were the last words the spoke—she leaned down on her side, and I went to her and supported her bead, as well as I could, and she vomited a little blood—the prisoner changed in a moment as soon as he saw the blood, and he helped me to raise her up, he got some water, and bore her up while we bathed her temples—he went for the doctor, and fetched some brandy, which the doctor ordered.</p>

Instructions have been given not to pay you any this week"—we did not pay him any that week—we struck off the second week's salary—I see here on 7th May, 1863 there ate two sums of 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. charged him for carriage—on 25th May we deducted 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for charges on goods—he had due notice I that he would be charged with them—on 11th July there is a charge on Webster's oil 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that is all—those were for the carriage of goods not taken by the customers—there were no deductions for money owing previously—there is no entry of a payment of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week to Mr. Denton—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are Mr. Denton's receipts, which I know nothing about—I did not send the salary down myself—the prisoner was provided with 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when he started—he was three weeks or a month out on a journey—we kept remitting money every week from time to time—my cashier is not here—I don't know whether he could tell you what money was remitted—the prisoner was charged with the deductions—his salary was forwarded every week; so it appears here—he was charged in the account with the deductions, and the result of the account is to his debit—no settlement was I made with him in September, when we called him to come up—we did not I see him; we have not settled the matter at all, it remains just as it did—we I have not struck a balance—I think the balance is 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd against him—that is charging all these deductions and all the deficiencies and these items we are now trying as well—the deductions are charged against him immediately—there was nothing due to him for salary when we struck this balance—he had already got money in his hands—he absconded with the money; we gave him notice to quit, as he had broken the engagements he had entered into—the previous deficien<lb/>cies wore settled up by the brother's bills—they were not paid when they be<lb/>came</p>

I am physician and medical officer of the Mary lebone Workhouse—on the morning of 6th August, my attention was called, to Eliza Mitton by Mr. Fuller—she was then in the lunatic ward of the workhouse—I was with her some time—in my judgment, she was a person of unsound mind; I have no doubt of it—about 1 o'clock that day, the defendant came to the workhouse—he came to my room and said, "You have got one of my patients here"—at first I did not know who he meant, and I asked him for an explanation—he said he came for a Miss Mitton, who had escaped from his house—he said his name was Mr. Henry Wilkins, of Ealing, a medical man—Mr. Wilks, the Commissioner of Lunacy, was in my room at the time, and he asked him in my presence if she was a certified lunatic—he said, "No"—Mr. Wilks asked him whether his house was licensed—he said, "No"—directions were afterwards given for Miss Mitton to be given up to him.</p>

M.; Insanity. Eliza Mitton, about thirty years old. Found in Edgware-road, and brought by police-constable 509 S, Portland-town station. Sent to Dorcas ward"—he said, "Yes, that is the young woman"—I then asked him to sign for her across the entry, and be wrote in the book, "Received this patient from the Master of the Workhouse. H.

                  </hi>. I live at Stamford, Lincolnshire—I have a daughter of the name of Eliza Mitton—I placed her under the defendant's care about two years ago—I agreed to pay him 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, to take care of her—I have made him two payments of 135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was for taking care of my daughter—she remained with him until 8th September—on that day, she was received into a licensed house at Acton, called "The Friars," kept by Mr. Nesbitt—I signed the order for her admission there.</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. I made a post-mortem examination of the de<lb/>ceased, at the Coroner's request, on the afternoon of 13th August—I was told she was fifty-three years of age, and I should say she was about that—she was a fat, bulky woman, in good condition—the body was still some<lb/>what rigid—there was an old scar on the right side of the forehead, and another on the right shin—those were the results of violence some yean ago—around the left eye was a very severe bruise, from which a cut extended down to the cheek-bone, about an inch in length—that bruise was becoming green and yellow, and the cut was in process of healing—I judge it to nave been from one to two weeks old—upon the abdomen, midway between the navel and the pubes, was a very severe black bruise—on the front of the left thigh were four more severe, transverse, black bruises—their size, colour, and appearance indicated that they were done at the same time and by the same instrument or means which bad caused the bruise on the abdomen—I believe they were caused by the toe of a large, heavy boot—they were such wounds as only very severe violence could have caused—I judged them to have been about three days old—there was a small bruise on the knee, and another small bruise on the buttock—on opening the head I found a clot of blood weighing about 3 ozs., dark in colour, and firm in texture, lying between the brain and the membranes on the right side, in the cavity of the arachnoid—it spread all over the right side—that clot of blood had sprung from a rupture of the meringiael artery, where it passes through a groove in the skull—that had been the cause of death—the brain and its vessels were perfectly healthy—I examined the chest and stomach—the rest of the organs were healthy—the bruise in the abdomen bad net caused any visceral mischief—from the character of the fat about the body, and the condition of her liver, I should</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186409190063"/>
               <p>have suspected that she was in the habit of drinking too much; but not that she was a drunkard—such persons have a peculiar oily kind of fat—I think the rupture must have been caused by violence, because that artery is never known to burst from natural causes, unless from aneurism or some manifest disease—the vessels in the brain itself are very liable to rupture in common apoplexy—this was not apoplexy—the clot of blood may have existed there three weeks—I have known similar cases, in which the violence was clearly traced to a week or ten days before, without any symptom beyond headache being caused.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You attribute the death to the effusion of blood on the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that may have been caused by a fall on the floor—with a person in the habit of drinking freely, there would be a brittleness of the brain-vessels, which would render them more liable to burst—drinking rots all the textures—this was not a vessel in the brain itself—it supplies the skull and membranes of the brain.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business as agent and valuer at 4, Great Carter-lane—I bad the front office vacant—in April, a man named Montagna, appa<lb/>rently a foreigner, applied to me, and ultimately took it—it was arranged that the first month's rent, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>, should be paid in advance—he took pos<lb/>session, and there was a Frenchman with him—about a fortnight afterwards I saw the prisoner Davis there, and he continued there from that time till Ibis charge was made—I did not see Cooper till six weeks ago—Montagna continued till the middle of July—the other foreigner left shortly after Davis came—the name of Montagna and Co. was painted upon the door—the second month's rent was ultimately paid—Davis was there before the third month became due—there appeared to be a difficulty in paying it, and it was arranged with Davis that it should be included in an account for which he gave me an acceptance—I got no money on account of that bill—I subsequently distrained twice; the last time was in August, when we seized a basket of new pewter-pots as they were delivered—the prisoners were both there then, and Davis informed us that it was by pledging goods that he obtained the money to pay out the first distraint—he said that it was by pawning a quantity of brooches and other things which we had sold him—he said that he expected Dawson and Co. would execute the order for him, as they were a pliable firm, and he should then be able to give me security for my debt—I saw no bona fide business carried on there—goods came in and went away again the same day, often in the evening—I never observed or heard of their making any sale of goods, and I have had frequent communications with them—the offices were opposite each other, on the side of the passage—if people came on business I should have seen them—I have seen people who had supplied goods come to make inquiries, and I have over<lb/>heard squabbles and difficulties about not getting payment for accounts—that was a very frequent occurrence lately—I seized some of the account-books for rent, and handed them to the officer Hann—Cooper was introduced by Davis, as a gentleman who was going to join Mr. Montagna as a partner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am traveller to Carlton Brothers, straw hat manufacturers, of 10, Gutter-lane—on 25th July, Cooper came and pre<lb/>sented this card, "G. Montagna and Co. importers of foreign fancy merchant<lb/>dize, 4, Great Carter-lane, St. Paul's"—he said that he came from that firm, and wanted to see samples of a certain description of straw hats—I said that we had a pattern of the goods in stock, bat not all—he said that the firm bad a shipping order for those goods—I said that I would select a few samples, and send them down to his place or go down myself in an hour—it I was then pretty near 3 o'clock—he said, "Unless the goods are sent down before 3 it will be little use, as our buyer, Mr. Davis, leaves then"—I made up twelve hats and twelve bonnets, and sent them by a porter—they were worth about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I followed him, and saw both Davis and Cooper—Davis was looking at the patterns when I went in, and I said, "I have come down about those patterns"—he said, "Yes, the gentleman who is our client has left; you are a little too late; we shall see him to morrow morning, and then will send up the order with the patterns," but we did not receive either—I went to the office, and saw Davis—he said he was very sorry to trouble me, but his client bad gone to the Crystal Palace with Mr. Montagna, and would not be at business that day, but it would be all right; he would see his client, and very likely he would bring him, and the result would be that he would very likely buy a good parcel from us—I did net like being put off twice, and rather pressed him, but in quite a business-like way he said that since we pressed him he would try and see the gentleman that evening, and would come up with the money that evening—he did not do so—I con<lb/>tinued to go there till the 5th, and generally saw each of the prisoners—I again asked them for the samples—they promised faithfully to send them the next day, and on the 5th the order came for five different patterns of hate and bonnets, to the value of 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and also an order for further samples of goods, which were the most expensive we could produce—Cooper came with that order, and I referred him to the counting-house—next day I called at the office and saw both the defendants—I said that we had received the order for goods, which we had not in stock, but if he gave us the order we would apply to our agents and get them from abroad—Davis said he be<lb/>lieved there was no hurry, and we might take time—I told him our terms were a reference or cash; "cash" means on the receipt of the invoice—he said that he quite understood that, and their terms were cash; they paid cash for all the goods they bought, and when the goods were delivered he should be prepared to pay cash for them—I agreed to those terms—this was a shipping order—I said that it was necessary, before we could proceed with the order, to have the patterns back—Davis said that they had been sent into the country to his client—after this I went frequently for the patterns—I brought away a portion of them, seven, I think, but never got the rest—I did not execute the order, because I never got the patterns back—once when I asked Davis for the samples, he said that probably his client might keep two or three of them—nothing was said before we left them about their</p>

               <p>being sent back, because we never leave them, and Davis said that they should be returned the following morning with the order—about 18th August, I went to the office, and saw both the prisoners—I said that I was very dissatisfied with the way they made excuses, and I told Davis that one excuse was directly contrary to the other, and I was quite satisfied that it was an attempt to swindle us out of our patterns, and unless he was pre<lb/>pared to pay for the goods, or return them by a certain hour, I should very likely give him in custody—subsequently to that, an I O U was handed to me, and I went with it to the office—it was signed Chas. Davis—is it not here—I received it, in our office, from one of the partners—I showed it to Davis, and said, "This I O U is of no use, and I believe you are the principal party interested"—he received it back, crumpled it in his hand, and said, "You have no further use for this then"—I believe this to be it (<hi rend="italic">an I O U for</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">signed "Chas.

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Edmund Jacobs, importer of fancy goods—on 2d August, Cooper came with a small piece of paper in his hand, and said, "Edmund Jacobs, you keep clocks?" I said, "Yes," and offered to show him some—after he had seen them I asked him where he came from—he gave me a card, and said that a customer wanted the clocks at once—I said that if he bought any clocks he must pay cash for them, as we did not know him—he said, "Oh yes, they will be all right, I have no doubt"—he said he wanted them for a customer, who wanted them as samples—he did not say how many be wanted, but he ultimately selected six—he said that if I liked to pack up the largest one he would help me to carry it round, which he and I did, and afterwards I took the rest—there was a brooch and a scarf-pin on the counter, and he said that he should like the brooch for himself, and his customer would want a gross of them—we took the clocks to 4, Carter-lane, and there saw Davis, who said that it was too good a clock, he wanted cheaper ones, about 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I then fetched the three smaller ones and a cheaper one—I did not take the shades—Davis said they looked much better with the shades, and told me to fetch them, which I did—he said that he expected the customer every minute, and that I was to make haste—I said that I should come and fetch them away in the evening with a truck, but instead of going that evening I went next morning—I saw Davis, and gave him this note (<hi rend="italic">This was from Mr. Jacobs, requesting to have the clocks back</hi>)—Davis read it, and I brought away two of the clocks, but never got back the other three—he pressed me to let them stay for the customer, who would not want the dearer ones—I took the scarf-pin and samples of jewellery on the first occasion to the value of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Another letter was here put in, from Edmund Jacobs to Montagna and Co., dated August</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">th, stating that unless the goods were paid for or returned by</hi> 12 <hi rend="italic">o'clock next day, steps would be taken to obtain them.</hi>)</p>

               <p>an hour afterwards I went into the Old Walworth-road, and found James Walker in a shop—I told him I should charge him with receiving a pair of boots from his son, knowing them to have been stolen—he said he knew where he got the boots from; that he bought them for his little girl, but they misfitted—neither of the Walkers have kept a shop at Woolwich to my knowledge—I have been in Woolwich three years—they have never kept a shop there in that time—I received these two pairs of boots from Fox a witness, and this pair from the sister; these from Mrs. Bartlett, of 16, Chester-street; these from a person named Kitson, living near Chester-street, and this pair from Mr. Carter's, who keeps a pawn-shop in Bear-lane—they were sent by a witness in Court—the other con<lb/>stable will speak to these other three pair.</p>

I live at Rose-street, Plumstead, and am agent for the Liverpool and London Fire Insurance Company—the prose<lb/>cutor's house is insured there, in the name of Tompkins and Lewis Davis, but nothing else—I went to the house about 2 o'clock, and found that a very small fire had taken place; I suppose 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would cover the damage that was done—in one corner of the under part of the mattress there was a small bole, and it looked as if about as many shavings as I could take in one hand had been taken away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> When I was taken in custody I was completely stunned, and I did not realize my situation through the stupor of drink till the following day. When leaving the police-station, a neighbour walked alongside of me, and told me that the prosecutor's son had most grossly insulted my wife on Sunday night—I then began to think there was some trickery at work, which I soon perceived when I was taken before the Magistrate, who told me that the fire insurance company had withdrawn the prosecution, and asked if I had anything to say; I told him that I had not the slightest knowledge of anything connected with the fire—he said that the charge must go on. The prosecutor then altered the charge. If the fire was not the result of accident on my part through drunkenness or carelessness, or from the prosecutor leaving the light with a drunken man, it behoves me to see if he had any purpose; he had brokers put in on Saturday for a deal of rent which he was unable to pay; he paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. off, and arranged to pay so much a week, as he had lodgers to move in on the Monday. Through the insults and the bullying he made at my wife, she and the children left the place, and said they would not sleep another night there, and left the key with a neighbour, telling him to acquaint me when I got sober that I might take a decent place. The place not being in an eligible condition, the landlord would not let it, and there</p>

I had lived in the house I was found in in Robert-street three or four months, and got a good connexion there as a tailor, and my first impulse was to go then, but I do not recollect being there at all; I perhaps was faint or sick, and made my way out the back way towards Robert-street; I knew the street-door was open, because I hung the key up for the landlord to go in for it. I could have no motive for destroying my furniture. If shavings were taken to set fire to the house, would they not be more than half-burnt? As regards the threats he says I used, he did not think of them for fourteen days afterwards. I swear by the Almighty Father who is in heaven, that I am innocent.</p>

On 9th September I received infor<lb/>mation from Mrs. Griggs—she gave me a description, and I went down Trafalgar-road, and saw the prisoners turn down Prospect-place—they then came up another opening, called Orchard-place, which is a short street—they went towards Woolwich, and after they had gone a little way, they stopped—I asked them if they had been to the cook-shop to have some dinner—they said, "Yes"—I asked them to come back, they said, "Yes," and Williams asked what for—I said that there had been a watch missed there, and wished them to come to the station about it—they asked me to let them go and see the woman—I said "No"—I searched them at the station, and found this watch on Rail—the turning they went down was rather a roundabout way to Woolwich.</p>

I charge him with uttering a bad two-shilling piece"—at the station, I put down the paper parcel and the bag—the prisoner said, "They are mine; they are my hard earnings"—I searched him, and found on him four shillings and three sixpences, good money, and one shilling and three farthings in copper, all good—I received this florin from Mrs. Carpenter at the station—the prisoner's wife was with him at the time I apprehended him.</p>

She asked me to treat her; but I told her I had but a few halfpence; she said, never mind, she would treat me. She changed the two-shilling-piece, and told me to put the change in my pocket, which I did. She said she had been to Westminster to see her cousin, and he had given her a half-sovereign. My wife has, I am sorry to say, been in bad company for years. I have tried to put a stop to it, but could not I have been out all hours of the night, but could not get her away from bad company. About five months ago, I came up to speak for her on her trial here, and she got off with four months; and the very next day after she came out, she took a good half-crown from my pocket, and put a bad one in its place. She has told parties she would get rid of me. I found one of her bad companions in bed with her.</p>

               <p>gone by train to Camberwell-gate, and I then walked home—I had gone into the Old Kent-road, lower down than the Bricklayers' Arms Station, when I was seized from behind by two fists—whether it was one man or two, I can't say—they wrestled and tripped me up by my heels, and got me into the gutter—or in the road; and no sooner was I down, than one of them took my watch I took hold of his wrist, and said, "Not quite so fast"—I had no sooner said that than I had a tremendous blow, which knocked six of my teeth out; at least, loosened them, not knocked them out—I can't Bay what the blow was with; it was with some heavy instrument—it cut a piece out of my mouth—the doctor said, had the blow been a little higher, it would have killed me on the spot, and if a little lower, it would have broken my jaw—two of my teeth are loose now—I got up on my hands and knees, and was knocked down again—I did not see any one there, only the prisoner and two more in advance of him—I got up, and called, "Stop thief!" and followed him—as soon as ever he got on to the pavement, I kept calling out, "Stop thief"—I very nearly overtook him, not quite, but he was taken by police-constable 114—I was getting up to him fast, but I was completely covered all over with blood—the prisoner is the man I followed—I never lost sight of him after I got up on my hands and knees—I could not say who knocked me down the first time, but I believe it was him who knocked me down the second time; I am sure it was, because there was no one else there—as soon as he got on to the pavement, he started running, and I after him, calling "Stop thief," and I never lost sight of him—I lost a silver watch—I have the chain; the swivel and all was taken—I can't say where the other two men were when I was first knocked down; I received two blows all of a sudden—at the time the prisoner ran away, I saw two men in advance; one crossed the road, and the other went another way, by the Deaf and Dumb Asylum.</p>

               <p>comes"—I turned the gas off, and and then opened the door and came upon the prisoner and prosecutor two feet from the door—it was a moonlight night—Driscoll was in front of the prosecutor, who was smothered in blood—I said, "Halloa, what is the matter? let the man alone"—Haley said, "He has assaulted my husband—I said, "Then we will all go to the station together"—Driscoll said, "I shall not go to the station"—Haley said, "And I am sure I shall not"—I said, You all will"—I called "Police!"—a policeman came—we got a little way to the station, and Driscoll refused to go further—I got the policeman's rattle out of his pocket and sprang it—I did not go to the station, as I had only my slippers and trousers on—the prosecutor was covered with blood, and there was as much blood along the place as to appear as if they had killed a pig.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coffee-house keeper, and live at 128, Great Suffolk-street, Borough—the deceased was my wife—I had been married to her about fourteen or fifteen years—we have had five children—the prisoner Dr. Goss was in partnership with Dr. Jones in the South wark-bridge-road—Dr. Jones had attended my wife in three of her previous confinements—I can remember the prisoner with Dr. Jones for ten or twelve years—he has sometimes attended my wife with Dr Jones, on one occasion in her confine<lb/>ment—my wife's confinements were difficult; she wanted care and attention—in August last she was in the family way—on Wednesday, 17th August, Dr. Goss was sent for to attend her—about three months ago as he was passing by my wife said she wished to engage him; he looked in about a fortnight afterwards, and then she engaged him—I was present at the time—on 17th August she was taken unwell, and I sent a messenger for Dr. Goss between 7 and 8 in the evening—he did not come at all on the Wednesday night; be came on the Thursday morning a little before 12—he went into the bar-parlour and saw my wife for about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—when he came out, I said to him, "Well, Doctor, how is my wife going on?"—he said, "The symptoms she has are a mere nothing, she may go on for week or a fortnight, or very likely a month in this state; it is nothing, and you must not make yourself uneasy about it"—he then left my mother had come on the Wednesday evening, before I sent for the doctor and she remained with my wife up to the time of her death—we sent for him again on the Friday night—she went on very comfortably on the Thurs<lb/>day, but on Friday evening she began to have some very bad pains—I sent for him and he very soon came—I suppose it was between 8 and 9 o'clock—he went up stairs to my wife and stayed some time—I was standing at the door when he came out—I said, "Well, Doctor, how is my wife going on?"—he said, "She is going on very well, but it is a cross birth. I have examined her; I can't tell you exactly whether it is the elbow or the knee that presents itself—I said, "Doctor, you are never going to leave her then in that state?"—he said, "Oh yes, I am; I have not had any tea or supper,. but I shall be back again"—I said, "I hope you will come back again directly"—he said, "Oh, no, I shan't I shall be back again to-night"—I said, "Will it be over to-night?"—he said, "Oh, yes; I hope it will be over before I come back"—he came back again about 12 o'clock, I believe, but I did not see him, I was asleep on the sofa—he stopped about half an hour—he next came on Saturday afternoon about 3, but I was not in the way then—my wife got gradually weaker and lower in spirits, and weaker altogether—the pains left her from the Friday night—Dr. Goss called on Saturday of his own accord</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186409190101"/>
               <p>—I understand he remained about a quarter of an hour or twenty minute I went up to my wife, and she said she was very bad, and she knew she should not have strength to go through it—I sent for Dr. Goss again about 8 or a little after—we understood he was attending Mrs. Edwards at the Bridge House—he was there, and he came in about twenty minutes or half an hour—I met him at the door—I was waiting for him, and I said, "Doctor, really something must be done with my poor wife; she is sinking fast, and I don't believe she will have strength to go through what she has got to go through"—he said, "You don't mean that, Brazier?"—I said, "I do, indeed, or, and I am afraid she has been left too long"—he turned round very angrily indeed, and said, "Brazier, what do you mean? I don't understand you; what I have done I have done for the best"—I said, "I hope you have, air"—he said, You know it is impossible for me to be in two places at once"—I said, I am quite aware of that, sir"—by that time he was up by the bedroom door, and in about a minute or a minute and a half or two minutes I heard the door slam, and my mother came down stairs—I did not see Dr. Goss then, he went out at the private door; I saw no more of him—I subsequently went for Mr. Llewellyn—he attended immediately—my wife was confined between 11 and 12—it was between 8 and 9, or something of that sort, that Dr. Goss left—Mr. Llewellyn came and examined my wife, and said he must have assistance and consultation—I begged him to get the cleverest person he could, and he went and fetched Mr. Jarvis, and they both remained until the delivery—I saw no more of Dr. Goss—my wife died on 4th September.</p>

I am the mother of the last witness—I attended the deceased in four confinements previous to this one—on Wednesday, 17th August, I went to see her in consequence of being sent for—from what I observed, I thought the confinement was likely to take place soon—I re<lb/>commended that Dr. Goss should be sent for—he did not come till Thurs<lb/>day, some time about the forenoon—I told him the symptoms, and that I was convinced it would not go off—the symptom I observed was a <hi rend="italic">show</hi>—he said it might go off for a fortnight, or even a month—he had known such a thing—I told him I never had—we did not send for him again; she was not in a great deal of pain—she went on very slowly, having pains now and then—we sent for him on the Friday night, between 7 and 8 o'clock, and he came between 8 or 9, or between 9 and 10—Mrs. Brazier was very bad in that interval—I described to him the state she was in, and told him a circumstance that I was very much surprised at; that the child had a motion with every pain—he remained with us about three quartern of an hour, or it might be nearly an hour, and he came again that evening—I never left her—I observed her symptoms, and told him of them—when he came the second time, he said he had had no tea—I said, "Shall I get you anything?"—he said, "No;" he wanted to go home, but he would come back again, and he did about 12—he stopped with us about an hour, and then he got up very suddenly, and said he should go—a lady who was with me said, "Surely you are not going, Mr. Goss?"—he said, "Yes, I am; I am not going to stop here"—she said, "Will there be time to send to you"—he said, "Oh yes, there will be time enough; I only wish it may be all over, and the child on the bed when I come back"—he came again on Saturday morning between 1 and 2—I told him she had been very bad all night, that her pains were gone, and that her strength was gone with them—he examined her—I told him I was convinced she had had pains enough to bring half a dozen children into the world if she had had proper assistance—he said it would be an evening job—I asked him if it was all right for the world—that was on Friday—he said, "Now—I said, "How is it?"—he said, "I don't know whether it is an arm or a leg"—I asked him on the Saturday if it had progressed much—he said, "Yes, a little," but it would be an evening job; it would not come off till the evening—she was</p>

               <p>very weak and faint—we sent for him again on Saturday night, about 8 or 9 o'clock—I was listening very attentively, expecting him, and when I heard his knock at the foot of the stain, I went to the lobby—I heard my son say to him, "Oh, Dr. Goes, I am afraid you have left my wife too long; the is sinking fast;" and I heard him speak very cross, "What do you mean? Can I be in two places at once? I have done the best I could?"—my son said, "I hope you have—;" he then came up stairs in a very great pet—I said, "I am very glad to see you, sir; she has been very ill, very bad, and her pains are all gone, and her strength with them"—he said, "I don't know what Brazier means by talking to me in this manner; I will not be spoken to by any man in such a manner"—I said, "You must make some allowance for a husband's feelings; she has been very ill"—he kept on saying that he would not be talked to in that manner; that he could act be in two places at once—I said, "Well, sir, if you could not, you might have sent some one else, or have told us, that we might get some one else"—"Then get them," he said, and he took up his hat, and was about immediately to leave the room—Mrs. Brazier put up her hands, and said, "For God's sake don't be angry; don't leave me, Mr. Goes; don't leave me to die; don't be angry"—but he was half-way down the stairs; she begged me to call him back, but I could not have done it for the world—he went on down the stairs, and slammed the door in such a manner that it really shook the little house—that was all I saw of him—Mr. Llewellyn was then sent for, and he fetched Dr. Jarvis—she was confined between 11 and 12 that night—she lived for fourteen days afterwards, but she was sinking last every day—she never rallied—for the first day or two she felt better from her extreme pain and agony, but she never rallied, only to get out of bed a few minutes at a time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a burgeon, of 28, Trinity-Street—I have been in practice ten yean—I was called in to see Airs. Brazier on Saturday night, 20th August, about half-past 10—I found her in labour—I made an exami<lb/>nation—I found it a case of arm presentation, the elbow forward far down in the passage, the <hi rend="italic">os uteri</hi> grasping the shoulder—the woman was very much exhausted, and it was a case that I would not undertake the responsibility of myself—I came down stairs, and mentioned it to the husband, and then went and brought in Dr. Jarvis—I was away a quarter of an hour or rather more; a sufficient time to go down to St. Thomas-street and back—I found Dr. Jarvis at home, and he returned with me immediately—he examined the patient, and advised chloroform to be administered, so as to facilitate deliver; and turning—I administered the chloroform, and Dr. Jarvis delivered the patient—I attended her afterwards until she died—she rallied a little after delivery—she seemed to get on very fairly for two or three days, then pain commenced in the region of the womb, and she daily got gradually worn and worse, and died on the Sunday fortnight following—I attribute her death to exhaustion consequent upon inflammation which sprung up in the right side of the womb, a few days after delivery—upon post-mortem ex<lb/>amination it was found there was inflammation of the right broad ligament and of the <hi rend="italic">uterus</hi>—in my opinion she had not sufficient vital power to resist the slight inflammation that arose—inflammation occasionally comes on after delivery, after a difficult birth, and sometimes after an ordinary birth—in my opinion that was the immediate cause of death—I cannot undertake to say whether that was hastened in any way, or produced by anything that happened or did not happen on that night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think she was delivered as soon as she should have been? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot form an opinion in what condition the patient was at 9 o'clock, or any time before, not from my experience at 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ORRIDGE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From what you know or have heard of the case, can you say it was wrong to leave her undelivered up to the time you saw her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is impossible to say what condition she was in previously; I can only say what condition she was in at the time I arrived—medical opinion might differ upon that subject—I Will not undertake to say that she suffered from that cause.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In a case of that kind, where the presentation is of a knee or elbow, would you expect inflammation of the womb? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In an arm presentation you might expect it, because you would have to turn, and some<lb/>times that is a difficult thing—I think it would be an Library thing to succeed the turning.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. JARVIS</hi>. I am a member of the College of Physicians, and obstetric physician of St. Thomas's—I was called in on the Saturday night by Mr. Llewellyn—I have heard the evidence he has given, and agree with him en<lb/>tirely—having regard to this being a cross birth, and being known to be so before 9 o'clock in the evening, an examination ought certainly to have taken place by the medical man attending; but that, involves the whole case, that is to say, ought the medical man to have left—it would be no use to make an examination and then go—it was: necessary for him; to be there at 9, and necessary for some, one to attend her—I delivered her; it was one of the most difficult cases in midwifery, and required a great deal of cart and attention—I had nothing to do with the case between the delivery and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186409190105"/>
               <p>a consultation with Mr. Llewellyn on the Friday—she certainly died from exhaustion—it was a difficult and anxious labour, that was one source of ex<lb/>haustion—there was slight inflammation of the right broad ligament—she was exhausted prior to that coming on—I gather that she was a slight and delicate woman previously; undersized and very spare in habit—I can't say how she was before I saw her—she was then extremely exhausted; whether that exhaustion was due to the previous labour pains or any other cause I am not prepared to say—looking at the state, in which I found her at 11 o'clock, I should say she ought not to have been left without medical attend<lb/>ance—there is no question about that—every hour unquestionably added to the difficulty of the birth—I look upon the slight inflammation which occurred as having just turned the scale—I think if that had not occurred she would probably have survived.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Slight inflammation of that description happens in very many cases where there is difficult labour, does: it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> And in very natural labours too—Mr. Llewellyn arrived at my house a little before 11—I cannot say whether if the deceased had been attended at 9 o'clock, as she was when I saw her, any different termination would have taken place—I can't say positively that two hours' difference in the termination of the labour would have affected materially the result of the case, or may have made any difference to the termination of the case—I won't say that I think she might still have died if it had not been for the inflammation which supervened—I should have hoped she would have rallied—that inflamma<lb/>tion might have occurred from a common cold, and in the most natural labour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From what you saw, ought this to have been done at an earlier period than two hours before you did it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose that would depend entirely on the state in which the os <hi rend="italic">uteri</hi> was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Just so—what state it was in two hours previously I could not undertake to say—in my opinion this was not a premature birth—there was no post-mortem evidence upon that question—he rapidity of dilatation of the <hi rend="italic">os uteri</hi> differs with different patients—some<lb/>times where it is rigid and small, there is a rapid dilatation, and sometimes it remains rigid and contracted hour after hour—that would be quite eccen<lb/>tric of the person's constitution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Those answers then rather qualify what you said before, that she ought to have been delivered more than two hours before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This is the qualifying element, that she was in an exceedingly reduced and exhausted state, and that we are able to deliver by artificial means if a person's strength is flagging, independent of the opening of the mouth of the womb; therefore I cannot go beyond 9 o'clock; I should certainly say at 9 means might have been adopted to deliver her, but whether that would have made the slightest difference in the termination of the case I cannot say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the <hi rend="italic">os uteri</hi> sufficiently dilated for the purposes of delivery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Fully so—I gave her brandy at once—I believe she would have died there and then without the administration of chloroform—I should be very sorry to connect the death with anything that occurred on that night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ORRIDGE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If Dr. <hi rend="smallCaps">GOSS</hi> examined her at 9 o'clook, is it probable that he would have found the mouth of the womb sufficiently dilated for delivery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think probably, but I cannot say positively—if that was so every hour or half-hour afterwards became of importance—she should have been delivered as soon as the womb was properly dilated—it was a full<lb/>grown child.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a draper, in High-street, Borough—Baylis was in my service as shawl-buyer and salesman—he served behind the counter—previous to the day I gave him into custody I gave some directions to a police-constable—on Friday, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> September, about 11 in the morning, I saw Hempsted in custody—I was fetched from the City—I had seen him many times before in my shop, but I did not know his name or his business—Baylis has been in the shop at the same time, and Hempsted has waited till he was disengaged, I fancy—I never saw him buy any goods in the place—I went with the officer after Hempsted was taken, and fetched two shawls which had been left at a public-house close by—I brought them into the shop, and said, "Who sold these shawls?"—Baylis immediately replied, "I did"—I said, "What did you sell them for?"—he said, "Seven shillings"—I went and looked on the check-file, and found that 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. had been paid to the cashier—I then said to Baylis, This is a very strange business, your selling such goods as these for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and I then inquired of the men generally what was the cost of the shawls—one cost 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the other 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I knew from the tickets what they had cost, I marked them myself—I have not got the tickets; they were not on the shawls when I got them from the Black Bull public-house—one ticket was produced by a young man—I saw it, but I imagine it was destroyed—there are no tickets now on the shawls—there are tickets on all goods that go out of my house, with the selling-price marked in characters, not figures—I know the value of the goods; the value, to buy them, is 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. the two—the price, to a wholesale buyer, would be 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said to Baylis, "It is a very strange thing that you sell goods like this," and he said, "I know I have done wrong; I will make it up if you will forgive me"—Baylis had directions as to price—if it was a wholesale customer he was to sell at the wholesale price, and if a retail customer at retail price; no deviation whatever—I gave those direc<lb/>tions to Baylis, and to every other salesman—I took this piece of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) off the cashier's file; it is Baylis's handwriting—it is not signed by any one—it ought to have been signed by some one—every bill ought to be examined by another person, and his initials put on it, to show that it is correct; and in case the bill is wrong, he is fined for examining it wrong—these shawls are my property—they have been in my shop.</p>

               <p>mine is a plain trade—I don't call these fancy goods at all—it was reported that one of the shawls was a little soiled, but I don't see much of it myself—it is only in the crease where it is folded—I say it is not soiled; nothing to harm the shawl; not to make it of less value—I believe the witness Mountfield, is outside, he came away from the shop this morning before I did—he is in my service now—I have not seen him here this morning—he has been in the shop this morning—we open at half-past 7—I have been in Scotland, shooting for three weeks, bat I stick to business very closely generally—Baylis is one of my head men, and Mountfield is another—the bills are shown to another person to see if the items are added up rightly—I don't think that is always carried out when there is only one article; it should be done—I mark the shawls with my own hands, at all times, when I am in town, and when I am out Baylis does it—I cannot tell you what date these shawls were purchased, or how long they have been in my establishment—the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. marked on this document, as payment for the shawls, has been received by me—it is in Baylis's ordinary handwriting—I should know, if I saw it, that he had received 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the shawls—he did not say, if he had done wrong he would make it up—he said he knew he had done wrong, and he would make it up—he told me at once that he had sold them for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I don't know whether he knew that Hempsted was in custody then or not.</p>

               <p>some directions from Mr. Ewin—on 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> September, about a quarter to 9 in, the morning, I was at the corner of King-street, High-street, in private clothes—I was about thirty yards from the shop, I should think—I could see who entered—there was somebody employed in the window of the shop—I saw Hempsted standing at first in front of the shop—Baylis came to the door, and spoke to him—some other person was then engaged close by in the window—Baylis then went into the shop, followed by Hempsted—I did not see what occurred in the shop at all—I then saw Hempsted come out with a parcel under his arm, and shortly afterwards Baylis followed, not more than a minute afterwards—Hempsted was not more than thirty or forty yards from the door when Baylis came out—they went into the Bull public-house in High-street, a few doors from the prosecutor's premises—they remained there some three or four minutes, when Baylis came out, and returned to the prosecutor's shop—a minute or two afterwards, Hempsted came out—he had nothing with him then—I followed him down High-street into the Westminster-road—he then went into Mr. Alderson's, another linen-draper's—he came out with two parcels from there, and went to a pawnbroker's, of the name of Barnett, near the Circus—he came out of there with only one parcel, and went back again in the direction of tin prosecutor's shop—I followed him down the Borough-road into Blackman-street, where I stopped him—I asked him what he had got—he said he had some head-dress pieces—I told him I was a police-constable, and I wished to know what he had—I asked him if he had any invoices with them—he said, "Yes"—I then asked him if he had been into any other shop besides Mr. Alderson's that morning—he said, "No"—I said, "You had better be careful," and he afterwards said, "Yes, I have; I have been to Mr. Ewin's"—I asked him what he purchased there—he said, "Three shawls"—I asked him if he had any invoice for them—he said, "No"—I then asked him how much he gave for them—he said, "Seven shillings"—I told him he would have to go with me to the station.</p>

I went with Mr. Ewin to the Black Bull on 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> September, and got a parcel which contained these two shawls—I afterwards went to the prosecutors shop, and he asked Baylis if he had sold any shawls that morning—he said, "Yes, he had; he had sold two"—the prosecutor said, "What did you sell them for?"—he said, "For 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he then asked him if he thought he could buy the shawls for the money himself—he made no reply to that—the prosecutor then told him to put on his coat; he should live him in charge for steal<lb/>ing the shawls—I then took him into custody—on the road to the station he said, "May I speak to Mr. Ewin?"—I looked round, but could not see him, and told him he had better wait till we got to the police-station—the inspector cautioned him in the usual way, and he then said that he hoped Mr. Ewin would forgive him, as. it was his first time; it was the other man who caused him to do it—the shawls were shown to him in the shop at the time of the conversation.</p>
