               <p>Mr. Deseaves. I was along with the prosecutor at that time under Ludgate, where there was a great crowd, and the prisoner rushed by.

When I was got within about forty or fifty yards of Mr. Masterman's house, I heard something behind me; I looked back and saw, I think, the same man, with a mask on his face, and a pistol in his hand, about four or five yards behind me. I mistrusting his errand, put my hand under my coat to push in my watch chain, which, with two large seals, hung visibly to be seen. He said, Give me your watch, or I will shoot you; I said I had none, or would not, or such like words. He replied, I saw your watch when I met you, therefore I know you have a watch; and added, I am an unhappy man, drove to it by necessity; I am a gentleman, and a man of honour, and drove to the utmost distress, or I should not use you in this manner; - I insist upon it, or I will shoot you through the head. I did not immediately give it him, but wanted him to put his pistol within my reach, that I might have an opportunity to lay hold on it ; then he put his hat towards me for my watch, and I put it into the hat. He then insisted upon my money; said I, I have but little, and it will not do you much service; to which he replied, don't conceal any; I answer'd, if you don't believe me, search me; which if he had, I designed to have secured him, but he would not, so I gave him two shillings into his hat. He then went off, and turning his horse about, when he was got about five or six yards, said, You shall have your watch again, if you advertise it, for the value of the gold, and then rode very fast off towards Highgate ; and I seeing Mr. Masterman, or his servant, called out for him to get me a horse, telling him that I had been robbed. I saw the prisoner ride by my house, and ran to see whether he turned towards Pinchley-common. I then mounted a horse, took a handle of a rake in my hand, and pursued, and Mr. Masterman's servant mounted another horse, and overtook me at Highgate; there we inquired, and was directed wrong, but found our mistake, and turned again. We never saw the prisoner till we got to the Spaniard at Hampstead. I had described him to the servant. I saw the prisoner turning by Mr. Arnold's corner, so I cut cross through the gravel pits, to meet him at North-end. We also called out as we rode; and when we came to North-end we saw him in the bottom. By this time the people were a little alarmed, and about two miles beyond there he quitted his horse, and took to the fields. My horse was almost knocked up, so I jumped upon the horse the prisoner had quitted. The prisoner had hid himself in a hedge, and before I got to him, he was by some persons dragged out. We took him before

            . I am servant to Mr. Masterman. Mr. Bretley called out to me, to know if my master had any horses in the stable, saying he had been robbed; I said there were two. He then pointed out, saying, there goes the man, but I did not see him. I saddled two horses, he mounted one, and I the other, and pursued him to High-gate, where a man informed us he had turned to the left hand; upon which I rode round the two roads that go to London, and met several persons, who said there was no such man gone that way; then I went to the turnpike, and there I was told that no such person had pass'd through there; we turned again to the left, went to the Spaniards, and enquired there, and was told that there was such a man gone by some little time before. When we had got about two hundred yards from thence, I saw a man riding full speed, and calling to Mr. Bretley, I informed him, that I believed, by his description, there was the man that robbed him.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he describe the person who robbed him?</p>
               <p>Griffice. He described him as having a thin face, and riding a dark bay mare with a brown muzzle. I saw the man turn at the corner of a house, and take down the great road; for I was in view of him about a mile riding in the road, being rather better mounted than Mr. Bretley. I called out to a gentleman to stop him, informing him that he was a highwayman; then the prisoner turned out of the road, and rode to a hedge, quitted his mare, and jumped over it. There were a great crowd of people got about his mate, and I saw Mr. Bretley get on the mare; for my horse refused to go over the hedge, or I had taken the prisoner in the first field. When I had got up to him, there was a man or two had got hold of him; then Mr. Bretley came up, and after he had tied the prisoner's thumbs, he asked him where his watch was; he said he had it not. We got him into the road, mounted him with a man behind him, and carried him to the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Did you see me dismount my mare, or did she throw me?</p>
               <p>Griffice. He was on full speed, and in such a case no man can give evidence of that. According to the description Mr. Bretley gave me, the prisoner is the man that robbed him.</p>

            . I was coming to Mr. Bretley's house the same time he was robbed, and about forty yards from Mr. Bretley's gate I met the prisoner on the same brown mare, which Mr. Bretley rode afterwards; he was whipping and spurring all the way he went, and I expected she would throw him every minute. This was just after the robbery was committed; the prisoner was going towards Highgate, but there was no mask on his face then. I took particular notice of his clothes and his mare, but I did not so much mind his face. I followed Mr. Bretley, and saw the prisoner, when they had got him into the road, after taken. I saw the mare, and can swear it is the same mare I saw before, and that the prisoner had on the same sort of clothes. The mare was a dark bay with a brown muzzle.</p>

            . I was with one Eldridge upon the Green, and there was the cry, Stop a highway-man! I saw the prisoner on horseback turn to the Green, who rode at a great rate. We pursued him, being about fifty pole from him when he turned out of the road. When we came up to him, we found him crept into a ditch covered pretty much with bushes. I did not see him when he quitted the mare, but I can swear the prisoner is the man I saw riding, and the mare I believe to be the same, but I did not so much mind her.</p>
               <p>Eldridge confirmed what the last evidence said, with this addition, That the prisoner was found in a ditch in the second field.</p>

            . As I was coming from Ditton to town, I saw the prisoner come riding down the hill very fast, whipping his horse, and as I rode up the hill they said it was a highwayman, and desired I would turn back again. I was pretty well mounted, so I rode back, and got ground of him every minute. I saw some people coming along, I called out to them a highwayman, stop him, &amp;c. he turned round upon Golder's Green, jumped off his horse, and went through a hedge, and ran over the fields. The hedge was difficult, and I could not jump my horse over, but I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175110160005"/> down a little lower, got over, and went down the field; he then got over the stile, and went into the second field; I likewise jumped my horse over the stile, by the assistance of a man to force him, but the prisoner was then out of sight. Presently I heard a man say there he is, and I saw him pulled out of the hedge. I am certain he is the same man I saw whipping and riding, &amp;c.</p>

            . On Wednesday the eighteenth of September I went to the play-house, Drury-lane. I could not get in, but staid there till the play was over. Coming away, at about half an hour after nine o'clock, about ten yards from the playhouse door in Bridges Street, the prisoner at the bar desired me to go and take a pot and a dram with her; to which I made no reply, but walked on. She followed me, and accosted me in that manner a second time; I desired her to be gone about her business, but she persisted in following me. Then another woman came up and said, Mary, will not you go to your company? If you have ticked up this gentleman, he shall go along with you, and be welcome, but don't detain the company you have left behind. I went on into <placeName id="t17511016-4-crimeloc20">White-Horse-Yard</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17511016-4-crimeloc20" type="placeName" value="White-Horse-Yard"/>

Then this woman, and six or seven fellows, as near as I can remember, came up to me; but she was the first. One of the men struck me about the head, which stunned me a little, and I fell against the rails. They bid me stand, and the men held me while the prisoner took out of my pocket a green silk purse, in which were a guinea and a half in gold, a crown, two half crowns, and one shilling. She is so remarkable, I am certain she is the woman that robbed me.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it a light or dark night?</p>
               <p>Widenham. It was a dark night, but by the light of the lamp, which was over the door where I was knocked against the rails, I observed her. I had a suspicion of her, and had observed her before.</p>

I lay to sleep on my side to preserve my guinea and half, which I then felt there by putting my thumb down in my pocket. I awaked when the clock strack three, I heard it, there was nobody in the room; I knocked, Drinkwater's wife came up, I said I was very cold; I went down stairs with her, I trod on one of my straps as I was going down, I look'd, my silver buckles were taken out ; when Drinkwater's wife came down I asked her where were my buckles; said she, damning her blood, did not you sell them because you had no money, calling me impudent son of a bitch? I said no, I had no occasion, for I had money about me, going to feel for the guinea, and I found it was gone also; she went to her husband, who came in with a knife in his hand, and said to me, don't play any tricks here, but sign this paper, he had a paper in his hand already wrote; he said I sold them for twelve shillings; I signed the paper, but it was through fear; Drinkwater's wife had the buckles in her hand at that time; then they were very agreeable; I asked if I should stay till quite day, I knew I could lose no more than I had lost, so I staid, I went to bed and lay with the prisoner, I could not sleep, she asked me several times why I did not go to sleep; they asked me to stay breakfast; we had all a dram a-piece at six o'clock, and out of the house I went, and promised them to be there at breakfast; then I went for a warrant, but the justice was not up. The prisoner had nothing to say, nor called any witnesses.</p>

               <p>Prosecutrix. There was not any body came in.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walker. I live at the White Hart in Thames-street, and have known the prisoner 15 years, he has had a very good character, he was an hostler, he is now I believe out of place.</p>
               <p>Mr. Prew, one of the jewry. The prisoner lived hostler with me six months and was as good a servant as ever I had.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is this ago?</p>
               <p>Prew. It is almost a year ago.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutrix. Where is the man that found the tankard?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. He was sworn before the alderman, but I cannot find where he lives.</p>

I pushed on as hard as I could, but within a stone's throw of where I live two of them overtook me, they were Mallone and M'Cane. It was as fine a moon light night as ever I saw in my life, and I knew them all four. I am positive to them. When I came to the very door where I live, Byrne and the evidence Wayland laid hold on me, one on one side, the other on the other; they bid m e hold my tongue, and called to the other two to come up. Mallone and the Evidence led me beyond the passage behind the pump; there they bid me deliver my watch and money. I said I had never a watch about me, but my money I would give them; so the Evidence took my money, which was nine shillings and three pence. I had one shilling more, which they left. I believe M'Cane took my hat, for he stood on my left hand, Byrne stood facing me with a pistol, and the other two with cutlasses over my head. M'Cane had no weapon, as I saw, Byrne and M'Cane were both stooping when my shoe-buckles were taken, but which took them I cannot tell. They told me, if they found I had concealed any thing they would blow my brain out. I had a suspicion of them when they followed me, so I had put my watch down in my breeches, and by that means saved it. I described them all in the morning to several neighbours, and how they were armed. I believe they were about eight minutes with me. They were taken up, as far as I understand, within an hour after this, and I saw them about seven the next morning.</p>

            . The prisoners and I had been acquainted together for about a month. We went out in July last, in order to get money by robbing, and we all four attacked the prosecutor in Catherine-wheel Alley, Whitechapel, where we turned him up under a gateway. Byrne had a pistol, Mallone and I each a sword. We took from him nine shillings and three pence, his silver buckles, his hat, and an old tobacco-box out of his pocket. Byrne and I first attacked him; Byrne ran the pistol to his chin, the other passed him before, and looked at him, but when they saw we had attacked him, they turned back to us.</p>
               <p>Q. Were your weapons naked?</p>
               <p>Wayland. They were. M'Cane took his hat, I took the money, and Mallone took the buckles out of his shoes. We were all taken in about an hour after. The prosecutor came the next morning, and said we were the four men. We had spent a shilling of the money. We went into Winifred-street, and in a private ground room of a house there Byrne and Mallone fought about the buckles; afterwards, the men that took us took the things from us.</p>
               <p>[The two swords and pistol produced in court, which were deposed by him to be the instruments they had at that time.]</p>
               <p>Q. from Byrne. Ask the prosecutor, my Lord, what the Evidence said to him after the robbery?</p>
               <p>Smart. After they had robbed me, they bid me continue in that place where I was a considerable time, I promised them I would. They went away, but the Evidence turned back with the cutlass in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175110160009"/> his hand, and asked me where I lived, saying he intended to turn Evidence tomorrow, adding, I do not like the company I am in. I told him where I lived; then he said, By the great God you shall hear of me. By the great God and sweet Jesus tell me the truth. I said, Indeed I am at my own door; to which he replied, You shall hear of me in the morning, for I stand in danger of my life.</p>

            . I was at the taking the prisoners in a sort of entry, betwixt Winifred-street and Catherine-wheel Alley. I looked through the window, and saw a pistol and some hangers lying, but the prisoners seemed in a dispute. A woman went in with some beer, Robinson followed her, and I him; Mallone whipped a hanger up, saying, D - n my eyes, if here is not a grab, then the candle was struck out. I called to Chailes to shut the door, off went a pistol close by my head, and Chailes called out he was shot; I said never mind that. I had then got hold of Byrne, and having a pistol in my hand, gave him three or four cuts before he would submit. I said to the woman, If you are an honest woman go for a candle, so she brought one. The last witness took the silver buckles out of Byrne's hand, and I found this hat in the room. Wayland first submitted. We carried them to the watch-house, and they blamed each other. The Evidence said, Mr. Stanley, if it is possible my life can be saved, I will make a discovery; to which I replied, Then the only thing is to tell of the robbery. Upon which he shewed us the place, as likewise the prosecutor, who told me he had been robbed, and that he knew the Evidence; when he saw the other three, he likewise knew them. They all confessed the fact before the Justice, and wanted to be admitted evidences. I had a warrant from Justice Clark to take up Byrne for robberies committed in George's Fields, and I had told Robinson of him. He saw them, and came and called me out of bed.</p>

Some of them snatched off my hat and wig; Symonds, the evidence, said to me, how much money have you in your pocket? I told him; no, d - n you, he said to them, you shall not strip him; there was a dispute betwixt them about it; said he, give him his hat and wig again, which they accordingly did; they went away towards Whitechapel church, it being my way I followed them. Presently I perceived some of them coming towards me; they said if I came any further they would blow my brains out; then I turned back, and went up Red Lion-street, and so to my inn; this was on the Sunday night, and on Tuesday two men came to my house (I had told the hostler and people of the house of the robbery) by whose direction they found me; I came to London with them, and saw the prisoners before Justice Richards; then I knew Newton and Mandeville. I had a hat before my face part of the time of the robbery, but then I had a good view of Newton, he standing by my side; but I saw them before and after that. A pair of buckles produced in court, he deposed they were taken out of the knees of his breeches, and that he saw them taken from out of the breeches knees of Holmes after he was taken ; the shoe buckles were shown and deposed to.</p>

A surgeon was sent for, and there was found a wound on the left side of his head through his scull, which bled very much; he had also a wound on his left arm, and another on his left thumb.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any weapon in the prisoner's hand when he struck the deceased?</p>
               <p>Tompson. I did not, my Lord. The deceased died on the nineteenth of September, and this was done on the 31st of August. I think he did not keep his bed the first and second days, but he never was out of the house after.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he on his legs when he received these blows?</p>
               <p>Tompson. He was not down at all.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of wounds were there?</p>
               <p>Tompson. They were all cuts.</p>
               <p>On his cross-examination he said, The prisoner and the deceased seemed always to be very friendly to each other; that he could not tell but the deceased might have struck the prisoner before he turned back; that the deceased was standing in the same place he did when the prisoner went into the middle of the street.</p>

            . The deceased and I were first cousins. On the last day of August, about eight at night, Mr. Tompson and I went to Mr. Black's in Round-Court, to see for one Mr. Bonner, a painter, for Mr. Tompson to deliver a letter to him, but not finding him I came out again, meeting the prisoner at the bar just without the door; upon which we went up stairs, and had some steaks together. About ten o'clock the deceased came into our company; we were then drinking<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175110160012"/> the third pot of beer. There was a wager laid about the height of twelve new halfpence, when laid one upon another, for a pot of beer, and Tompson lost. Then the deceased and the prisoner wagered about their heights; the prisoner laid that the deceased was not an inch taller than he was; they were measured, and the deceased was taller by an inch and a half, so the prisoner lost. We had six pennyworth of rum and water for the two threepences lost; Tompson paid his, but the prisoner refused to pay his threepence, so the deceased paid it for him. They had words; the prisoner put down half a crown, saying he would not pay the wager, but would spend half a crown with any man, and desired any of us to cover it; but as we did not chuse to spend any more, we all four went out to go home. It struck twelve just as we were going out of the house; we went on till we came to Chandos-street, there they had words, and the deceased called the prisoner scoundrel ; the prisoner said he was no more a scoundrel than he was, and that he was his man at any time; to which the deceased replied, Nothing like the time present. I smiled and said, I hope, gentlemen, you will not quarrel about so small a matter as threepence. I walked pretty hard on towards May's Buildings; being about seven yards before them, I looked behind me, and saw the prisoner give the deceased three or four blows towards the head. I saw no weapon in his hand. I saw the deceased hold up his hands to guard his face, but made no resistance as I saw. I turned back a step or two, and the deceased said, James, I believe Mutter has cut me with something or other; then I saw the blood run much. We walked pretty hard home; when we came there a light was brought immediately, and there was found a large wound on the deceased's left temple, which seemed to be cut. A surgeon was sent for, and upon searching him farther, we found a wound on the prisoner's left arm; it was a cut about an inch and a half long: there was another cut on his left thumb, and a little wound below his eye: they all seemed to be done with a sharp pointed instrument. The prisoner came home with us, and the deceased ordered the watch to be called, to take him into custody.</p>
               <p>On his cross-examination he said, The prisoner and the deceased lived together in a friendly manner; that he knew of no malice betwixt them; that he turned about on his own account, not upon the calling out; that it was possible there might have been blows before he turned, &amp;c. that the deceased said, before he died, he was sorry for poor Mutter; that as the deceased was going to be put to bed, (there was Mutter in his own bed) he shewed him his blood on his sleeve, saying, Mutter, do you see your own handy works? Mutter answered, It was all your own fault, you was the first aggressor; then the deceased ordered the watch to be called, to take care of the prisoner: that it was about two or three minutes after the word scoundrel, that he saw the blows; that he had used to look upon the prisoner to be a good natured man, and the deceased likewise; that they were facing each other at the time of the blows; and that he thought the wounds were the cause of his death.</p>

            . They all four lodged in my house. They came in on the first of September, a little after twelve in the morning, and the deceased was bleeding at the left temple very much; my wife held her apron to it, and the blood ran down on the floor; he said, Take care of Mutter, for he has cut me, and I shall die; so his kinsman went and called the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what he was cut with?</p>
               <p>Wadle. He did not, my Lord. When the watch came, the surgeon said, Perhaps the wound may not be dangerous, you had better not take Mutter up with the watch yet; to which the deceased replied, No, I will not hurt poor Mutter, for I do not know what ailed him to hurt me, but I was afraid he would do mischief with the knife. I gave a man a small sword to threaten the prisoner, if he should come down stairs, fearing he might be mad. After that I went up to the room where he was, saying, You have cut Anderson. It is his own fault, replied he, for he struck me on the temples first; then shewed me a little place on his forehead, where he said the deceased struck him. I said he ought not to have taken a knife to him for that, desiring him to give the knife to me; he said he would not: then I said to one Steward, who was in bed with him, Get out of bed, and went to Mutter again, saying, Give me the knife; he replied he would not: then said I, Throw it out of the window, he said he would. Upon which he threw up the window, making a faint motion with his hand, but I did not see any thing thrown away. He did not deny cutting him, but did not say whether he had, or had not a knife.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a place was that on his forehead?</p>
               <p>Wadle. It was a little red, and a little rising, but I took very little notice of it. After that the deceased insisted upon our taking care of Mutter, so the watch was sent for again.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175110160013"/>On his cross-examination he said, They two lived in great friendship together; that he judged the small place on the prisoner's face was not done with a hand, except it was done with one nuckle; that it was very small, if given at all; that the prisoner was as sober a lad as could be in any body's house; and that they all lived together in friendship like brethren.</p>
               <p>Mr. Steward. I was the prisoner's bedfellow, but was asleep when he came to bed; they awaked me, and I saw him sitting in the room: I asked him what was the occasion of that noise? he said he and Anderson had quarrelled about a wager, &amp;c. that he had lost, and that he had refused to pay it in the publick house. Coming out in the street, the deceased called him scoundrel; that he answered, I am no more a scoundrel than you are; and that at the end of the quarrel he believed he had cut him. I asked him what he had in his hand, but he made no answer. Presently after the landlord came into the room, and taxed him with cutting the deceased with a knife, desiring him to give it him, which he refused; then, at his desire, he made a seint, as if he threw it out of the window, but whether he did, or did not, I cannot tell. When the surgeon had dressed the deceased, the deceased came up and said, How could you use me so? the prisoner replied, You struck me first, but the other denied that he ever struck him at all; then he went down, and the watchmen were sent for, who came and took the prisoner away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kelley. I am a surgeon. I was called to the deceased between twelve and one in the morning on the first of September, and found him bleeding from three several wounds; I dressed them, and attended him to the day of his death. During the course of my treating him, I found none of the wounds in any danger, except that on his temple, and that I believe was the cause of his death. I found the instrument, which must be sharp pointed, had penetrated the scull, and wounded the brain.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the deceased sensible ?</p>
               <p>Kelley. He was not delirious at first, but was afterwards at times.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he die?</p>
               <p>Kelley. He died on the nineteenth of September. His other wounds were one upon the back part of his left arm, the other on the left thumb, and a little scratch under his eye; they all appeared to be done with a sharp pointed instrument; the flesh was raised on his thumb, but not cut intirely off, it being only divided from the part; that on his head was on the temperal bone. I was with him the night before he died, about the hour of ten, he was then insensible, and he died about two the morning following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever say any thing to you about this quarrel?</p>
               <p>Kelley. Sometimes he would exclaim against the prisoner, saying, he could not think how he came to do so bad a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what he struck him with?</p>
               <p>Kelley. He said he did not know he had struck him with any thing but his fist, till he found the blood running down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he had struck the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Kelley. He said he did not strike him; but he did not tell me the particulars of what passed in the street, as I remember.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in his senses when he said he did not strike the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Kelley. He seemed as if he was quite master of his senses at that time.</p>

               <p>On the 31st of August the deceased and I came out of this house in Round-Court in the Strand; we had some words about a wager for a pot of beer. When we came to Chandos street, he called me scoundrel, and said he would kick me, but on my saying I would not allow it, his cousin came and prevented him. After that, he said he would fight me for a guinea, then for a crown; he also struck me on the forehead, which caused a bump.</p>

Sir, said I to Mr. Wills, he has picked your pocket; then the prisoner handed it to one of his companions, who dropped it, and the prosecutor took it up.</p>

On the 21st of last month I had been into the city; upon my return I found the prisoner in the shop looking at some lawn. As I passed by her, I heard one of my servants tell her, he was surprized she should offer him less than half the value of it. I took notice of her, and apprehended, by her appearance, she could not have occasion for such a thing; and, by her offering so low a price, I thought she could not come to buy, but to steal. This made me determine to watch her; but I had occasion to leave the shop for four or five minutes; and at my return again, I saw between her and the compter, as she was fitting, something that seemed considerable bulky; she was putting it under her petticoats. As soon as she saw me drawing nearer, she lifted up the right side of her gown next me, and covered it. When I came up to her, I could not see what she had got; but upon my passing behind her, and going on the other side, I saw part of a piece of printed cotton; about eight inches of the selvidge lay upon the floor uncovered at her left side, the rest of it was under her petticoats; the piece was folded. I went behind the compter, and looked at her again. I took a book and laid it before me, and with a pen made believe I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175110160015"/> writing. At the same time I observed she kept drawing it up under her petticoats. After I was sensible she had drawn the greatest part of it up, I went forwards and spoke to three or four people of mine near the door, and ordered them not to go backwards to prevent what I thought was going forward, and if she took the piece of cotton away they should follow her and bring her back again. Soon after, she came forward, and went out into the street; as she was going out, I saw part of the cotton hang down below her coats. When she was gone 20 or 30 yards, I sent two of my people, Mr. Maycomb and Mr. Boston, who brought her back. They carried her backwards; a mob gathered about the door; I stood there; she dropped the piece of cotton as she stood; I sent for a constable; he searched her; and, in my presence, he found a remnant of lawn upon her, my property, under her petticoats; both produced in court and deposed to</p>

I live servant with Mr. Eyres; the prisoner has used our shop for six months; she came to look at some lawns on Saturday the 21st of September; I shewed her some; she bought a yard and paid for it, at 6 s. per yard. After that she went out of the shop; I did not see her take the lawn or printed cotton; he looked on the piece of cotton and lawn. These are Mr. Eyres's property; the cotton is worth 3 l. the lawn 10 s. and more. The piece of cotton came from the printer's that morning, and was lying on the compter when she came in.</p>

            . I am servant with Mr. Eyres. The first time I remember seeing the prisoner was Saturday September 21. I had been out of the shop some little time; when I came in again, Mr. Eyres told me the woman had taken some cotton. After that she came forward; I saw something hang down, it dragged the ground, as Mr. Eyres had described. Then she went out of the shop; so he ordered me and Mr. Maycomb to follow her, and bring her back. We went after her, and took her before she had got far; we brought her back, and placed her in the middle of the shop, I on one side of her and Mr. Maycomb on the other ; he stooped down and picked up the piece of cotton which she let fall to the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it fall?</p>
               <p>Boston. I did not; but when we brought her into the shop, there was nothing lying upon the ground. I wrote the initial letter of my name, and the initial and final letters of my surname upon the cotton. After that, she complained she was not well, and sat down upon a stool; then the constable came and searched her; I saw him take the piece of lawn from her, on which I wrote my name with a black pencil; it is hardly to be read now, but I am positive it is the same. Then she was committed.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Eyres. I remember the prisoner coming to our shop a number of times on the 21st of September; I saw this piece of cotton hang down below her clothes when she was buying the lawn.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you speak to her then?</p>
               <p>Maycomb. We let her go out of the shop in order to take her. After she bought the lawn she went out of the shop, and we followed her; she had not gone above 20 yards before we apprehended her, brought her back, and placed her in the middle of the shop, where she let the piece of cotton fall from under her petticoat; I took it up and wrote my name upon it; it is Mr. Eyres's cotton; it came that forenoon from the printer, I asked the prisoner how she could do so; she seemed much affrighted, and desired a glass of water, and to sit down. The constable searched her; I saw him pull the lawn from under her gown or petticoat; it is my master's lawn.</p>

The prisoner was sitting upon a stool, complaining she was very ill; she had no mind to get from the stool; I lifted her up, and felt something soft tucked under her stays behind ; I put my hand up under a petticoat or two, I cannot say which, and there found this piece of lawn; I wrote my name upon it; here it is.</p>

            . I took the two prisoners at the end of Fleet-market, the Monday in the last Sessions. I knew Clark before. I searched his pockets, and in his right hand pocket I found that penknife the prosecutor has sworn to. I was directed to Mr. Tipping on Tuesday morning, by a person who he had told of his being robbed, and he said he believed he should know one of the persons: said I, Do you know your knife? then he described it, saying, there was a flaw at the point of it. (which there was.) We went with them before Justice Fielding the next morning, where Rakes said, Sir, I will tell the truth, adding, Mr. Tipping said we jumped from the step of a door, but we crossed the road, laid hold of him, and robbed him of a hat, knife, and a halfpenny. He was asked if this was his hat which he left with Mr. Tipping; he said it was. The Justice then asked Clark what he had to say for himself; he said he could not deny but both of them robbed the gentleman. When they came away from thence, Clark d - d the other, adding, You might have saved your life, but now you have hanged us both. There were four of us to take them.</p>
               <p>Tipping. I have made enquiry since, and find Rakes to be of a very honest family, and that he had bore an extreme good character. I believe, by his behaviour, that this was his first fact.</p>

               <p>Mr. Reynolds. I have known him these twelve years, and I always looked upon him to be an ignorant harmless boy. I verily think he is defective in his understanding. He was errant-boy to my father about four years ago. I never heard any thing amiss of him before this.</p>

            . I live with the prosecutor. This chest is my master's; I saw it in his shop on the Tuesday morning. I was in the cellar at night with the prisoner, and fastening up the windows, and going from one window to another, I saw through a crack the prisoner, who was then going out of the shop, take a tea-chest out of the shop window, put it under his coat, and carry it out. I ran up, and told my master of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use to lie in your master's house?</p>
               <p>Oliver. No, he did not. He came to work the next morning.</p>

            . I keep a pastry-cock's shop in Ludgate-street. To my knowledge I never saw the prisoner before he left this chest at my house on Tuesday in the evening; then I was behind the counter. He desired me to let him leave it half an hour, and I ordered my man to put it behind the door. The next morning a man came for it, but my servant told him he was not the person that left it, therefore would not deliver it to him. About half an hour after this, the prosecutor and another man came; he said it was his property, and he would swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was left by the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Harper. I am pretty sure it was.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Who was it that went to Mr. Harper's with you?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was one of my journeymen.</p>
               <p>Harper. I went with the prosecutor to see the prisoner in custody, and knew him again.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to leave it at your shop?</p>
               <p>Harper. It is common for people to leave things at our shops, they being open later than other shops are.</p>

I sent a guinea to change; the lad could not get it changed, so I did not pay her, but gave her half a crown, and bid her come for the rest in the morning. I looked over the things, and missed one large table spoon, three tea spoons, a strainer, all silver; two shirts, a pair of sheets, two table cloths, and one napkin. She did not come for her money. I sent my boy to enquire amongst her acquaintance after her, why she did not come for her wages; but could not hear of her. I went to Justice Lediard and had a warrant of suspicion; I advertised the things; I had the large silver spoon brought by Mr. Gunston, a pawnbroker in Piccadilly, his boy had stopped it. I desired him to look if he had any other of the things. After that, he brought me two tea spoons, tongs, and strainer; I asked him in what name they were pawn'd; he said in the prisoner's for six shillings; I paid him. Two days after that, I had another pawnbroker from the corner of Coventry Court, with two shirts; in a short time he brought one table cloth and one napkin. About a fortnight after, I had intelligence where the prisoner was; so I got a constable, and took her before Justice Lediard. She acknowledged the taking the things as soon as I took her; she also did the same before the Justice. She had pawned some of them in the name of

               <p>I did not take them in the way of theft, I was his servant, and when I was short of money, as he would go away three or four days together, being a stranger in the place, as every thing I was to pay for, except meat, bread and beer, was obliged, at times, to carry out these things, but not with an intent to wrong him; I thought to have fetched them home again, and put them in their places when he paid me my bill. I have had but half a crown from the day I went into the house.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Whenever she asked for money she had it. One day she brought a little trifling bill, it was the time she talks of; I had been out two or three days; I then left her half a guinea; and whenever I went out, I always left her as much as I thought necessary.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you owe her?</p>
               <p>Evans. I owed her about 1 l. 3 s.</p>
               <p>Q. What need had you to send a guinea to change, when that and the half crown would have paid her?</p>
               <p>Evans. When the boy came back I said it was as well, and might be lucky it was not changed, for then I could have an opportunity to look over the things before I paid her.</p>

            . I keep a chandler's shop in Rose-street, St. Martin's-in-the-fields. M'Carty came to my house the 31st of July for a farthing-worth of small beer; she gave me sixpence to change, saying, if I did not like it, she would give me another; I did not like that; she gave me another bad one, so I kept them both; I ordered a constable to be sent for to take her up: she was carried before Justice Fielding; I produced the two sixpences; she acknowledged they were the two I had of her, and that she took them in Covent Garden ; he ordered her to be searched; she was taken out into the yard, there we found upon her three shillings and two sixpences wrapped up in some powder, paper, and rags all together; there was also a piece of leather; the rags seemed to have been rubbed. The justice ordered her commitment to be wrote; while it was writing there was an Irishman talked a great deal of Irish to her, and desired her to confess. Then she said to me, and Mr. Clark the constable, in the fore office, (the Justice then being backwards) she had lodged with Mrs. Johnson, who learned her to make this bad money; that she had followed the practice three or four years that she used sometimes to buy bad counters, and they made it their business to go both together; one stood at the door while the other went into a shop to pass the money off; sometimes one went in, and sometimes the other: she said she could not file them so well as Mrs. Johnson. I was two days at the Justice's; the second time Mrs. Johnson was there; they scolded together; one said, you gave me the the money; the other said she did ; thus they accused one another.</p>

               <p>Schulchus. I understood they had both put off bad money; they both said they had. The two sixpences were produced in court.</p>

I am constable of St. Martin-in-the-fields; I was sent for by this witness to her house, who charged me with the prisoner M'Carty ; I carried her to Justice Fielding, where the two sixpences were produced; the Justice asked her, whether she knew any thing of them; she said, yes, she took them in Covent Garden in exchange for old clothes. The justice ordered me to search her; I took her into the yard, searched her, and found three shillings and two sixpences, some rags a powder like pounce, and two pieces of leather; then I took her again to the Justice, and shewed him the money; she was confounded and could say nothing for herself. Mr. Fielding ordered me to take her into the fore room while he wrote the mittimus. When I had got the mittimus in my hand, I said to her, she must go to goal. An Irishman talked a great deal to her; he told me she would tell me somewhat; so I went with her up in a corner of the room, where she said one

Mr. Fielding granted a warrant against Johnson; we found she lodged at the corner of Russel-street, Drury-lane,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175110160023"/> at a chandler's shop. I went there and searched the room, where I found a little more powder and a King Charles's farthing. Johnson was not there; we took her up at a cook's shop in Drury-lane and carried her to Justice Fielding on the 31st of July. Then M'Carty was in the office; she said, that is the woman that was concerned with me; there they accused each other; M'Carty accused Johnson with passing two shillings to a pawnbroker. The pawnbroker was sent for; his name is Rotchford ; he came and brought two had shillings. He was asked who put them off to him; he said Johnson did. When I carried M'Carty to the Gatehouse the first day, she said in the coach, she had filed the money but once, and not doing it well she did it no more; but Johnson did that, and she used to whiten them; that they made them of counters or halfpence.</p>

            , a pawnbroker in Bridges-street, Covent Garden. The prisoner ( Johnson ) has been a customer there several times; on the 19th of Nov. last she brought three handkerchiefs to pawn for 1 s. 6 d. on the 24th she brought a shift for 1 s. 6 d. on the same night she came for them both; she laid down 1 s. 6 d. and a penny for the shift : the shilling was a bad one. Then I was going to deliver the handkerchief. She laid down one shilling and sixpence, and a penny more; that shilling also was bad. When I told her they were bad, she said she had good money in her pocket, and gave me two good shillings. I likewise kept the two bad ones. I shewed them to my master, who ordered me to go and get a constable; she then ran out at the door, and I never saw her again till she was before Justice Fielding. There she said M'Carty gave her them to put off, and that M'Carty stood at our door at that time.</p>

               <p>Simpson. I was within five yards of him; it was moon light as bright as day. After that he came on board, and laid the tarpawling even. I got out of my lighter head, and said here is a sack of malt gone, adding, I saw you take it out of our lighter; he replied, Then you may take it out of my barge again. Then he swore he would turn the lighter adrift ; upon which I called a sculler, went over the water, and acquainted my master. When my master came, he had put it in its place,</p>

            . I employed Mr. Wilmote, a master-plaisterer, who sent the prisoner to do some white-washing in my house. After he was gone I missed several things, which before were locked up in the drawers, and found the drawers open.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any body worked with him?</p>
               <p>Tompson. I cannot say I saw any body else but the prisoner, and a boy to attend him. When I came to enquire the prisoner's character, it gave me more ground for suspicion. I took out a search-warrant, and the constable and I went and searched his house, but found nothing. Upon hearing he was seen with a ring on his finger, described like that I lost, I took him up.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose?</p>
               <p>Tompson. I lost a ring with seven rose diamonds, a silver snuff-box, a tortoise-shell snuff-box, some Brussels lace, and a small silver porringer.</p>

               <p>Tompson. My wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it locked when the prisoner came to work?</p>

               <p>Q. What family have you?</p>

               <p>Q. How many rooms had you white-washed?</p>
               <p>Tompson. There were two more rooms beside the room where the things were. He did them all three.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not the rooms left open for him to have access from one to the other upon occasion?</p>
               <p>Tompson. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. When were they finished ?</p>
               <p>Tompson. They were finished the twenty-ninth of August.</p>

             were seven diamonds of middling water roses. On the 28th I went to my drawers, took up the shagreen case in which my ring was put, and shook it; it rattled. I had my child stood by me; he had been at sea; he asked me what it was; I said a ring.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open the case?</p>
               <p>M. Tompson. I did not; but it was a case for only a single ring; and as I shook it, I heard it plain. I missed it the second of September. To the best of my knowledge I locked the drawers, but I will not swear that. The prisoner was at work during the time I had the ring upon my finger, and after I put it in the drawer.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know your ring was not gone at that time you say something rattled?</p>
               <p>M. Tompson. At that time I had the case, but when I missed the ring, I missed the case likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. What water were the diamonds?</p>
               <p>M. Tompson. They were rather of a yellowish cast, not a clear water.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a judge of that ?</p>
               <p>M. Tompson. I was brought up in the business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see this ring since?</p>
               <p>M. Tompson. No, Sir, I have not.</p>

               <p>M. Tompson. We keep Will's Coffee-house in Cornhill.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your servants access to these rooms, during the time of white-washing?</p>
               <p>M. Tompson. Yes, Sir, they had.</p>
               <p>Q. What room were the goods in?</p>
               <p>M. Tompson. It was a one pair of stairs room.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner a labourer to assist him?</p>
               <p>M. Tompson. I believe he had, but I don't think he was ever in that room, for it wanted no scraping, nor no mortar. I believe there was none but the boy attended him in that room.</p>

            . I am of the same trade the prisoner is of. On Sunday, the first of September, the prisoner came to the Coach and Horses at the lower end of St. Martin's Lane, and asked me if I would drink; he called for a pint of beer, and we sat down together. He had a ring on his finger, which I supposed then to be a diamond ring. I never saw a ring on his finger before.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe it.</p>
               <p>Benson. There was one stone in the middle, one of each side, and two between of each side, being seven in all; but the middle stone was the largest. It was a very handsome ring. In the afternoon Mr. Kite and I took a walk. When we got into Duke-street, at the Bricklayers Arms, we saw the prisoner and his wife coming along; we called him in, he came, and we drank three or four full pots of beer together, which Mr. Kite paid for; then the prisoner and I called for an eighteen penny tiff of punch, which we paid betwixt us; there I saw the ring again several times. The prisoner was taken on Saturday the seventh at the pay-table; he said he could produce the ring he had on that Sunday; he produced one, but it looked as much like it, as this candlestick is like the ring, (pointing to a brass candlestick.) There were three stones on it, and so black, I don't know what metal it was. The prosecutor asked me if it was the same ring, I said it was not.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examined.</p>
               <p>Q. How near did you sit to the prisoner at the alehouse?</p>
               <p>Benson. We were so near to each other, that we touched one another.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175110160026"/>Q. Which finger was the ring on?</p>
               <p>Benson. It was on his right hand little finger. I saw it when he went to light his pipe, or take hold on the mug.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you how many stones there were?</p>
               <p>Benson. I never was told at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you and he any quarrel?</p>
               <p>Benson. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to the prisoner about the ring ?</p>
               <p>Benson. No, I did not. Mr. Kite and I talked about it after, but not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the ring you saw afterwards was not the ring you saw on the prisoner's finger?</p>
               <p>Benson. I am sure it was not; it was not like it.</p>

             on the first of September in the morning; I did not drink with them, being too soon in the morning for me. I did not see the ring in my house. I took a walk, and about three o'clock the same day I was in company with him and Benson at the Bricklayers Arms in Duke-street, Grosvenor-square. We had four tankards of beer, and I paid a shilling for them; then they two called for eighteen pennyworth of punch. I there saw a very handsome ring on the prisoner's right hand finger. I could swear to the make of the ring: there was a large stone in the middle, two at the ends drawed into a point, and two on each side. I have not seen such a one these twenty years; it was a seven stone ring, and there was a great deal of lustre.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you in company with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Kite. About three hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a diamond ring?</p>
               <p>Kite. I have seen a great many diamond rings, it looked like a diamond ring.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Kite. He is sometimes a master-plaisterer, and sometimes a journeyman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever observe he had a ring on before?</p>
               <p>Kite. No, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examined.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it you did not see this fine ring in the morning?</p>
               <p>Kite. I did not sit down with them then.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it, you or Benson, that spoke first about the ring?</p>
               <p>Kite. It was me that first spoke to Benson about it.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you the prisoner when in Duke-street?</p>
               <p>Kite. I was within a yard of him three hours.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it you did not ask him concerning it?</p>
               <p>Kite. Because it would have been a piece of ill manners.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Tompson. What sort of make was the ring you lost?</p>
               <p>M. Tompson. It was old fashion make, some may call it a fancy ring, it was set a little odd; it had seven diamonds ; the middle one not very large, five on the shank; and two opposite. The diamonds are roses, but not set like a rose.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had it been set?</p>
               <p>M. Tompson. Fifteen years at least.</p>

We then being near the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175110160028"/> Bank, as one was a Bank-bill, the other from the South-sea house, for 25 l. he told me I might have cash for both at the Bank. I went and received the money, and then came to the prisoner at the alehouse, where I told him I had received it.

I sent her up for it, and she staid a little longer than ordinary; so I went up, and was then in the bed chamber, and had the money in a child's stocking. I asked her for what money I wanted, which was 7 l. 14 s. she gave it me, and put the other up; it was all gold in the stocking, the silver was in a news-paper, both which she put into a chest of drawers, I saw her. We both came down stairs between seven and eight o'clock, and I paid the man the bill. The next morning I told my wife I wanted some more money; she said it was in the drawer; so I went up with the keys, and found the drawer open, the upper part whereof was broke; I told my wife, who said she locked the drawer.

I was at Gosport at the time the horse was lost; it was a cart horse<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175110160029"/> worth 6 l. or upwards; he is now at the White Lion at Islington; I have seen him there. I went to the prisoner in Bridewell, who told me he never did such a thing before, and that he was out of his senses. I had trusted him with my horses and other things; he never wronged me before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pullin. I met a man that had but an indifferent character with the prisoner, who was leading this horse; the other man asked me if I would buy the horse; said I, what do you ask for him? the prisoner said, seven guineas. I saw the horse had but two shoes; I bid him three, if he could find me a sufficient voucher; he said the horse was his own; I gave him sixpence earnest: then I said, I will not deceive you, I believe the horse to be stolen, and if you have more in your gang tell the truth, and I'll be favourable to you; he said he came honestly by the horse. I delivered the horse to the hostler (this was at Islington) and went to Justice Chamberlain with the prisoner; he seemed to be an ignorant fellow; we got him some victuals and drink. I believe he was half starved, he had but a halfpenny in his pocket; then he said he took the horse out of Mr. Thomas's field himself; that his master owed him some money, and that he did it for want, saying, sometimes his master would pay him two shillings, but never pay him all that was due, and what he took would hardly keep him alive.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a horse was it?</p>
               <p>Pullin. It was a black gelding, with a star in his forehead. He is now at the White Lion.</p>
               <p>Q. to Thomas. Is your horse which you lost such as this witness describes?</p>
               <p>Thomas. He is.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you owe the prisoner any thing?</p>
               <p>Thomas. To the best of my knowledge, I do not owe him one farthing; as to making any particular reckoning I could not, he owed too many little scores up and down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was ignorant of what I did.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Is he out of his senses at time?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. To me he appears as if he was.</p>

The first was Clayton, who called himself a butcher, and said he lived in Hanover-yard. He deposed, that Dixon was his journeyman in the year 46; that he came in June, and continued with him ten months successively, and never lay out of his house a night in that time. The other evidence was the prisoner at the bar, who deposed he knew Dixon in the year 46; that he was Clayton's journeyman; that he had used to buy his meat of Clayton, and that Dixon was the man that used to bring it home; that he used to give him a dram, and talk with him about shooting; that this was about Midsummer; that he went that year to Sturbridge fair, and also to Bristol fair, and would fain have taken Clayton with him to the last mentioned place; that after his return from Bristol, which was on the 27th of July, he went to collect his rents, where he had estates, in Northamptonshire, Warwickshire, and Buckinghamshire ; that he had at that time a mind to have taken Dixon with him, to have been his game-keeper; that Dixon was at Clayton's when he set out; and that when he returned, which was about six weeks after, he was gone.</p>

            ?</p>
               <p>Lion. No, Sir, it is not. His business was so low, that he might have done twice as much business himself, if he had had it. I used to trade with him when his meat was good, he being a neighbour. In the year 47 I moved over against him, and I could from my house have seen every thing done in his shop. If there had been a man I am positive I must have seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain he had no servant in the year 46?</p>
               <p>Lion. I am positive he had none. I was often at his door, and often in his shop, perhaps two or three times a day.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examined.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to six upon the year 46?</p>
               <p>Lion. I say the same of all the time he lived in Hanover-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he come there?</p>
               <p>Lion. I believe he entered upon the house seven years ago last Michaelmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Dare you venture to swear he had no servants abroad?</p>
               <p>Lion. I can venture to swear he had none at home; if he had one abroad, they must also buy their meat abroad, or I should have known of him, had he come for it there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there an old man, named Major, used to carry out meat for him?</p>
               <p>Lion. Perhaps there was, for a dram or a half-penny, but no hired servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he used to use your house?</p>
               <p>Lion. As my house is opposite to his, he used to come in and smoke a pipe, and observe his shop, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Then you seem to have had a great opinion of him?</p>
               <p>Lion. No, I cannot say I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know one Dixon?</p>
               <p>Lion. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Might he have employed one Dixon abroad, and you not know him?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175110160031"/>Lion. I can't answer for what is done out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Have Clayton and you ever quarrelled?</p>
               <p>Lion. No, never; but having heard that he had stole a pint mug at Wapping, and two silver falts, whenever he came into my house to light a pipe, which perhaps might be six or seven times a day, I used to follow him, fearing he should steal something.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lion. I live at the King's Arms in Hanover-yard. The other evidence is my husband. I know Clayton; he lived next door to us, when he first came there. He has lived there about seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his living there in 46?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lion. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you remember it by?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lion. Because of our removing in 47. He had neither man nor maid as a yearly servant in his house the time he lived there; if he had had either, I am positive I should have seen them. He had not business sufficient to keep a man; he was not very well liked in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Are his wife, son and daughter living?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lion. They are all three.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been often in his shop?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lion. I used to go for meat, and to carry in beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he never a man for a single day?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lion. I cannot say for a single day.</p>
               <p>Q. Might he not have a man for two days, and you not know of it?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lion. I cannot say for that.</p>
               <p>Q. Might he not for four days?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lion. I cannot tell, but if he had, I think I should have seen him sometime or other. Had he had one to lie in his house for two days, I believe I should have known it.</p>

            . I am a distiller, and live in Oxford-road, five doors from Hanover-yard. I know Clayton; I dealt with him frequently in the year 46; he or his son would come and shew what pretty meat they had; he was dextrous in forcing people to buy of him. I was one of the Middlesex jury in July last, when Dixon was tried. I remember when he was brought to the bar, which I think was on the Wednesday, he petitioned the Court to put off his trial, pleading his witnesses were not here. Upon that he was asked what were his evidences names; he said one was Clayton, a butcher in Hanover-yard, and the other Mr. Payce, a coal-merchant. When Clayton came, he said the prisoner had lived with him ten months. I looked upon him, and was surprised I could not know the man. I go through the yard perhaps a dozen times in a week, and had I known there had been any likelihood of a truth in what they swore, I should never have agreed to brought Dixon in guilty; but I could not believe either of them. My meat was always brought home by himself, his boy, or girl, but I do not remember any maid or man-servant he had. I have since enquired in the neighbourhood, and cannot find any neighbour that knows he ever had a servant.</p>

            . In the year 46 I lived in Hanover-yard. I am a linen-draper. Clayton lived almost opposite my house, so near, that I could see from behind my counter who went in and came out of his shop. I have dealt with him a little, and I never saw or heard he had a servant. He used to kill now and then a sheep, but a good family would have destroyed all the meat he ever had in his shop at one time; he never had enough to employ himself to hawk about; he has once or twice, since I knew him, killed a bullock. I am sensible he had no servant lived with him in 46; I have been in his shop, and he in mine; I have bid him go out often; he was a very impudent fellow.</p>

            . I lived in Hanover-yard in 46. I am a cheesemonger. I knew Clayton when he first came into the yard, which is about six years ago. I live within two doors of him, but I do not remember he ever kept a servant since he came there. I have been in his shop perhaps once or twice a week. I have bought meat of him. I have seen him have a man for a dram, or a halfpenny, to carry out a joint. He never had much business. There was an old man with him about a twelvemonth ago; Clayton's daughter has come to our house to beg straw for him to lie upon, but he could be no hired servant; though in 46 there was no such.</p>

            . I am a tallow-chandler, and live in Tottenham-court Road, within two doors of the corner of Hanover-yard, and did in the year 46, and some years before. I knew Clayton when he came there, which is upwards of six years ago; I have dealt with him, but not for a certainty. He carried on but a very little business. I never observed he had a servant; his son and daughter, and sometimes himself, carried out his meat; for they could carry out all he dressed, and three times as much. I am positive if he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175110160032"/> had a servant, I must have known it; for he was a bragging stumping man; and if he had kept a man he would have had it up often enough. I have been in his shop perhaps two or three times a day, and never saw such a person.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he never had a servant for a week or a fortnight?</p>

               <p>Q. Are you certain he never had a servant?</p>

            . I did not know Dixon by name. I knew Clayton in Hanover-yard. I live in St. James's Market, in Market-lane. The first of my acquaintance with Mr. Payce was about nine years ago; through him I got acquainted with Clayton. I bought a lot of meat of Clayton in the year 46; I was not at his shop, I bought it over a mug of beer, and I remember a fellow's bringing it home. I never saw him after till the day of execution, when I took one of them to be the person that was Clayton's man at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live when he brought you the meat?</p>
               <p>Here. I lived in Tothill-street, Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Here. I think it was some little time before the Lords Balmerino and Kilmarnock were beheaded. I was a grocer at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you follow now?</p>
               <p>Here. I am of no business at present. I have an annuity by right of my wife of 16 l. a year, and I have some little matter left. I cannot say but what I did fail, and compounded with my creditors. I used frequently to see Payce at sales. When I was first acquainted with him he lived in St. Martin's Lane, where he kept a tea-warehouse, and sold stockings; after that he removed to St. Giles's High-street; then he moved into Hanover-yard ; and from thence to Duke-street, Grosvenor-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever deal with Clayton after this?</p>
               <p>Here. No, the meat I bought was not good.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at home when it was brought?</p>
               <p>Here. I was, and then I saw the man, whom I imagined to be the man that was executed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe him to be the man?</p>
               <p>Here. Indeed I really do believe he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the man that brought your next lot of meat home after this?</p>
               <p>Here. I cannot say so particularly to that, because I have dealt with several of my neighbours.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought home your lot of meat last Wednesday was sevennight?</p>
               <p>Here. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought it home on Thursday last ?</p>
               <p>Here. Sometimes I bring it home, sometimes my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought the candles home on Thursday?</p>
               <p>Here. No body brings any thing of that kind, but the baker bread, and a man my coals.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any bread of the baker last Wednesday?</p>
               <p>Here. I cannot tell. I was subpoena'd upon the trial.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from Tothill-street to Hanover-yard ?</p>
               <p>Here. They are about a mile distance.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the man's name that brought the meat home?</p>
               <p>Here. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a man was he?</p>
               <p>Here. He was a country looking man, not so tall as myself.</p>
               <p>[The court was of opinion Dixon was the tallest.]</p>
               <p>Q. What meat did you buy at that time?</p>
               <p>Here. There was a buttock of beef, a roasting piece, and a thick flank ; it came to 26 or 27 shillings; I paid for it in halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pick out this man going to be executed, or was you told which was Dixon?</p>
               <p>Here. Several people told me it was Dixon.</p>

The man he employed was a country looking, short punched person, about my height, and about thirty years of age. [Note, About the whole head shorter than Dixon.]</p>

               <p>Q. What is the prisoner's general character?</p>
               <p>Crooks. I have no business with peoples characters.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what you have heard as to his general character.</p>
               <p>Crooks. I cannot say I ever heard any ill character of him. He has had goods of mine several times, and has always discharged himself with a great deal of honour.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he a good or a bad character?</p>
               <p>Crooks. I cannot say I have heard a bad one. I have heard people speak very indifferently of him, but I am not to believe all that is said.</p>
               <p>Cross Examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard that he has a bad character?</p>
               <p>Crooks. I cannot say as to that, I have not had sufficient proofs.</p>
               <p>Q. Speak out, have you, or have you not?</p>
               <p>Crooks. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell the truth, you are upon your oath.</p>
               <p>Crooks. There is not a person in the world that has every body's good word, I can say no farther, you'll be so good as to excuse me.</p>

               <p>The counsel for the crown had seven persons of credit to discredit the prisoner's; but not being willing to give the court any farther trouble, they were not called.</p>
               <p>Q. to Payne. How old is Clayton's son ?</p>
               <p>Payne. He is about 15 years of age, not quite so tall as the evidence Sells, nor so thick. In the year 1746 may be he could kill a sheep or a lamb.</p>
               <p>The evidence Here says the man he took to be Dixon was not so tall as he, but in my opinion he was taller.</p>

Mr. Spencer came to my house that day and told me he had some brass that he had stopped, brought by my maid; he brought it to me; there were two pounds and a quarter of it.

            . I live at Mr. Spencer's at the Seven Stars, Fleet Ditch, he is a brasier. Mr. Midwinter lives in Shoe-lane at the Five Bells. The prisoner came three times to my master's shop with brass; the second time my master saw it, and said he suspected she did not come honestly by the brass; the third time I told my master the same woman was come again. He is shewn the brass, and deposes it is what he bought of the prisoner. I cannot tell the day she brought it; I believe it is about a fortnight ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did she say it belonged to?</p>
               <p>Garret. She said it was her own.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give per pound?</p>
               <p>Garret. I gave her after the rate of sixpence per pound. I was with her before the alderman; the brass was laid upon the table before her; she owned she took it, and that she was out of her senses at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she seem to be out of her senses?</p>
               <p>Garret. No, my lord, she did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner at the bar you bought the brass of?</p>
               <p>Garret. I went to Mr. Midwinter's house to see if I knew her; she was melting butter; she ran her head up the chimney because I should not see her face; she knew me, and I knew her.</p>
