               <p>The prisoner came to my house on the 21st of May, and hired a horse and chaise, for two or three days; at the end of the three days she came and paid me for the hire of them, and said I should have the horse home that evening, but that she should want the chaise for some time longer. She ordered me to send my man down to the house for the horse that evening and he should have it. I accordingly sent, but the horse was not come home. The prisoner pretended<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150003"/> she had left it in the country. I did not see the horse till some time after. The prisoner came up to me the next day, and said her servant was bad in the country and could not bring the horse to town; and she pretended she should want the horse a day or two longer.</p>
               <p>Did you consent to her having it a day or two longer? - I did. This was on the Friday, on the Saturday I went to enquire after the horse and chaise, it looking very suspicious that it did not come home. I heard that the chaise and horse were parted with. I got a warrant and took her before Justice Cox who committed her.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say? - She said she had disposed of it. We found the chaise in St. Martin's lane, at Mr. Aldridge's.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was it when she first hired it? - Monday the last day of May.</p>

               <p>Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes; she brought a chaise to me on Monday the last day of May. She asked me to lend her some money upon it; I said I did not choose to do any such thing, but if she would fell the chaise and harness cheap I would buy it, as I wanted one for my own use; she said she would rather I should lend her some money upon it; I told her I did not choose to do any such thing. She asked me to buy the horse; I said I did not want one. At last she concluded to sell the chaise, and asked sixteen guineas for it; I offered her twelve; she said she was in such great distress that she was obliged to take it, for she should be ruined if she had not the money the next day, and she said she would in a day or two give me two or three guineas for my bargain; I told her I did not buy it with an intention to sell it again, and I would not sell it. I said if I buy it, I buy it, and will pay you for it. I gave her the money.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. Did you see the chaise afterwards in the custody of this witness? - I did; it was my chaise.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, This is an indictment against the prisoner for horse-stealing. I have conferred with my brothers, and we are all of opinion that under the circumstances of this case, this does not amount, in point of law, to a felony, therefore you will acquit the prisoner.</p>

When I had walked about fifty or sixty yards from them, I was seised by a man and four or five women; I struggled to get away, upon which the man struck me two blows with a stick upon my legs, which lamed me; my right leg is not well yet; the man then seised me and pinioned my arms, and held me against the wall, and the women supported him on each side. I cried out loud thieves! several times; the prisoner Creamer seised me by the collar with one hand, and struck me two or three times in the face with the other; she said if I made any more noise she would see my liver, while I was thus pinioned, one of the women put her hand into my right-hand breeches pocket, and from thence took two guineas and nine shillings. Others of them,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150004"/> but which I cannot pretend to say, put their hands into my coat pocket and took out a handkerchief, a three-foot rule, and a pocket-book; then they took off my hat and wig, and dispersed. I saw Creamer (to whom I positively swear) go over the way to the sign of the Sun and Sword; I went over and begged her to give me my hat and wig. She made use of very vile expressions, and told me I must go to the thieves who robbed me. I look upon it Creamer had the hat and wig, but I cannot swear to that; I went on some little way but came back. When I saw her go into the house, I knocked at the door and begged for my hat and wig; she again answered me in the same manner without opening the door. I then told her I would spare no pains to find her on the morrow. The night of the same day I found out one Israels, an officer, to whom I told the story, and he took up some of the prisoners (I believe) that night; he told me to come the next morning; I accordingly went at about nine o'clock the next morning, which was the Monday, and he had then got all the prisoners in custody.</p>

             is the person who struck me on the legs, but I will not swear to him.</p>
               <p>How came you out so late? - I am foreman to Mr. Burne, a sail-maker, in Wapping. I had not paid the men on Saturday night till it was very late, and then I staid a a little longer with a friend, at the same house where I paid the men, which was a publick-house, the sign of the Globe, in Globe-yard.</p>
               <p>How far is that from the place where you was robbed? - About a quarter or half a mile.</p>
               <p>Was you at all intoxicated with liquor? - I was not hurt with liquor at all, I perfectly remember every thing that was done.</p>
               <p>How far had you to go home? - I have a house over the water; it was too late to get a boat, I was going to walk round over the bridge, which I generally do when I am too late to get a boat.</p>
               <p>From Creamer. Whether you had not a woman in company with you? - I had no one in company with me.</p>
               <p>Did you know the two women you spoke to at the corner? - I did not; they did not follow me as I know of; I never was in the place before; we were burnt out, and that made this the nearest way.</p>

I can swear to them and a fine white holland gown. I had a suspicion of her sister, and took the constable to her sister's. We found a number of things there in a box. The prisoner acknowledged that the things found at her sister's were my property; there was a gown and some caps that were cut out of a tambour cloak.</p>

I followed him into this farm; he ran in among some hay; I ran after him; there he struck me with the stick that he had in his hand; I doff'd my shoe and struck him with the heel; a battle ensued, and I believe I should have mastered him, if it had not been for a dog that frightened me away; I then went out to the turnpikeman and told him my story; I then came back with the watchmen and they found the prisoner; they took him to the watch-house; we found the purse and the sixpence that was left in it, upon him; the three shillings were not there. It was a moon-light night; I am sure he is the man that robbed me; there was a man and woman close to us at the time that he kept me in the road talking. I tried to get away from him, but he would not let me; the man and woman who were there at the time he was talking with me went on; he had been with me half an hour before they passed me; I do not mean to charge him with taking the bundle, I only lost it in the scuffle.</p>

               <p>I am a serjeant of the watch. On a Sunday, which was the 6th or 7th of June at about twelve at night, I saw this girl (the prosecutrix) standing with one of the watchmen at his box, the watchman told me that she had informed him of her being robbed, and that he had desired she would continue with him till I came round to acquaint me with the matter. She informed me of the affair; she told me whereabouts it was at the farm-house. I took two or three of the men with me; she said he had taken a purse from her with three shillings and sixpence in money, and she had lost a bundle; she said she followed him into the farm yard, and she was sure he was gone into some of the out-houses; I went into the out-houses; we searched round with a lantern, but could not find him; there was a hay-stack on the outside of the yard almost finished, I searched round it, and we found two men, and pulled them out. We asked the girl if either of them was the man; she said no. We had almost given it up, when one of the men turning the hay from the bottom of the rick found the prisoner lying there; we pulled him out; as soon as the girl came up to him she said that is the lad that robbed me; I said be particular in what you are doing, if you swear to him you will take his life away; she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150007"/> came round again and said that is the lad, I will swear to him by his eyes; she said if you search him you will find my purse and money. I searched him and found this purse (producing it) in his pocket with a little bit of white worsted, and a bit of white thread, as she had described before we found it, and one sixpence in it.</p>

I saw this purse found upon him. The girl challenged him as the person, and she told us before we went there that she had torn a little bit of his coat off, and we found a bit had been torn out of the slap of his coat.</p>

The prisoner passed me. I was in a whiskey. He headed my horse, and rode up before me. They had each a pistol. Then the other stopped me, and the prisoner demanded my money. I delivered my watch, which was a gold one in a single case, to the prisoner, and half a guinea and an half crown in money.</p>
               <p>Was it light? - It wanted about a quarter of eight I believe: he had a white handkerchief tied under his chin, with an intention to disguise himself.</p>
               <p>Was he dressed as he is now? - He appeared to be dressed in dark clothes; his face looked remarkably pale and white. He was close to me during the time. He had white nankeen breeches on.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body upon the road at that time? - I saw carriages behind me; the next carriage behind me, I imagine, saw me stopped, for they attempted to stop the carriage, but it drove on. The prisoner's hat appeared to be slapped over his face.</p>
               <p>How long might they stay with you? - They appeared to be in a great hurry; they begged I would make no delay, but deliver my money immediately.</p>
               <p>Do you undertake positively to swear that the prisoner was the person? - I do swear positively to his person.</p>

               <p>On the second of September, a little after eight in the evening, the prisoner was brought into a publick-house, close to Battersea-bridge, on the Surry side, by five or six people. He had had a violent fall from his horse, and was then insensible. When he was brought in, after setting him in a chair, and examining to see if he had any bone broke, he came to himself. One Dover said to him, I have got your watch, Sir. He made for answer, I had no watch. Do you wear a watch in general? Yes. What kind of watch is your's when you wear a watch? A silver one. He was then asked where he lived. He said his name was Lake, that he was a taylor, No. 23, Goodge-street, Tottenham-court-road. Nothing further passed then. Another person came in, and said Jem how do you do? Mr. Lake made no reply to him, but the person that accosted him said we have had a damned sober ride to Kew to day I think. The person who then came in went to the door to go about his business; he said; you had better stay here all night Jem, you will be taken proper care of, and I will be with you in the morning. As<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150009"/> Mr. Lake appeared to me to be much in liquor, and stunned with the blow he got by the fall; he went out of the yard, and sell as he went to the gate, where they take the toll. He staid there some time. I believe he did not know which way he was going. He asked if somebody would go home with him; he had before said where he lived, and offered any body two shillings to go home with him.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - About a quarter after eight. He went away, and I went about my business.</p>
               <p>You have no doubt that this is the person? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am the person that gave him the horse, and that direction.</p>
               <p>Did he go away on horseback? - No; on foot. I sent the horse to the Black Raven inn at Battersea, in order to be taken proper care of.</p>
               <p>Did he desire you to send it there? - No; a Mr. Ivey, who is clerk of the bridge, desired me to have the horse taken care of, and I sent my servant with it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was he so much in liquor that he could not go home on horseback, or was it from his hurt? - He appeared much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Jury. How long after he came to himself did he deny the watch? - Almost immediately; for the man told him that he had found his watch.</p>
               <p>Court. How far is this from Nine Elms turnpike? - Better than two miles.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner.</p>
               <p>He immediately denied the watch, and then told you his name was Lake? - Yes; he did.</p>
               <p>Is that his name? - I believe it is.</p>
               <p>And did he live in Goodge-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And he said that without any kind of hesitation at all? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. He does live in Goodge-street? - I know no more than what I heard at Sir

On the evening the robbery was committed, at a little after eight o'clock, two horse came over the bridge, bridled and saddled, without riders. I think they were both bay horses. The first ran through the gate very fast; the man could not stop it. I seized hold of the bridle of the second, and secured it.</p>
               <p>Did you observe what size the horses were? - The horse I secured was rather tall; the other horse was not so tall. In a few minutes after this happened, by what light there was, I could see some people collected together upon the bridge. I went up; there was a person thrown from his horse, who was very much hurt; he was by several people carried off the bridge to Mr. Munday's.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner that person? - Yes; in about an hour afterwards another person came to demand the horse that was secured. I refused him the horse, not being certain it was his. I made some doubt of it. He told me I might be satisfied that the horse came from Westminster-bridge. I asked him what company he was in? He said none at all, he was by himself. I asked him how his horse came without him? He said his horse threw him at the foot of the bridge. I remarked the oddness of two people being thrown so near together, one at the foot of the bridge, the other on the Battersea side, about the middle.</p>
               <p>This horse that you secured was the horse that afterwards was sent home to the last witness? - Yes; when I told him the other person was thrown, and appeared to be very much hurt, and that he was at Mr. Munday's, he said, I will go and see him. He went in. I went in presently afterwards. He made some jocular speech to the prisoner. He said, Jemmy, we have had a sober ride, or something to that purpose. Presently afterwards he advised him to stay there all night to be taken care of. Soon afterwards he disappeared, and I saw no more of him. The prisoner, when he came out from Mr. Munday's, stopped some time at the gate. Some questions were asked him concerning the watch. He said he had no watch about him; the watch that was produced and shown him he said was not his. He offered any person two shillings to go home with him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150011"/> and mentioned his name and the place where he lived. He said his name was Lake; that he was a taylor, and lived in Goodge-street.</p>
               <p>Court. You said the other horse ran through the gate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it ever stopped? - I never heard any thing of that horse.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>The fact is two people were thrown off upon the bridge that evening; - Yes; the horses came within two minutes of each other without their ri ders.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was at the apprehending of the prisoner. I went to search his lodging, in Goodge-street, Tottenham-court-road; I believe it is No. 23. I brought these nankeen breeches and waistcoat, and a pair of boots, up to the office.</p>
               <p>When did you search his lodging? - The robbery was committed on the Thursday, this was on the Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He took a white cambrick handkerchief out of my pocket which I wrapped my hand up with.</p>
               <p>Jealous. That was taken out of his pocket by my partner; he is not here; I expect him every minute.</p>
               <p>To Wheatley. Was it a white handkerchief that was tied under his chin? - It was.</p>

               <p>You found him at his lodgings on the Saturday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He had not left his lodgings then? - No; I found him in bed.</p>
               <p>What business is he? - A taylor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This gentleman said I could not be contented, after I had robbed the gentleman, but I must leave my boots, spurs, and pistol upon the bridge; my wife said no, I had not done that, for they were in my lodging.</p>
               <p>To Wheatley. Was you long enough with these people, when they robbed you, to observe whether they were drunk or sober? - I think they were much in liquor.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>

               <p>I am a painter. I have known Lake four years; he is a taylor. I never heard any thing dishonest of him in my life. He was four years with a father-in-law of mine before I was acquainted with him. I never heard the least stain on his character in my life.</p>

               <p>I am a butcher in Goodge-street. He lodged with me near six years. He lodged two months next door, before he came to me. I always looked upon him as an honest young fellow; he seemed willing to get any work, and always did it out of hand.</p>
               <p>Has he any family? - A wife and child.</p>
               <p>What hours did he keep? - Very good hours, and generally came in sober.</p>

               <p>Did both the prisoners lodge in that room? - No, only the woman; Coleman had a place in the Custom-house. Isabella Prosper informed me he visited this woman. Having secured the property, I went after Robinson; Coleman hearing of it, in the mean time had surrendered himself.</p>

               <p>You discharged Robinson six weeks before she was taken up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You cannot form any judgement when they were in your house? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Might they not have been fairly sold? - They might.</p>
               <p>You cannot swear they were not sold? - No.</p>
               <p>When did you miss the things? - I did not miss them. They could not have been gone above a month or six weeks, for I had not had them longer.</p>
               <p>You say she made a confession before the magistrate; what was said to induce her to make that confession? - The alderman asked her what she had to say; she said she took them.</p>
               <p>Was there no promise made to induce her to confess? - None.</p>
               <p>You say Coleman has a place in the custom-house? - Yes, he has.</p>
               <p>When he got that place I believe you gave him a character? - I did.</p>
               <p>When was it he got that place? - About a fortnight before I discharged him.</p>

I came from the White Horse about half after eleven o'clock; I made what haste I could home; going by Leadenhall-market, the prisoner, Kingsland came from one of the archways and laid hold of my arm, and asked me to give her something to drink; she said she had not had any thing all day; I said go along with you, you b - h!

I had six guineas. I clapped my hand on my thigh, and saved two guineas out of the six, I lost four; they ran away immediately. They were taken afterwards separately. When Kingsland was taken she offered me fifteen shillings, and said that was all that was left; but I did not take it as I did not know how to act.</p>

               <p>We met him by Leadenhall-market; he asked us to drink some gin we told him we did not drink gin, if we had any thing we would have anniseed. There were four of us; he gave us half a pint, and we went out and went away, and I saw no more of him till he came to my lodging the next morning. I had eighteen shilling's which I had in change of a guinea. I never saw his money; he asked if I had any more; I told him I had left two guineas with Mr. Jones, a publican; he said he had lost four guineas, and if I did not give him the money he would send me to Newgate; he went to the publican and gave him a note not to hurt us if he would give him the two guineas.</p>

Then they threw me down with violence and took two guineas from me; they said if I made any noise they would take my life. The prisoner is the person that took the money out of my pocket; I laid hold of her hand and desired her to give me my money; she said I ought to be killed because I said I had no money; they then opened the door and bid me get about my business, they had none of my money; and they ran away; a person ran after the prisoner and brought her back to me.</p>

            , an impressed man. They said that Hughes was so drunk, refractory, and troublesome, that for their own security they were obliged to lock him up. Observing a wig on the table, I asked who that belonged to; an answer was made, (I believe by the warden) that it belonged to the drunken fellow who was locked up. I said the man might get cold by being without his wig, and I ordered the warden to carry it to him; I said let me look at him; we went to the door, the warden unlocked it, and I saw the deceased lying on the floor on his back, the upper part of his shoulder was leaning against the end of the watch-house, his coat and waistcoat were pulled all over his head, his shirt was pulled up, his waistcoat was pulled backwards and yet there was not any of the buttons unbuttoned. Not supposing the man was dead, I ordered the warden to lift him up. A friend of mine who was with me laid hold of his hand and said the man is dead; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150017"/> felt his hand, and his fingers were quite cold. I sent for a surgeon; he rubbed the body with salt, and used every means without effect, for the man was dead.</p>

               <p>On Tuesday evening, the third of August, I went to Mr. Emmerson's house to meet with a person I wanted to see. A neighbour of mine was sitting there. I staid with him better than an hour. Mr. Hind, one of the king's messengers, came in, and called for the Gazette. I stopped to read it. While we were reading it Mrs. Emmerson opened the parlour door and said, Mr. Emmerson here is a person has called for a pot of beer, and will not pay for it. Mr. Emmerson went out immediately, and was gone some time. After he was gone out, I heard a scuffle in the passage. I went out of the parlour immediately, and found Mr. Hughes and Mr. Emmerson together; I believe they had hold of each other's collar. In going towards the back part of the house there is a step near the end of the passage. Hughes fell off the step; I rather think he slipped off. Emmerson said, take care, or you will be down the cellar, and catched at him to save him from falling. I should have mentioned that all this time there were words between them both but I cannot particularise what they were. I got in between them to part them, and said, for God's sake, Emmerson, do not strike the man. He said he would not, but it was hard to be cheated out of his property, and be struck with a stick. He opened his breast, and there appeared to be a fresh mark upon it.</p>

               <p>Did the deceased deny having struck him. - I got in between them, and parted them. I endeavoured to persuade the deceased to pay for the beer. His answer was, he had paid for it; that his name was Hughes, and he was a man of substance, and lived in Maiden-lane. Something brought Mr. Emmerson back, but I cannot say what. The deceased then made two blows at him, one of which struck him. Mr. Emmerson immediately laid hold of him, and went to strike him. I catched Emmerson, and said he should not strike him. He said it was hard to be robbed of his property and be struck, and have no satisfaction. I told him all the satisfaction he should have in my presence should be to charge the watch with him. Upon that Mr. Emmerson went away, I supposed to call the watch; he was gone some time; all that time I was endeavouring to persuade the deceased to pay for the beer; he said he had paid for it, and would not pay again. Mr. Emmerson came in, and brought a watchman with him, and gave Mr. Hughes in charge of the watchman. They went out with him. I went into the parlour, and I heard a noise in a passage that goes into Petty France. The watchman then said the man was so obstreperous, that he could not take him himself to the watch-house; he must get more assistance. Just as I came out of Mr. Emmerson's door the deceased was sitting on his breech at the step of the door. As soon as I came out the deceased threw himself upon his back; he afterwards turned upon his right side, and, with his left hand inclining towards the kennel, he then cried out murder several times, when nobody touched him. Mr. Emmerson was just before that going to him, but I kept him back, and said he was quiet enough then. Soon after came two watchmen. I think they lifted him up, and underneath the deceased was a piece of a coat. I believe it was the shortest of the men picked it up, and said here, d - n you, you have torn my coat; but I will make you pay for that. I observed there was a piece of the right side of the watchman's coat torn off. After the man was standing upon his legs the two watchmen, the deceased, and Emmerson, all went away together, and I went home.</p>

I asked what was the matter there. Bell, the watchman, told me they had got a gentleman that had torn the cuffs off his coat, and a piece off the back. Then they went on towards Tothill-street.

               <p>I had been at Wapping, and came home at one o'clock. As I came along Tothill-street I heard a noise. I was afraid of getting into trouble for being out so late. I thought they had got a pressed man, and I ran under the porch of a door to hide myself. I saw them have hold of a man, and a tall man walked sometimes before and sometimes behind the man. I did not know any of them. They had lanterns in their hands. I heard the deceased groan very badly as they came along Tothill-street. The deceased said something to that tall man, I could not distinctly hear what. The tall man replied, D - n you, you rascal, you ought to have one of your arms cut off. Upon that, one of the watchmen, I believe he that had hold of the left side of him, struck him, and said, d - n your sulky eyes, you can walk if you will.</p>

I came, and put my horses up, it was then near one o'clock. I heard some people talking at the end of Tothill-street. I stopped, and heard the voice of a man, saying, what authority have you got to use me in this manner? The answer by some person was, we have got an authority, and we will show you our authority. I then heard murder cried three or four times very loud. I went to my own door, stood upon the steps, and saw four persons in company; three of them had got hold of a man, one under each arm, and the other was holding one of his legs, and the other part was dragging on the ground, and the voice of somebody, as they went along, said take hold of the other leg. They made a bit of a stop before they came into the Abbey church-yard, and I saw no more of them.</p>

In their bustle one of the watchmen was locked up in the lock-up hole; they opened the door, and let him out again. I sat down upon one of the benches; the deceased lay in the corner. Between two and three o'clock I was awaked by Mr. Abington; he bid one of the watchmen unlock the door. When the candle was brought in, the deceased lay up in the corner, with his clothes, waistcoat and all, stripped over his head. One of the beadles said to me lend a hand to lift him up. We tried to lift him up; his head was inclining on one side; his waistcoat was pulled off without unbuttoning; it was slipped up; the buttons were inside, Mr. Abington said he thought the man was dead. A surgeon was sent for. He tried to let him blood, but very trifling came from him. The surgeon ordered him to be stripped, and rubbed with salt, and tobacco fumes to be blowed up his nostrils.

               <p>I am a surgeon. I was called up by the church-wardens to the deceased. The man, when I came there, was to all appearance dead. I found no pulsation; his extremities were very cold and stiff. It appeared to me that he might have been dead some time; but to satisfy my friends I used every means to restore him, but with very little hopes. I was pretty sure he must have been dead some considerable time. After trying a variety of means, I gave it as my opinion he was dead. I took particular observation if I could see any external marks that might<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150020"/> have caused his death. I examined him very attentively, but could find none, except a slight scratch on the fore part of his throat. A mark of something having been very tight about his neck; I judged it to be his shirt-collar. I then went into the watch-house to Mr. Abington, who was enquiring into the manner in which he was brought there, and from the account they gave there of the rough manner in which he had been brought, I got a candle, and returned again into the lock-up place. Mr. Abington went with me. I examined the body again very attentively, but I saw no other appearances upon which I could form an opinion of the occasion of his death, but this scratch upon his throat, which appeared like the mark of a nail in the neck. I then left the watch-house and went home. In the afternoon I was called upon by the coroner to inspect the body. The first appearances which I took notice of were a very large blackness, extending a good way round the neck, and a great deal round the chest; those appearances, I imagine, must have arisen from the putrefaction, and it being exceeding warm weather, and probably in some measure encreased by the pressure of the men's hands round those parts. I am particular in mentioning these circumstances, because, from these appearances, there are prejudices in the neighbourhood very much against the prisoners. I had a gentleman with me, and I opened the body. Upon inspecting the thorax I found that in a very sound state, and the abdomen too. I opened the stomach. I found nothing there but a little undigested fruit, and a very small quantity of blood; but it appeared as if he had been drinking of spirits; there were no appearances that could lead me to suppose any injury had been done to occasion his death in those parts. I then opened his head, and found the vessels of the head remarkably full indeed of serum, and there was water in the ventricles of his brain; the whole brain had just the appearance of a man that had been hanged, which case I once had an opportunity of seeing. From these appearances I was led to suppose that the man had been strangled.</p>
               <p>Suppose he had died of a fit, occasioned by having too much heated his blood by drinking, would there have been the same appearances that you found upon your examination? - There would probably. I should imagine there would have been more appearances of blood upon the brain; there might, I should imagine, have been those appearances if there had been any pressure upon the brain.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>I understood you, that when you first inspected the body you observed nothing that could lead you to say decidedly what was the occasion of the deceased's death? - I could see no marks but those I mentioned.</p>
               <p>Is it not very easy to happen to a man of a full habit of body to be suffocated by being laid horizontally, without any remarkable degree of violence? - Certainly; there is more danger to a corpulent than a thin man.</p>

On the 25th of August one Dyall, who had nursed the prisoner's child, gave my brother an inscrmation of some carpeting being in the prisoner's room; and by a key she had she let him into the room, where he saw several pieces he knew to be my property; he informed me of it, and in the morning I went to the prisoner's lodging. Dyall told me he took it to Rosemary-lane to sell. Mrs. Cole, the prisoner's landlady, said, if you look sharply after him you will catch him out, for this is his market day. I do not doubt but he is making up a bundle to go to Ragfair, and will come out presently; accordingly I waited at the door till the prisoner came out of his lodging with a basket on his head; I asked him what he had got there, he said nothing but his apron. I desired to see it; he refused to let me see it; I insisted upon it, and laid hold of it and turned his apron aside, and saw it was carpeting; the woman was then at work in my warehouse; she was intrusted to work where the carpeting is, and I thought she was a woman I could have safely trusted. They both confessed before the justice that they had carried on this practice from last Christmas. He went down upon his knees and prayed me to forgive him. He used to come backwards and forwards to bring the key of their lodging to his wife, and fetch it from her, and bring her tea, and such things. The husband accused the wife, and the wife took it upon herself; she said she had taken that piece in the morning and had carried it to her husband.</p>

I drove her up stairs; when I got her up stairs I observed her to be lame; I took her up stairs and put her upon my lap; I found her private parts were swelled as big as my fist; I cried out Lord, fetch in my neighbour to look at her; she came, and said the child has been injured by a man, she has got the foul disease; I immediately took her up to Mr. Dimond, in Holbourn; Mr. Dimond ordered me to bring her up next morning; the two brothers examined her.

            . When we went with the warrant, the prisoner came to the door; I stood on the other side of the way, I crossed over and said that is your prisoner; he started, and said O Lord, what have I done, what have you got to alledge against me! I said young man, I am sorry for you, that you have not had more grace, go along with that gentleman, and you will know too soon to your sorrow.</p>

               <p>Was you present at the time? - I was.</p>
               <p>And the prisoner was present? - Yes. She said Mr. Wright's coachman; Sir John said where was it in the garret or the kitchen; she said neither, it was in the stable; where did he lay you? on the hay. Sir John said point out the man; she pointed out the prisoner; upon that Sir John committed him.</p>
               <p>You say the prisoner was present all this time? - He was arraigned at the bar.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said he was innocent.</p>
               <p>Did he deny the fact? - He said he was innocent. I remember the child two or three weeks before, came in to me at dinner time; she had been missing; I could not find her; I asked her where she had been; she said, mammy, I could not come for Mr. Wright's coachman locked me in the stable; I said what did he do there; she said he took up my clothes before and behind; I took up her clothes and observed her to look very red; I said to my husband what does the fellow mean by playing tricks with my child, I'll go and kick up a dust with him; he said pho, pho, the coachman is always playing with the children. My child told me another time when I told her she might take a walk along with a girl, that she would rather go with the coachman who was to give her a ride; I gave her a penny to spend; when she came home she said that instead of taking her to ride in the coach he locked her in the stable; I said no more, but sent her to bed.</p>
               <p>Do you of your own knowledge, or does any body else to your knowledge know any thing that affects the prisoner except what they had from the story of the child? - It is three times, by the child's story that he has taken her into the stable.</p>
               <p>Has any one ever seen any thing pass? - I believe not.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Poultney brought the child to me on Saturday night between ten and eleven o'clock; I looked at the child, and told her there was some degree of inflammation upon the parts; she said she apprehended the child had been injured; I told her it was impossible to judge of the state of the inflammation by candle-light, but wished she would bring her the next morning; she brought the child about nine or ten o'clock the next morning; my brother and I both inspected the child; there was some degree of inflammation in the exterior parts, and there was a little discharge.</p>
               <p>What was your opinion? - I cannot pretend to say what was the cause of it.</p>
               <p>From your view of the parts is it your opinion that she had been lain with by a man? - I cannot pretend to say that; we find inflammations in children of that age upon these parts from other causes. I could not perceive any laceration. I saw her again on the Monday morning, there appeared then rather an increase of the discharge, but the degree of inflammation was much the same.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon. I was called in by Mr. Dimond on the Monday morning to inspect this child, as Mr. Dimond did not choose to give his opinion himself. I washed the parts with milk and water; I inspected into the vagina as far as the inflammation would admit, but the inflammation was so great then that it was impossible to have such an examination as would enable one to say whether the child had been penetrated or not. If I had had the child under my care till the inflammation abated, I could have ascertained that.</p>

The prisoner had been at the house some days before, and he came back on the 14th of July, pretending to take lodgings; it was just before breakfast. I let him in, and let him into the parlour. I went up two pair of stairs to call my mistress to come down to speak to him. The spoons in question lay in the kitchen; he had been in the kitchen seven or eight days before. When he called there I was the only servant in the house. I might be up stairs about ten minutes with my mistress. When I came down he was gone, and the spoons, which I missed immediately. I had seen them there the moment before he came in. It must have been him that took them, because nobody else had been in the house, for the door had not been opened that morning till he came. He was taken up upon the 24th.</p>
               <p>What was the value of the spoons? - They are set down in the indictment, the table ones at thirty shillings a piece, and the five tea spoons at sixteen shillings.</p>

I was called out between eleven and twelve o'clock by the watch, and the officer of the night, when Mr. Bennett's barge was robbed, and was informed there was a boat seised with peas in it; at the same time the watch desired to know what they were to do with them. I went down to the water-side, and ordered them to be lodged in the watch-house, and that one of the officers might take charge of the boat, for there was nobody with the boat when I was there. I went to bed at half after one; at half after two the watch knocked me up again, and said they had got a man they believed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150029"/> belonged to the gang, and they partly knew, I believe, who they were.</p>

               <p>On Tuesday was a week the prisoner came into Mr. Smith's house. She called for a pint of ale. It was brought her in a spouted pint pot, with a glass to drink put of. The prisoner had a barrow at the door with small nuts and pears. She had her dinner with her. In about half an hour she paid for her ale and went away; after she was gone, the spouted pot was missing.</p>

               <p>The barrow did not belong to me. As I was going along a woman asked me to drink with her. I sat on the side of the barrow with her.

I know no more of it than the child unborn.</p>

            . I lost a gold ring. I missed it from some part of my house up stairs. I found it again at a pawnbroker's some time ago. I went over accidentally, and saw it in the window. I found it very lately.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner? - Yes; she used to come occasionally when any of the family were ill, and she used to go to my drawers. I thought well of her.</p>
               <p>- MENIZ sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pawnbroker in petty France, Westminster. I took that ring of the prisoner at the bar the second of February, 1777. I lent her half a guinea on it. Fourteen months after that she came again. I then bought it of her for sixteen shillings in March 1778. Since that time it has been in my window, but I could not meet with a customer for it.</p>
               <p>Did she give any particular account of it when she brought it? - She said it was her own; that it was given her; she has brought very good things sometimes for other people.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Priestman. On the 10th of July, between two and three o'clock, the prisoner came to my master's shop, in company with a man who came to pawn a pair of shoes. She was speaking to him. She stood a minute or so near some linen that was hanging up for sale. A woman who was in a box, pawning some linen, told me the prisoner had a piece of linen hanging under her petticoats. I looked and saw the linen, and jumped over the counter, charged her with having the linen, and saw her drop it from under her petticoat. I do not know whether the prisoner or I took it up. She begged me to let her go, and said what would you have more, you have got your property again. I charged a constable with her, and took her before the justice.</p>

I staid there about three quarters of an hour. The prisoners went out first. It being fair, I thought I would take a walk as far as a house called the Jews-harp. There is a narrow passage that goes into the fields; as I was going through that passage Bristow laid hold of my arm, and pulled me into a necessary belonging to the Queen's-head and Artichoke, and asked me what money I had in my pocket. I said I had only a few halfpence. Bristow put her hand part of the way into my waistcoat-pocket. I took hold of the money on the outside of my pocket, and begged to have the privilege of making them a present of it myself. I then took out my money, and put it in my mouth.</p>
               <p>You refused to give her the halfpence? - Yes; then Bridgwater lifted up her fist, and began beating me about. I said what is the matter; let me out; I do not know you; I never saw you to my knowledge. No, blast him, says the other, bolt the door. They bolted the door, and Bridgwater kept her back against it, and got my head beside her belly. I had put my watch in my waistcoat pocket for fear of losing of it. They let my breeches down behind, and then they left me. As soon as they were gone I missed my watch. I went into the fields after them, and begged and prayed of them to give me my watch; they danced and capered about the fields, and would not give it me. I went and got assistance, and had them taken up. When they were brought to the watch-house, Bridgwater said to me, God bless you, Sir, I take you to be an honest man, but I do not know whether you are a man or a woman.</p>
               <p>She might have known that? - Yes; it was against my consent.</p>
               <p>Have you found your watch? - No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Wormald, the prosecutor, came to me, and said he had been robbed of his watch by some women, who were in the fields. Mr. Small and I went and took them. I took Bristow; she said she would go peaceably. Mr. Small came up with Bridgwater; she seemed to go peaceably with him at first, but soon after struck him on the breast. I quitted the other, and came up to her. She said, I looked something like a man, she would walk quietly with me. We had not got far before she served me in the same manner, and got quite away. I was some time before I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150032"/> recovered myself. Some of Mr. Wellings's people came to my assistance, and we secured her again; four or five of us could hardly manage her. I put a pair of hand-cuffs on her with a great deal of difficulty, and she kicked and bit my arm. At last we got her to the watch-house; she then said, if I would go back with her into the field, the watch should be produced; it was then about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did she confess taking it? - No. I would not go with her by myself, but asked her to tell me where it was, or let somebody go with us, but she would not. The next day, when she was before the magistrate, she said it was bid in the necessary. A person went to look for it, but it was not found. She said she was innocent of the affair.

               <p>I was at the Queen's-head and Artichoke; this man was in the skittle-ground, much in liquor. I went to draw a pail of water, and saw him go into the necessary. He came into the skittle-ground again, and said he had lost his watch, and would take up some of us for it. He struck me with a stick he had in his hand, and threw down the water. I am as innocent as the child unborn.</p>
               <p>BRISTOW's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was at this publick-house, talking with Bridgwater. We went out, and were going by the necessary, and this gentleman pulled me in. I asked him what he wanted me to do; he said I must whip him. I went out, then he pulled me in again and this young woman, and bolted the door; he then took out his handkerchief, and tied some knots in it, and said we must whip him. I did not know what he meant; he afterwards said he had lost his watch. I never saw any thing of the watch.</p>
               <p>To the prosecutor. I do not see what occasion they had to unbotton your breeches to take your watch? - They are the persons that robbed me of my watch; they have made it out that I was in liquor; I was as sober as I am now. If I was on my deathbed I would say the same.</p>
               <p>Bristow says you pulled her into the necessary? - They were both there before. Bristow pulled me into the necessary. I am above sixty years old; I could not stand against these creatures. I gave four guineas for the watch thirty years ago.</p>

               <p>Did you know the deceased? - I did.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - I remember it is the man. I did not know much of him before. I live at the County-court-office. Fullwood's-rents. I belong to the Register. I was going home about six in the evening, as near as I can recollect on the 8th of July.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150033"/>Where was you? - I was at the County-court-office door. I had ascended the steps; there are four steps; I was on the uppermost step. I heard some words, in Gray's-inn, between the prisoner and the deceased, which I could not distinguish; there is a high brickwall between the place where I was, and where the parties were.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the effect of the words? - I could not distinguish what the words were; they seemed to be quarrelling. The deceased came out of Field-court, and the prisoner very close to him, following of him to the door of a Mr. Dancer, which is directly opposite where I live. The prisoner asked the deceased if he would fight him then. The deceased replied, I will not fight you now, I will fight you to-morrow morning. The prisoner gave the deceased a push, or tap, with his hand, just to touch him.</p>
               <p>Immediately? - There were a few words, but it was very short the whole of it.</p>
               <p>What part did he touch? - About the breast, and repeated his question will you fight me now. The deceased replied no, I will fight you to-morrow. There were more words passed, which I do not recollect. The prisoner then snatched a stick which the deceased had in his hand from him, and attempted to break it upon his knee, and then struck him with his fist.</p>
               <p>On what part did the blow fall? - About the head; the deceased fell, but was, not entirely down; I believe he was almost down. As he attempted to rise again, and was partly up, the prisoner struck him a second blow, which laid him flat entirely at his length on the ground. I afterwards called to some officers that belonged to the County-court who were near, to remove the man. I perceived he was incapable to help himself at all. That is the whole that I know of it.</p>
               <p>After the deceased was knocked quite down on the ground what became of the prisoner? - He went away.</p>
               <p>Immediately? - Not immediately; there was a soldier laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>How long was it after the second blow that the soldier laid hold of him? - I believe not two minutes; I cannot be exact as to the time. The prisoner then went his way; the soldier, as he told me, did not apprehend the consequences.</p>
               <p>Did you know these parties before? - I knew the deceased, as he was a runner to the officers of the County-court, to assist them in doing their business.</p>

               <p>You did not know any thing of the prisoner? - I did not know that he belonged to Gray's-inn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner snatched the stick out of the deceased's hand, and attempted to break it on his own knee? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know the meaning of that? - No.</p>
               <p>Was it that the prisoner wanted to provoke the deceased to fight, and wanted him to be on equal terms? - I do not know what he meant.</p>
               <p>He did not break it? - No.</p>
               <p>What became of the stick? - I do not know how that came out of his hand. It came afterwards into mine, and I produced it before the coroner.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did the deceased offer to strike the prisoner? - Not that I saw; many things might pass that I did not see.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>A great many things might happen that you did not observe? - There might.</p>
               <p>There were a great many people present? - A great number.</p>

Mr. Wilkinson was standing on the Court of Conscience steps. He called the deceased to him; he came out of the Duke of York, shaking his stick at Ann Green. Mr. Wilkinson bid him not beat the woman. Ann Green is the person that lived with the deceased. He said to Mr. Wilkinson what must I do with her; I cannot tell what to do.</p>

She<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150034"/> want into the court and turned herself round and called Mr. Talboys and the deceased rogues and villains; the prisoner came up and told her she was not to make a riot there. The prisoner was the porter of Gray's-Inn. she told him she would go or stay, which she pleased; the deceased hearing him speak to the woman, went up to him and told him not to use his wife ill, for if he himself used her ill nobody else should; the porter desired them both to go; this was in Field-court; the deceased said he would go or stay which he pleased, that they had no business to interrupt him and his wife; the porter said to him, you would look simple if I was to give you a slap in the face; the deceased said if he did he should be very apt to return it; the prisoner said if he would go into the Rents he would fight him for a guinea; then they both came out and went into the rents.</p>
               <p>How far are the rents from Field-court? - They go directly out of the rents into Field-court. The prisoner said to the deceased will you fight me now?</p>
               <p>Did you see Mr. Wilkinson at that time? - He was standing upon the steps; the deceased said he would not fight him, he would defer it till the morrow; then the prisoner took the stick out of his hand, put it over his knee and attempted to break it; it did not break in two, it split; then the deceased went to put his hand to take the stick from him, and the prisoner struck him.</p>
               <p>Do you remember where the blow fell? - I cannot justly say, it was some part of the head; the deceased fell, and as he was rising again the prisoner gave him another blow which laid him flat on the ground.</p>
               <p>Did you see him after he was dead? - No.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Do you remember when they were in the inn together the first interference of the prisoner, who was the porter of Gray's-Inn, was for the purpose of bidding the woman get out of the inn, who was making a noise there? - Yes it was.</p>
               <p>Then the deceased came up and said, if he had a right to use his wife ill nobody else should; do you recollect the deceased challenging the prisoner to fight, and taking out money for that purpose? - I never saw any money, nor did not hear him say any thing to challenge him.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him swear or use any imprecations that he would beat him or thrash him if he would come out of the Inn? - No, I did not hear any such expression.</p>
               <p>When they came out of the inn did you see any attempt on the part of the deceased to strike the prisoner? - I did not see any.</p>

               <p>I was coming past the Court of Conscience steps at the time the deceased was talking to Mr. Wilkinson, who advised him to let his wife alone; the deceased said what can I do. At that time the woman was making a noise in Field-court. The prisoner attempted to put her out there and told her he would have no noise; I went into Field-court, and stood at a distance; I heard more words pass. The prisoner was aggravated by the the deceased to return back twice.</p>
               <p>In what manner? - There were words, but I cannot pretend to say what the words were; the prisoner was coming away from him in Field-court; they went then into Fullwood's Rents; I followed at a distance; when I came into the Rents, I saw the deceased give the prisoner a sort of a shove; then the prisoner attempted to break his stick.</p>
               <p>Did he take it from him? - I believe he took it from him, I saw him attempt to break it, upon which the deceased gave the prisoner a blow on the side of the head, I believe.</p>
               <p>Court. You do not mistake this matter do you; you say the deceased gave the prisoner a blow on the side of the head? - Yes; then the prisoner gave him a blow and knocked him down; in rising again, before he was quite up, the prisoner gave him another<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150035"/> blow and laid him down upon the ground again.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You said the prisoner was twice about to leave this man and go away from him peaceably, but he was brought back by the deceased aggravating in, as you call it, what do you mean by that aggravation? - Abuse. He twice turned round to come away.</p>

I found a man rather close upon my heels all the way up the Strand; a boy ran in after me and said, have not you lost your handkerchief? I felt and missed it; he said a man who was gone up towards Temple-bar had stolen it. I went after him with the boy; we did not find him; we came back; the boy said he often came by of an evening, and he knew him very well, and supposed he would come by again; I ate my supper at the coffee-house; I told the boy if he would give intelligence if the thief came back, I would give him something; the boy afterwards came in and said the thief was gone by; I ran out; he pointed out the prisoner; I took him into the coffee-house, and in the presence of a great many people there he took out and dropped my handkerchief, and kicked it under the box; I am certain it is mine, it has my mark upon it. He was taken to the watch-house, and I was bound over to prosecute him. My lord, when I preferred the indictment, I said it was worth five shillings, as they cost me six shillings and sixpence by the dozen; I find by that means the indictment is laid capital; I was not aware of the consequence when it was so put down. This is the handkerchief (producing it) I sealed it up in a paper, and have had it ever since.</p>

               <p>I live at the Union Coffee-house. I was shutting up the shutters on the 9th of July, between nine and ten at night, I observed a man behind Mr. Estcourt, and saw him take something out of his pocket very quick.</p>
               <p>Do you know who that man was? - Yes, if I saw him (looks round) that is the man (pointing to the prisoner).</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150038"/>Was there light enough to see him? - Yes. Myself and a gentleman who keeps an oil shop saw him one night picking pockets. The prisoner ran over the way; I went to ask Mr. Estcourt if he had lost any thing; he went away; I ran towards Temple-bar, but could not find him. Mr. Estcourt desired me, if I saw him again, to let him know. I stood at the door; I saw him again; and informed Mr. Estcourt of it. We went out and laid hold of him, and brought him into the coffee-house; we searched him. The prisoner took out the handkerchief behind his coat and dropped it.</p>
               <p>Did you see that? - No; I saw when he was first taken, that he shifted something into his hand behind his coat.</p>
               <p>From the prisoner. Did you see me near you, or find the property about me? - You was near me.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor laid hold of my collar and bid me pull all I had out of my pocket, which I did. He took me into the coffee-house and made me strip naked; he found nothing about me; he turned round to a bench and picked the handkerchief from under the bench. He had been all day in the coffee-house, as I hear: I am innocent of it.</p>

               <p>At what time of night was it? - Between eleven and twelve o'clock, to the best of my recollection. We went to a house, known by the name of the Ham, in Cecil-court, where the prisoner took us; we went up stairs, and my friend called for a bowl of wine and water. He went out of the room with one of the women, and told me if I would wait a little while he would come to me again. I accordingly waited with the prisoner at the bar. After a quarter of an hour had elapsed, my friend came out of the room with the other woman. He went down stairs, and then the woman that came out of the room came and sat on the left hand side of me. The prisoner sat on the side where my watch was, on my right hand side. My friend never came back. In a very short time after, the person who sat on the left side of me got up, and went to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150043"/> the farther side of the room, and the prisoner immediately said I want to speak to my friend; in consequence of which, after a little subsequent discourse between themselves, they both went down stairs, and left me by myself in the room. The woman of the house immediately came up to be paid for the liquor which my friend had called for, and upon putting my hand into my pocket for money to pay for the liquor, I missed my watch. I said I had lost my watch; those women had robbed me. I asked her if she knew any thing at all of the two women. She said no, she had never seen them before.</p>
               <p>When do you recollect having your watch? - I recollect having the watch at the time I went into the house.</p>
               <p>Did you take it out to see what it was o'clock? - I did not.</p>
               <p>What makes you remember it particularly? - I cannot say any particular circumstance, only knowing I had it at the time I went into the house.</p>
               <p>Are you sure as to that woman at the bar? - I am certain that is the woman.</p>
               <p>Have you any thing to lead you to suspect her more than the other woman? - I cannot say I have.</p>
               <p>Do you think it possible, from the manner in which you sat with two women, one on each side of you, that either of them might have taken your watch, and you not know which it was? - I cannot say that, because I must have felt the hand of her that sat on my left hand coming across me. I did not feel the watch go. I was a little elevated, but was sober enough to know perfectly what passed.</p>
               <p>Have you got your watch again? - No; it was pawned; the pawnbroker is here. It is a gold watch in a fish-skin case, capped and jewelled; there were to it two gold seals, one with a coat of arms, the other a cypher, one a white seal, and the other a red one.</p>
               <p>Was you in such a situation that your watch might have dropped out of your fob? - No; I was sitting down all the time.</p>
               <p>It could not have dropped out? - It could not; it was impossible.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - No.</p>

               <p>Did you know her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she give any account of it? - No; I had lent her money before.</p>

When they were gone he said he had no money, but he would leave me his watch if I would give him a direction, and he would call again. He was very much in liquor.</p>

On the 27th of August, when I was going with my master's horse and chaise to the stable, I saw the prisoner, Kelly, come out of my master's warehouse with two bars of iron. When I returned he was got to his work; he was putting up a crane for my master. I catechised him about it; he said his master ordered him to take them, and work them up in the crane. I told my master, and he ordered me to get a constable, and take him up. When we went before the magistrate he ordered us to go, and search among the shops to see if we could find any of my master's property. We first went to four or five places, and then we went to the foreman, who was over Kelly, and he said he had sold them to Arkin. We went there and found all the things mentioned in the indictment, in a shop at the back part of the house. We took them and Arkin before the magistrate. There Arkin said he bought them of the prisoner for a penny a pound. Kelly said he took the things away from my master.</p>

               <p>I am a smith. I have seen these irons; they are the property of Mr. Baker; I made them for him myself.</p>
               <p>You was present before the magistrate? - I was. Kelly confessed that he stole them, and that he sold them to Mr. Arkin. Arkin owned to the receiving of them, and paying one penny a pound for them.</p>
               <p>What is the value of them? - They are worth one penny a pound.</p>
               <p>Any more? - Not to sell again.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Arkin made no secret of it? - No.</p>
               <p>The magistrate let him go upon his promise to appear again at another day? - He did.</p>
               <p>Jury. The iron was no way concealed? - No; it was in the shop where he works.</p>

            , on the 21st of August, at about ten o'clock in the forenoon. Mrs. Field was just coming out at the door. I went in and saw Mr. Field sitting in a chair at the bottom of the stairs, near the window in the lower parlour; he seemed to look earnestly at me, seeing me a stranger. I said, old acquaintance, how do you do? He fell back in his chair, and made no answer. I said I had an information, that some coining implements, were concealed in that house. He said, the Lord have mercy upon me, I am a dead man! I said, where is the money is it above stairs or below; and your tools? He made no answer, but his wife endeavoured to get up stairs. I prevented her, and passed just above her. I found these bags lying upon the stairs.</p>
               <p>Were they on the steps of the stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Perfectly open? - Yes; the prisoner could not fit where he did without seeing them. These two bags (producing them) contain finished shillings. I counted them, but I do not exactly recollect the number; there is about 5 l worth, I believe, in one bag, and about 6 l. in the other.</p>
               <p>Where did you proceed to search afterwards? - This bag (producing it) I found likewise; these are unfinished. I believe there are 500 shillings, and more. Here are some bags of jet and of silver. I believe these were in the large bag on the stairs; I do not remember that they were separate, and here are the patterns (producing them.)</p>
               <p>Where was it you proceeded to from the stair-case? - I went up the two pair of stairs; there I found two pair of flasks.</p>
               <p>In what room? - In the fore room; there are no back rooms. I found two pair of flasks, about five or six and forty crucibles; a trough of sand for the casting; a lathe; three dutch stoves; some sieves; two bottles of aqua fortis; files and metal, and copper. These two crucibles were in the fire-place; there is a shilling in one, and some metal in the other.</p>
               <p>Was the fire alight? - No.</p>
               <p>This lathe was fixed, I believe? - Yes; it was fixed upon two blocks, with just space enough for a shilling. This paper (producing it) lay under to catch the filings. This file lay by it; it has the appearance of having been used. The filings are base metal, a mixture of copper and silver. There was a large quantity of scowering-paper lying on the bench in the room, and this one shilling, which is not finished; it has been edged but not rubbed with the scowering-paper sufficiently. There were three or four large pans of pickling for the finishing of money.</p>
               <p>What is that pickling? - Aquafortis and water; here is some that has been used, and some that has not been used.</p>
               <p>Who was the person that laid hold of Field to secure him? - He was very quiet, and did not need any body to lay hold of him at first. We desired M'Donald to take care of the prisoner below, while Hyde and I went up stairs. While we were up stairs we heard a noise below. I came down and saw Field and M'Donald lying on the ground in the yard.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150046"/>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>If I am rightly informed there are but three rooms in the house? - I believe there are but three and the cellar.</p>
               <p>The ground-floor where the prisoner was, another room, and the two-pair-of-stairs? - Yes; the two-pair-of-stairs was hung round with blankets and ruggs, that a hole should not be made to look through.</p>
               <p>He was at breakfast, I believe? - No; he was sitting by the stairs.</p>
               <p>There were preparations for breakfast? - I heard that his wife was going out for the rolls for breakfast.</p>
               <p>How near was he to the door of the house? - The stairs is a very little way from the door, and he sat by the bannisters, with his elbow on the bannister; the steps were on his left hand, and he was leaning on his left elbow.</p>
               <p>The steps of the stairs were on the same side he was leaning on? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The things found were all in the highest room, except the bags on the stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>All you have yet told us of were found in the two-pair-of-stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That is the highest room in the house? - Yes. This pot (producing a bell-metal pot, with brick-bats and charcoal in it) was standing on a chair in Mr. Field's bed-room, and these tongs across it.</p>
               <p>That pot is for coining I suppose? - It might be used for it.</p>
               <p>It may be used to make broth, I believe? - Yes; but they do not make broth of brick-bats and charcoal, I believe. There is another bag that was found in the two-pair-of-stairs room.</p>

             M'DONALD sworn.</p>
               <p>I went with Dixon, Hide, and Grubb, to this house.</p>
               <p>When you came there where did you see the prisoner? - He was sitting at the window just by the stairs; he might lay his hand on the stairs where he sat. The breakfast things were set. I took charge of him while the others went up stairs. He and his wife offered me 50 l. or 60 l. to let him go. While his wife was gone to get some money he jumped out of the window, and I jumped out after him; she laid hold of my coat, and tore the flap. We were on the ground. I called for Jack and the rest. He said often, before he went out of the window, and afterwards, Lord have mercy upon me, I am a dead man. When they were up stairs he begged me to let him go several times. The room where he worked was all hung with rugs and clothes.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Where who worked? - Where the workshop was up stairs.</p>

               <p>You went with the two last witnesses to this house? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you proceed to search it? - I did; I went in a coach with a person who was to show us the place. When we came there I staid in the coach with that person, and Dixon brought the prisoner to me in the coach. We did not meddle with any thing till we came back. On the side of the room where there were any houses there were rugs hung that nobody might bore holes; there was no occasion to hang them on the other side, because there were no houses.</p>

             was in the premisses before.</p>
               <p>How long before? - I believe five or six years; I understood him to be a jeweller.</p>
               <p>Was you there when they found the things in the house? - I was in the yard, and being landlord, they asked me to go in.</p>
               <p>Did you see these things in the house? - I saw things of the same kind; I cannot swear they are the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150047"/>- NEWTON sworn.</p>
               <p>You were, I think apprehended yourself upon the 21st of August by some officers, as being suspected of coining or practices of that sort? - I was.</p>
               <p>Have you had any dealings or transactions with the prisoner, of what nature, and when? - Yes; it may be six months or more ago, I cannot speak exactly to the time; there were some shillings and sixpences found in my house which I believe to have been part his, and part we had taken which we put by.</p>
               <p>How did you come by those shillings and sixpences? - Mr. Field brought about three pounds worth to me; I returned most of them back again, because they were so bad I did not know what to do with them.</p>
               <p>What did he bring them to you for? - To pay away I suppose.</p>
               <p>I ask you for what purpose he brought them to you? - To pay away, to sell them to me.</p>
               <p>Had you any other dealing with him besides that? - Yes, I believe the farthings produced to day I had of his wife.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You received the money from him about six months ago? - That or more, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Whether they were good or bad you did not know? - I did not know much about it then.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the crown. Do not you know whether those shillings he brought you were counterfeit or good ones? - I did not know at that time; I imagined them not to be good.</p>
               <p>You returned some back that were not good? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Have you received three pounds worth of silver from any man in which there has not been a great many bad ones? - I have received money from several people, and I dare say eight or ten or more bad.</p>
               <p>How did the prisoner bring them to you? - I understood I was to have twenty-seven or twenty-eight shillings for a guinea.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Do not say what you understood, but what he said to you? - He said if I had twenty-six shillings for a guinea it would be so much profit; but I did not like such sort of money.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. What sort of money do you not like? - Not bad; I returned it back.</p>
               <p>How much? - Not all, I had a guinea's worth I think.</p>
               <p>How much is it that you call a guinea's worth? - Twenty-six shillings for a guinea.</p>
               <p>Do you usually get twenty-six shillings for a guinea? - Never but that one time.</p>
               <p>Just now you said some of the money they found in your custody you believed to be Mr. Field's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you not sure of it? - I am certain some of it was for it never was paid away.</p>
               <p>So he put off twenty-six or twenty-seven bad shillings upon you once? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know them to be bad at that time? - No, not at first; I knew it afterwards.</p>
               <p>At the time you took them did you know them to be bad? - They must be bad because I did not like them then.</p>
               <p>But you would have liked them if they had been good? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you would have given a guinea for twenty-six shillings if they had been good; and did you understand that they were good when you gave a guinea for twenty-six? - No, I believed them to be bad and told him so at the time.</p>
               <p>And you agreed to have twenty-six for a guinea? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you took them knowing them to be bad? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And returned them all but a guinea's worth? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But those you passed away? - My wife I believe did.</p>
               <p>So you intended to put them off for good? - I kept them by me.</p>
               <p>So you gave a guinea for twenty-six shillings in order to keep them as a matter of curiosity? - They laid by.</p>
               <p>But what did you intend to do at the time? - If nobody would take them I could not pay them away.</p>
               <p>But did not you intend it? - I had no intention to intend it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150048"/>Then you intended not to pass them? - No they laid by.</p>
               <p>Do not tell me what happened afterwards. Now Mr. Newton you look like an exceeding honest man; I never saw a better looking man in my life, now did you when you took them mean to pass them as good money or to keep them? - I might have passed them.</p>
               <p>But you altered your opinion afterwards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then your design at that time was to be a very great rogue? - That might be.</p>
               <p>But did you mean to be a rogue? - I did not pass them after I found them so bad.</p>
               <p>But did you mean to be a rogue, and to cheat the world, or what, when you took them? - I do not know what you mean by that.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you mean to pass the money? - I did not know any other but that they were good to pass.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Then that is an answer. You swear upon your oath that when you took them you did not apprehend they were bad shillings? - I do not say so, I knew they must be bad.</p>
               <p>Then when you gave the guinea for twenty-six shillings worth you knew them to be bad; now did you mean to pass them or not? - Yes, if they could have gone.</p>
               <p>You meant to cheat any body that would be cheated? - Yes, If they could have been passed.</p>
               <p>Then you meant to be a very great rogue, but could not accomplish it by their being too flagrant? - I do not know what you mean.</p>
               <p>I will tell you what I call a great rogue; a man that takes bad money, knowing it to be bad, intending to pass it, to cheat the world. Now is that your case? - I cannot say what you please to call me; I wish there were nobody greater rogues in that than me. If Mr. Field had not brought them to my house I should not have gone to his house for them.</p>

               <p>Do you know one Turner? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Field's house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who lived in that house? - I do not knew.</p>
               <p>Any servant? - I do not know. I never was in any part of the house but the lower apartment.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Did you give him the guinea at that time or not? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Mr. FLETCHER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the moniers of the Mint.</p>
               <p>Is that silver good or counterfeit? - Some of these appear bad, and others are doubtful.</p>
               <p>(Several were cut that were in the bag. Then Mr. Fletcher said they were all bad.)</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My lord and you gentlemen of the Jury, I am perfectly innocent as to the knowledge of any money being coined in my house, or any implements for that purpose being there in. It is now near six months ago since I entered the garret, having no use for it whatever, but to place lumber therein, and since which period it has been occupied by a person who calls himself by the name of Turner, and who had hired that room of me to make buckles there. The morning of the search in my house, the said Mr. Turner came in in a great hurry about eight o'clock, and left something in bags on the stairs and ran out again almost instantly with a large bundle, declaring he should soon return again, but unfortunately for me it is not in my power to find out or learn where he can be met with, nor do I know the contents of the said bags, it was then I began to fear my own person was in danger from such a discovery, and I have a witness in court to prove what I have above set forth.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>- PHILLIPS sworn.</p>

               <p>How many rooms does his house consist of? - A room on the ground floor, a chamber and a garret, and there is a cellar.</p>
               <p>What does he do with the garret? - I do not know that he made any use of it.</p>
               <p>Did you ever know any body a lodger there, or whether it was let out to any body? - I will give you to understand as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150049"/> far as I can recollect of the matter; I was at Mr. Field's, the prisoner's house, about six months ago; a man came there and said he had heard there was an apartment to let.</p>
               <p>A man you do not know the name of I presume? - He said his name was Turner. The prisoner asked him what business he was? he said a buckle-maker.</p>
               <p>Then he was a stranger to him as you understood at that time? - He asked who recommended him; he mentioned some name which I forget.</p>
               <p>Do you know what price was agreed to be paid for the lodging? - They went both up stairs, and were there some time; I cannot say as to that.</p>
               <p>Then all you know is that he came there to ask whether any room was to be let; he said his name was Turner; being asked his business, he said a buckle-maker; and being asked who recommended him, he mentioned a name you do not recollect; and then they went up stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What passed there you do not know? - No.</p>
               <p>You did not hear any bargain made? - No.</p>

               <p>You was very intimate with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see that Turner in the house coming up or down stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long did he continue there? - I had seen him within a few days of the prisoner, Mr. Field, being taken into custody.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A widow.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In St. John's-square, Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Do you follow any business? - My husband was a gilder, he is dead; since his death I have employed journeymen to carry on the business.</p>

               <p>In that passage is it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many journeymen may you employ? - Two generally; I have but one at this time, because business is rather slack.</p>
               <p>You was very intimate with Field and his wife? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So intimate as for your visits to lead you there three or four times a week? - I did not go at any set time; my business led me that way; I have customers in Moorfields, and I made it my business to call and ask them how they did when I went that way.</p>
               <p>What sort of a man was this Turner? - A tall thin man.</p>
               <p>Did he wear his own hair? - Yes, black curled hair, a little bald upon the top of his head.</p>
               <p>Mr. Field did not know him at all? - I do not know that he did.</p>
               <p>From what passed it is clear he did not, for he did not know his name nor who had sent him there? - I do not know that he did.</p>
               <p>Did he ask him if he would let him a lodging? - If he would let him a place to work in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Field has but one bed in his house has he? - There is one bedchamber, but there are two beds in it.</p>
               <p>Only one sleeping room in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>All that this man wanted was a room to work in, that was a singular thing; did he assign a reason for wanting a room to work in; had he a number of journeymen or why did he not work in his own room; he must lodge somewhere? - I did not hear any reason.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Field say he would let him have this room at once without saying he would enquire of the gentleman who recommended him? - They went up stairs; I cannot say.</p>

               <p>We understand that there was a bell-metal pot found in his room, is that an implement used in foil making in his trade? - I can say nothing to that; with respect to the process of his branch of business, I am unacquainted with that; his business is to polish and colour it for the jewellers and button makers.</p>
               <p>How long have you known him? - Upwards of five years, I believe.</p>
               <p>What is his character? - I always looked upon him as an honest man, because he always paid me honestly.</p>
               <p>Was he estimated an honest man? - He bore a good character.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Have you had any great dealings with him lately? - For two years past I believe I have taken forty or fifty pounds or upwards of him; my former connexions with him were more trifling.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. That is pretty large dealings in that way? - Pretty well.</p>
               <p>- DE LA FONTE sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - Yes. He applied to me five years and a half ago to teach him the art of foil making; I taught him; he gave me a premium for it.</p>
               <p>That is an art that requires some ingenuity? - An art that is kept mostly among ourselves.</p>
               <p>It is not by any means generally known? - No; we are extremely careful of it.</p>
               <p>Do you suffer any body to see you when at work? - No, we are very careful of that.</p>
               <p>What has been his general character since you have known him? - I always looked upon him to be an honest tradesman; I dealt with him afterwards, and was backwards and forwards, at his house several times.</p>

My wife said she had them in her hand the day before, and that they were taken from a room which was locked, and she had the key. I then said there must be some false keys. I called the servants together and searched their pockets ; I found four pieces of silver lace in the prisoner's pocket. I said she had better confess the whole robbery. She said she found it in the garret. I said she could not, for the door was locked. Then she said she knew nothing of the robbery. I sent for a constable, and he found twenty keys in her bosom, a silver buckle of my child's, and a razor. I desired her then to tell of the rest of the robbery; she would not tell any thing. Then I took her up before his majesty *. The constable has got the keys and property in court; the sacque and petticoat, and some lace, were found in a box of her's at the Compter.

In the night he came to my room, and behaved rude to me. The next day his wife came home; he desired me not to tell her, and asked me to accept of these things; he said he had got them from Holland. He gave me the stuff, and desired me to have it made into a sacque and coat, and meet him at Vauxhall. I went, but he was not there. He said his wife was out of her mind, and would not miss the things. He said he dealt in lace, and would give me some, if I would let him be free with me. He said he would take me a lodging, and the things were sent to Bishopsgate-street, to go to Clapton. He said afterwards, if I would return the gown and coat, to prevent uneasiness between him and his wife, he would give me 20 l. There is a prisoner who saw him come every day to me in the jail to give me money.</p>
               <p>To Hyman. You have heard what the prisoner has said, is there any truth in it? - When she came to me my wife was ill; my wife went out of town. There was another servant with her; she was not alone. I never offered her any thing. I advertised the things, and offered four guineas reward.</p>

I went in and missed this remnant of cloth. I pursued the prisoner, and took her about one hundred yards from my house. I found the piece of cotton under her cloak. I asked her what she meant by it. She said, why, Sir, you are not hurt, you have your property again. I said, yes, you jade, and you too. I brought her back, and delivered her to a constable; he took her before an alderman, who committed her.</p>

               <p>On the 25th of August, between nine and ten in the morning, Mr. Archer came to the counting-house, where I was, and said, Master, master, for God's sake come up, you will see such an inhuman thing you never saw in your life. I looked into the fields, and saw a cow lying down, and the prisoner at the hinder parts of her, with his body moving backwards and forwards.</p>

               <p>Where was the prisoner? - In the field.</p>
               <p>How far is the counting-house from the field? - I suppose about eighty yards. I saw him lying at the hind part of the cow, nearly close, with the middle part of his body moving backwards and forwards. The cow was lying down. I called to Mr. Petit; he came forward by the time the prisoner got up from where he lay. The prisoner buttoned up his breeches, and moved forwards towards a bank. Afterwards he got up, and came to the counting-house, where Mr. Archer, Petit, and I, were.</p>
               <p>How long did he lie down there? - About the space of a minute, I suppose.</p>

            's, the brick-maker. When he came to the counting-house, Petit charged him with the crime, and asked him if there was never a bull in the field, that he was obligated to be the bull? He made for answer, he had no connexions with the cow he was sure. He attempted to run away, but Mr. Petit catched hold of him and secured him.</p>
               <p>How far from the cow and the man might you be? - I suppose about eighty yards.</p>
               <p>Was you near enough to see distinctly what passed? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Can you undertake to say whether he had this sort of connexion which you suppose he had with the cow or not? - I cannot no further than what I saw.</p>
               <p>Then all you mean to say is, you saw him in that posture near the cow, but whether he had carnal knowledge of the cow or not you do not know? - No; I do not.</p>

               <p>Then you saw nothing did you? - I was five hundred yards off at work. I saw nothing, only I heard them charge him with being a bull, and I saw him attempt to run away. I, being an officer, took charge of him.</p>

They put a pistol to my sister, and frightened her. It was between nine and ten o'clock at night. One of the men jumped into the chaise, and insisted upon my money. I gave them all I had in my purse. There was I think a guinea and some silver; they insisted upon my watch, which I also gave them, and, seeing my sister in a fit, they left her, and ran across the fields.</p>
               <p>What sort of a watch was it? - A metal watch, with silver seals. They left me, and ran into the fields. One of the seals had the impression of my arms, the other my crest. At the time they were robbing me there was a whistling and some noise, as if there were accomplices in the neighbourhood. I did not attempt to stop after they were gone, and saw no more of them. When the prisoner was apprehended I was sent for, and I do verily believe, that the prisoner is the man who came into the chaise to me.</p>
               <p>Are you certain that the prisoner was one of them? - To the best of my belief I think him the man that robbed me; it was by no means dark; it was light enough to see his countenance, and I most sincerely believe he is the person that robbed me from his profile, size, dress, and every other circumstance; and also because of the person taken with him, Garland; I think he was the accomplice, but I cannot answer as to him; but I think the prisoner is the person that came into the chaise to me; his dress, when taken, was as I had described, a loose great coat, and his hair was hanging down; at the same time his countenance struck me as the same person.</p>
               <p>What colour was his great coat? - It was a dark brown loose great coat.</p>

In consequence of this information, I charged the prisoner with having stolen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150056"/> them. The prisoner confessed he had taken them, and owned all the account of Jeffreys to be true. I found the hats at the several pawnbrokers.</p>

               <p>On the 4th of July the prisoner brought the deceased to the watch-house, and gave me charge of him. A great many words passed, and Mr. Lister ordered him into the room above the watch-house; he came down again, and blasted and swore at Mr. Lister; he clenched his fist at him, and said he would be revenged of him. About a quarter, or half an hour after that, Mr. Lister was going, when the deceased ran up to him, and clenched his fist at him, and said he would knock his jolt head off. Lister, upon that, gave him a push back with his fist across his breast, the deceased made a couple of steps backward, turned on his left side, and fell over a form. He said, What, d - n you, do you mean to murder me? I said no, there should be no murder done there. I went and took him up, and gave him some beer. He blasted Mr. Lister again. About one o'clock Lister went away; he was in the watch-house about half an hour. The deceased staid till three in the morning.</p>
               <p>After the fall did he complain of pain? - No; he complained of nothing. I left the watch-house a little after two; he was there then. The affair happened between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>When you left the watch-house did he appear to be hurt with the fall? - No; I set him on the form, and gave him some beer, and bid him be quiet. He blasted me, and gave me a smack of the face. I said he had better go home. He said, if he did he would go and break his windows. I said I supposed he would if he went in that condition. Then he gave me another smack of the face. I then took him in my arms, and carried him up into the room.</p>
               <p>When did he die? - On the 9th; this was on the 4th of July.</p>
               <p>He did not complain that he was hurt by the fall? - He did not complain at that time. His brother came to me upon the Monday week, and said he should be glad to speak to me. I asked him what he wanted. He said I hear my brother got his death among you. I said I did not know that he did. He begged I would show him the watch-house. I did so. He said his brother told him that four watchmen took him up into a room, and threw him down, and said he might lie there and be d - d.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the deceased after that? - I saw him twice. I saw him I think on the 4th day after; he then appeared as well as usual.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You have represented him as a troublesome man in the watch-house? - He was as troublesome a man as I ever knew; he was in liquor.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put out his hand and gave him a shove, and he, being drunk, staggered, and fell backwards? - He did.</p>

               <p>On Sunday the 4th of July, between eleven and twelve o'clock, Lister and Bailey came into St. Sepulchre's watch-house. Lister took his leave of them about half after twelve o'clock, and went home. A little after that the deceased, Bailey, and another watchman, came into the watch-house again. They brought the deceased before the constable of the night. The deceased was very much in liquor. Lister said the deceased had like to have pushed him down in the Old-Bailey, and some words ensued, and he would see who and what he was, and ordered him up stairs; he was let down again, and words ensued immediately;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150058"/> the deceased offered his fist to strike at him, Lister warded it off with his left-arm, and the deceased fell over a form in the watch-house. He said, For God's sake do not murder me! Lister meddled no more with him. Trotter took him up, and set him on the form.</p>

               <p>What did he die of? - I do not know. I saw him the next day as I was going to Guildhall; I went into the prince of Denmark's head in the Old-Bailey; the deceased saw me and came in, and asked me where that rogue Lister was? He said, if he could see him he would lick him as long as he could.</p>
               <p>He did not complain then of the effect of the blow? - No, he did not; I saw him on the Tuesday week after, he was dying there.</p>
               <p>What do you know of his death, did you see him about the time of his death? - I saw him on the day before his death.</p>
               <p>What was he ill of? - He was very bad.</p>
               <p>Was it the effect of this blow? - He did not tell me that; he shook hands with me and said God bless you, Martin, you have behaved like a gentleman to me.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>The next morning when you saw him in the Old Bailey was he drunk or sober? - He did not appear to be in liquor, but full of spirits and ready and resolute to attack Lister if he could see him.</p>

               <p>On Sunday night, the 4th of June the deceased, Proctor, and I were drinking together; I went about ten o'clock to the watch-house to set the watch; he came after me and asked me to give him some more beer; I said he had had enough, and bid him go home and go to bed; he went away, and was brought afterwards to the watch-house by Lister: I was present at the time.</p>
               <p>Did you see the blow or push? - It was a violent blow or push, I cannot say which; he fell down with a violent force; there was a form, he fell on the form, and pitched on his side, and his head fell under the bench; they picked him up, and he said, for God's sake do not murder me! they took him up, and he was sent up stairs directly.</p>
               <p>Did Lister give him any other blow? - No. The deceased came to me the next morning and said that he had received his death, he had received a violent blow that he should never recover.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon. I opened the body of the deceased. Upon viewing the body before I opened it. I observed the right side of the body was swelled, and discoloured; upon the scrotum there was a large black place the size of a half-crown piece. Upon opening the body I found there was no mischief under the appearance of that black place, it was nothing but an outward blackness. I proceeded to examine all the entrails; there was no appearance of any thing but what was natural; it was observed to me that he had made bloody water; I examined the bladder; there was no appearance of any thing amiss there. I cannot tell the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>What do you think might be the cause of his death? - It is impossible for me to say; the fall might have produced a fever, and the fever might produce death; he might have died of a fever sooner if he had had no blow. He was attended by an apothecary in his life time.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You cannot say what was the cause of his death? - It is impossible for me to say what his death was occasioned by.</p>
               <p>There was nothing that you can determine upon of any injury that caused his death? - No, there was no fracture in the skull; no strain of the membranes; there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150059"/> was rather a larger quantity of water than usual in his skull.</p>
               <p>Should you if you had not heard the story of his fall when you opened the body have collected that the man had had a bad fall? - I should not.</p>

I undressed him and got him to bed.</p>
               <p>Did he continue to complain of that? Yes, every day till the day he died he complained of a pain in his head and side.</p>
               <p>Did he complain of the head-ach? - No, of a pain on the top of his head.</p>
               <p>Did he call it a blow or a fall? - A blow he gave him and knocked him over a table, and that the table fell on him; and that he spit blood, and there was blood in his water.</p>

               <p>In what capacity did you live with him; I believe you passed as his wife? - Yes, I did.</p>

               <p>Then how came you to let him go out? - I could not help it.</p>
               <p>Did you learn how he got that wet? - When he went out he met with no misfortune.</p>

               <p>I am an apothecary. I attended Proctor in his last illness.</p>
               <p>What do you ascribe his death to? - To an injury he had received; by what means I cannot tell; I suppose an inward hurt, by a fall or a blow, I could not determine which.</p>
               <p>How many days did you attend him? - Not till the day before his death. I found him extremely convulsed; I thought him very dangerous and apprised him of the danger.</p>
               <p>Had he much of a sever? - No; his breast appeared very much distended; he breathed with difficulty, and spoke with difficulty; but seemed very sensible. He said that on the Sunday week before that he reeled against Lister, and Lister was not pleased, and being a constable he said Lister said he would press him, and take him to the watch-house; that words arose and something happened to him.</p>
               <p>What happened did he say? - That Lister gave him a fall or struck him, or something to that effect.</p>
               <p>Did he seem to have any hurt in his side? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Did you from his appearance think his story probable that his death happened from some fall or blow? - The woman complained of his making bloody water.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What symptoms were there to induce you to believe he died of a blow or fall, did you strip the body and examine it? - I did not. If the body had been hurt in nine or ten days, I should not have expected to have found the discolouration. I was sent for too late to do him any good. I ordered some broths and a fomentation.</p>
               <p>Was you present when the body was opened? - No.</p>
               <p>Could a blow be given without there being an appearance of it when the body was opened? - Yes; I think a blow in the stomach might be given without any appearance of it.</p>

I heard a sound at the window, crunch, crunch, and repeated knocks, one after another. I went up the steps and knocked at the door, when a woman put her head out of the window. I thought it was the best method to get in at the window. I threw my body right through the window into the cellar; there I saw a press and a fly. I went up-stairs, and let in Yardly and Hobbs. We secured the door, and then went up stairs into the chamber. I saw the prisoner standing upon the stairs, but whether the first or second pair I am not certain; his coat was off, and he was in his shirt sleeves. I presented a pistol to him; he desired me to put it up, and said he would come quietly; upon which I secured him and his sister; then Yardly and I went into the cellar, there we found these farthings (producing a great quantity in a bag) some on the ground, and some by the press. This farthing (pointing it out) was between two dies. We put the farthings into a bag, and took them and the prisoner to Justice Wilmot's office. There was no one in the house besides the prisoner, except two women, one of them the prisoner's wife, and the other his sister.</p>
               <p>Jury. You did not see any body in the cellar? - No; I heard a kind of rumbling on the stairs, as if somebody was going up; that was just as I broke in, before I saw the prisoner. The women were dressed in their morning dress. One of the women called for a gold ring which was in the cellar.</p>

               <p>I went with the last witness at the time he has mentioned. I can say no more than he has related. He broke in, and let us in; Wade took them to the office. After we were let in I went into the one-pair-of-stairs room, there I found a quantity of farthings all black; they were in a brown paper, blacked over as if they were old farthings. We went up stairs to find the prisoner; he knew me very well; he was on the stairs, in a waistcoat without sleeves, and without a coat on, and, as I believe, but am not certain, with his shirt-sleeves tucked up. There was no one in the house, besides the prisoner, his wife and sister, and two small children. I found some copper blanks, and a piece of copper they call cecil. We found three instruments for cutting blanks, two for farthings, and one for halfpence.</p>

               <p>I am one of the moniers of the mint (looks at the farthings). These farthings are every one of them counterfeits.</p>

I had no kind of connexion with them. They<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150064"/> went away from me, and in a minute or two I missed my watch.

The next day I went round to the pawnbrokers, and found my seal pawned at one place, and my watch at another. I found out who the prisoners were, and had them taken up. I saw them very distinctly, and being so near I am certain as to their persons; it was a moon light night. When they were taken up they owned they had taken the watch, and said it was pawned with Mr. Burroughs for 18 s. I found the watch at Burroughs's.</p>

I had a suspicion that the prisoner had robbed me, which suspicion was grounded partly upon the time when he left me, which agreed with the time when I missed the books, and partly upon the prisoner having access to my quire warehouse, which nobody else then had. I had him apprehended. He had a lodging in Oxford-road, where he had set up a bookstall. I had his lodgings searched, and there I found all the books mentioned in the indictment, and many more, all which I took to be my own, except as many as might be worth about 20 s. When the prisoner was taken up, he did not account how he came by those books, but set me at defiance, and said I could not identify the books for want of marks. The books were stolen in sheets, and he had done some of them up in boards for sale, or in order to disguise them the better. In binding the books in boards the prisoner had used some of my paper to put before and behind, which cost twice as much as the paper commonly used for that purpose. Nobody would have bought such paper for that purpose. There are no marks in most of the articles, but, from their correspondence with my quire-stock, I cannot have a doubt of the whole being mine; but some of the articles which are damaged or tied up in a particular manner I can speak to with certainty. Here is also a Field's bible, that I found at a bookseller's in Middle-row, which I know to be mine; it has the name of the gentleman I bought it of in it. I know that I had never sold it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable. I went with a search-warrant to the prisoner's lodgings, and found the books which are produced in the prisoner's lodging, and a great many more, that Mr. Fox swore to. The prisoner said he bought them at one place or another, but could not tell when, nor ascertain of whom he bought them. Mr. Fox in my presence asked him whether he could ascertain any one person he bought any of them of; he said no. A soon as I found the books I took the prisoner to Sir John Fielding's office; he was examined there, and committed for further examination. On the Wednesday following we attended at the publick examination day. Mr. Fox swore positively to these books; the prisoner was committed, and I was bound over to produce the books.</p>
               <p>From the prisoner. Will your lordship please to ask the prosecutor whether he can, upon oath, ascertain these books to be in his shop when I came to work with him on the 1st of October last? - My lord it is impossible all these articles could then have been wanting without my missing, in the course of that time, some one or other of them, or a multitude of them; these books must have been, some or other of them, taken away since, for if they had been taken away before I must have missed them. The first article I missed was Kenrick's dictionary. I can swear I must have missed some one or other of the articles.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether, upon oath, he can declare that he had never a servant in the house since the 1st of October last but me? - I had no other servant in the house when I missed the books. When I turned him away I took a maid-servant. I do not much live in the house myself; I go out. She came about a week after he went, I believe.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Do you mean that never since the 1st of October you had no other servant, during the time that I lived with you? - I think not, if there was, it was a few days when he first came, and if she had taken them I must have missed them much sooner than I did, but to the best of my recollection I think she was gone before he came.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether he had an officer with him when he took these books he lays to be on the premisses? - The officer has himself sworn that.</p>

            , who came along with Mr. Fox. I told them as to pointing out every particular article belonging to Mr. Fox I could not do it, but if he could certainly swear to any of them, or could with safety to himself claim any of the property he found upon my premisses he might take them in the name of God. Upon the strong persuasions of my friends; the promise made by the prosecutor not to appear against me; the horrid apprehensions of a prison, and the natural love of liberty worked upon me to deprive myself of my property, and to risque my life. I delivered up an order to the prosecutor to go and take such books as he chose to take, which he thought he could claim.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any witnesses? - Yes, to prove that about this time twelve months, when I kept a shop in Peter's-street, Saffron-hill, I was afraid of my landlord. I took that shop about this time two years. Being afraid of my landlord, and the tax-men, I moved off the principal of my shop-goods to a friends of mine, who is ready to appear; but having unfortunately lost my catalogue among the other effects, which sell into the hands of the broker, and after the sale I could not procure it, I am therefore deprived of showing to you the number; denomination; the quality; the time when, where, and at what price, I have bought my books, being deprived of that happiness, I had nobody to recur to but my friends to prove that I had these books; they cannot possibly ascertain the value, but I moved a great quantity of books upon my friend's premisses about this time twelve months. I was obliged to serve the prosecutor as a porter; he hired me to sold and few, and put books in boards for him. It was on the 29th of September last I left off, and the books I had not time to remove unfortunately fell into the hands of my landlord. I removed what I could of my books to a friend's in Bridgewater-gardens, intending to re-assume my profession afterwards.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner; he was a bookseller fifteen or sixteen months ago in Peter's-street, near Cow-cross.</p>
               <p>Had he a good stock of books? - A great stock. About this time twelve months he brought to my house a large chest, containing, as he told me, books. I did not know it then, but I knew it a week afterwards. He brought so large a chest, I wonder he stood under it, for my apprentices and I had much a do to get it off his shoulders. He brought some more in a sack, in which sack I saw a parcel of books, such as pamphlets and old magazines; he said he was obliged to remove them for fear the officers of the parish should take them for parish dues; they might be there two or three months.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether these books now produced are some that were in the sack? - I will not pretend to say that I know any of them. I am certain these were not; those were in blue covers.</p>
               <p>Were there any books larger than pamphlets? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did they seem to be new books or old books? - Those I saw seemed to be new books. I can say nothing as to the contents of the trunk. I have known the prisoner ten years; I never heard any thing bad of him; he is an honest industrious sober hard working man, and took care of his family.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am in the watch way.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - At No. 1. Bridge-water-street; I have kept house in that parish fourteen or fifteen years.</p>

My nephew told me they went to Mailling's the night before the burglary, and bought the instruments to break the house open with, and that they were sold to Mailling; I went to Mailling's house with Dinmore the constable; and Mailling confessed that he bought the goods for a guinea of

He acknowledged that he knew they were stolen from No. 13. but that he did not know that it was my house; he acknowledged the same thing to me the next day, and promised me to return the patterns; he made these promised me to return the patterns; he made these promises five different times. I was willing to make up the matter on receiving my goods; but finding he did not keep his promise, but put me off from time to time from the month of March to the month of May; I at last got an indictment against him. The patterns were fairly worth 100 l. and if melted down would be worth three or four pounds. The prisoner acknowledged not only that he had received the patterns, but that he had received the other goods mentioned in the indictment.</p>

               <p>What is Mealing's trade? - I look upon him to be an infamous man, a buyer of stolen goods.</p>

               <p>This man was free in confessions, he made no secret of it to you or any body else? - Possibly he might; if he had been an honest man he would have done it at first; my opinion is he is as great a rogue as any existing; if it were not for such men as he very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150069"/> few I believe would come to an ignominious death.</p>
               <p>You have been at America I believe? - When my lord judge pleases to ask me I will solve it. I have nothing more worth your hearing.</p>
               <p>You have been at America? - I will not solve you; I have never been there for any thing that is bad; if my lord judge will ask me I will solve him.</p>

               <p>"I am come from the justice and he desires you will attend, for he will not take bail for the man without you are present?" - Not to my remembrance.</p>

               <p>Did not you make an appointment to attend at six o'clock? - It was between eleven and one, I was casting; I said I could not attend then; I told him I should be done casting at six o'clock; he said his watch was with the Horse Guards, as true as the sun; that he would be there at six.</p>
               <p>Do you know one Bartum? - Give me your reason for asking that question; I will not answer that question, it is not a fair question. I do not owe Bartum a farthing; I do know him.</p>

               <p>Did you carry any goods you took from your uncle's house to Mealing's? - I did; I carried some small lead patterns in my hat; Walker carried all the rest of the things (repeating them) in a bag at different times he weighed them, and said they came to just one pound one shilling; this was in the morning after the burglary, I believe between seven and nine o'clock. He asked Walker where they came from; Walker said out of Eyre-street. Walker said I hope you will keep them safe, as Penticross is a man that knows things, and this is his nephew; I am afraid we shall come into trouble. He told him where they came from in my hearing. He was an older acquaintance of Mealing's and could converse with him better than I could.</p>
               <p>Where did he put the things? - They were on the counter when we came away.</p>
               <p>Have you had any conversation with Mailling since? - No, only at the Castle and Falcon in St. John's-street; he said to me, now you have confessed the robbery you shall be hanged.</p>
               <p>Did Walker tell him they were stolen? - He knew the place was to be robbed before it was robbed; the tools to break open the house were bought of him; he made some old keys at the time; the tools were straight, and he made them red hot and bentthem, fit to break the house open; I was present at the time.</p>
               <p>Did he tell him what the tools were for? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Did Walker tell Mealing you were going to rob Penticross? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was taken up for this burglary? - Yes; I told my uncle the same story before I was in custody.</p>
               <p>When you was taken up did you tell the constable you sold these things to Mailling? - Dinmore said, Stumpy, where are these things fenced? I said they were at Mailling's.</p>
               <p>Did not you say the property was left at Walker's, under the bed? - No, I said the bags were there; the property was at Mailling's.</p>
               <p>You do not know what the weight was? - No, I do not, indeed; he bought them by the pound; he weighed the lead, pewter, and copper all separate.</p>

               <p>I never had the copper; young Penticross never was at my house.</p>

               <p>I am one of the moniers of the Mint (cuts the money). The shilling is bad; I cannot pronounce upon the sixpence; I cannot tell whether it is bad or no by this light; there is an appearance of yellow metal in the shilling.</p>

               <p>Is that the shilling? - It is impossible for me to tell because it is not in the same state.</p>
               <p>Look at this sixpence and see whether it is good or a bad one? - It is a very bad one.</p>

I thought it was not proper she should have them again; I took them to my mistress, and she sent for a constable who took her into custody; there were seven bad shillings and two bad sixpences; I was informed the constable found a good sixpence upon her.</p>

               <p>I have known the prisoner ten years. I am a manufacturer of shag duffel for great coats; he worked with me in the year 1772, with a woman he called his wife; he went down to Norwich; she got a pass and went after him; he came up again by himself in 1773, and worked for me in July; I never saw him here since he sent for me when he was in the Poultry Compter; I asked him how he could be so foolish to marry another wife, his former wife being alive; he said he had been down into the country and saw her; and unfortunately while he was gone two letters came up; but he had settled matters; so that no harm could come of it. I asked him if he had any connexion with her when he was down; he said no, not so much as to kiss her lips. That was before his second examination.</p>

Conway went to Barker, and struck the first blow, and there were several falls, and terrible ones. Conway in general gave the falls, and rolled over Barker; he was the heaviest man. Conway gained the battle; the prisoner gave out.</p>
               <p>Conway had some bad bruises? - Yes; but I did not observe it then.</p>
               <p>When was this? - I cannot say.</p>

               <p>The 13th of July? - Some time thereabouts.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was it? - I cannot say; I came home with Conway as far as his house; I thought he was very well; he asked me to drink; I left him and saw no more of him afterwards; I heard of his death, but never saw him.</p>
               <p>What is the prisoner? - A captain's clerk of a ship.</p>
               <p>Mr. VALENTINE JONES sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon. I reside at St. Bartholomew's hospital. Conway, the deceased, came to the hospital, about eleven o'clock on Tuesday the 13th of July; I enquired what was the matter; he said he had fallen from the coach, and bruised his arm. I examined his arm, but found no bone broke. I asked him if he had any other bruises; he said none. The next morning I saw him, and asked him if anything else was the matter with him (he being intoxicated the night before); he said no; his wife said he had been fighting. I knew nothing of it. On the Saturday he was seised with a violent fever, and died on the Monday.</p>
               <p>You attended him all the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see any other bruises, thought he did not complain? - No; nothing more than his arm; his wife said he had a bruise in his side; he never complained of that to me.</p>
               <p>Now as to your own observation what do you think might occasion the fever? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did you see any bruise that might cause his death? - No, I think not; his arm was swelled, but not broke.</p>

               <p>I was a lodger in the house of the deceased at the time. I came home on the 13th of July, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I went to the window, and took a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150074"/> pipe, and smoked. The prisoner came out of his own room into mine; he was disguised in liquor; the deceased's wife called Barker to come down and take his wife's part. It was Conway's house, and Barker and myself lodged there. The prisoner went down stairs, and I followed him. The prisoner stood near the shop-door, and I saw the deceased in the street, with his coat, waistcoat, and shirt off; he came up to the door, and challenged the prisoner to fight several times. I went between them. I thought the deceased would strike him. The prisoner had a pipe in his mouth; he came into the shop. The deceased came into the shop and said, come into Gough-square and fight; he said go, and I will follow you; the deceased went into Gough-square. I went into the square, and found him stripped. The prisoner came into the square; the deceased struck him in the face, and made his mouth bleed; he threw the prisoner several times; the prisoner gave out, and the deceased went away rejoicing, with most of the people who were in the square; the prisoner and I staid behind. When we came to the house the deceased's wife came to me and said O Lord, my husband's arm is broke. We took him to St. Bartholomew's hospital. Mr. Jones said it was not broke, it was only very much bruised. I saw him on the Sunday after, and he seemed out of his mind. I did not see him any more till he was dead. The deceased was troubled with a dropsy, and turned out of St. Thomas's hospital incurable, which occasioned a blackness in his side.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jones. At the time this man was in the ward there was a very bad fever. I have a patient that is bad with the same fever who is delirious, and the prisoner was in the same state. After a person is dead it is very common for the blood to coagulate and appear black, when there is no bruise of any consequence.</p>
               <p>Whether you think the deceased died by a fever occasioned by the bruise of the arm, or a contagious fever? - I cannot positively say, but I should think from the fever that was in the ward.</p>
               <p>He was taken with the fever on the Saturday; on the Friday did the bruise appear likely to occasion such a fever? - No; on the Friday he had very little fever; when I saw him on the Saturday I was surprised to see it.</p>
               <p>Was the fever the sort that are occasioned by bruises? - It was not.</p>

We carry the goods home every night. When I had packed them up, I waited for my husband to come and take the tilt of the stall down, and take them home; some people that came past bid me take care of my goods, for they said there was a bad man or two behind my stall; that they were afraid I should be robbed; that put me in a good deal of fear. I saw Value at the end of the stall; there was another, but I could not get a sight of him. My daughter said I will go and watch him; she went and faced him. My husband not coming, I said we must take the things and go home. I went to take the tilt down, the prisoner Value that instant took up the box and ran away with it; he gave a whistle, and the rest all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150075"/> came up to him immediately. I pursued them down Chick-lane; they ran into a court; I was afraid to follow them there. I did not see the faces of the others till they were taken. I saw them all run away together. I got two constables, Mr. Hall and Mr. Massey, and they took the prisoners as they were selling the things. When they were taken, I told the constables I could swear to Value but not to the others.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable. Mr. Massey came with the prosecutrix to Mr. Henshaws, and said she had been robbed. I went immediately to Sharp's-alley, in Blackboy-alley, to the house of one Lynes, and looked through the window, and saw Bolton and Ward showing a woman a roll of green ribband, and a piece of lace.</p>
               <p>What sort of a house is it? - A little house; a bawdy-house.</p>
               <p>Is it kept by a man or a woman? - By a woman.</p>
               <p>(The goods were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutrix and her daughter.)</p>
               <p>Hall. I took the prisoners down to the Anchor and Crown, and left them in custody of some of the neighbours, while I and Massey went down Field-lane, and saw the other prisoners in the house of one Mrs. Tipton, who keeps a clothes-shop, in the back room; they were sitting down. I did not see them doing any thing. I found lace, ribbands, mits, and other things, tied up in a handkerchief, and thrown into the coal-hole. I brought them all to the Anchor and Crown, where the others were. I searched them, and found rolls of ribband in every one of their breeches, they are in the bundle which the prosecutrix has sworn to. This roll of sash ribband (producing it) I found in Value's pocket.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I can swear to that ribband; it is not rolled up as they are rolled up at the shops; I bought it by the yard at a sale, and rolled it up myself on a piece of paper.</p>

               <p>My master works in Sharp's-alley. I was going home at half after eleven o'clock; coming through the alley, I saw this bit of ribband and lace lie. I saw a light in a window. I went in to ask the woman to lend me a candle; while she was lending me a candle this gentleman came in and took me.</p>

               <p>I happened to be locked out, and coming down Field-lane I saw a woman at a door. I asked her if I could have a lodging there; she said yes; as I was going to pay for the lodging the men came up, and said they are all here. There was nothing found upon me.</p>

               <p>Is that the lace that is produced? - Yes; when I saw Dickins again he asked what it was. I told him. He said I was a fool if I did not cut some of it off, for he dare say she did not come honestly by it; that she had robbed her master of it. Dickins kept company with me at that time.

We received information that there was coining carrying on in a house at the top of St. John's-street, but that the prisoner and her sister were finishing them in Peartree-court; we went there; I went in first; the prisoner was sitting upon a chair in the room; there was only one room, it was a sort of shed; she was finishing a shilling; a boy stood just by her; I caught hold of the boy's hands, and Jealous caught hold of her hands.</p>
               <p>What age was the boy? - I suppose about sixteen years old. I saw upon the table aqua fortis, water, scouring-paper, and all the implements for finishing he silver. Mr. Clarke came in; she had several more shillings in her lap; I do not know how many; she had one in her hand which she was cleaning off. There was a key lying on the table by her.</p>
               <p>Were there any shillings finished? - One in her hand, which will be produced by Jealous; that is, I believe, finished. Upon asking her what key that was, she said she did;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150078"/> not know. Mr. Clarke said, pho, pho, it is your key, what signifies denying it. She said, d - n me you cannot do me now. Upon that we took her from thence to her dwelling-house, which is in a little court at the top of St. John's-street. When we came to the end of the court she was asked which was her house; she showed us the door, and with that key we opened it, and went in; we went up, I think, to the two-pair-of-stairs room, where we found all these utensils; here is a cork they make use of for finishing, &amp; scowering-paper, and melting-pots; here is the stuff they black them with to make them look old; here is the fine sand they use to make the impressions with; here is a stick with aqua fortis upon the end of it, which they use to clean the pieces with; this flask was ready set for casting. (The flask was opened in court; it was filled with sand, in which were made impressions for coining shillings and sixpences.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What did I finish the shilling with? - I cannot take upon me to say. I immediately snatched hold of the boy. I saw the shilling in her hand; she was rubbing it with something, it might be a bit of scowering-paper.</p>
               <p>Jury. How did you get admission? - The door was just upon the jar.</p>

               <p>On the 3d of August I went with Mr. Clarke and Mr. Prothero to a house in a little court in Coldbath-fields; we went in directly, and I saw the prisoner rubbing a shilling.</p>
               <p>What was she rubbing it with? - A piece of sand-paper. She had some shillings in her lap, and some lying on the table, and there was this piece of cork. We made her stand up, and out of her hand we took this counterfeit shilling (producing it). After we had secured her we saw a key lying on the table near her; she said it belonged to her house. Mr. Clarke and Mr. Prothero went first, and she laid hold of my arm, and we went to her house. The house was in a little court, near Goswell-street, in a new row of houses, opposite St. John's-street. We unlocked the door with that key, and went up stairs, and in the garret we found all these things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How was I finishing these shillings? - She was sitting rubbing a shilling.</p>

               <p>What was I finishing it with? - Rubbing it with sand-paper.</p>
               <p>What was the water in? - I did not take particular notice of that.</p>

               <p>I went with Prothero and Jealous, on the 3d of August last. We first went to a place in a court at the top of St. John's-street. When I came to the house I received information that the prisoner was not then at home. Then we went to a court near the Cold-Bath, and saw her there sitting at a table, scowering a shilling with a piece of sand-paper; before her, upon the table where she was sitting at work, was this bottle of aqua-fortis, some water, and scouring-paper, and in her lap were seven counterfeit shillings, which I have got here (produces them.)</p>
               <p>Were those shillings finished? - No; they were what she was at work upon. There was the key of her house lying upon the same table. I asked her whose key that was; she said it was her's. I knew where her house was. After we had taken her into custody we went to her house; when we came there I asked her which was her house; she pointed out the house, and I unlocked the door with that key; we took her up to the garret, and in the garret we found these things; here are flasks, melting-pots, wrought arsenick; here is facing, which is what they use after they have put the impression upon the sand; the sand is porus; this is a fine sand, and it is laid upon it to make the impression come off clear; here is sand-paper, and some part of a get which is used to make the passage for the metal to run into the flasks; here are some shillings, but the impression is not come up; there are five, which are patterns, which clearly have made these impressions in the flask; here is other waste metal.</p>
               <p>You found none that were in any degree finished, except that which she was at work upon, when you went in? - Yes; there are three there that are finished; they lay by the side of the moulds in the other house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150079"/>Are they counterfeit? - They are; these are all counterfeits.</p>
               <p>Court. Whether that shilling you say she was at work upon was made from these impressions in this mould? - (After inspecting them) I do not think it was.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner with her, at the time you took her, all the necessary things to make this piece complete? - She certainly had.</p>
               <p>What was all that was wanting to make it complete? - Nothing but to be dipped into aqua-fortis; the aqua-fortis and water stood in a cup before her; dipping it in aqua-fortis and water forces the strength of the silver on the outside.</p>
               <p>Do they want rubbing afterwards? - With a little sand.</p>
               <p>Will a flask do for more than one casting, or must it be set afresh for every casting? - They make a fresh mould, for by taking the pieces out it spoils the impression; they generally keep a particular set of patterns for laying the mould.</p>
               <p>Do any of these correspond with the mould? - Two or three of them do.</p>
               <p>Mr. FLETCHER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a moneyer in the mint (inspects the three finished counterfeits). These are all bad.</p>

               <p>Mr. Clarke says he took these things all on my lap; the other men say there were some in my lap, and others on the table. They were all in my lap. I went to Mrs. Beckford's house. I was there before they came; she had pawned some things for me. A young woman came in that I had let the rooms to, and left these things with me. I did not know what was in my lap, one looked like a shilling, it was white and yellow. They watched this young woman from her mother's house to the house where I was. I believe she knew these men were pursuing her by her burry, so she dropped in there. It is not to be thought that a poor woman like me could do it. There was nothing in the apartment where I was. I had let the house to these people. I had not settled with my landlord on Saffron-hill. I could not take away my bed till I had settled.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, it seems that the man, touching whose death you are now about to enquire, was a kind of <rs id="t17790915-74-viclabel385" type="occupation">assistant at the Publick-office in Bow-street</rs>

The prisoner, who is charged with having murdered him, it seems cohabited with a man of the name of Farmello, lodged with him, and lived with him as his wife, (though not really married to him). On the morning of the 31st of July it seems there had been a quarrel in the house<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150080"/> where the prisoner lodged, between the prisoner at the bar and another woman, who lodged in the same house; from words they proceeded to blows, the consequence of which was, that the other woman went before a magistrate for the purpose of procuring a warrant to take up the prisoner and her husband for the assault committed upon her; when they came to enquire at the office in Bow-street, it was about three in the afternoon, they found then that there was no magistrate there, and that they could not have a warrant till six or seven o'clock in the evening; upon which the woman who came for the warrant begged to know whether there was any constable there that would go with her to take up the man of the name of Farmello, as an idle and disorderly person, and being a person within the description of the law that has lately passed for the recruiting of his majesty's forces; upon that a man of the name of Prothero, who is a constable of that parish, and who had a warrant authorising him to seise persons within that description, said he would go, and he spoke to Barnet who was there and desired him to go with him, they went together in company with the woman, to the house in Castle-street, where the prisoner at the bar and the man lodged; upon going up to his room-door they found it fastened, and I think Prothero knocked at the door and demanded to be admitted; that was refused to him; one of the people of the house said, there is no occasion to go in through that door, there is another room that communicates with this, I can unbolt that door for you; the person went and unbolted it, and Prothero the constable, together with William Barnet, entered the room; in the room there were no persons but the prisoner at the bar and Farmello, who was a journeyman shoemaker, and followed that business in his lodgings. When Prothero came in he said to the man you must come along with us; Farmello made no answer, but the constable repeated it again; the man made no kind of resistance or show of resistance, for I think he had a rasp in his hand at the time, which he put out of his hand and had no weapon of offence about him, nor did he seem to meditate any kind of injury to any body; but the prisoner at the bar, who had in her hand a long knife, without a word having been said to her, without any kind of provocation having been given to her, ran at Barnet and plunged the knife into his breast, of which wound he languished till four o'clock the next day and then died.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, this will be the nature of the evidence that will be submitted to your consideration, and it being a clear fact upon which nobody can doubt that this man's death was occasioned by the wound given him by the prisoner; it will then remain for your consideration, under the direction of his lordship, whether there are to be found any circumstances in this case which will extenuate the offence to manslaughter.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I shall take leave shortly to state to you what I conceive to be the law upon this subject, which I do the more readily, because I have the honour to speak before judges of known and consummate abilities.</p>
               <p>I take it to be a settled principle of criminal law, that wherever there is a voluntary felonious homicide, without provocation, it will amount to murder. If it turns out in fact that the constable and his assistant were strictly in the execution of their duty and their office, there then could be no question at all made, but what this must necessarily amount to the offence of murder. But I own I doubt, myself, whether the constable was in the due execution of his office, for though he was possessed of a warrant which authorised him to search for people of a certain description, I confess it does not appear to me that the man who was the object of that search was a person who fell within the description of that law, and though the constable received that kind of information, yet I conceive a constable is always acting at his peril in that respect; and I doubt extremely whether he can be said to be in the execution of his office. But supposing that he was not in the execution of his office, then the constable and this man who was his assistant can only be considered in the light of trespassers,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150081"/> that is, they are persons who without any legal authority, got into the room of another, and in so doing have barely committed a trespass; for you will observe that at this time there was no arrest of the person nor any attempt of that kind made before the blow was given, they had proceeded no farther than a menace of taking up the man, by that expression,</p>
               <p>"you must go along with me;" so they were, as I said, barely trespassers. Now I take it to be one of the decided cases, that where a trespasser is found upon the land of another, and the other with a dangerous weapon, likely from its nature to kill, gives him a blow which occasions his death, the law says it is such an indication of that brutal conduct which implies malice, that such offence in the eye of the law amounts to murder. Now considering this case in that point of view, and considering these men as barely trespassers in the room of Farmello, without doing any thing more, I should conceive that the conduct of that unfortunate woman such as it was, subjects her to the extent of the charge against her, namely that of wilful murder.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, there seems another way in which this matter may be considered also, which is this, supposing they were not in the legal execution of their office, but the constable and his assistant had actually attempted to apprehend the man, I conceive then if the man himself, whose liberty was so attempted to be invaded, had resisted and killed the constable or his assistant, that would clearly amount to no more than manslaughter. But I think it a matter of great doubt and worthy of consideration, whether the law gives that favour to any other persons except the person whose liberty was actually attempted to be invaded. Here there was no menace or threat against the prisoner; she was not the object of their warrant or search, nor was meant to be apprehended; she was merely a person standing by upon whom no attack was made. It seems to me therefore, considered in either point of view, with respect to her, the offence of murder imputed to her cannot possibly be lowered. I have taken the liberty to state my opinion upon the subject, under the correction of the learned judges upon the bench, from whom I have no doubt you will receive proper instructions upon the subject, and I have no doubt but you will discharge the duty imposed on you as you ought to do.</p>

               <p>I am a constable of the parish of St. Martin in the Fields. At about half after four o'clock in the afternoon of the 31st of July, I was at home at my own house, which is in Castle-street. Barnet the deceased came to my house and asked me if I would go with him to impress a man who had been beating a woman, and had almost murdered her; he said he was a loose, idle, disorderly man, and came within the meaning of the act to be pressed; I asked him how he knew that; he said the two women were at the door and would inform me of the nature of it; I came to the door; the two women were there; one was terribly beat; I enquired further into the matter; they said he was a loose, drunken, noisy man, and lived with a woman who was not his wife. Barnet and I went with them.</p>
               <p>Had you any warrant or authority under which you acted? - I had this (producing it). I went to the house, it is a publick-house in Castle-street, Long-acre; it was within 150 yards of my house. When I went into the passage of the house, I saw three men standing on the stairs. One said here is the constable coming up stairs to take him; I told them not to be in a hurry, but show me the door; they showed it me; I tapped at it with my hand; I had nothing in my hand; a question was asked from within by Farmello, as I imagine, as it was a man's voice, who is there? I said it is me, open the door. A servant maid in a room adjoining, said you need not go in that way, you may go in this way; that was a door in the middle of the wainscot which was a communication from one room to the other. Mr. Stephens and Mr. Ellis, who were in the room, went and unbolted the door, as the bolt was on their side. When they unbolted the door I went in.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150082"/> Were Stephens and Ellis of your company? - Yes. When I went in I saw Farmello standing in the middle of the room straight before me.</p>
               <p>Did you know Farmello before? - I did not. The prisoner stood on my left hand; when I went into the room I just waved my finger, I had nothing in my hand; and I said to Farmello, come my friend, you must go along with me; the answer he made me was what for? Barnet, the deceased stood on the right hand side of me and said, before I could make an answer to his question, come, come, you must go. Upon that the prisoner stepped by me in front of me, and I saw her strike Barnet, and she said, I think it was, d - n you, he shan't; I think that was the word; I know it was an oath. When her hand quitted him, I saw the knife was left sticking in his body, upon that he turned out of the room and said Lord have mercy upon me, I am killed, I turned round with a view of securing the man; I observed then that he had in his hand a long rasp (a kind of coarse file) about fourteen inches long; I had not observed the rasp before. I ran up to him and said what you villain do you intend to murder me; I struck him as hard as I could with my hand, and he either threw it out of his hand or dropped it, I cannot tell which; I catched him by the collar, and got hold of the woman; I begged Mr. Stephens and Mr. Ellis to assist me, which they did, and we secured them.</p>
               <p>How long did the deceased live? - Twenty-four hours within a few minutes.</p>
               <p>What became of Farmello then? - He is out upon bail for the assault upon Stephens.</p>
               <p>But he has never been sent any where under this impress act? - No.</p>
               <p>I understand he was a journeyman shoemaker? - I was told so.</p>

               <p>I lodged in the same house the prisoner and Farmello lodged in. I went on Saturday the 31st of July to the office in Bow-street to get a warrant for their abusing me. Mr. Barnet was over the way in Bow-street; I went to him, and told him I wanted a warrant for Mrs. Farmello (as they called her) for abusing me; he said I could not have one till six o'clock. I asked him if I could not get one elsewhere; he said he did not know. He asked what sort of people they were, and who they were. I said there was a man lived with her that had a wife of his own that he did not live with, and that he did not mind his business. He asked me if I was sure of that; my husband made answer that he did not.</p>
               <p>Had you any complaint against Farmello? - No; they never affronted me till that day. My husband said they always worked on a Sunday, Mr. Barnett said, if he lives with another woman, not his wife, he is under the act, and liable to be pressed; he said he would get Mr. Prothero to go along with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150083"/> us; he went with us to Mr. Prothero's house, and then we went to the house; what happened up stairs I do not know. I sat in the passage a few minutes; as I went up stairs I met Barnett coming out of the room with a knife in his left side. He said O dear! O dear! three times, and asked me to take it out. I turned my back on him, and said nothing more.</p>

               <p>How long had these people lodged at this house? - Six weeks.</p>

               <p>Had Barnet said or done any thing to her previous to that? - Not that I saw; upon that Barnet turned round, and went out of the room.</p>

The minutes therefore of the special verdict are now drawing up by the counsel on each side, and will afterwards be read to you for your approbation.</p>

             proceeded thus.)</p>
               <p>Gentlemen,</p>
               <p>The counsel for the prisoner has just now very properly suggested to us that he thinks the jury ought to exercise their discretion upon the matter, if they think fit to take it upon themselves to say whether it is murder or manslaughter, because if you should be of opinion, upon what I shall state to you, and what I hope my brothers will, that it is only manslaughter, then there is no occasion to debate the matter more solemnly, and it is sit that the prisoner should have that chance. But if you should be of opinion that it is too much to take upon yourselves, you may be relieved from it by finding a special verdict. It is my duty, therefore, to tell you, which I shall do in a very few words, what I conceive this crime to be, and I should be exceedingly happy if I could in my conscience look upon it as amounting only to manslaughter, but am sorry to say that I cannot, as I see her act in a very different light from that in which I should have considered the act of the man himself. If Farmello, when the constables entered the room as they did with an insufficient warrant, or perhaps with a sufficient one, but not disclosing the business upon which they came, if he had immediately, in his own defence, rather than suffer himself to be impressed, done the deed that unfortunately ended in the man's death, I should have thought that would have amounted only to manslaughter; but I consider this woman in the light of an absolute stranger, a mere stander-by, a woman who had no right to be concerned in any degree whatever for him; she was not his wife, if she had been so it might have been a very different consideration; but standing in the light she does, notwithstanding her cohabitation with him, she is in the eye of the law a mere stranger to him to all intents and purposes; that stranger, (when the officers came in, whether they had a warrant or no, whether it was legal or no) before he made any resistance, when he only asked why am I to go? at that instant she stabbed the deceased; she took no method whatever to prevent his arrest; she did not argue with them; she did not struggle with them; she did not supplicate them; she said not a word, but in the instant before any answer could come out of any of their mouths, she stabbed the deceased. I fairly confess that I think this can amount in point of law to nothing less than murder. I know there have been cases where this doctrine has been considered heretofore, and there have been some doubts entertained upon the subject how far a mere stranger, a stander-by, is at liberty to interpose; when that interposition is justifiable, or when it is officious. In one of those cases, where a person was taken up by a constable who was out of his jurisdiction, and had not therefore a proper authority, a person interposing occasioned the death of another, and the majority of the judges held that a justifiable interposition, but without giving any opinion upon that determination at present, there were very different circumstances attending that case, because in that there was a general scuffle; a struggle and conflict between the parties; the blood might be supposed to be heated on both sides; that blow was not given in the cool manner in which. this murder was perpetrated, in the instant before any blood could be heated, or any sort of provocation given beyond that which you have heard. I am therefore clearly of opinion that this does, upon the whole of the case, amount to murder. I wished to have avoided giving you my opinion upon the point; however I have done it as it strikes me, but I hope my brothers will give you their sense of the matter, that you may have the assistance of much fuller and abler directions.</p>
               <p>Mr. JUSTICE GOULD.</p>
               <p>I am very far from differing in opinion with my brother Hotham; but I think in every case where the life of a fellow-subject is at stake, it becomes the judges, if they see any difficulty in the way, to proceed with the utmost-caution; to remember that maxim of the law, that no delay is too long<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150085"/> where the life of a man is at stake. The reason of my suggesting what I have done to my brothers was the recollection of a principle that is laid down in two authorities, one of them was alluded to in a most candid manner by the counsel for the prosecution, Hugget's case, which was in the time of L. C. J. Hale; the other was in the time of Queen Anne. The case of the queen and Tooley, both of which cases, as I recollect, were upon special verdicts, and the principle that is laid down in each of them, and which makes me wish to have this case, undergo a future consideration is, that where an attempt against law is made, with force and violence, to deprive an Englishman of his liberty, it is a provocation to every fellow-subject in the kingdom, because every man is called upon to preserve the constitutional liberty of his fellow-subject, when he is attempted illegally to be deprived of it. Now, in this case, there can be no question upon the fact upon Prothero's evidence, but that he and Barnet, the deceased, did attempt illegally to deprive Farmello of his liberty, and most emphatically I may apply it to Barnet the unfortunate deceased, because when Farmello asked</p>
               <p>"what for?" by no means implying that he was willing to go, Barnet says,</p>
               <p>"come, come, you must go;" that in plain English necessarily implies I will force you to go. Now a material observation has been made by my brother, that there was no resistance offered by Farmello, in truth, his person was not touched, there was no affray began, but the prisoner seeing that Farmello would be taken away in an illegal manner, she, in this rash way, occasions death. The doubt which I have, is, upon the principle which is laid down in these two authorities, which I do wish to have a further consideration of, at the same time desiring it to be understood, that I do not, in my present sentiments, at all differ from the idea and opinion delivered by my learned brother.</p>
               <p>Mr. JUSTICE ASHHURST.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt, but that in a case of this kind, where a person is indicted for murder, the jury have a right, if they think fit, to give a general verdict; in doing of which they necessarily must take upon themselves the determination of the law upon the subject. If the case appears to them to be doubtful, they may rather choose to relieve their own minds from the difficulty of deciding upon the law, and giving a general verdict ( either murder or manslaughter) and may find the facts specially, in order that the question of law may ultimately be determined (upon argument) by the judges. It was the desire of the prisoner's counsel, that this option might be given to the jury, whether they choose to take upon themselves the decision of the law, and to give a general verdict, or whether they choose to have the facts found specially. You have not signified your inclination whether you choose to exercise that option or not. But supposing you should be inclined to exercise it, in that case it is fit and proper that we should inform you what are our opinions as to the law arising from the facts before you. Now I own, as to that I do not myself at present entertain much doubt with respect to those two cases that have been alluded to of Huggets and Tooley. I own, if the same facts had now been before me (sitting here) that are mentioned in those cases, I do not know that I should perfectly have coincided with the opinion which the majority of the judges gave in those cases, or at least not with the reasons upon which their opinions were founded; but however allowing these cases their full weight, I think in the present case there are circumstances appearing, that makes this case distinguishable from either of those two cases. With regard to the case of the King and Toddy, the facts there seem not to be reported quite so fully as they might have been, but as it is reported it appears, that the constable having taken a woman to the watch-house (and as far as appears, illegally; he having acted out of his jurisdiction) some soldiers afterwards, feeling a compassion for the case of the woman, came to the watch-house, and attempted a rescue; now from that circumstance, their having actually attempted a rescue, it is plain there was some act done by them, and some affray probably<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150086"/> happened before the time the mortal wound was given; and if, in the prosecuting that act, and meeting with opposition, their blood became warm, and they gave one of the parties, opposing them, a mortal wound; that might be deemed manslaughter; not upon the ground</p>
               <p>"that it is a sufficient provocation, where any of the king's subjects sees the liberty of another subject invaded, immediately to give a mortal blow to the person so invading it;" but upon this ground, that having lawfully interposed, in order to prevent the invasion of his liberty, and, meeting with opposition, his blood might be heated by the contest, and the wound being given in that heat of blood, it shall extenuate the case to manslaughter; so far I go with that determination, taking it upon that ground; but in this case there is no such circumstance appearing; all that appears in this case is, that these constables, endeavouring to restrain Farmello of his liberty (and that illegally, he not being a proper object of the impress laws) the prisoner standing by (without any previous attempt to rescue, without any scuffle between her and the constables, which might have warmed her blood, the man himself standing quietly, and not making any resistance) draws out a knife, and stabs the deceased in a vital part. I own it does not appear to me that that can be considered in any other light than as murder. These are my sentiments upon the subject, which I thought it my duty to give you, that if you do choose to exercise that right you have of finding a general verdict, and to say it is either murder or manslaughter, you may have the best assistance we can give you respecting the law of the case, but if you choose to relieve your minds from that difficulty you may find the facts specially, and refer it to the decision of the judges.</p>

On the 29th of August I missed a pair of silver shoe-buckles; afterwards I missed another pair of buckles that were my wife's, and a tea-spoon. I charged the prisoner with taking them, and told her if she would confess generously I would forgive her. She told me where these things, and a great many more, were pawned. I went and paid about 2 l. 4 s. for them, and I came home and sent the prisoner about her business. On the Tuesday following I went to a woman's that used to come after the prisoner. I found the prisoner there. I told her I missed several things more, and begged her to tell me where the things were. She then told me of the three books. Then the woman and she began abusing me, and said they would punish me for what I had done.</p>
               <p>Where did she say the books were? - At the same pawnbrokers. They shut the door upon me. I was aggravated by the usage I met with, and went and got an officer, and took the prisoner up. Mr. Townsend is the pawnbroker where the things were pawned.</p>

               <p>Was that before or after her being brought to bed? - She did not appear to be different to what she used to be.</p>
               <p>Did you think her to be with child? - I had known that she was with child about a fortnight.</p>

               <p>What do you know of her being brought to bed of a child? - About three o'clock in the afternoon two of my children went to the vault; they came back and said they heard a noise of a child crying.

            , a lodger, he attempted to take it out, but before he had accomplished it Mr. Ellis, who is now here, came to his assistance, and they took it out.</p>
               <p>What is Mr. Ellis? - A jeweller, I believe, he lives at the next door.</p>
               <p>What condition was the child in when it was taken out? - I cannot say, I was so frightened that I fainted away, when I came to myself I saw it upon the carpet, and the ladies were cleaning it.</p>
               <p>When it was cleansed how did it appear? - I cannot say much of that for I went to take care of her, and did not attend the child.</p>
               <p>Did the child cry or move? - Yes, it cried. After the child was found the ladies were very desirous to know the mother. Then I taxed Miss Gwatkin with it, upon which she said, if I would walk into the parlour she would tell me. She said it was an accident, and that she had no thoughts of a murder.</p>
               <p>How did she account for it? - She said she had occasion to go to the vault; that she was delivered on the vault, and the child dropped into it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150089"/>At what time did the prisoner tell you she had been delivered of the child? - She did not tell me any time, nor did I ask her. I was in the yard from eleven o'clock till two hanging out some clothes and taking them in; I imagine I should have heard the child if it had then been in the vault, as I was close by the vault for the whole morning, and the yard is very small; it is not more than two yards square. At three o'clock in the morning I took the child out of the bed, it ate two spoonfuls of gruel, and it opened its eyes and appeared to me as well as any new born infant I ever had of my own; in half an hour after that it fell into a convulsion fit and died upon the nurse's knee.</p>
               <p>ELISABEEH TRACEY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mrs. Robinson. I saw Miss Gwatkin at eight o'clock in the morning, when I went to open the door for a lady who is a lodger; she asked me to fetch her twopenny-worth of brandy; she said it was for Miss Baldwin's tooth-ach.</p>
               <p>Who is Miss Baldwin? - She is here; she lived in the house. Miss Baldwin came down in the morning, and said she had had a bad night with the tooth-ach. At eleven o'clock I saw Miss Gwatkin sitting at work as well as usual; the door was open as I passed by. I was down in the kitchen at about three o'clock when Miss Robinson came down into the kitchen, and said she heard a noise like a child or kitten in the vault. My mistress took a candle and looked down the necessary; upon this Mr. Dowson attempted to take up the board but could not. Mr. Ellis came down and took up two boards; he said there was a child; I returned into the kitchen and heard no more for two hours after. Between three and four in the morning the nurse called me up and said the child was in a fit. The child died in a fit.</p>
               <p>Did you see the child after it was taken out of the vault before it was in a fit? - I did.</p>
               <p>Where did you see it? - In a person's lap who was dressing it.</p>
               <p>How did it seem then? - Very well.</p>
               <p>What time was that? - That was between four and five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the prisoner's having told any body of her having been delivered of a child? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing more of this matter? - No further than that Miss Gwatkin took the candle once and looked down the vault; she said it could be nothing but a kitton. It must have rolled down under the boards.</p>
               <p>Did you suspect it to be a child then? - No, I thought it to be a kitten then.</p>
               <p>When was this? - At the time of the alarm, before the boards were taken up.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>At about two o'clock I believe, or it might be half after, I took up the boards of the necessary house, and found the child there.</p>
               <p>Could you form any conjecture how long it had been there? - No.</p>
               <p>When it was cleaned in what condition of health was it? - It cried. As soon as I had taken it out I delivered it to Mrs. Bailey, and went for a midwife to the mother. I brought Mr. Jackson, an apothecary in Newgate-street; he has a partner that is a man-midwife; he was not in the way; we begged Mr. Jackson to come and attend the woman.</p>
               <p>Was the child in good health or bad? - It appeared in pretty good health; Mr. Jackson thought it might live; so did I.</p>
               <p>In good health was it? - Pretty good health; not so hearty as it might have been if it had not been down there. I thought it was likely. to live.</p>
               <p>Did you see the child afterwards? - Yes; I saw it again in the evening about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>How was it then? - Revived very much to what it was before; it cried, and they talked that it had ate; I did not see it eat, but it was more lively. The next day I heard of its death. I live at the next house; I was not present when it died.</p>
               <p>Mr. JACKSON sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 23d of July last Mr. Ellis came for my partner; he not being in the way, I attended him to the house to see the infant.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150090"/>In what condition did you send it? - I found it washed, and the umbilical chord (the navel string) had not been secured; I therefore immediately secured that, and desired them to rub the stomach of the child with a little warm brandy; I thought the child might recover.</p>
               <p>You found it rather sick? - Rather sick and faint.</p>
               <p>At what time was you called? - About four in the afternoon. I waited about a quarter of an hour with the child, I found it so much better, that I desired them to use the brandy, and to rub it with flannel, as I thought there was a great probability of the child's recovering.</p>
               <p>When did you see the child again? - About eight in the evening; it was then better in every respect; I then took with me Mr. Wade, my partner, we found the child better, and were both of opinion the child would recover.</p>
               <p>Did you think it had recovered, or had any remains of the languor occasioned by the exposition? - Very little of the languor; it recovered in every respect; we directed the child to be put up in the warm bed with the mother; and Mr. Wade upon coming down said that the prisoner was much pleased at seeing the child so much recovered, she said every thing should be done that could to save it, and every thing she could do for restoring it.</p>
               <p>Did you continue to attend the child? - I did not see it any more; I called in the morning and found the child dead. They told me it died about four in the morning of a convulsive sit in the nurse's lap.</p>
               <p>Do you conceive that convulsive fit to be in any degree occasioned by the situation in which the child originally was? - It is almost impossible to answer that. There are many infants that die of convulsions that appear very likely to live; and it is very clear that the child was not much hurt by the stench of the place as it lived near thirteen hours afterwards. I cannot say positively to that question.</p>
               <p>Do you incline to think that was not the cause of its death? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>You say the child was almost well? - It was abundantly better in the evening in every respect, and I had hopes of its recovery.</p>
               <p>Were your hopes of its recovery very strong in the evening about seven o'clock? - Yes, both myself and partner were of the same opinion.</p>
               <p>Then you thought it would recover? - I had scarce a doubt of its recovery, nor had my partner.</p>
               <p>When you say you had scarce any doubt that the child would recover, you seem to acknowledge that their was a little remains of the languor still upon it? - There was, but it was trifling.</p>
               <p>You practise midwifery? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you think this child was come to its full time? - I think it was.</p>
               <p>Have not you known some instances in the course of your practice, where women have been suddenly taken in labour? - My partner practises midwifery.</p>
               <p>But from that sort of intercourse you have with your partner do not you think it possible that women in certain situations might be delivered at a time not expected? - There are many instances of that.</p>
               <p>Had this child any mark of violence on it at the time you saw it? - I forgot to mention that I carefully examined when I first saw the child, and there was not the least mark of violence upon it. I was not satisfied with my own examination, but likewise desired Mr. Wade to examine, and neither of us could find the least mark of any violence upon it.</p>
               <p>When did the mother express her satisfaction that the child was so well? - When it was carried up between seven and eight in the evening.</p>
               <p>Whether you think it possible that a woman, being at a necessary, upon a needful occasion, may be taken in labour, and for the child to drop from her into the necessary without her putting it there? - I have made enquiry respecting that; I have never known an instance of it; I have frequently heard of its being so, and I was informed of a lady, whose name it may not be necessary to mention here, that had her child drop into the necessary. I think it very probable.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Friday the 23rd of July Mr. Ellis came to me between the hours of one and three, and asked me to lend him a hammer, a hatchet and a chissel; I lent them to him; in five minutes after that another gentleman came and said there was a child in the vault. I went immediately to Mr. Robinson's, which was next door to my house, when I came there Mr. Ellis had got up one board; then I saw the child's feet; he took up the other board and took out the child, and put it into a lodger's apron; I put that apron into my apron and carried it into the fore parlour; the child cried twice before we took it out of the vault; but I do not remember its crying afterwards till we got it into the parlour; it was then very faint and low; I rubbed it with things, and did all I could to bring it to itself; I asked for something to wash the child with; I desired Mr. Ellis to go to my house and bring some warm water which was on the fire, and some Holland's Geneva, which he did. I was in a fright. Mr. Bailey said to Mrs. Robinson, who have you had in your house to day? she said no stranger; then one of the gentlemen said the mother of the child must be in the room. I wrapped the child up, and laid it on the floor, and said to the prisoner, I beg your pardon, ma'am, but you are the mother of the child, she said, O no, I am not; I said do not deny it, you are; she said for God's sake have mercy! we went into the room together; I said if you are the mother of the child, for God's sake do not deny it, she said I am the mother of the child! I said stay here, I will fetch something for you; in my flurry instead of bringing things fit for the mother and child, I brought some old rough dried shirts of Mr. Bailey's.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner confessed she was the mother of the child, did she tell you any thing about the manner of her delivery? - She said she was upon the vault and it fell from her.</p>
               <p>Did she give any reason why she did not tell of it? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you a married woman? - I am.</p>
               <p>Can you give an opinion respecting it? - There is a difference in women.</p>
               <p>Do you think there are any women to whom that accident might happen? - I do not think it possible.</p>
               <p>You said there is a difference in women, but do not you think it possible with any woman? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>I do not understand that you have ever practised as a midwife? - No.</p>
               <p>Therefore the ground of your observation must be very confined indeed? - I have been the mother of children.</p>
               <p>As you have not practised as a midwife, nor are yourself a very old woman, the possibility of information to you must be but little? - I answer according to my judgement.</p>
               <p>Court. You have only hitherto spoken of the state of the child when it was first taken out, and a quarter of an hour after, did you see the child in the after part of the evening? - I wrapped the child up in a petticoat and put it on the carpet, I found it very cold, after that I carried it down to the fire, and warmed it as well as I could; I never saw the child after that day till the coroner's inquest sat upon it.</p>
               <p>In what condition was it when you saw it about five o'clock? - Very weak and low, but I think stronger than when I took it out, it had recovered in some measure.</p>
               <p>When you saw it at five, you say it was a good deal better, but did you think it was quite recovered of the first sickness? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you expect it would live at that time? - I cannot say, I did.</p>

               <p>You did not see it then about the time of its dying? - No; I was not near the child after five or six o'clock.</p>

               <p>You are I believe a man-midwife and surgeon? - I am.</p>
               <p>You have been in court and heard the evidence in the course of the trial? - I have.</p>
               <p>Then from your experience and knowledge in the profession, I beg you will state to the court whether it is not extremely probable and possible for women to be delivered in the manner you have heard described? - It is certainly possible, I have known several instances in the course of my practice where I have been very near at hand and have been called and when I have attended my patient, I have found a child born.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you a man-midwife? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long have you practiced that profession? - Nine years.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you ever known any instance that makes it possible for a woman not to be delivered suddenly by herself without assistance, but in such a manner that she being upon the necessary house the child might drop into the hole? are you of opinion that might happen? - I am clear it can happen.</p>
               <p>Could not a woman who should find herself in that situation rise from the seat so as to prevent the child from dropping into the hole? - I cannot answer to that.</p>
               <p>Court. If she had a mind to drop it there she might perhaps, the question is whether she could not prevent it? - To that I cannot answer.</p>

               <p>How long have you practised midwifery - About twenty-three years.</p>
               <p>Have you, in the course of your practice, known any such sudden deliveries as that, if a woman had been at the necessary-house, she could not have moved from the place so as to have prevented dropping the child down the hole? - I have known women delivered at the camp-necessaries drop the children into the hole, not being able to help themselves; those children have been taken up, and though bruised they have lived, and the languor of this child might very easily be accounted for from the umbilical chord not being secured.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150093"/>I believe you may know that very young children are often taken off, with convulsion fits exceeding suddenly? - The most healthy children often are.</p>
               <p>Where you have had no expectation of it before? - Very suddenly.</p>
               <p>Dr. DOMINICETI sworn.</p>
               <p>I have delivered 2000 women of children. I have seen instances of women being at the little-house, going through other evacuations, and the child has followed.</p>
               <p>In those cases could not the woman remove from the place? - It is impossible when it is so sudden. I never heard the name of the prisoner, nor anything about her, only being present in court I speak what I know.</p>
               <p>Mr. DEPUTY AXFORD sworn.</p>
               <p>You know, I believe, the young woman at the bar? - I do.</p>
               <p>And her family and connexions? - I do.</p>
               <p>What has been her reputation and character? - Respecting her family they are equal to any people in the country of Hereford; as to her character, when she came to London she has been at my house, and Mr. Alderman Sainsbury's, and some houses that I know who have connexions with her family, but on account of a little dispute between her family and her she thought proper to get into some business to earn her bread, in consequence of which she went to work for a linen-draper at the other end of the town; he came to me to enquire her character; I told him I would be answerable to any amount he might entrust her with, and if she had applied to me I should have entrusted her with any thing she might have wanted. I could not have conceived she could be capable of destroying a child of her own body.</p>
