On the 6th of February last I retired to rest about eleven o'clock at night, and as I supposed about two or three o'clock in the morning, I heard a noise, I attributed it, however, to some company going away from the next house; it did not induce me to arise.</p>
               <p>Q. What does your family consist of - A. Myself and wife, and I think at that time there were three maid servants sleeping in the house, and the children.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what state your house was in when you went to bed, as to its fastenings - A. I did not particularly examine it that night, I remained till about seven o'clock in the morning, when one of my servants knocked at my door, and informed me that the house had been robbed; I immediately went down stairs, I found the kitchen in disorder, the drawers of the dresser being open.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose then it was quite light - A. It was then quite day light, and the door on the side of the house, leading out into the yard, was open; I concluded they went out that way; there was no marks of violence there. I missed several things, a great coat, half a dozen pair of boots, and two gowns belonging to my wife, a wine strainer and some silver spoons; I had a servant of the name of Ive, she informed me that she had lost a considerable quantity of wearing apparel. Upon this; after I had dressed myself, I went into the fore court, where I discovered a small iron bar which goes across the outside of the laundry window was forced away, it had been fastened on by screws, it appeared to have been wrenched off; I rather suppose that the inside shutter had been neglected to be fastened, besides that there were two little mortise bolts which fastened the window down at the bottom; I apprehended the bolts had not been properly put in; and when this little bar was moved, which was the centre bar of three bars, the window would open, and that is the way they easily could enter. The cross bar was in the center of the two others, and I think there was room enough for a man to go through between the two others. The laundry communicates to the kitchen and the lower part of the house, the laundry was in the front, and the kitchen at the back of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you heard the noise in the night what quarter of the house did that noise seem to you to come from - A. I awoke in the night; it was not sufficient for me to tell where it was; the impression on my mind was that it was a step of a carriage being put down. On the top of the kitchen stairs there is a door always fastened every night by an iron bar, that prevented their getting up stairs. With regard to the property being stolen, I have seen some of it since.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 6th of February what time did you go to bed - A.About half past ten or eleven; before I went to bed I fastened the outer doors, and the door in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to the lower windows of the house, did you look at them - A.The shutter on the inside of this window was not fast, owing to the iron bar being lost; I cannot say whether the window was bolted down or not; I saw all the cross bars safe in the course of the day, and all the lower windows in the rest of the house were fastened.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the door of the yard was fastened when you went to bed - A. Yes; I looked at it the last thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get up in the morning - A.About seven o'clock; Mary Hatfield, the house maid, was up first.</p>
               <p>Q. You got up at seven, it was light then - A. No; it was getting light; I was just coming down, the house maid came up to me and said there had been thieves in the house. When I went down stairs I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180912060004"/>found this door open, I missed two gowns, a yellow one and a dark one, and I lost several caps, and other things; I left them on the over night on the dresser in the kitchen; my master's coat was hanging on the kitchen door; and six or seven pair of boots were behind the door. I saw the middle bar of the laundry window wrenched off; it was left hanging at one end.</p>

I believe it was Sunday night, three weeks back, I was on board Mr. Nockell's ship, the Monmouth, Cornelius came down for a light, I was a bed, I knew him, he belonged to the Hibernia, I told him if he would feel upon the top of the chest, he would find a tinder box, he struck a light himself, he went upon deck and fetched Gray down. Gray asked my fellow apprentice for the key, he told him he had not got it, then they asked me for the key of the hold, I told them I had not got it, my fellow apprentice had got them. He made Sealey go and get them, he told him to unlock the door, he did; they went down in the hold and sent me upon deck to watch for fear our mate should come. I saw them come up with a bucket of rum, they went on board their own ship, they came down and got another bucket, and told me to come with them on board their ship, they gave me four bottles, two for Sealey and two for me. I took them on board, they told me I had no occasion to be afraid, they allowed three inches leakage in a cask, and we had a nice place below to keep it. On Monday morning, when the mate came on board, I told him that Gray and Cornelius were taking the rum on shore. The officers stopped it.</p>

On the night of the 18th of November, a little after twelve, I went about Mr. How's grounds, to see if there were any poachers. I found a net at a gate on the Wednesday night before; I saw Wicks on the Saturday night, the night in question; I saw Wicks on the 18th in Mr. How's park; Lee was in company with me; I had left him at a certain place while I went to the gate; I had a dog with me. I saw Wicks get up out of a bush, and go towards the gate; it was a bright moon light night. I did not know Wicks then; I saw a man get over the gate; I ran up to the gate and holloed to him to stop. I called to my dog, hold him; my dog was a little way behind; he did not come up instantly. I ran after Wicks holloing to him to stop, or I would shoot him; he was running; he turned round instantly and fired at me; I instantly fired at him. We were about the distance of thirty yards; he stopped till I came up to him; then, and turned round the butt end of the gun to me. I asked him who he was; he would not speak. I told him I had another charge, having a double barrelled gun; my dog came up and seized him by the smock frock. I turned the butt end of my gun at him, to avoid discharging it at him; we fought some time with the guns; the dog kept hold of him all the time; and when he spoke, he said, pray do not take my life away. I never stuck him afterwards; I took the gun out of his hands and put it in the hedge; the dog still holding him, I collared him and got the dog off. Lee came up, I told him to take hold of the man; the prisoner said to Lee, you are a d - nd tight fellow, ant you.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw Wicks turn round for the purpose<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180912060006"/>of firing, were you near enough to see which way he pointed the gun - A. I did not know he had a gun at the time I saw him turn round and front me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say whether Wicks knowed your voice - A. He knew me before, he had seen me often enough; he knew I was game keeper to Mr. How. I was in my shooting dress that night. This is the gun that Wicks had, it is cracked in the stock just by the lock; I thought it was broken by my fighting;. Wicks said it would kill at seventy yards it is longer in the barrel than most guns. I got the prisoner into Mr. How's out-house and searched him; I found powder and number one shot on him, and a knife.</p>
               <p>Court. Young man you told us you did not know he had a gun in his hand, of course you could not see till he fired, were you sensible of any motion of any wind at the time the gun went off. - A. No; I thought I heard a shot in the hedge at the time when the gun went off, I could not take my oath of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the dog up to you when the prisoner let his gun off. - A. No; the dog was between the gate and me, he had not passed me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner in July last. - A. I saw him in July, the time of our hay harvest, we was having a merry making, and Johnston was among them, Wicks and Johnston were talking about shooting, Wicks was boasting of shooting with Johnston for a guinea. I said to Wicks, mind what you are about or else Johnston will catch you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Johnston hear this. - A. No; Johnston was a little way behind, I was thinking that if Wicks went out a poaching, Johnston would catch him, he said, if I was in an hedge and I thought he saw me, I would be d - nd if I would not blow his brains out. I said to Johnston, when he and I went round the ground, mind what you are after, Wicks says he will blow your brains out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When he first saw me at the gate they were both together. I did not know who they were, I tried to make my escape, to run away if I could, he holloed, hoy, stop, if you do not stop I will shoot you, I went to turn round to stop, my gun went off, I could not help it, I had been trying to shoot a rabbit; he set the dog on me, I held my gun up that he might not beat my brains out; the dog pulled me down. I got up, and the dog got me down again: he beat me so, I have no use of my arms, and one of my fingers is beaten all to pieces.</p>

When I got to the top story, I perceived the wet come through the ceiling: I went upon the roof, and found the lead was missing from the gutters of all the three houses, except a small piece that hung over to blind my sight: by seeing that, I should have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180912060007"/>concluded the lead was all safe; the piece that was left was about three feet long at the end. I went into one of the kitchens of the unfinished houses, and saw some lead standing up by the kitchen wall, concealed; some boards were placed round it. I went to Mr. Armstrong and the other officers to come and watch with me. About half seven I saw a man come on the terrace: he jumped from there into the house where I saw the lead. In two or three minutes he returned with something under his arm like a bundle: he went off with the bundle. Mr. Armstrong went into the houses, and said one of the pieces of lead were gone. In about a quarter of an hour, the same man returned again: I am certain it was the same man by his walk and by his coat: I saw him jump down the same place again; the officers had placed themselves in the kitchen during the time he was gone; I took a lanthorn, and went into the empty house, and saw the prisoner in the custody of the officers: he had moved the lead three feet from where I had seen it on the same day; I am sure he is the man that was taken. I am quite clear of it. I was looking out of the one pair of stairs window when he first came; the lamp gave a light to the terrace.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went in the kitchen, the prisoner had none of the lead about him then. - A. No, the prisoner was secured, and taken before a magistrate: on comparing the lead in the kitchen with that upon the house, they were the same in breadth and thickness; it made a complete join: I make no doubt but that it was the lead that came off my houses.</p>

            . On the night of the 5th of November, Mr. Emmins applied to me: I went with Bishop and my son to some new houses of his in Hackkney Road. I had a candle and lanthorn, and saw the lead behind the boards in the kitchen: there were two pieces; one a very large roll, and the other a small one: the timber was put over them as before; then I and Bishop went to the adjoining house: after I had been there some time, I had occasion to go through that very house where the lead was, I found one piece gone from the kitchen: then Bishop placed himself in the front kitchen, and I placed myself to command a view of the kitchen where the lead was left: in about twenty minutes I heard something; I looked and let it come into the second kitchen, where the lead was. I saw the figure of a man; I seized him, and never let him go, which was the prisoner at the bar. Bishop instantly came to me and the prosecutor; I sent him for a candle and lanthorn; I never quitted the prisoner till he got a candle and landthorn, and then the prosecutor measured the wall where the lead lodged against, from where it laid flat on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was that. - A. Two or three feet: he took particular notice; I requested him, he being a builder.</p>
               <p>Q. When you last left it, and put the timber before it, it stood against the wall - A. Yes, and when I took the prisoner, it laid flat on the ground. I found this basket and a bit of a blanket at the side of the foredoor, which was not there when we went in the first time. This large piece of lead I locked up in the cupboard on the Monday; it was compared with the piece that the prosecutor produced; it matched.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is the piece I took off the house.</p>
               <p>DANIEL BISHOP. I was present with Armstrong; I was placed in the front kitchen, and Armstrong in the back. The prisoner passed me about three yards: when I came up to him, Armstrong had hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you notice the different situation of the lead when you left it to where it was when you apprehended the prisoner. - A. Yes; Armstrong has given a right account of it; I saw the two pieces of lead fitted; they corresponded.</p>

               <p>Q. Before you went to bed, do you know what money you had in your pocket. - A. Yes, perfectly well; I knew all was in my purse: on Tuesday night I had reckoned what money I had in my purse, and I had not any occasion to take any money out of my purse. On Wednesday night, between 10 and 11 o'clock at night, and when I went to bed, I felt my purse: in the morning we both got up at six o'clock; he went down before me; he left the family at eight o'clock; he had no leave of me, nor the colonel was not up. I missed my purse at nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any information that you received, did Butler give you the notes. - A. Yes, he gave me two notes: these are the notes; they have been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of these notes to be yours. - A. Yes; the one pound note, I recollect the number, it was 13428, Dr. Dick gave me that note on the evening of the 24th. I kept that note for the purpose of laying it out in the lottery; that made me remember the number. I accused the prisoner on the morning of the 26th of robbing me of my purse, and the two notes which I had received from Lady Mulgrave's footman: Colonel Welch asked him who gave him them notes, the prisoner said his wife.</p>

I went to the Golden Lion and asked for a lodging, the landlord said he could not let me lodge there. I saw these two prisoners in the house, and when I came out towards the door,

I saw Silvester walking fast towards Snow-hill with a woman, and just as I came up to him, I heard somebody say, above I have found found the case. I directly laid hold of him by the arm. I said, there is a cry of stop thief, I must take you back to see what you have got, I perceived him put his right hand to his right hand jacket pocket. I immediately put my left hand into his right hand pocket, I took hold of a watch string, with a key and seal to it; he endeavoured to drop the watch, but I prevented him and took it from him. I took him back to where the watchman was, the prosecutor pointed him out, and said, this is the man that was with the other man. I took him to St. Sepulchre's watchhouse; I there asked the boy if he knew the name and number of the watch, he mentioned the name and number, I found it to correspond. I saw the case, and put the watch into it, and found it fitted. It had no case when I took it from Silvester; in taking him to the watchhouse, he said he found it. I know nothing of Crook only seeing him in the watch-house.</p>

I told him I would detain him until I knew what was the reason of his running, in about two minutes a boy came, and said he had taken a watch from him; I took him to the watchhouse; I saw the other prisoner at the watchhouse.</p>

On Monday the 30th of October, I missed a plank, I saw it concealed in a ditch. I watched on Monday night, he did not come then. On the Tuesday I concealed myself; I saw the prisoner come from the ditch with the plank on his shoulder; it was then about half past nine o'clock; he came up to me and said holloa. I never answered him; I walked towards Twickenham; he threw the plank off his shoulder, and followed me. The prisoner said who are you; he came and looked in my face. I turned round and would not let him see my face, because he would know me. He said d - mn your eyes I will see who you are; he followed me towards Mr. Gosling's. Then I set off upon a run. I was going to jump over a wall; he then holloed out, stop him, here is a man going to jump over the wall. I concealed myself; it was very foggy. He missed me and went towards Mr. Goslings, then he turned back, and went towards where the plank was. I took off my great coat; I went round by the water side, and met him again by the stile, about an hundred yards from where he had got the plank; I jumped over the stile and let him pass with the same plank on his shoulder. I pulled off my shoes and followed him; he went home, plank and all; I saw him house himself and the plank. On the next day I got a warrant, and went to his house with a constable; we searched the house, we could not find any thing but a small piece; we received information that there was a trap door; we went in again and took up a piece of sacking before the fire, and found half the plank there. There were some more pieces that he had cut from the same plank; he was building a cart.</p>

On the 21st of November, about five o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into my shop to look at some stockings; I shewed her some; she said she had not money enough for them, she would go and ask her husband for more money. She came back again, and asked to see some prints. I shewed her some but they would not suit her. After she was gone, I missed a piece of callimanco. I had nobody but myself in the shop at the time; I could not follow her.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand you that during the time she was there, there was no other person in the shop but you. - A. There was no other person in the shop but me at that time. She came again on the Thursday, to look at some muslin's for her husbands handkerchiefs; I shewed her eleven pieces, the prices would not suit her. She asked to see some gloves; I shewed her some, she bought one pair; while I was looking for the gloves, she rolled a piece of muslin up in her bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her - A. No, I did not, when I had shewn her the gloves, I counted over the muslins, instead of being eleven pieces there was only ten, I missed one; she kept the pair of gloves and paid for them. She went away, delivering the muslin to me before she went; I followed part of the way home. She hid herself in some stable in Bankside. Soon after, she started; I followed her to the constable's house, and gave charge of her to the constable. He went with me to search her lodgings, where we found three duplicates of some stuff that was pawned on the 22d of last month. I went with the constable afterwards, to see the stuff and the calimanco at the pawnbrokers; it was exactly the colour and pattern of that which I lost.</p>

            . On the morning of the 23d of November, between eight and nine o'clock, Mr. Powis brought the prisoner to my door and gave her in charge to me, for stealing a piece of calimanco and other articles. The prisoner begged to be liberated; I told her I could not suffer felony to be compounded without going before a magistrate. She said she had three children at home; I went home with her to see about the children: Mr. Powis accompanied me to her house where she lived. I then asked her for her duplicates; she then refused giving me her duplicates, but she opened her drawer, and I was going to look in it, she took out a roll of paper, which she was going to throw in the fire; I catched her hand and took from her a duplicate of a piece of calimanco stuff, pledged at Mr. Wrights for 2 s. 6 d.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180912060011"/>she then replied you have got it all, and I hope Mr. Powis will be merciful to me on account of my children. I told her I must see further, among an hundred duplicates I found another duplicate of Mr. Wrights, a piece of stuff, 3 s. 6 d. the same date as the other; I looked further and found one on the 21st a piece of stuff.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Powis. I understood you only found two pieces, do they form the twenty eight yards - A.It was taken in one piece and cut into four.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it all found at one pawnbrokers - A. No, at two pawnbrokers.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner at the bar come to your house - A. Frequently; on the 23d of November, she pledged a piece of calimanco for 3 s. 6 d. I think it was eight yards, she had 3 s. 6 d. on it, and 4 s. on the other piece, pledged on the 21st.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I swear it is my property.</p>

             was; I said he was at the play: I delivered the message to him that Captain

             desired me, and then lit him into Captain

               <p>Q. When he came out of the room, did he appear to to you as though he did not know what he was about. - A. Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he like a man that was stupid drunk. - A. Yes, he was all in confusion.</p>
               <p>. Do you mean that he was agitated, did he appear to shake. - Yes he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he very drunk or was he only flush with liquor. A. Oh! he was only flush with liquor.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner coming to your shop. Yes, Friday the 24th of November between twelve and one; he came to purchase a watch, he agreed to pay 5 l. for it, and tendered me a 100 l. bank note.</p>

            . I am one of the police officers at Lambeth-street office. On the 24th of November captain Hanson called on me, he had been robbed. I went with him to the banking house of Prescott and Co-62 in Threadneedle-street. I went there to enquire for the number of the note; I got the number of the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any body here from Prescott and Co. - A. No, there is not, I traced the note to the Bank. On the Saturday, I apprehended the prisoner in St. Catharine's, where he seemed to keep medicine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. You did not apprehend him till the Saturday, that was two days after the supposed robbery - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that Mrs. Smith had been him before that - A. No, I did not know that, I never heard of it. I took up the prisoner and brought him before the magistrate; Mr. Smith charged him upon suspicion of committing this robbery in his house; he was committed for re-examination, he was put in the lock-up-room. I do not know what conversation passed between him and Mr. Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. The note is supposed to have been lost on the 23d. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was on the morning of the 25th that the prisoner was apprehended - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go by captain Hanson's desire to the prisoner - A. No, I did not, my own inclination led me, when he was locked up; it was after this first examination; I conversed with him outside of the door.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180912060013"/>Q. Did you lead him into the conversation of this note by promising him, that if he would confess that Captain

               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him on pledging the watch. - A. Very little; no more than what was in my business.</p>
               <p>Q. From the conversation that you had with the person who pledged the watch, do you know whether he was an Englishman or a foreigner. - A. I am sure the person that pledged the watch is a foreigner.</p>
               <p>Q. And he pledged the watch that you have in your hand. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. - You had never seen the prisoner before had you. - A. No, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>COURT. - Q. To Mr. Sharp. Look at that watch. - A. This is the same watch that I sold; there are figures of my own upon it, No. 8m&amp;7, on the edge of the case; it is a peculiar watch, and I believe only made by ourselves</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, and called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean they persuaded you to go up stairs. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you talk about making you? you do not mean to say they forced you by manual force and violence. - A. No; as soon as I got up stairs, they asked me if I would treat them; I was going to treat them; I could not get the money out soon before that lady put her hand into my bosom, and robbed me of a handkerchief-pin, a handkerchief, and some silver: they called out to Mr. M'Carty, a publican, to bring up three half quarterns of rum, and change for a pound note. When M'Carty came up, he said here is the change for the pound note. I immediately refused to give the pound note: I was going down stairs; they snatched my hat off; and away I went down with the landlord to his own house without a hat. When I came into M'Carty's house, I set myself in the bar: I called for six pennyworth of rum and water: the prisoners came in, and gave me the hat. I then said to the prisoners, you have robbed me of a handkerchief-pin: if you will give it back again, I will spend five shillings; the handkerchief-pin was worth 2 l. or 3 l. I pulled out a handful of bank-notes, to the amount of 80 l. or 90 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you walk about with that money in your pocket. - A. I was going to pay my distiller: when I took this money out of my pocket, a 10 l. note was the first of the bundle. I was going to give it to the landlord to treat them, to get my pin back again. One of the prisoners snatched it clean out of my hand, and gave it to the other: the landlord told Sullivan to give me the note back again: she abused me in all languages.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by all languages. - A. Bad language.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober. - A. I was perfectly sober. The landlord sent for the watchman, and one of them got away. Some man knocked me in the mud; I lost my hat: Sullivan was taken to the watch-house, and searched; nothing was found on her. Fitzhenry was brought in afterwards, and searched the note was never found.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. - You are a publican: where do you live. - A. In Long-alley, Moorfields; I am a married man; I have five children.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the evening. - A. I believe it was between seven and eight in the evening; I know it was on the 13th; I put it down when I went home in the evening; I know I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put it down. - A. I put it down in my head to keep it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not put down the day of the week; did you, is that so. - A. I know it was on the 13th. I cannot say any thing what day of the week it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in the public line. - A. A. About fourteen months.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you been before - A. I do not know what I had been before; I came here for justice.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not give me any other account. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. This gentleman is trying you, to know whether what you say is true, therefore answer, or else the jury will say, very likely, you deserve no credit.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Inform these gentlemen what you were, before these fourteen months. - A. A dealer in cloaths. I have been in Holland, I bought old cloaths and took them there to sell them. It is now about four years ago since I returned from Holland, and since then, I bought old silver, clothes, or any thing of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your solemn oath, were you never in a court of justice before this day - A. I came here to have justice for what I lost.</p>
               <p>Court. I will have an answer, or else I will commit you, that is my plain method - A. I have been here before for no harm, the same as another person.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you - A. I am a jew.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM M'CARTY. Q. What are you. - A. I am a publican. On a Monday night,

             called me out of her room, and told me to bring three half quarterns of rum; I did. She told me to give change for a pound note; Mr. Barnett refused giving the pound note, I took up the change, and was coming out of the room, and Barnett walked down before me. On the stairs Fitzhenry put her hand over my shoulder and took off his hat. I said it is better to lose your hat than your money. He came to my house and sat inside my bar, and called for sixpenny worth of brandy and water; I made it him; we both drank it. When both the prisoners came in with the hat, they handed it to him. He told me he was robbed of a handkerchief pin, and a silk handkerchief. He offered to spend five shillings to get the handkerchief back again; he took out a handful of notes, out of them he took a ten pound note and held it open in his hand; here landlord, he said, let them have five shillings-worth out of this.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180912060014"/>Q. Was he perfectly sober - A. Yes, Sullivan put her hand over my shoulder and snatched it out of his hands; he cried out, landlord I have lost my ten pound note. I see you have, said I, and I will try and get it for you. Accordingly, I pushed in to get hold of her hand, I saw the note in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever the note in your hand - A. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q, How near were you to the bank note. - A. I was quite close to it.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know how you came to see it was a ten pound note - A. The light was on the table, he held it out in his hand, I was quite close to it. When I tried to catch Sullivan's hand, she put her hand round to Fitzhenry, both their hands met; I saw the note between their hands; I saw their hands part; and I then saw Sullivan's hand without the note. I said it is of no use, I cannot get the note from them. I shut the door and sent for the watchman, and gave them in charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you relate to the watchman what had passed - A. No, Barnett told him what about. They went down the street, and I went a short passage to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. What is the name of the public house you keep - A. The White Hart.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know these women - A. Yes, I was called up into their room.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got up there, Barnett made a complaint to you, that they had stole his handkerchief pin - A. Not immediately, he did not; he did not say a word about it in their lodging, he did mention it when I was going to leave the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it when the hat was taken off his head, that you, and he, did not return and take it from them - A. Why, what was I to trouble my head about another man's affairs.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you go over for - A. To serve the liquor. I thought it better for him to come away without his hat, than lose his money.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any of his money then - A. I had seen a lot of notes in his hand.</p>

               <p>Q. Then before he came to your house he pulled out his money - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in court when Barnett was examined - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you observe, that he did not say that he pulled out the notes in their room - A. I did not observe that in particular.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. I think you told my lord just now, that he was perfectly sober - A.No, I was not asked the question.</p>
               <p>Q. Yes, you were, and you distinctly answered the question, that he was quite sober - A. He said, himself, that he was not quite sober, here now.</p>
               <p>Court. He said he was quite sober, I asked particular, I did not think his behaviour was that of a sober man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Pray what time of night was it - A. It was between ten and eleven when I went to the watch-house. It was near ten when they came to my house.</p>
               <p>The prisoners were not put on their defence.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day did you see the box last - A. About one at night. They were obliged to make their monthly payments. The stewards did not leave the room till one at night.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw it after the club had left your house, did you - A. I did, they called me up in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss the box - A. The same morning about seven o'clock, my wife missed the box and the servant; she apprized me of it; I came down stairs and found the box missing, and the prisoner at the bar also.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she lived with you - A. About ten or eleven days.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know what time she left your house - A. I cannot say, she went into the room about one o'clock; I saw her after the club was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the box and the girl again - A. On Friday last about nine o'clock in the evening, there was a person, that knew that she committed this robbery, saw her in Rose street, Long-acre, at a door way, sitting there; he came and informed me, I went to Rose-street and saw her, she was sitting in a door way much intoxicated. I said, is this you Ann; she said, yes master. I gave her in charge to a watchman, and took her to the watchhouse; when she was in the watchhouse, she told me that the box was at a shoe-blacks place, in a court in Shire-lane; I went there, and one of the officers of Bow-street went with me, and found the box according to her direction; the box was forced open, there were the books in number, but the cash was gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was no such thing in it, as he said; I took this box, I do not deny; he told me if I would tell where the box was, he would forgive me. The cash in it was of little consequence.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I said the loss of the books to the society was the most consequence; I did not say I would forgive her.</p>

            . I am constable of St. Martin's in the Fields. I went along with Mr. Doyle, and found this box last Friday about nine o'clock. On going back to the watchhouse. I searched the prisoner; I found they had not searched her, and in her bonnet, I found this parchment, a certificate of her marriage; I found a two pound note and a guinea in it, she did not like me to take her bonnet off, and when I came to her bosom she was rather refractory again. I found a rag in her bosom, in that rag was a seven shilling piece, seven or eight shillings in silver, and in her right hand I found some half-pence, and three shillings in silver. The silver and gold I gave up by order of the magistrate. The note I have kept; this is the note.</p>

            . I am clerk of this society, that was held at Mr. Doyle's. I know that is the box, and I know the contents of it; I saw the money deposited in it. The two pound bank note I cannot swear to, but I saw a piece of paper pasted at the back of it that corresponds with this two pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Douglass has said there was a two pound note, was it so. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say that note by any particular mark was deposited in the box on the 8th of November. - A. No more than there was a piece of paper pasted at the back of it, and from that circumstance, I believe it to be the same note.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you your money loose in your pocket. - A. My money was wrapped up in a bit of linen in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you saw the prisoner how much money had you. - A. I had sixteen half Joes, fourteen guineas, fifteen shillings, and a one pound bank note in my pocket book, that was all the money I had, and when the prisoner was gone, I had two half joes remaining. I lost all my money but two half Joes. The landlord went for a constable; I got some of my money again.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH CHRISTOPHER. I am a publican.</p>
               <p>Q. It was in your house where these people were drinking - A. Yes. On the 16th of November Westwell was in my house, in the evening. I remember seeing the prisoner, he was sitting near Westwell. The prosecutor told me he treated the prisoner with three half quarterns of gin. He told me he was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner by at that time - A. He was in the house, but not by at the time. I wrote a note, and gave it to the prosecutor to go to Lambeth-street office and bring an officer with him. When he came back he told me he could not find the office, and he had lost the note; he was a good deal in liquor. I then sent for a constable, and described the person of the prisoner to him, the prisoner was then gone. The constable returned and told me he could not find him. My wife came in about a quarter of an hour after the constable was gone. I left my wife in the bar, and went with the constable to the Bee-hive public house, and found him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might this be after the prosecutor had told you that that the prisoner had robbed him - A. An hour and a half. We found him there in company with another man. We took them in custody, and searched them at the watch-house. On the prisoner we found in his jacket one half joe; it is the value of 1 l. 16 s. We continued searching him; he said, so help his God he had no more. I observed his shoe being off (he had only one shoe, he is a cripple). I was going to take his shoe up, the prisoner picked up his shoe himself, he turned the shoe topsy turvy; I laid hold of his hand, as also did the constable, and found twelve half joes in his hand that had held the shoe. The watch-house keeper took his protection box out of his pocket, and found a one pound bank note and a sixpence was found on him.</p>

            . Q. You are the constable that had the prisoner in charge - A. Yes; I took him to the watch-house, we searched his pocket and found one half joe. While I was searching him I saw him slip his shoe off, he took it up and turned the twelve half joes in his hand, then he let the shoe fall; I saw he had twelve half joes in his hand. The watch-house keeper found a one pound note in his protection box; afterwards we found a six-pence. The other man was locked up, he had three hearings, he had this man's watch, we found nothing else on him.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WEBB. Q. You keep the watch-house, do you - A. Yes; I was present on this search. I found the protection box on the place where we take the charges. It was put there by Mr. Cooper or the other man when they took the money from the prisoner. I found a one pound note in the protection box. The box was not on the table before they came in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was my own property. I went into this public house, this man came and knocked up against my foot, I pushed him off, and he struck me; then four Portuguese struck him; after that he came to me, he said I know I am in the wrong; Westwell put his hand in his pocket and gave me some money. I never looked at it, but put it in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never gave him any money.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the man that you laid hold of when you awoke - A. Yes, and the rest of people pushed me about; they said I should not impose upon a cripple.</p>

I found them in a court in Chancery-lane; there were three of them. I went after Fox, she was about twenty yards before the others. Underneath her apron I perceived something white. I asked her what she had got, she said nothing. I put my hand under her apron, and pulled out a piece of muslin. She told me two girls gave it her. I took her to Mr. James. I asked her where she had been to, she said that she had been to her brother in Purple-street, near Gray's-inn-lane, and she came up Chancery-lane to go to West Smithfield, and in passing by our house somebody gave her the muslin.</p>

               <p>Q. Had the prisoners been in the shop - A. I heard so, I did not see them. After I had taken Fox, I went into a public house back yard. I heard she had been there. I went in search of the fag-end of the muslin which had been torn off; I picked up a ticket which corresponded with the ticket of the same description of muslin which was bought at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had you seen that muslin, had you seen it that day - A. I dare say I had, I cannot say positively; I believe it to be Mr. James's property.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know what I am to infer from your finding that ticket in that yard - A. By comparing this ticket with the other muslins that were bought at the same time, this corresponds with the muslin.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. James. On Saturday the 18th of November, about one o'clock, the two prisoners came into the shop, and asked to see some muslins, and after a good deal of trouble I sold them three-eighth of a yard. About twenty minutes after they went out of the shop, the prisoner Fox was brought into the shop, having a piece of muslin found upon her by the last witness.</p>

On the 17th of November, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner was going home; I had long suspected him, and I had called on Mr. Davis the constable to be in readiness; when I went in he said as usual good night; I replied good night, Benjamin; he advanced two or three paces, I called him back, I told him I had reason to believe, and I could prove it by my own servant, that he had long been a rascal to me. I asked him if he had any property in the bank, if he had any property out at interest, and if he had any property at home, to all which questions he positively denied having any; Mr. Davis came in, and I desired the prisoner to turn out his pockets; he turned them out, and there were a great many more halfpence than it was necessary for him to have in his pocket; I asked him whose property the halfpence were, he said mine, meaning his own; Mr. Davis then put his hand down his side, he rather resented; he had concealed in his breeches a cake of soap, it was divided in two; halves were on each side; I asked him whose property that was; for the soap, when joined, was the same as a banker's check; he said his apron was dirty, he took a little bit to wash it.</p>

               <p>Q. How much was the weight of the soap - A. They are generally on an average about three pound; I identified some of the halfpence; there was a sixpence in his shoe.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of halfpence was found upon him - A. I did not count them; there were two or three that I knew. I then desired him to give me his keys, he did, and every one of these keys have separate locks at his habitation, and all his drawers were lined with clothes, rings, broaches and silk stockings, and a variety of other things; he had six gallons of gin in his cellar, four gallons of rum, preserved damsens, and exclusive of that, in one of his iniquitous nests I found forty guineas, beside half crown pieces, and all from poverty and woe; when I took him he had scarce a shirt or a shoe; and it is an iniquitous thing that a retail tradesman should be plundered by such a rascal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. How long had this man been with you - A. Near twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. These rings, and all these quantity of things, were your's - A. If you took a man from an indigent state, and had placed him behind your counter, you would have thought so. He was a labourer in the India house; I only had him late of an evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that he had a legacy left him of a considerable sum of money - A. I do not believe it. He told me he found some money in the tea pot, but that was a deception. He is a rascal; it is a duty that I owe to society to bring him before this court; as to the rigour of the law, I do not wish to go to the extent of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not got possession of a considerable property of this man, of which you made no claim - A. Yes; here it is in my hand: forty guineas, four score half guineas; his sister desired me to take the four watches.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not been able to trace where he sold these things of yours to raise that money - A. He is too sly for that.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not you refuse to let this man have a guinea to defend himself - A. I said I would bring it before the court, and to them I would humbly submit.</p>
               <p>Q. On the day he was searched you only found two or three halfpence - A.What he took that night was very little short of four shillings.</p>
               <p>MR. DAVIS. Q You were sent for to search this man - A.Yes, I asked the prisoner if he had any of his master's property about him; he said he had not; I told him I must search him; I put my hand in between the lining and the upper part of his breeches, and took out these two bits of soap, making one cake, broken in two; I asked him whose property that was; he said his master's. I put my hand towards his waistcoat pocket, he emptied it into my hands; the halfpence, I examined them, and found two marked halfpence as described by Mr. Everatt; I found in a pocket half a guinea, and sixpence in his shoe.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, and called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

On Saturday, the 18th of November, about half past eleven at night, the prisoner came into my house and took a remnant of flannel, seven yards and three quarters; I pursued him and called out stop thief; about half way down Beech-street he was stopped by the watchman, I saw him drop the flannel; when he was stopped I returned back and picked up the flannel. I never lost sight of him till he was taken. He was taken to the watchhouse.</p>

I was coming from Finsbury-square, the watchman stopped me at the corner of Barbican, by the White Bear; I heard the cry of stop thief, a good many people run as well as me, and when I had run about an hundred yards, a watchman stopped me; I went with him, I did not resist him. As for knowing any thing of what was stolen I do not.</p>

            . I live at No. 115, Maid-lane, in the Borough; at present I am out of place.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you on the 27th of November last - A. I left my place on the Monday, I do not know what day of the month it was; I left my place between four and five, I took my lodgings that very evening in Maid lane in the Borough; I had lived at the City coffee house, Mr. Readers, a twelve month.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left Mr. Readers, you received your wages - A. Yes; I received seven pound eleven shillings and two-pence; I went to the doctor's to pay my bill, in Queen-street, between six and seven; I went to pay the chandler shop woman and the washer, woman what I owed; we got talking, it was near ten o'clock when I came away. They told me at my lodgings if I was not home at ten o'clock I could not be let in; I intended to go to Long Acre to Mrs. Haggerston's, the George, to try to get a bed; on my going there, on the other side of Temple bar, I met with the prisoner, she was going as if to Covent Garden; I said to her, young woman, will you be so good as to tell me of a lodging. I dare say when I met her it was half after eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been from ten o'clock at the time you left your washerwoman till half after eleven o'clock - A. I had been no where, but kept straight on from Little St. Thomas the Apostle, where my washerwoman lived. I told the prisoner I would give her any thing if she would take me to a good house, as I was a stranger; she took me up a court, and when I came up to a public house she asked me to give her something to drink; I gave her a glass of rum, and after that she said she was damnably hungry; I said I was going to have a pint of porter and some bread and cheese, she was welcome to have part; she did take part of it; after that she took me to Ship-yard, to the Old Rose hotel; I asked the landlady if I could have a bed; she said yes, and took me up stairs to see the room; the prisoner said she would go up with me, she would be a protection for me; the landlady took me into the room; I asked her what it was for the bed, she replied three shillings; I gave her a dollar and she gave me two shillings; the prisoner said she would stop with me if it was agreeable, she was destitute of a bed; I said to her, as you are a servant like myself I have no objection, if you are quite clean you shall sleep with me; she said she was quite clean. I gave consent for her to sleep with me. In the course of conversation, as we were sitting down, I said I do not think you are a servant; she said, what do you think I am; I said I did not know; then she told me that she was an unfortunate woman; I said cannot you reform and become a servant, it is better than going in the streets; she replied, thank God, I have found a friend at last, and she burst out a crying. I set for some time, and then said, there is more joy over one sinner that repenteth than over ninety nine just persons; I told her I was no scholar, I had heard so. Before I went to bed I counted my money, I had a two pound bank note, and two shillings in silver, and six pennyworth of halfpence, a pocket handkerchief, a snuff box, and two bills that I had been and paid; I put it into my pocket; the prisoner was present; she saw my note on the table, and the two shillings in my hands; in about two minutes afterward she said, my dear, you seem fatigued, you had better go to bed; I undressed myself and went to bed; I left my pockets all of a lump with my clothes on the chair by the side of the bed. I said, before I got into bed, which side will you sleep on; she said, you sleep on the further side, next the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose that was on the other side to where the chair was - A. Yes. We had a candle on the hob in the fire place, close to the chair; I went into bed; I sat up on the bed; she was sitting in the room; I heard the pockets chink.</p>
               <p>Q. Where the curtains drawn - A. Yes, almost close together. When I heard the pocket chink I put the curtains of oneside, I saw her hand in my pocket; I saw the prisoner take the note out in her hand; I said you have robbed me, you have got the note out of my pocket; I told her if she would give me the note I would make no disturbance in the house; she said, blast you, search me; she took her cap and shook her hair about; I said I did not understand searching her; I said do not think that I am afraid of you, for I will go down to the landlady directly; I run down with my garment on and fetched her up stairs; I told her the woman up stairs had robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the landlady here - A. No. They said at Bow-street they did not want any body. The landlady told Collins she had got my money; she denied it; she told them to search her; the landlady searched the bed and every where and could not find it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the landlady search her person - A. She did not, and I was afraid to touch her for fear she should give me a thumping; I said I would have the watchman in if she did not give me the note; the watchman came up stairs, he said now my good woman, give this girl her note; Collins said to the watchman, search me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the watchman search her - A. He did not; I told him to search her, the landlady said I had not the modesty of a woman; to tell him to search her; I told the watchman to keep her safe till I got my clothes on, I would follow him, and at the watchhouse I told them to take charge of her; they wanted to turn her out and me; I told her if they did turn her out it should be the worse for them; they then took her into a back room and told me they searched her, they could not find any thing upon her. I did not see her searched, I went back to the room and searched, and found nothing there. I took the prisoner before the magistrate the next day, and told him the same thing that I do now. At the office she said she would give me a pound note, and make up the rest when she could, if I would not prosecute her.</p>
               <p>Q.Young woman, you said you left Mr. Reader, whom you had lived with a twelvemonth - A. Yes; I was a house maid; my mistress died while I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you say you had been to the washerwoman and to the chandler's shop had you drank any thing with them - A. No; I had not tasted any thing but at my dinner at Mr. Reader's, except my tea, until I met with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was about half past eleven o'clock on Tuesday night when this woman overtook me between Temple bar and Chancery-lane, she tapped me on the shoulder, she said, it is a cold night, will you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180912060019"/>have something to drink, I feel for your situation; I said thanky, ma'am; she said, can you inform me where I can get a lodging; I said I cannot get you a place but at a house that receives company; she said she did not mind what place it was, if she could get clean sheets; she said would not I have some refreshment first; she took me up a place to a public house, I said I would have a glass of gin; she said no, I should have a glass of rum; she heard a parcel of men singing in the tap-room, she said that it was a long while ago that she heard singing; she had a pot of beer warmed it, and put some ginger in it; I drank none of it. She asked me if I could smoke, I said no; we left there; she paid for the liquor and the bread and cheese. We went to the Old Rose; when we got up, stairs she told me she would get me a character if I would reform; I said I must go, she told me it was rather late then, it was near one o'clock in the morning, there was nobody about; I should get no good; it was rather cold, I got into bed, then she asked for her pockets. I gave them to her, then she said I had robbed her of a two pound note; I said, you are wellcome to search me; she went to the door and called the landlady up, she and the landlady searched me, then she sent for the watchman. I was sent to Clare-market-watchhouse and searched; they were going to turn me out, they saw she was intoxicated. She swore that she saw me take it out of her pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. She says that you drank this pot of beer - A It was only a pint; I had no ginger in it; it was only warmed by the fire; and fourpenny worth of bread and cheese.</p>
               <p>Q.She says that when the landlady came up she and you searched her - A. She never was searched, her stockings were never taken off.</p>
               <p>Q.Who keeps the Rose tavern - A. I do not know; I never was there before.</p>

It was one evening in September, Wicks was with us, and the two prisoners, we met at Wicks's house we proceeded altogether to Hanworth park, we beat about for rabbits, we caught nothing. The two prisoners parted from us, they went towards Mr. Evans's rick yard; we stopped in Mr. Evans's field, about three hundred yards; we had not taken the nets up. In about half an hour they came towards us, they had some fowls, among which was a guinea fowl; I do not know what number, I did not see them, they were dead. One of them said, we have got them; Wicks said, I see you have, and if Evans had seen you he would have shot you.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that there was one guinea fowl among them - A. Yes.</p>

On the 16th of November about eight o'clock in the evening, I was sitting in the accompting house, there is a window between the accompting house and the shop; on my looking through the window I saw the prisoner, he was laying flat on the counter in the shop with his face close to the till; I had but a transient sight of him, but he appeared to be busily employed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the position of his hands - A. No; I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door of the shop open or shut - A. I am not sure whether it was fastened or put to; I went into the shop and saw it was not fastened, only put to; I fastened the shop door inside, to prevent the prisoner going out, I called my niece and sent up for my brother, before my brother came down the prisoner went up to the corner of the shop where the witness will prove that three one pound notes were afterwards found; I went up to the till and looked in, there were in it ten or eleven shillings, and some halfpence; in the afternoon I put two one pound bank notes in it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you saw the prisoner there - A. It might be two or three hours before; and some small gold, some seven shilling pieces, I cannot say how many; I believe more than one seven shilling piece, and I put one half guinea in, and some silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you taken this money in the course of business - A. Yes; in the afternoon; I had taken the money of different customers; no other person had served behind the counter during the afternoon; when I first ran in the shop and got between him and the shop door; I asked the prisoner what business he had there; he replied by asking what he had done, he said he had nothing about him, and then I instantly fastened the shop door. When my brother came down he laid hold of the prisoner and sent me to fetch Mr. Midlam, our next door neighbour; Mr. Midlam went in, he, my brother, and myself took the prisoner into a back parlour; when there my brother took a few shillings out of the prisoner's waistcoat pocket; Mr. Midlam told the prisoner to pull off his shoes, which he refused to do, I stooped down and endeavoured to pull one of his shoes off, I could not; Mr. Midlam laid hold of his leg and forced one of his shoes off, and in that shoe there were two seven shilling pieces. My brother then told me to fetch a constable; the prisoner then said, for God's sake do not; my brother insisted upon knowing where the prisoner had put the rest of the money, and the prisoner repeatedly begged of him to forgive him. I went for the constable, and when the constable came he searched the prisoner in the parlour, he found nothing more on him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any notes found - A. No; when the notes were found the prisoner said he did not know any thing of the notes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The lady swore, at Marlborough-street that she knew nothing about the seven shilling pieces.</p>
               <p>Witness. I told the justice that I could not be so certain that they were in the till at the time. Upon the prisoner was found two seven shilling pieces, he said they were his own; that made some impression on my mind, and it induced me to doubt whether I had not given them away in change for the identical notes which I had put into the till, but not the half guinea; I put a half guinea in the till, there was no half guinea found on the prisoner.</p>

            : Q. You are brother to the last witness - A. Yes. About three o'clock I had occasion to look in the counter till, I saw there a one pound note. In the course of the afternoon I went up stairs and left my sister to serve in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q Did you observe what gold there was - A. No; I only recollect the pound note being indisposed; I went up stairs, I remained there till about eight o'clock in the evening, when I was called down; and when I came in the shop I saw the prisoner standing in the shop near the door; my sister informed me that she had detained the prisoner for stealing the money out of the till; I sent for Mr. Midlam when he came we took the prisoner into the back parlour, he was searched, Mr. Midlam took off one of his shoes, and there two seven shilling pieces in it; I then asked the prisoner what he had done with the rest of the money, at first he denied any knowledge of of it, but upon repeating the question, and ordering the constable to be sent for, he said, will you let me go if I tell you; to that I made no reply, but again insisted upon knowing where the rest of the money was; he then said, if you will let me go I will shew you where it is; I then said, I suppose you have given it to some of your accomplices at the door, or words to that effect, the prisoner answered, no, it is in the shop. I then went with Mr. Midlam into the shop, taking the prisoner to shew us. When we got half way along the shop the prisoner turned round to me and rather stopped me, and said, you have children of your own, pray forgive me, and I will never do so again; immediately after this I saw Mr. Midlam go into the corner of the shop, there he stooped down; it was the right corner as we came from the shop door.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Salmon. You have heard your brother describe this place to which Mr. Midlam went up, was that the corner where you saw the prisoner go when you came in the shop - A. Yes, that was the very corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either your brother or Mr. Midlam point out the corner where they found the note - A.Yes; they both pointed out the corner, and I am sure that is the place to which the prisoner went up.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Salmon. You say he turned a little to the right - A. Yes; Mr. Midlam stooped down then and took up a note from off the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. It was laying unconcealed then, was it - A. Yes. He then turned his hand to a tea chest that stood on the same spot, in the corner, or near the corner, and between the tea chest and the wall; he took up two other notes wrapped up together; I did not examine them; they appeared to be bank notes as he had them in his hand.</p>
               <p>MR. MIDLAM. Q. You have been in court while Mr. Salmon has been examined - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. His account is correct - A. Yes. I kept the notes myself and the two seven shilling pieces till the constable came, and then I gave them to him. They were three one pound notes; I do not recollect the numbers.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into the shop in order to buy some sugar for an aged mother, for whom I am her chief support, no person being in the shop I leaned against the counter to rest myself until they came; when the prosecutrix rushed from the parlour, bolted the door, and accused me of robbing the till. I was taken into the back room and searched, nothing was found on me but money that was my own.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you keep this house - A. No, It is Neale and Cadwallader's house. This warehouse which I have is seperate from theirs; they are shut out from me entirely, and I have a door into the street. All I know is, the prisoner was brought back in the custody of two officers, and the five pieces of callico also.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TRANGE. I am clerk to Mr. Moore. On Monday, the 4th of December, about half past nine in the morning, I was in the accompting-house, I saw the prisoner come in and take from the counter a quantity of prints, he ran out with them; I followed him as soon as I was able; I saw him about half a dozen yards from the door with the prints under his arm; I pursued him down Ironmonger lane with the cry of stop thief; about half way down Ironmonger-lane I saw two men coming up which I believe to be constables: when he saw them he directed his course into a church-yard leading into the Old Jewry; I and the constables pursued him into the Old Jewry, there he stopped and was taken; I believe I was the first that collared him; I never lost sight of him from the first time I saw him with the goods under his arm, untill he was taken. When I collared him he asked me what I wanted; I told him I wanted him.</p>
               <p>Q.What became of the prints - A. I saw him drop them; a servant of Mr. Boydell was sweeping the door, he saw me pursuing the prisoner, and saw him drop the prints, and remained with them untill we returned and the man with us.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Slack. On the 3d of November I found some sugar concealed in a cask in the premises adjoining the sugar house, where the prisoner was in the habit of working. I informed my master of it. On the 4th, in the morning, about eight o'clock; my master took this cask out of the place where this man had placed it; there was some of his dirty clothes in it; the prisoner was working in the place at the time; master asked the prisoner if the clothes were his, he acknowledged they were; the sugar was at the bottom of the cask, master asked him if he had placed it there; he hesitated, and at last he said he put it there himself to sweeten his tea.</p>

            . I am an officer. I produce the sugar; there is four pound In taking the prisoner to the counter I asked him how he could be so unwise to do such a thing; he said he had taken it there merely to carry it back again, that he had some other business to do when he left it there.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have no doubt it is my sugar. When it was found I could have pointed out the spot from whence it was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you allow them to take this sugar for tea - A They are allowed to take it into their sitting room to sweeten their tea, but not in this quantity, not to secret it in the place where they keep their clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it removed from the place where it ought to be - A. About thirty yards. It was taken entirely into a separate place, to a shed in the yard.</p>

On the 30th of November, between eight and nine in the evening, from information, I went to the prisoner, he was in the manufactory; he had a file in his hand; I insisted upon him shewing me what he wanted with that file, and why he went away from his business. I took a small lamp in my hand and went down stairs with him; the door of the room where he worked was locked; I then perceived his jacket pockets looked bulky, I looked into them and found them full of brass; I collared him and brought him into the manufactory, and took upwards of eleven pounds of brass from him. The prisoner said it was the first time that ever he was guilty of any thing of the sort; I delivered the brass to Mr. Penton's-clerk and took the prisoner to the watchhouse.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any thing on the 26th of October - A. We lost some pieces of kerseymere and patent cord which was in the window, the prisoner was in the shop, she cried out thieves. I ran to the window, I saw the pieces falling out of the window; the shop door was locked. I could not find the key of the door. I screamed out thieves; the prisoner said it was of no use, they were gone; she did not seem affected by it. We took the prisoner before the Lord Mayor, he was pleased to release her; after that we thought proper to to search her box, and there we found a few very trifling things indeed.</p>
               <p>- PUGH. The servants box was brought down stairs; Mrs. Pickard picked out these things; the prisoner acknowledged this piece of silk was her mistress's; she said she had never done the like before she knew nothing of the kerseymere.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My box laid in the landing place; my mistress went often to my box; I was taken up and the gentleman acquitted me; as I was going out my mistress told me to call on the next day, she would pay me my wages. When I went she wanted to stop four shillings and six-pence. I asked her for what; she said, if I did not hold my tongue she would put me where I was before; I would not take less than my full wages. At the compter I sent to her for my money, I was almost lost for the want of it; I had nothing to support me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. In opening of your pocket book could they see you had a quantity of notes - A. Most likely they could.

            . My father is a plaisterer in Gray's-buildings, Duke-street, Manchester-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing Martin - A. Yes, on day the robbery happened, between four and five in the afternoon; he shewed me a five pound and a ten pound bank note.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What colour pocket book was yours - A. Black.</p>
               <p>Q. Take that ten pound note in your hand - A. That ten pound bank note I received from Mr. Thrall; I had it in my pocket book that day.</p>
               <p>Martin's Defence. I left there about three o'clock in the afternoon to go to my work, when I got there I could not see. The prosecutor, before the magistrate, said that he did not miss his pocket book till he got home.</p>
               <p>Jones's Defence. I know nothing at all of it.</p>
               <p>Kilby's Defence. That woman, Sharpe, owned she took it from the side of the gentleman; I told him that I saw her give the book to the man, but I did not see her take it.</p>
               <p>Sharpe's Defence. I took the book, I do not recollect what I did with it, I wish to have the money what I am to suffer for.</p>
               <p>Pearce was not put on her defence.</p>

I asked my servant if she knew what had become of them, she told me she did not know, she expected they were all there. Not being satisfied, I sent for an officer to search her boxes: nothing was found in them. During the time the officer was in the house, the prisoner brought three of my shirts from the pawnbroker's. The officer searched her, and found in a pocket-book that she had in her bosom several duplicates, where a number of my cloaths were pawned, together with one of my neck handkerchiefs in her pocket. I understand she used to visit my servant,

That day week before my master called me to account he missed his linen, I counted his shirts over, I missed three shirts.

On the 29th of November, about two o'clock, the prisoner came into our shop; I was alone in the shop; she asked to look at some black prints for a dress, which I immediately got for her, they were not patterns that suited her; she said she would first speak to her sister who had purchased one, and have one like her's; she went out of the shop, calling Mary, Mary; her sister was not with her. I know no more till after the piece of print was brought in by Mr. Beal for us to own, I then knew it to be ours; he gave the print to me, I put it in the desk wrapped up in paper, and gave it to my husband in the evening. I am quite sure it was the same piece; it was a printed calico, blue ground with a small white spot. Mr. Riddlestroffer measured it, it was seven yards and a quarter, and of the value of ten shillings and sixpence prime cost.</p>

She came in about a quarter past two in the afternoon, she was put into my custody, she pulled a piece of cotton out of her apron and gave it me; she said, take care of it. Then Mr. Riddlestroffer told me to go to the neighbours; in consequence of that I went to Mr. Gilbert's, I gave the piece of printed cotton to Mrs. Gilbert, there was a young man in the shop at the time, they both said it was their own. I left the piece of printed cotton with Mrs. Gilbert, and at the magistrates I put a mark on it.</p>

             had robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way had he robbed you - A. I cannot say in what way he robbed me. After he had introduced himself as a customer to me, about four months back, he purchased a watch of me, and three or four small articles; he was in the frequent habit of calling in to see how his watch went, by which means he gained a kind of familiarity: at last, he was in the habit of calling two or three times a day. On the 18th of November, Mr. Presman came into my shop, to caution me against a little man, who he conceived to be a foreigner; the prisoner happened to be in the shop, upon which he said he should take charge of him; he ran out of the shop. About an hour afterwards, Mr. Presman returned, he said he had succeeded in securing the prisoner; he told me he had not searched him. I then went with him down to the watchhouse; on entering the inner door where the prisoner was locked, we found a number of pieces of paper torn as small as could be, I took them up and returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him - A. We did, we found nothing more. While we were picking up the paper, he said he did not know what they were; I said, they appeared to be pieces of duplicates; he said, they might be, but he had no knowledge of them. When we put them together, we found they were three duplicates, one for a gold chain, seal, and key, for three pounds, ten shillings, at Mr. Parker's, 91, Houndsditch; and a pearl broach, twelve shillings, at Mr. Parker's, 115; Mr. Parker has two shops in Houndsditch; the other was a plain ring, which I could not prove. On seeing the articles I knew the whole of them to be mine.</p>

            . I am a stationer. On the 18th of November I went to Mr. Morris, to caution him of the prisoner at the bar; just as I came into the shop, the prisoner was standing with his back towards me; he turned round, and said, how do you do, Sir; I said you are the man I am looking for; I told him I would take charge of him; he said, for what; I told him, for stealing a watch from Mr. Esdaile; he immediately ran out of the shop. I pursued him as far as East Smithfield; I stopped him and took him to the watchhouse. I returned to Mr. Morris, and told him I had succeeded in taking the prisoner. Mr. Morris asked me if I had searched him; I told him I had not. We returned and searched, and found nothing about him, but where we were standing, there were several small pieces of paper; I took them, we found they were duplicates. I went with Mr. Morris to Parker's to examine the articles; Mr. Morris said they were his.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On Thursday evening, the 16th of November, about half past six, I was coming from Petticoat Lane, towards the Bull Inn; I saw the prisoner, and two others with him, they were quite young lands; they immediately crossed the road when they saw me, I followed them; the other two took to the right, and the prisoner to the left, with the property. He went to a butcher's shop, he threw this coat down; I went in and took the coat, and then I went after him. He turned round and saw me coming, then he began to run; then I called out stop thief. He stopped himself at the corner of Petticoat Lane; I went up to him; he asked me what I wanted with him. I told him he knew what I wanted with him, he must go along with me. I took him to the watchhouse, I gave him into the charge of Kinnersley.</p>

            . I am book-keeper at the Black Bull Inn, Aldgate. On the 16th of November, I received a coat to take care of for Mr. Clark; I was to give it to the care of the coachman, as Mr. Clark meant to go forward, and to be taken up on the road; I placed the coat along with the other parcels going by the same coach. On the following morning the coachman applied for the coat.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Thursday afternoon I was coming by Aldgate watchhouse. A gentleman was standing with this coat on his arm; he said, if I would take the coat to Somerset-street, he would give me a pint of beer.</p>

On the 10th of November, I placed myself in a floor above the warehouse; I looked through a hole, and saw the prisoner take a loaf of sugar out of the hogshead, in a short space of time he returned and took another out. I let my master know, and when I returned, he was gone. The sugar never was found. The prisoner was a servant to my master.</p>

               <p>Q. He sailed to the Baltic. - A. Yes Sir, the very same evening that I left him.</p>
               <p>Q. When he left you, what money and effects did he leave with you. - A. I am no scholar, I can neither read nor write; he gave me this money after the money, being paid to him out of the Commissioners' yacht.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he count the money out to you. - A. Yes, he counted out two hundred pounds to me, and for me to go home to Ireland to my children; he gave me a number of Bank notes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he told you that they were two hundred pounds. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And bid you go home to Ireland to your children. - A. Yes; I came from Deal to Dover; I had three twenty pound notes, and four ten pound notes, and whether I had five or six five pound notes I cannot say, and six guineas and a half in gold, and a great many articles of my own wearing apparel, a black silk gown and petticoat; it stood me in very near six pounds. I had a green plaid silk gown, one of my husband's messmates made me a present of it. I sailed with my husband three years, I believe it was worth about three pounds. I had three dark cotton gowns, one cost me three and six-pence a yard, one gown cost me making and all thirty shillings. The three gowns, I can put them fairly at three pounds. I had four light gowns, they were worth four pounds. I had a dozen shifts, each of them worth six shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. That is three pound twelve. You had several other articles. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These things you put up in a bundle. - A. Yes, all were together, and my notes.</p>
               <p>Q. And six guineas and a half in gold. - A. No; five guineas and a half in gold: I changed a guinea in Deal.</p>
               <p>Q. You came up to London. - A. I came to Charing Cross on a Saturday night; on Sunday morning I was to go upon the Liverpool coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does that set off from. - A. From Charing Cross, and at Liverpool; I was to go on board a ship to Dublin.</p>
               <p>Q. You slept at Charing Cross that night. - A. Yes, the waiter is here.</p>
               <p>Q. You slept in the house, and you took your bundle with you. - A. Yes, I did, and the umbrella. The waiter called me at four o'clock in the morning. They told me that the Liverpool coach was to go off at four o'clock. I got up, I was very cold, the gentleman of the house was not up, but the waiter; I took my bundle in my arms, and the umbrella. I went to a public house just by the turn of the gateway, to get a pint of warm beer, and some gin in it. It was just by the turn of the gate at Charing-Cross, I still had my bundle with me. The ostler came out, and told me the coach was going immediately; I followed him out; I met with this Dailey and another man.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, is that the man. - A. Yes, Sir, that is the man; I met him and another man just at the gateway. Dailey asked me, was I the young woman that was going upon that coach. I said yes, so they told me to go that way, it was better for me to come on and walk on the pavement, than to ride upon the top of the coach on the stones. They were going with me; they said, the coach had three places to stop at before it set off, and we had better walk to the last place, and they would go with me. I thought they were for my good, and they were wheedling me away, they took me up streets; I did not know where I was; I kept my bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought they were your friends, then they took you to a place where you did not know. - A. Yes, I do not know any place in London. They brought me to a public house in Drury Lane. They went in and had some gin; I stood outside of the door, and had a pennyworth of milk of a milk woman that was there walking along; she just stopped at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Now where was your bundle during this time. - A. I had it in my own possession, upon my arms. They came out, and brought me away to <placeName id="t18091206-47-crimeloc283">the Cock public-house in Dyot-street</placeName>

This young man that was with Dailey told me it was his brother that kept that house, he said his sister lived a little way off, they would bring me where I could have some tea. Then they began to curse and swear about spilling a glass of gin at the Cock in Dyot-street. I considered, and looked into myself, and thought I should not go out with them any more; then I called for a pint of beer and a glass of rum, to pay them for their trouble as I thought. I laid down my bundle on the counter; while I was putting my hand into my pocket to get the money to pay for this pint of beer, and glass of rum, I turned round and missed my bundle off the counter where I put it; says Dailey, is that your bundle gone out?</p>
               <p>Q. That was before you spoke. - A. Yes. Then Dailey said, is this your bundle that is run away with; I screamed out, and said, Lord have mercy, I am robbed; I did not know what I should make of myself, and I being in a strange place, as they had robbed me of all, I thought I might as well die.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, do not distress yourself, what did Dailey say. - A. He said, stop there for the course of an hour and I will bring you back the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Dailey go. - A. Yes, and he never came back, I stopped there an hour, very nigh, and never saw him any more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I heard her telling of lies. Did not I come back at last. - A. No, you never came back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When this bundle was gone, that woman and man were in at the Cock; I went in, and that woman and the man with her went in along with her; he was standing in the bar with the bundle in his hand.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. to Prosecutrix. Had the other man your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180912060029"/>bundle in his hand while you were there. - A. No one had the bundle, I had it in my own possession until I laid it out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that the prisoner at the bar is the man that came to you at Charing-cross - A. Yes, he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. And carried you on this way. - A. Yes, I am quite sure.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. All along I had never been with you, any more than I have been with this house. Did not you come in the Black Dog - A. No; I never put my foot inside the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you pay a shilling; that man pulled out half a crown, you told him to put it up, and paid the shilling yourself - A. No; that is not true.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did come back to the Cock.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. You did not come back.</p>

There were a few words arose between the prisoner and the other person, about some gin being knocked down at the other house. The prisoner asked for a quartern of gin, one glass he drank himself, and the other he gave to his friend or friends, I do not know which.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there other people in the house - A. There were two or three.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner Dailey - A. Yes, by sight, not by name; he is a watchman. I have heard since he is not a watchman in our neighbourhood. The strange man went out, in a few minutes this man and Mrs. Wilcox missed him; she said, I have lost my bundle, or I am robbed, one of these words, I do not know which.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she seem in distress - A. Very much so; I said to them, that the strange man had not been gone out above five minutes, they had better go after him. The prisoner, another man, and Mrs. Wilcox, went out; the other man is here;

            . I was at the Cock taking a glass of gin, I was unwell that morning. I saw this young woman come in and a man along with her; she called for a pint of warm beer, I saw her lay the bundle on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner Dailey there - A. Yes, I did not see him come in. I do not know what time he came, he called for a quartern of gin, and put down a dollar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Dailey in the house before Mrs. Wilcox called for the warm beer - A. I cannot say, I took no notice. The other man clapped his hands under his arms, he set his back to the counter, and faced the door. Dailey turned round to him, and said, you are the man that spilled half a pint of liquor upon me a while ago. Mrs. Wilcox came up and said, my dear, do not let us have any row about it now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she speak to Dailey, or the other man - A. To Dailey: she took the beer up and offered the stranger the beer, who had his back to the counter. Dailey said, give him no more beer, he is drunk enough already. Then she offered Dailey the beer, Dailey said he would have none, he had a drop of gin just now. Then she came and offered me a drop of beer, she said she could not drink; I took a drop of beer. She heard me talking Irish to a woman; she asked me what part of Ireland I came from, and during the time that she was talking to me the bundle was gone. Dailey asked the young woman if that was her bundle that the man had taken out of the door; yes, she said, my dear, I am robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. She was in great distress - A. Yes. This young man and the woman in the house said, it was a pity that somebody did not follow them. Dailey jumped outside, he ran after them, and away he went.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it quite light at this time - A. Yes, sir; it was almost seven o'clock, the neighbours were all up. Then Mrs. Wilcox and I went out, and two or three women; we went out after him, and could not see any thing of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she come back to the house - A. Yes, when I took the knife out of her hand she came back: she drawed the knife in Broad-street; I took the knife out of her hand, and took her to the Cock, and then Dailey was standing just facing the Cock door, in the street. I and Mrs. Wilcox, and Mrs. Stracey, asked him if he had seen any thing of the man, he said, no. Then Mrs. Wilcox began to tear her head, and get mad-like; and Dailey said, as far as I could understand him, if the man has any honesty in him he may come back in the course of an hour. Then I took her into the Cock to get rid of her: then she demanded the knife of me that I took away from her; I gave her the knife, and she offered to stick herself again with it; she opened her breast.</p>
               <p>Q. Dailey was not in the house then - A. Not as I know. Then I took the knife away, and

Yes; to the best of my knowledge he was one that was with them; they called for three half pints of gin separate, and they only paid for two. I think the prisoner was one of them; I took more notice of the prisoner than of the others, because he insisted upon it the third half pint was paid for.</p>

I desired Mrs. Wilcox to meet me at half after nine at night, she met me about ten. I took her with me to the New Church in the Strand watch-house, I found he was on his beat, I went and took him off. Mrs. Wilcox knew the prisoner directly, and he knew her, he mentioned that he knew her very well, it was about the bundle that she wanted; he said that he could bring two or three watchmen to prove that he was at the Black dog drinking.</p>

               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. How came you to find that this man's name was Dailey - A. The man who took me home to his wife's place, Ragan, told me his name was Dailey, and that he was a watchman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Three weeks to-morrow night I had been on my duty till six o'clock. We went to the watch-house and hung up our coats, and four men and me went up to the Black Dog, Drury-lane, we went in and had half a pint of gin. This good woman came in and a man with her; the man that was with her put down half a crown, she would not let him pay, she put down a shilling. They went away, we stopped, we had more gin, every man went home, and I went out and went to the Cock, and this man and woman was there before me, and Ragan was there; he went along with this woman and the man that had the bundle in his hand; he began to spew up, he went out of the door with the bundle in his hand, and this man Ragan asked her whether that young man was her husband; she said, no. I said, does that bundle belong to you that he had? she said, yes; then we put our heads out of the door and looked after him. I went down to the bottom of Dyot-street and returned, we met one another at the Cock door. I know no more of this business than the child that is unborn.</p>
               <p>Q. to Ragan. That you were with him at the Cock is quite true. Were you with him in Drury-lane - A. No: I went into the Cock and had a glass of gin. I was not in Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. The prisoner says that he was in this house in Drury-lane before you and the other man came in. I understood you to say, that you, the prisoner, and the other young man, had gone into this house together - A. No, sir. I never went into the house, I staid out. I was never inside of the house in Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. But you say the two men that were with you did go in - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the two men that went with you to Drury-lane, the prisoner and the other man - A. Yes. They were the men that brought me away from Charing-cross; I swear it positively, they were the very men that conveyed me away, all the way.</p>

On the 16th of November, between six and seven in the evening, I had been into Mr. Guest's, the pawnbroker's, Fleet-market, to fetch a watch out, that I left in May, before I joined the ship. I laid the duplicates upon the counter, and two one pound notes, they would not take one of the notes because it was a Windsor note.

               <p>Q. What did you call it - A. Hitting of me. Another came on the other side of me, and snatched the pocket-book out of my pocket; it was taken away. There were two on my left side, and the prisoner was facing of me. I, at the moment, clapped my hand to my jacket pocket and missed my book. I seized the man that struck me, with both my hands; one of the other men took a stick out from under his coat, and struck me over the head; I holloed out, watch, as loud as I could. While I was calling out, watch, they struck me over the nose and over my cheek. In the mean time, a man that was in Mr. Cutler's shop came out, and took hold of the other side of the man that I had hold of.</p>
               <p>Q. You never let him go - A. No, I would not, without he cut my head off. We took him into Mr. Cutler's; in came two men, that called themselves officers; they searched him, they could not find any thing about him. He was taken to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. You never got your notes again - A. No, he begged I would not be severe.</p>

               <p>Q. Where had you been spending the evening - A. I had been spending the evening at the White Lion.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking - A. A little peppermint, a glass or two; I suppose I was about half seas over.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen the prisoner before - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side of Fleet-market was it - A. On the other side, to where the Fleet prison is; it was on the foot path; next the houses; it was light enough to see his face when he hit me.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not alarmed, were you - A. He did not frighten me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there other people passing along the pavement at the time - A. There might be, I did not take notice; I should not have taken notice of him if they had not stopped me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not heard that there is a forty pound reward - A. I have heard it, I do not want it.</p>

In crossing Fleet-market, I observed three or four fellows looking in at Mr. Guest's, the pawnbroker's, window; whoever they were, I suspected they were going to cut the window, or going to take something out of the shop; we went towards Holborn with an intent to watch them, and when we came near Mr. Guest's window, I saw no more of them, and coming towards the end of Fleet-market, near Fleet-street, I heard a woman say there was something the matter; we hastened to the place, where we saw a mob of people standing where the prisoner was taken to. I went in the shop of Mr. Cutler; the prosecutor was in a bustle; complained of being struck particularly on his nose. I understood him, at that time, that he had robbed him, that his hands were in his waistcoat pocket; but he was quite in a flurry and fright at that time; I was not certain whether he said that his hands were in his pocket, or that he struck him. I searched the prisoner and found nothing about him. In company with Fogg we took him to the Compter, and the prosecutor went with us; in coming back; I thought the man would be more collected; he told me the same then, as he has here now.

            . I am a constable. On the 4th of November between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I overtook the prisoner at the bottom of the Minories, near Tower Hill; he had a bag which seemed very weighty. I asked him what he had got; he said, you know; I told him, it was impossible for me to know, till I had examined it; what do you call it? he said, provisions. I insisted upon seeing what it was; he rather refused, and struggled to get away; I took him into a shop and examined it; I found it to be white lead and Prussian blue, together. I took him out, and asked him what employment he was in; he told me a bricklayer's labourer to Mr. Teanby, a bricklayer in Old-street road. I took him to the watchhouse, and asked him where he was going with it; I think he said to Green Bank, Wapping; he knew the house, but not the person, to whom it was to go to; I asked him who he had it of, that he could not tell me; he told me he would give me a guinea to let him go; I told him that I would not do, but if he would tell me where his home was I would go there. I went to Golden-lane, where he told me; and the next day I went to Mr. Yallop's and Grace. I searched the prisoner, I found a little colour box at his breast, inside of his waistcoat; and the next morning, in the watchhouse where he was confined, I found a vermillion bag. There is forty pound of white lead, and two pound of Prussian blue, I have kept the property ever since.</p>

I said, my friend you have been doing something that you ought not to do; I shall be obliged to take you to Bow-street. He then said, he hoped not; he never would do so any more. I then laid hold of him by the arm, told him to follow me down the ladder: I conveyed him to Bow-street; an officer searched him, and took out the lead in my presence.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was the blow given you that knocked you down. - A. I do not know where.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not sure whether it was upon your head or not. - A. No; it was done so quick.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive yourself stunned. - A. No; I got up, and was pulling my coat off about half off my arm: in the mean time they were all three round me: the prisoner pulled my watch out of my pocket, and ran away: the prisoner is the very man; I will swear that he is the man; he was in blue clothes at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not present when he was taken, were you. - A. Yes; I kept him in sight all the time; the watchman stopped him; I holloed out, stop thief; the watchman came up, caught hold of him, and they both fell together; I was close by, he was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other men. - A. God knows, we followed after him, the watch was picked up off the ground where the watchman and he fell down, about a yard from them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who picked the watch up. - A. A small boy picked the watch up in my sight, the boy gave the watch to Mr. Griffiths the officer, he happened to come up.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not see what he knocked him down with, did you. - A. No: with his hand, I believe; Mr. Harvery got up again out of the kennel, and his coat was very muddy, and as he was pulling it off, the prisoner at the bar snatched his watch, and ran off with it.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him do it. - A. Yes, I ran after him and Mr. Harvey likewise; I never lost sight of him; after we had ran some distance, and did not get any ground, we cried out, stop thief, and the watchman met him and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180912060033"/>knocked him down in the kennel, and fell upon him; he was secured in White Lion-street: I was not two yards from him all the way: Mr. Griffiths came up at the time, I told him he had taken the watch away.

               <p>Q. Did you come up to the cry of stop thief. - A. I did; I was near the place, I heard the cry of stop thief; I was in Chamber-street: I ran up directly, and when I came up they were just got up out of the kennel, the watchman and him; he had hold of him: I pulled the the prisoner of one side, and searched him: I heard a person say here is the watch, a boy gave it me. I have had the watch ever since.</p>

               <p>HARVEY. That is my watch, the maker's name is Salter, I know it by the seal and chain. This is the same watch that was pulled out of my pocket that night by the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. to Griffiths. You were present at the examination of this man. - A. I was all the time; after the evidence was gone through, the magistrates asked him what he had to say about taking this watch; he said he did take it. I believe he made mention that the person wanted to fight him and he took the watch for that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There were so many questions put to me I did not understand them. On the Sunday night in the house that I was in, with two other sailors and three young women. I called for half a pint of gin for me and my companions, in the course of a quarter of an hour there came in a strange man; the landlord turned him out of the house. I stopped a quarter of an hour, and thinking it time for me to go to my lodgings the servant cautioned me from going out of the door that he had gone out of; she told me there was another door that she would let me out. I went out, and this man seeing me, he challenged me to fight; I refused, and then he challenged me with taking the watch, which I deny.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Gentlemen, the case of the person under examination is probably the most singular that ever attracted your notice. In the first place my affection for my husband induced me to take a crime on myself, for which I suffered the sentence of the law. My time being nearly out, I embraced an opportunity which offered, to return to England. I have two children in England, and my affection for them led me to accept the happy opportunity of embracing my dear offspring. I have suffered much on my passage. I submit my case to my dearly beloved Sovereign, for an act of royal mercy, and for which there cannot be a doubt but the Lord will command an extra blessing on his royal brow. Gentlemen, consider a mother's feeling for her children: give me them, and no punishment that the law can inflict will be thought too severe by the most unhappy of the human race. Oh! my dear Gentlemen, consider the unhappy state of the unfortunate</p>

On Tuesday last the prisoner came in my shop with a boy; she asked for a half-handkerchief for her boy; I told her that I never cut them. She stood a little time; I told her again I never cut them; then the boy went out, and she after him. A neighbour came in, gave me some information. I missed the red cotton handkerchiefs out of the window. I went in pursuit of the prisoner, and overtook her in Bedford-square; she had something under her coat. I told her that I had lost some red cotton handkerchiefs; she must come back with me. She then dropped them with an apron from under her clothes. I brought her back to the shop; she begged that I would not prosecute her on account of her children. These are the handkerchiefs that I picked up; they are my property; I had seen them in my window ten minutes before she came in; there are eleven handkerchiefs; they cost me two shillings and eight-pence each.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180912060034"/>Q.Where was she at the time you supposed she took them. - A.She was of one side of the counter, and I on the other. I had no suspicion, until a neighbour came and told me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you find the handkerchiefs on me. - A. I saw you drop them.</p>
               <p>GEORGE SPRING. Last Tuesday afternoon, about a quarter past four, on my going from my parlour to my shop, I saw a boy look in the window, and immediately a woman came to the boy and snatched the handkerchiefs out of his hand. She endeavoured to put them under her coat, notwithstanding on my opening the shop door, I had a distinct view of them. I had suspicion that she had not come honestly by them; I immediately went to Mr. Bowick, and communicated what I had seen; he followed the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. You said you picked up the handkerchiefs. - A. Yes, in her apron; the apron she owned when she came in the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing at all concerning the handkerchiefs; I was not guilty of taking the handkerchiefs neither one way or the other; nor did he find the handkerchiefs on me; there were other people passing through the square.</p>

I told the prisoner he had cut the plat leads off the tackling; he said he was drunk; he laid himself down on the ground by the plat leads, there were several cut off the looms; two looms were entirely stripped; and when I was going to carry my work down stairs to my master, I saw the prisoner coming from a loom that I had tackled the day before; he was putting something into each of his coat pockets. There were ten looms in the shop; he had cut the first and the last all the leads off.</p>

I put my hand to his pocket and found something heavy in it. I took him back with me; going through the yard, he put two of the plat leads out of his pocket on the lid of the window; I picked them up and took him into the warehouse; I searched his coat pocket and took ten more out.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of any information that you received, did any thing pass between you and the prisoner - A. He was ordered to go in to his superior officer at three o'clock, the usual hour of leaving work. Mr. Lane directed him. The prisoner said he must go back to the ship, he had left something; he was not permitted to return; he was taken by the collar and put into Mr. Littlewood's office; a letter that had been received was read to him concerning him. Mr. Littlewood said, if the contents of this letter be true I must be convinced of it, you must shew me that you have nothing about you. Mr. Littlewood is the principal officer of the docks; he told 
               <persName id="t18091206-57-person517">Watson</persName>
             that letter must go before the Customs for them to decide. I felt it my duty on the part of the East India Company that he should be searched; he was standing in Mr. Littlewood's office with his hat on, I told him that I did not wish a constable to be called, I wished him to shew whether he had any thing or not; he appeared very much agitated, and then said he had a little in his hat; his hat was taken off and two pounds and a half of gunpowder tea was taken out of the finer sort, and a small quantity of tea was taken out of his pocket of the same description as that in his hat; I told him I was not satisfied, he had more about him, he then took off his coat and waistcoat and untied a handkerchief, which was filled with hyson tea; the handkerchief went round his body, there was about two pounds of tea in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there chests of tea on board the Ceres - A. Yes, many chests of Hyson and gunpowder tea; they belonged to the East India Company. I examined the chests of tea in the warehouse that had been delivered from the Ceres, I found that several of these chests had been plundered.</p>
               <p>Q. What might the value of this tea be - A. About five shillings a pound, without duty. This tea was under the care of the East India Company.</p>
               <p>RICHARD OVER. I am a constable. I took the prisoner in custody. In going to the office he said, he would prove that the tea was given to him. The tea was delivered to me by Mr. Brooks. I have had it ever since.</p>

            . I am an officer of the public office, Whitechapel: on Friday the first of December, between eight and nine in the morning, I went to the Hallifax-head, public house; I saw in the bar two half quartern loves and a quartern; I went into the back parlour; I waited there a little time, the prisoner came and took the three loaves, and as soon as he was gone, I followed him, and as he was turning into Brick-lane, I told him I knew him; I said, who do you live with, he said, with a baker down the road; I told him that was false, he lived with Mr. Clarke, the bread that he had got there, was stolen bread. I told him that was not the first time that he had been watched; that he had been watched taking two loaves every morning that week to the public house, and I had no doubt but that he had been doing so ever since he had been with Mr. Clark; he then said that he had never taken any before that week, and begged that I would fetch his master to him, and not lock him up: I asked him if he was a married man; he said no, he kept a girl in some court by West-Smithfield, he was going to carry the bread there.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

When I was in the room with her, I took my watch out of my fob and put it in my waistcoat pocket; I had not been with her five minutes before I missed my watch. She ran down stairs; I pursued her. I did not find any thing of her, till the Monday morning following, I took an officer with me; he took her in the same room; he searched her, but could not find any thing of the property. I never have found the watch; it was taken out of my waistcoat pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not feel her take it out, did you. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain you did not drop it any where. - A. No, I did not; I was a little elevated with liquor.</p>

I told her it was not in my power to forgive her, she must go to the landlord, and see whether he would forgive her. I took hold of her by the arm, and turned her round to go to the house; she then dropped a quart pot; I picked it up, and said, how many more have you got; she then took another pint pot from under her cloak. I took her and the pots in the public-house.</p>

            . I am pot-boy to Mrs. Hatton, George-street, Manchester-square. On the 24th of November, about ten in the morning, I was calling pots, at 68, George-street, I saw the prisoner take something up, on the otherside of Baker-street, and put it under her apron; I could not tell what it was, till she came close to me, then the wind blew her apron up, I saw a quart pot and a pint pot under her apron. I ran after her when I had got my pots at that house, and asked her for my master's pots; she said, she had no pots of any body's; I said, she had; she pulled out a quart pot; then, I said, it was my master's pot; she said, do not make a noise or else you will disgrace my character; I said, she had more; she gave me another pint pot, and after that, she gave me another pint pot, and after that, she gave me another pint pot out of her pocket.</p>

On Wednesday the 8th of November, the prisoner came into the shop for a quire of writing paper; it came to sixpence, she gave me a seven shilling piece; I gave a five shilling piece, a shilling, and sixpence: she asked me to give her shillings for the five shilling-piece, as the paper was for a lady that owed her four shillings, and she thought she could get it if she took the change in shillings. I asked the prisoner if half a crown would do it; she said, no, she thought she had enough without changing. I then put the seven shilling piece on the glass case; then she said, she had not enough; then I gave her half a crown, and three shillings; I was looking for a shillings worth of halfpence, to make up the full change. I missed the seven shilling piece from the glass case: I asked the prisoner where it was; she said, she did not know. I rang the bell for assistance, and my sister came down; we sent for a constable. I described the seven shilling piece; he searched her, and found nothing: she went to the fire place in the shop, and then we heard the seven shilling piece fall; the constable picked it up, and found it was the same as I had described.</p>

I asked the prisoner where the lady lived that she bought the paper for, she could not tell. I said, it is a stale trick; I will try to choak her; that moment, she went to the fire place, and spit it out of her mouth.

I brought her back: she had taken the umbrella from the one pair landing place. She said, if I would let her go, she never would do the like again. I brought her back and took her to the office.</p>

I might be running, as I generally do in my travels; I told him I had nothing, and unbuttoned my coat to shew him. I hope my lord you will not think there is the least shadow of my guilt in that boy's evidence. I have been an unfortunate man through life.</p>

            . Q. You are the wife of whom - A. Of Thomas Walter.</p>
               <p>Q.You are the same person as gave evidence here in September sessions last of being ill treated by Sullivan and Fitzgerald - A. The same.</p>
               <p>Q. You were the then prosecutrix - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you whether on the 16th of September last you were at the Green Man public house, at Poplar, at all - A. Never. I have been there, but not on that day, nor on the night of the 16th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the 16th of September the day on which you were ill-treated by Sullivan and Fitzgerald - A. I believe it was the Saturday evening, but I do not know the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at all see Sullivan and Fitzgerald at that public house on the Saturday - A. To my knowledge I never saw him in my life; I never saw him at that public house that night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you ever see the prisoner at the bar at that public house in your life - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. About eleven o'clock on that night were you drunk or sober - A. I was as sober as I am now, and I had not so much as I have had to day; in the morning I drank part of a glass of gin, and part of a pot of beer; I was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Q. During the course of the day, till at night you met with Sullivan and Fitzgerald had you been in company with Sullivan and Fitzgerald, or in a public house with them - A. No, not in company with them at all; I did not know them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. Now previous to the ill-treatment that you have sworn to did you ever put your arm round the neck of Sullivan - A. No; I never saw him either at the Green Man public house at Poplar; or any where else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time receive any offer of money of three shillings and six-pence of him in any way whatever - A. No, not of Sullivan, nor any body else; I never had seen him before the ill-treatment, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Had you received an offer of three shillings and sixpence from him to go home and lay with him - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Sullivan take out three shillings and sixpence to give you - A. No; I never saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw him at the Green man at Poplar or any where else till he ill-treated you - A. No; I never saw him till then.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he ask to sleep with you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you advise Sullivan to have another pot of beer - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. When did you see the prisoner after the ill-treatment you received - A. In my own house, on the Sunday morning next, after I received the ill-treatment on the Saturday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you, and what - A. He said he was very sorry to see I had been so ill-treated; he begged me to make it up, for a trifling sum of money would do me more good than going through the law; I told him I could do nothing in it. I would go to the magistrate; then he followed me up to Shadwell to Mrs. Jackson's, the public house, where we retired; he offered me six guineas, or some money; there were six guineas in it, and he would make another pound when I got home, or another guinea, I do not knew which, for me not to appear against Sullivan and Fitzgerald. They told me I was to go away and not to appear against Sullivan and Fitzgerald.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any body present at the time this conversation took place - A. Yes, Mr. Vallas; he was present when Haggerty offered me this money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he offer you this money, or any other sum of money to stop the prosecution against Sullivan and Fitzgerald - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she at your house at eleven o'clock at night on the 16th of September - A. She was not.</p>
               <p>Q. If she was there at that time must not you have seen her there - A Most assuredly; because I always take care and see every body out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of two persons of the name of Sullivan and Fitzgerald - A. I knew Sullivan by name, and by sight, but Fitzgerald not by name, by sight I might.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Walter in your house in company with Sullivan and Fitzgerald at eleven o'clock at night - A. I saw neither of them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then this is not true that she and Sullivan and Fitzgerald were all very drunk at your house - A. I deny that; and that she put her arm round Sullivan's neck and said he should not go, and called for another pot, that is not true, because we shut up before eleven o'clock, and I had not to my knowledge seen them.</p>

               <p>Q.Look at the prisoner, where you present at any time when the prisoner had any conversation with her - A. Yes; I was in a public house at Shadwell, kept by one Jackson, I was sitting in one of then back rooms; Mrs. Walter and Haggerty came into the same room; Mrs Walter sat down by the side of me; Haggerty held some money in his hand, he said he would give her provided she would make it up with Sullivan and Fitzgerald. It was on Monday the 18th of September.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you observe what the money was - A. I saw some notes, and some gold on the notes; the prisoner, to the best of my knowledge, said it was to the amount of six guineas; and he would give her that and another after he got home, if she would make it up with Sullivan and Fitzgerald. The woman asked me what she had better do in it.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was the woman going then - A.She was in waiting to go to the public office, Shadwell; Sullivan and Fitzgerald had not had their hearing then.</p>
               <p>COURT. You are sure the prisoner is the man - A. Yes; I am confident he is the man. I was the officer who took Sullivan, along with others.</p>

I have a wife and two children, drove to the utmost distress, I pray your lordship to consider my wife and my family and to consider me an object of mercy, and should I experience your humanity the lenity shewn unto me shall ever impress me with the most grateful sensations, and deter me from offending the laws of my God, and my country. - Signed by the mark of

            , you were convicted at a former sessions of embezzling money that you received on account of your master; upon that indictment you were tried and convicted; I am now going to deliver to you the opinion of the judge. The fact was this, your master desired a neighbour to go to the shop and purchase some articles, whether you put the money in the till or not. They supplied this neighbour with money of their own, the neighbour went to the shop, bought the articles, they came to three shillings; it appears that you embezzled the money; your counsel was of opinion that you might have been indicted of larceny at common law, and not for embezzling. It appears the money had been in your master's possession, and he supplying a person with it to purchase articles at the shop, it must be considered your master's money at the time of delivery. That this must be considered your master's money there can be no doubt, because he having marked it before he supplied the person with it to purchase articles at the shop, and that marked money was afterwards found upon you, as appears by the evidence from the notes of the learned judge who tried the case; and it appears from looking in to your case, that in reality the case turns upon whether this fact committed was in common law a larceny, or whether it was within a late act of parliament made for the purpose to prevent the embezzling of servants from their masters. Upon looking into this case and former cases, it appears there has been a case like your case, and the facts are similar; it was the unanimous opinion of the judges in the case of one Bull, who was indicted for a similar offence, and who was a servant attending his master's shop; his master employed a customer to come to his shop, for this purpose he gave him some marked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180912060044"/>shillings of his own, and of which the customer bought goods; soon after the master examined the till, and not finding all the marked money he caused the prisoner to be searched, the rest of the marked money was found upon him; the judges were of opinion that the prisoner was not guilty of the larceny it was only a breach of trust. This case therefore rules yours; from that case it most clearly appears that yours was not a case of larceny but a breach of trust; your case in every respect is like that case that was not a larceny but a breach of trust. I am directed to say by the judges that the conviction against you was right.</p>
