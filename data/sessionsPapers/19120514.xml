                  </persName>. At 8.30 p.m. on May 1 I saw prisoner at Union Street, Borough, and told him I should arrest him for stealing 47 cases of potatoes on April 10, the property of Matthews and Co. He said, "Who is going to charge me? Have you any proof I stole them?" I told him that Mr. King would charge him. He said, "I was drunk and don't know anything about it." I took him to the station, where he was charged. He made no reply.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's statement before the magistrate: "Six weeks previous to this date I had been a teetotaller. The night before this I had a few words with my wife and I took to drink. It very much upset me, sir. I arrived at Middleton's Wharf about 11.30 a.m. I found I could not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140007"/>
               <p>get loaded before dinner, which is 12 o'clock, so I went to the neigh<lb/>bouring public-house. How long I stayed I could not tell you, but I know this gentleman, Mr. Nicholls, woke me up. From this till I woke up in my van in the Tower Bridge Road I was apparently asleep, sir. How long I could not tell you. I got up and looked about me. I could not make out where I was. The van was empty, so I drove it home. Me and my horse-foreman and my horse<lb/>keeper went in next door and had a glass of ale. I went home, sir, and had another row as usual over supper, and having two or three shillings in my pocket through the effect of being a teetotaler I did not go to work for a couple of days. On the Saturday my wife told me Mr. King had been there for my work-docket, which we have to make out. I made it out and my boy took it to the office. They said they wanted to know what had become of their 47 cases of potatoes Of course, I knew nothing at all about it. The only excuse I can offer is that I was drugged in Wapping and robbed of them. I have no idea of how I got to Tower Bridge Road."</p>
               <p>Upon being called upon for his defence, prisoner stated that he wished to call his wife to prove the "row,"in consequence of which he had got drunk. On the Recorder stating that he did not think this evidence would be of any good to him, prisoner refrained from calling witnesses.</p>
               <p>After the summing-up, Mr. Thomas (recalled) stated, at the request of the jury, that prisoner had no van-boy when sent out with the van.</p>

I noticed it was bad, followed, and saw her 50 yards off with the male prisoner. They walked on together to Vincent's Drug Stores; Barton waited on the opposite side of the road while Parker went in. I then made a communication to a police-constable. Parker came out of the stop, joined Barton, and went on to Argon Mews. I detained Parker; the police-constable went after Barton and brought him back. Parker said to me, "What is the matter; what does this all mean?" I said, "I expect the policeman knows." They were then both taken to the police station and charged by me.</p>

On April 20, at about 9.30 p.m., I was on duty in Borden Place when the witness Day made a communication to me, in consequence of which I kept observation on the prisoners. Parker came out of Vincent's Drug Stores and joined Barton, who had been waiting on the opposite side of the road. I went into Vincent's. When I came out I saw the male prisoner walk hurriedly away. I ran after him; he went down Argon Mews into a coach house, where I saw him throw something away. I then arrested him. He said, "What is the matter?" I then took him to Day, and asked if this was the man he had spoken about. Day said, "I am not certain." I then asked Barton if he knew Parker. He replied, "Yes." I asked Parker if she had a few minutes previously been in a chemist's shop in Borden Place and uttered a bad 2s. piece. She replied, "Yes," and handed me a 2s. piece (produced) from her purse. When charged at the police station Barton made no reply; Parker said, "I know nothing about it." I then went back to the coach house, and on an orange box lying there I found eight tablets of soap (produced). That was ten minutes after I arrested the prisoners.</p>

I went to Bacchus Walk and saw a woman lying on the footpath bleeding from a wound in the right side of the neck; prisoner was standing over her. I attended to her injury and sent for a doctor. I then turned to pri<lb/>soner, and said, "What do you know about this?. He said, "I did it, governor, it is all her own fault, she left me; I promised her it. Now she has got it. May I help you to take her to the hospital. I asked him what he did it with, and he produced this razor. It was a broken razor. I took him to the station. When charged he made no reply.</p>

I saw a young woman I now know to be his wife come round the corner. They seemed to embrace one another, and both fell to the ground. I saw something bright in prisoner's hand. I ran towards him; when half way I saw him get up. I thought it was only a love affair or some thing of that, and so stopped. Afterwards I saw pri<lb/>soner hit the woman with his left hand and knock her to the ground. I went up to him and said, "You have done it, then!. He said, "Yes, fetch a policeman. I saw the woman's throat was cut on the right side. I went to find a policeman. Prisoner was quite sober, I thought. The woman screamed, that is why I ran to the spot. When I went for the policeman I left prisoner with the woman. He said, "Fetch a policeman, it will be all right. I said to some men at the corner, "See he don't get away."</p>

I rushed up, and prisoner said, "You go away or you will get some too. I saw the woman fall to the ground. Prisoner knelt down and kissed the woman, lifting her head up.

Mrs. Gibbs was admitted to the infirmary on April 10 with a wound on the right side of the neck, about four inches long; there was a jag in the middle of it; there was a second wound just in front of the throat, about an inch long; the superficial layer of the muscle running from the neck to the clavicle was cut and the wound was immediately over the big neck blood-vessel. It was dangerous on account of its position; had it been a quarter of an inch nearer the blood-vessel it would have been fatal. On May 11, when I saw her last, the wound was perfectly healed, except that there was a certain amount of scarring.</p>

On April 10 I was going down Bacchus Walk about 8 a.m. when my husband came behind me and caught hold of the back of my coat. There was a struggle and I fell down; I next felt a sharp instru<lb/>ment on my neck. I gripped it and then let go; it cut my fingers. He walked away and I got up. Some men were standing near; I asked them to help me; they made no reply. I then walked a little way, when prisoner came and took my arm. I fell down a second time. He held my head up and kissed me, saying, "Why did you give me over, Rose?. He asked a man standing by to get water and fetch a police<lb/>man. A policeman came and did my neck up. My husband said, "I did it and there is the razor. Don't blow your whistle, I shan't run away; I will help you to take her to the hospital. I was in a state of collapse. I was put on a barrow and taken to the infirmary. On the Thursday before Easter I left prisoner, having had a quarrel. I went to work and did not go back to him any more. The quarrel was about a lot of things, his being out of work and one thing and another. He had only done one week's work from February last year; I had kept him all that time. He left the Army in February, 1911. When I left my husband I went to my mother's place. He called there twice and tried to speak to me; they pushed him out of the room.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, not on oath). This trouble has been caused solely through my wife leaving me like she did and not taking the home with her. On Thursday, April 4, we had a row; what started it I don't remember. It was generally about me being out of work. I was out all this day looking for work, and when I returned home at night I found the place empty and everything taken away. I was very much upset and did not know what to do. I went round to my wife's mother's place, but I had no sooner entered the room, in which there were four or five women and also my wife, when I was shoved out again. I wanted an explanation off my wife, so I went round there again. When I got there the door was shut in my face. My wife going away like this had left me without a lodging, so I went round to my people's place and stopped there. On April 10 I went out to look for a job. As I went out I noticed a razor lying on the box. I put it in my pocket, though what for I don't know, as I had no intention of doing anything with it whatever. While I was out I thought I would call round the way my wife went to work and ask her for an explanation. As soon as I saw her, being excited, I lost control over myself, and then happened. When I saw my wife on the ground I was very sorry for what I had done, and tried to stop the bleeding. When a policeman came up I gave myself in charge. I had been out of work a year, and there seemed no prospect of my getting any, so I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140013"/>
               <p>suppose that is why my wife left me. If she had not left me like she did this would not have happened.</p>

On Sunday night, April 28., I saw them be<lb/>tween 10 and 11 in the "Turk's Head," East Street, Theobald's Road; they had been drinking, but did not appear to be drunk. They were on quite friendly terms. I stayed with them till closing time, and then went with them to 10, Harper Street, Mrs. O'Keith's. We got there between 11.30 and 11.40. Prisoner and his wife were quite friendly and happy together. As they left, the wife said to prisoner, "Come on, George, think of your work in the morning. He replied, "All right, my girl. The wife went out first, followed by prisoner. As he went he said to me, "I am heartbroken at the thoughts of losing my girl, she was 14 years of age, and she died a fortnight ago. During the whole time prisoner and his wife were in my company there was no sign of any ill-feeling between them.</p>

                  </hi>, porter, 6, Ormond Yard. I remember Sun<lb/>day, April 28 last. My father (prisoner), mother, two brothers, two sisters and myself were then living together at 6, Ormond Yard, on the first floor. In the kitchen is a bed on which my sisters Mary, Nellie, and brother Patrick slept. I occupied the smaller of the two beds in the bedroom; my mother and father and brother James occupied the larger bed. We took our meals in the kitchen. Mother washed in the third room. I went out that day about 5 p.m. Mother was at home; father had gone out. I got back at 11.15. All the family were in and had gone to bed except father and mother. I went to bed directly and went to sleep. I was awakened by a scream. I saw my mother in a half lying, half sitting position on the floor near my bed, that is between the two beds; she was bleeding from the right breast; she was dressed in a chemise. There was a gas light in the room. I slipped on my trousers, intending to go for a policeman or a doctor. I saw father by the right-hand side of the fireplace of the kitchen, and he said, "I have done it," or something to that effect. He was in his trousers, boots, socks, and shirt. I went downstairs and fetched a policeman. On our way back we met father in Ormond Yard; we all went back to the house. Father and mother lived on friendly terms, but they quarrelled occasionally. Mother took to drinking just after my sister died, about April 2 last. Father took a little drink. The bruises on my mother discovered by the doctor were inflicted 10 or 14 davs before; I did not see them inflicted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not notice where the chair was that is marked on the plan. I saw blood running from the bedroom into the kitchen. Father might have said, "I have done something."I do not remember what it was. On this Sunday they were friendly to<lb/>gether. Father had worried over sister's death, mother as well. I have seen mother taking too much to drink, but not drunk; she then got very obstinate. She jawed father when in drink.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Before being awakened by the scream I had heard no jawing or nagging—not on that day at all.</p>

                  </hi>, prisoner's eldest daughter. On April 28 I went out at 6.30 p.m., leaving mother at home; father was out. I got home about 10.40 and had supper. Father and mother were out. I went to bed in the kitchen. I woke up hearing a scream from the adjoining room. I got out of bed and ran into the other room and there saw mother in a half-kneeling half-lying position on the floor by my brother's bed. I ran for some water. I came back and went to bathe mother, when she turned, and her head fell under the bed, knocking the water out of my hand. I tried to raise her, but had not enough strength. I went for some more water. When I came back the police were there, and they would not let me go in the room. This knife was generally kept on the table; I left it there. When I went into the kitchen for some water I saw father there. He muttered something, I could not catch what.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. When I awoke the door between the kitchen and father's room was open. I did not notice the chair by the door. I used the knife for my supper, and left it for father and mother to use</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140015"/>
               <p>for their supper. There was food on the table. Father and mother lived on very friendly terms. Mother seldom took too much to drink, only since my sister died; since then she did not seem in her right frame of mind; she was very aggravating and annoying.</p>

                  </persName>, 289 E. On April 29, about 12.35 a.m., Richard Fitzgibbons came and spoke to me and I went with him to 6, Ormond Yard. On the way there we met prisoner. He said, "I've done it." We all went back to the house through the kitchen to the bedroom. I saw a woman lying on the floor, her head under the bed on the left-hand side of the room and her legs in a cramped position facing the bed on the opposite side. She had a gaping wound on the right breast and a deep cut on the right wrist. She was wearing only a chemise, which was saturated with blood. She was breathing slightly, but apparently dying. I called for fur<lb/>ther police assistance and for a doctor. The bedclothes of the bed on the right hand side of the room were very much disarranged; there were bloodstains.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. When I met prisoner he was very agitated and upset. I saw blood on the floor, in the kitchen and in the bedroom; it was running through the doorway.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. There was a little stream of blood; it had run through the doorway and formed a little pool just in the kitchen. It is not possible for the blood to have run from the kitchen to the bed-room; it had run from the bedroom to the kitchen.</p>

I saw prisoner there; he was in his shirt sleeves, with trousers and boots on. As I entered he said, "I've done it; it can't be helped; you will find the knife somewhere." I found it on the kitchen table; it was wet with blood. While I was in charge of prisoner in the kitchen he fell from the chair on which he was sitting; he appeared to swoon, and his shirt sleeve went in some blood on the floor. I saw a line of blood on the floor; it came from the bed-room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The blood could have flowed from the kitchen to the bedroom, but I should say it came from the back room, the bed-room. Prisoner when he fell off the chair seemed to be weak; he looked pale and upset.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I should not think he was under the influence of drink.</p>

                  </hi>, Divisional Surgeon. On April 29, shortly before 1 a.m., I was called to 6, Ormond Yard. I went into the back room on the first floor and saw a woman lying on her back with her face turned to the right side, her arm lying by her side. She was dead. Her head was under the left-hand side bed and her feet under the other bed. There was a good deal of blood on the floor, also on the sheets and blanket on the larger bed. I saw blood in the kitchen, but not so much as in the bedroom. I formed the opinion that it had come from where the body was in the back room. I found a cut on the right breast of the woman between the nipple and the collar bone,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140016"/>
               <p>also 3 inches above the wrist, 2 1/2 inches across to the outside of the arm. She was dressed only in her chemise, which was saturated with blood. I made a post mortem on April 30. Death was due to the wound between the second and third rib passing from the right down to the centre of the chest; it had punctured the superior vena cava, the large vein which empties itself into the heart; it had caused hemorrhage into the right side of the chest and death resulted in five minutes, I should think. It was downwards and inwards. Consider<lb/>able force had been used to inflict it. It could have been caused by this knife. I should say deceased was addicted to drink. Her liver weighed 81 ounces. Otherwise she was perfectly healthy.</p>

                  </persName>, E Division. I went to 6, Ormond Yard on the early morning of April 29 and there saw prisoner. I told him I should arrest him for the wilful murder of his wife, cautioning him. He made an incoherent statement which I wrote down at the time. He was agitated. I was not sure then whether he was under the influence of drink, but at the police station an hour afterwards I thought he was not. His statement was: "I don't know how it was, but she would nag, nag, nag. We had our supper together and from that I know no more. The knife and mutton was on the table and I don't know no more than the nagging, that is the truth." Then he immediately said, "Mr. Gough, can I see my children before I go? It was not done with any murderous intent." He was taken to the police station and charged with the wilful murder of his wife. He said, "I wish you, Mr. Gough, to go to the wake at No. 10, Harper Street, and see how we left in friend<lb/>ship I and my wife. There was no row. When we got home the child<lb/>ren were all in bed and my wife and I had supper together. As we were sitting she returned to the nag, nag, nag. We cut the bread up with the knife and it was always used for everything. My John picked the knife upon Waterloo Bridge seven or eight years ago. He is now in New South Wales, Dreadnought Farm, Sydney."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There was blood on the floor between the two beds. On the table I saw some mutton and bread. I should not say prisoner was very agitated; he was distressed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's statement before the Magistrate: "I should like to make no statement at all. I have no witness I wish to call to-day. I wish to give the names of witnesses.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath), scene-shifter, Drury Lane Theatre, 6, Ormond Yard, Great Ormond Street, W.C. On April 28 I was with my wife in the "Turk's Head" up to closing time. I was I friendly with her during that time. About 11.10 or 11.15 we went to a friend of mine who had a wake. We left there between 12.30 and 12.45, it may be 11.30. My wife and I got home at 12.20 or 11.40. We had our supper in peace. I sat with my back to the bedroom on a chair. My wife was the other side of the table at that time. I took my coat and waistcoat off and my missis undressed herself bar the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140017"/>
               <p>stockings in the kitchen. She pointed to a picture (as far as I can remember) of my son and exclaimed, "You sent him out of the country," or "You forced him out of the country," or something to that effect. I said, "He has gone and he has gone for the best; I have had to put £1 in the Post Office Bank towards his fare and had to stand security for £8 for him." I continued my supper. She turned into bed. My back was to the bedroom at the time. She seemed to come from the back of me; I had the knife in my hand cutting the meat. As she came to me I said, "Get out of the way, stop the nagging." My knife must have struck her. She went into the other room and screamed. Then the police came and arrested me. I had no intention of murdering my wife.; I wag too fond of her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I can imagine it was nothing more than an acci<lb/>dent. As I turned, the knife caught her. It was not in my mind to murder her. I was eating my grub at the time. I was a long way from being sober. When I realised what had happened my senses seemed to leave me. The knife must have caught her with a good hard swing. I had no opportunity of helping her, my children were too quick, and when the police came they would not let me into the room. I went to help. I was using the knife to eat my supper with. We had smaller knives. I do not remember if I had a smaller knife and put it down and picked up the other one; I should tell a lie if I said I remember.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I was cutting some mutton just before my wife leaned over me; I may have put the knife down and picked it up again.</p>

               <p>Mr. Huntly Jenkins stated that this was a similar case to that of Chang Hop and Ah Kou at the last session (see page 86).</p>
               <p>The Recorder asked if these Chinamen were prepared to leave the country, and was told by the Interpreter that they were quite willing to do so.</p>

               <p>Mr. Abinger said this was a very different case from the previous one, which arose out of a feud between two rival societies. In this case the prosecutor was a member of no society, and there had been a murderous attack on him, in which hatchets, hammers, knives and pocketfuls of pepper were used.</p>
               <p>The Recorder observed that we had plenty of criminals of our own, and suggested it would be better to get them out of the country. <rs id="t19120514-11-punishment-12" type="punishmentDescription">

The Chinaman who had been responsible for getting his countrymen out of this country on the previous occasion must attend next session, and he would deal with the case on the first day.</p>

               <p>in the building. I showed him two offices, one at a rental of £18, and he said he would like to take it. I told him the landlord would require very satisfactory references and he referred me to a Mr. Friend, of 18, Greenfield Road, Stratford. The reply was very satis<lb/>factory, and on the strength of the reference I let prisoner the office. He entered into possession on May 8. He said he was an art publisher and printer, but he did nothing to show that he was carrying on busi<lb/>ness at that address. The name he had painted on the door was "Malcolm Campbell and Company." I did not see any business done there. The only furniture was a table and two chairs which he was going to buy from me. I saw no books or anything in the nature of what an art publisher might deal in. He only came there for about three or four days and then suddenly stopped coming. Serious complaints began to come in and I sent him a registered letter on March 19. He replied by postcard, "Please forward any letters you may have for me so that I can clear up any complaints." I did not forward any letters. On March 22 I wrote him a letter cancelling the tenancy, but I did not register it, and I received no reply.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by prisoner. I never saw date books and pocket books displayed on the shelf; if they had been there I was bound to see them. If I said at the police court that the letter of March 22 was registered it is a mistake.</p>

                  </hi>, tobacconist, 106, Mile End Road. Early in March prisoner came to my shop and presented a card. He said he repre<lb/>sented Vivian Mansell and Co. I said I did not want anything and asked him to call later on. About a week later he called and I gave him an order for 15 gross of half-ounce cigarette boxes at 10d. a gross. He asked for a deposit and I gave him 5s., which left 7s. 6d. due. Then he said if I would give him the balance he would allow me 10 per cent. I agreed to do so if he would give me a trade refer<lb/>ence. He went out and came back with a reference on the bill head of Mr. A. Gold, wholesale tobacconists and cigar merchants. I gave him the balance which, less 10 per cent., brought the amount to 10s. 7 1/2 d. I should not have paid him unless I believed that letter came from Mr. Gold. I wanted some goods about a week later, and I wrote to Vivian Mansell and Co. and got a reply from them. Then I wrote to Malcolm Campbell and Co., in Lower Thames Street, and I got no reply at all.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. When I gave you the order you did not mention Mansell's, but I was under the impression that you still represented them. I took you to be a genuine man after you brought me the re<lb/>ference.</p>

I said, "No, there will be other charges of a similar nature preferred against you." He then said, "I will tell you what I have been doing. I have been taking orders and receiving deposits, and as I knew I could not complete the orders without capital I have been paying some of them back with what I got from other people. You won't want a remand, will you? I want to get it over. I think I owe about 10 people the same. I will pay Levy if he will let me.

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). Early in March of this year I started business and tried to work up a connection. My object was to canvass for orders and get them executed by the trade. I goon found that to open up a city office required more capital than I had. When I had had an office for about a month I found myself in difficulties. In some cases I executed the orders, and in other cases I returned the deposits. About two weeks before I was arrested I felt I would never be able to make the business pay, and that the more orders I took the more trouble it would be. With this idea I started to clear the deposits up, and I wrote to every customer stating that I should be calling on him on the following Wednesday to return his deposit. Quick had one of those cards. I am quite willing to refund the deposits to-day before I leave the Court. I swear I did not take the deposits knowingly by false pretences. If the case is in my favour I will return the prosecutors their deposits as soon as I am free</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140021"/>
               <p>and I will also promise to give up the business altogether and work under a master. The address I gave to my customer was a genuine one, and I cannot see that I have done anything by false pretences.</p>

                  </persName>, Y Division. On November 15 at 1.45 a.m. I was on duty in Holloway Road when a woman came up and complained of Sharatt following her. I spoke to Sharatt, he had been drinking. He put himself in a fighting attitude and struck at me. I told him I should take him into custody. He became very violent and we both fell to the ground. Bevan then came up, struck me three times on the head and jumped on my right leg. I heard Bevan say, "Get up, George, run, the bleeder's down." Prisoner then ran away. I was taken to the Great Northern Hospital.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Sharatt. You were very violent for about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Bevan. I turned round and saw you deliberately jump on me. You were in civilian clothes at the time.</p>

He then got hold of me to arrest me. I went to run away but slipped and fell towards the pavement with the constable on top of me. He had his knees in the middle of my back. I then said, "Come on, Jack," but I never see Bevan come across the road, as I had my face downwards. The constable released me, and I got up and ran away.</p>

                  </persName>. I am a Swede and a sailor. In April I was stopping at the Sailors' Home, London Docks, having been paid off on the 16th. I had £14 when I went there. On April 22, in the evening, I had a little too much to drink and went out with about £2 10s. in my possession. I met prisoners on the street first. I took them to the "Two Crowns" public-house and bought them and other men drinks. I went to the back yard, Montier followed, and whilst there wanted me to lend him half-a-crown. I said I would not do that but would give him 2s. Some one then struck me from the back: I did not see who. Another man got hold of my arms and throat and struck me several times about the face. Montier I saw had a knife in his hand, cleaning his fingers; he said, "For another word I'll cut your throat." My finger was cut with the knife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am certain I changed a sovereign in the public-house. I invited Montier into the public-house. Hudson followed and I paid for drinks. I don't remember whether Hudson followed me into the yard, but am quite sure about Montier.</p>

Two men were on the ground. One got up and ran away and I took chase; he was not one of the prisoners. Prosecutor was bleeding from the nose, mouth, and hand. I am absolutely certain that Montier was there, although not absolutely sure with regard to Hudson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It would be 250 or 300 yards from the yard to the beershop. Two constables followed into the public-house and brought out Montier and Hudson. With regard to Hudson I did say at the police court, "I did pick out another man for you, but at once saw my mistake." I would not swear to Hudson but will swear that Montier was there.</p>

                  </persName>, City. I was on duty about ten feet away from 127, Cheapside, at about 9.15 a.m. on March 26, when I saw Cornell standing by the door in a suspicious manner. He was rather bulky under his coat. He went off rather hurriedly. I followed and stopped him and said, "What have you got there?" He said, "A hat which I bought from a man up the street at Woolley and Sanders." It was not in paper. This is the hat (produced). I told him I was a police officer and should take him. I returned with him to Woolley and Sanders and had a conversation with the manager. Later in the day I told Cornell of the conversation and asked him if he had anything more at his house. He said, "No; I have nothing." At the police station prisoners were confronted. Cornell said he had the things found by Sergeant Gale at his house from Edwards-Sellett, and that he had bought them at different times.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The hat Cornell was carrying in the street was under his overcoat. He told me directly where he got it from. I understand he has been for 17 years in the employ of Kendall and Dent, jewellers, where he has had charge of the counting house and the keys. I am certain he said he had nothing else at home.</p>

                  </persName>, City. I saw Cornell about 11 a.m. on March 26 at the police station. I told him I was a police officer and should go to his address. He said, "You will find one blue hat there; I have had nothing else." I went to his house with Mr. Stuart, secretary to Woolley and Sanders, where I found these articles (exhibit 3), ten ladies' and children's hat trimmed and untrimmed, two lengths of ribbon, three ladies' ties, two lengths of silk, six motor veils, three wings and one feather. They were in the first-floor front bedroom, some in boxes, some in a wardrobe, and some in dressing-table drawers. I brought them to Cloak Lane police station, where I showed them to Cornell. I said, "How do you account for the pos<lb/>session of these goods?" He said, "Yes; I got them from Edwards." meaning Edwards-Sellett. I said, "Have you any receipts?" He said, "No; I gave him goods and money for them." Edwards-Sellett was then brought in and confronted with Cornell. I said to the former, "These goods have been found at Cornell's address." I said to Cornell, "From whom did you buy these goods?" Cornell said, "From Edwards." Edwards-Sellett said, "That is quite right. I say</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140027"/>
               <p>the same about these goods as I said about the others; I swept them up in the rubbish." I pointed out the good condition they were in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Mrs. Cornell brought some of the goods down and then I went up into the bedroom. Some of the things, which appeared to have been worn I did not bring away, and there was a doubt as to their identification. Cornell did not say he gave goods and no money to Edwards-Sellett for them. "When I spoke to him about the goods at his house I did not say, "Have you had anything else lately?"</p>
               <p>Re-examined. The hate that, had apparently been worn I did not know had come from Woolley and Sanders.</p>

                  </hi>. I am salesman at Woolley and Sanders, and have been in their employ for 25 years. It is not our practice to throw away hats at any time, unless they are past repair or torn. We sell them. We sell them, if damaged, at a reduced price, or send them back to the manufacturers to be put in condition. We have several factories in the country. The hat found under Cornell's coat is our make. It came in from our Luton factory on the morning of March 26. Some of these hats are 10s. 9d. each. I iden<lb/>tify them. They are all registered. They (fate back to last autumn. They are all saleable. None of these had been sold to Edwards<lb/>Sellett to my knowledge. All these ready-moneys came through me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Three of these ten hats are shipping samples, and could only have got into Cornell's possession through Edwards-Sellett. I have no record of any sales to Edwards-Sellett.</p>

                  </hi>, salesman to Woolley and Sanders. Limited. I am chiefly concerned with silks and ribbons and matters of that kind, including motor veils and scarfs. When these wide silks came into stock they remained in these boards and when sold they are put into a different class of board. These silks had never been sold by my firm. They have private marks on them. There was a different mark to each number with the price of the silk. I identify the marks. We do not throw any goods like these away on the rubbish heap. These goods are in a perfectly saleable condition. These wings and feathers are identical with the things we keep. None of them were given or sold to Edwards-Sellett.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Some of these things have our printed labels and marks upon them; not the bulk of them. These are wholesale wrappers. I could prove they came from our firm. The silk ribbons have had their ends knocked off. The mark would be at the end of the roll. They came in with our mark on them from the manufac<lb/>tory. Nothing is done to them at our place in Cheapside.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I live at 42, Birchanger Road, South Norwood. I am a married man, and these things were my wife's. I have surrendered to take my trial. I have been for 17 years in the employment of Kendall and Dent, watchmakers, Cheap-side, and for six years I have been chief of the counting house there, with the care of the keys of the safes. I believe I have always enjoyed the esteem of my employers and there is a representative of them here to-day. I have been suspended during this charge. I have known Edwards-Sellett about 12 months, I think. I did not know what his position was at Woolley and Sanders. I went by his statement and understood his position was that of stock-keeper and warehouse man. He was a man of good appearance. I have, from time to time, re<lb/>ceived these and other things from him, and some of the things that have not been brought away. They were things I could make use of for my wife and family. Whatever I have received from Edwards-Sellett I have kept in my own possession, and they have been worn by my wife and family and not concealed or disposed of in any way. I do not know to what Sergeant Gale referred when he said he did not bring away certain things I got from Edwards-Sellett. I became acquainted with him casually in the first place. I think he was with a friend of mine somewhere adjacent to Cheapside, in Milk Street. He said he was in the wholesale millinery and hat trade and occasionally got hold of travellers' returned samples and other things he could dispose of cheaply. I said, "I shall be glad to avail myself of them." I do not remember what I first got from him. He brought things to my office or I brought them away in boxes. I got these things from him at Woolley and Sanders, Limited, 157, Cheapside. During my meal times I passed there and saw him. Our factory is quite close. I would say, "Good morning," and he might suggest he had a cheap hat and I would ask him for a description of it and he might say, "I have it here," and I said, "All right, I will have it," and I would take it away in a box or in a bag (except on the occasion of the blue hat). I would take them back to my office and they would remain there till I went home. Some he brought himself to 106, Cheapside, my employers. I paid him for the things in the form of goods such as are supplied by my firm. I did not in any case pay him money. Gale has made a mistake in saying that I told him I paid for them in goods and money. I bought the articles from my firm very cheaply. I gave him such goods as a lady's enamelled watch, a gold keeper ring, for which I paid 12s. 7d., a gentleman's bangle 8s., a lady's enamelled watch and bow 12s., an umbrella 5s., cigar case 4s. 2d., three hat pins 2s., hat pin set with pendants 4s. 9d., two more hat pins 1s. 7d., lady's oxydised watch 3s., gentleman's oxydised watch 4s. 1d., lady's umbrella 4s. 6d., gold bracelet 12s. 8d. gold brooch 4s. 3d. lady's oxydised watch 3s., and another of the same kind and price, silver-plated belt and a consider<lb/>able quantity of small items amounting to about £1. Those are the cost prices. They total up to £5 9s. 7d. From the first when spoken</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140029"/>
               <p>to by the police I have said I got those things from Edwards-Sellett. I have no recollection of Beale asking me, "Have you got any more at your house?" and that I said, "No, I have got nothing." I have got something else. Gale did ask me if I had had anything lately, and I said, "Yes, a blue hat." Gale has made a mistake if he says I did not say anything of the kind. The things could be found by anybody who went to my house. I had no idea they were stolen property. I was dealing honestly with my people, and I assumed that Edwards-Sellett was honest also.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have had similar dealings with two other men belonging to that firm. They might be in a position like Edwards-Sellett. I think I was exchanging goods with them. I had not got in my house when searched a variety of goods similar to these from other firms in the immediate neighbourhood. I got handkerchiefs from the two other men and I think some cambric squares, it might be a couple of dozen I think he said or more, and perhaps a dozen of cambric squares. I was collecting these goods in my house. I was buying them for use. I have three boys. I had all things for my family. The hats were obtained over a period of a good many months. Only one has been worn. The hats I considered a suitable variety for my wife to wear during this summer. I think there were only seven ladies' hats. My wife is not a motorist. I bought the six motor veils for her. Some of the things have been worn by her. My wife has worn three of these motor veils. I passed Woolley and Sanders every day at lunch time. No. 127 is the lift entrance. I knew Edwards-Sellett worked the lift. I see now that it was a careless and irregular thing for me to have things from him. I never ques<lb/>tioned him as to how he came by them. I thought he was more than a lift-man; I always thought he was in charge of a large amount of stock. He always spoke of having to make the cost price I gave. I have not learnt that this is millinery silk for trimming hats. The black silk I wanted for a blouse for my wife. I don't know how many yards it is. I did not have that on approval. I bought it perhaps three or four months ago. The ribbons were for trimming hats. Most of those hats are trimmed, but sometimes you take the trimming off a hat and replace it with another. I prepared this list about a couple of months ago, since my arrest. I was admitted to bail. This list is a copy of particulars of goods taken from a statement prepared by my firm of the goods I have purchased—one is the cost price and the other the retail price. The total of £5 9s. 7d. is the cost price. It is not customary to give the staff receipts. The original of that memo<lb/>randum can be seen in the books. I have not them with me. It will show that I paid those sums to my firm. There is nothing to show that any of these goods went to Edwards-Sellett. The other two men I had similar dealings with I paid partly in goods. Friends some<lb/>times asked me to buy articles and I got them from the firm at a cheap rate. I gave 5s. worth of "jimcracks" to Edwards-Sellett for that 10s. 9d. hat. I did not keep a memorandum of my dealings, only a mental note. When I was arrested I reckon I saved Edwards-Sellett</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140030"/>
               <p>£2, for which I was to give him whatever he wanted. I never asked him how it was he could let me have spotless hats for that price. I knew that Woolley and Sanders were a large firm and would have them cheap. I do not remember Edwards-Sellett being asked any questions at the police station. Gale asked me if I had anything else at home and I said, "Yes, one more blue hat." I had not over<lb/>looked the others. He said, immediately after, "You need not answer questions unless you like," and I said, "Very well, I will say nothing more." I did not say, "If you search my house you will only find one blue hat." I understood his question to be "Have you had anything from him lately?" I said, "Yes, one blue hat," and then he said, "Of course you need not answer questions unless you like." I have no recollection of Edwards-Sellett saying at the station that he had given me the goods and that they were mere sweep<lb/>ings from the floor. I believe in court he said he had swept them up with the rubbish. I did not buy them as rubbish.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I believed that Edwards-Sellett was working at Woolley and Sanders as stockkeeper and warehouseman. I had not the least suspicious that he was robbing his employers. He told me he had been there about 14 years. That gave me confidence in dealing with him.</p>
               <p>Judge Rentoul. Would your firm give you goods for yourself or wife or friends at low prices? (A.) Yes. Q. Would they give you goods if they knew you were going to sell them again? (A.) Yes, my lord.</p>

I turned to the left for ten or twelve paces and saw the prisoners sitting on a doorstep. As I passed Mclntosh jumped up and put his arm round my neck and placed his hand in my right-hand trousers pocket. I then broke away and Mclntosh struck at me. I raised my hand <hi rend="italic">to</hi> ward off the blow and received the blow on my thumb and head at the same time. I ran down Brick Lane. Lyons, taking off his overcoat, joined in the chase for about 60 yards. I met a constable and we walked up Brick Lane but could not find the man. About 9 a.m. I saw them sitting on the same doorstep and said, "Good morning." Lyons asked me to buy him a drink. I took them to a public house in Brick Lane. A man in charge of the bar told me to go out and I took the hint. There was a constable outside and I gave prisoners into custody.</p>

I went down the length of the "Three Nuns" public-house and bought a ha'penny paper and stood outside Aldgate Church reading the paper for twenty minutes. Two men whom I knew came along and asked me to go to Epsom races with them. I said I had no money to go with. They said, "We have not got time to stop, but if you come with us you can have a drink on the way." I went along with them to London Bridge. I went down the steps leading into Tooley Street and from there I went to the Tower Bridge, and it was seven o'clock when I got to Aldgate again. The first time I saw prosecutor was in "The Bell" when it was gone nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was not sitting on the doorstep in Flower and Dean Street at 5.40, and I know nothing about the assault. I only know Lyons as a street acquaintance just the same as men using the same public-house.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, not on oath). I admitted all through that I was there talking to a constable at 6.15. Previous to that, at a quarter to five, I nodded to another policeman who was waiting to be relieved by the policeman that comes on at five past six. Prosecutor says there was no policeman there, but I can prove it by the policemen's numbers. It seems rather funny. If such a thing had happened do you imagine for one moment I would have stayed around that neighbourhood. I never saw prosecutor till nine o'clock when he came along Brick Lane. and I suggested he should treat me. Do you think for one minute if such a thing had taken place I would have gone to the prosecutor and sked him to treat me?</p>

               <p>McIntosh confessed to having been convicted at Clerkenwell Ses<lb/>sions on November 6, 1906. Lyons confessed to a conviction at Clerkenwell Sessions on December 4, 1906.

                  </hi>, fruit salesman, Spitalfields Market. Prisoner came to me the week before last and asked me for work and I took him into my employ as buyer. I handed him over £10 for that purpose on the Tuesday. (Here an interpreter was found to be necessary.) He was to to buy fruit and bring it in a van, but did not bring the fruit. As he did not return I went in search of him and found him at Jack Johnson's Club in Phipp Street. I asked him what he was doing there, and he said he had been playing faro and had only 2 1/2 d. left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He was not my partner. He was to get £2 a week and no commission; but I said I would give him something extra if I was satisfied. I had a deal with him the previous week, but the first three days I took him on trial. Prisoner had not paid £7 in the pre<lb/>vious week for the purposes of the partnership; he gave me no money. I agree that I also gave him £10 on the Monday, and that Tuesday was the second occasion. On Monday he could buy no goods and so he returned the money to my second man. I did not give him £4; I gave him £10. I did not intend to go to the County Court instead of the Police Court; I do not know the difference.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath, through an interpreter). I have been in this country from 11 to 12 years. I am a costermonger, but of late I have not been well and I have not had much money. I had a few pounds with which I used to buy fruit and hand it to salesmen who stand in the market to sell. During last winter I was in partnership with a woman, and I used to buy for many people. I have bought as much as £100 worth at a time, but have taken it out in lots. Siegal had to pay me nothing; I went into partnership with him with £7 about ten days before I was arrested. I gave the £7 to Siegal. We had a deal and made a profit of 30s. on some barrels of apples, but after that we lost. On the Monday he handed me £10, but there was no business to be done. On the Tuesday he handed me nothing, as we had a quarrel. He gave me £4 balance back and said he did not want to deal with me any more. I did not go to the Jack Johnson Club. I met prosecutor in Commercial Street as I was coming from the pictures in Shoreditch. I asked him what he had done with the barrels of apples and he said, "I have sold and we lost £6." We had a quarrel because I did not believe it. He gave me in charge.</p>

He said, "It was quite an accident; I done it with a razor; I was having a shave." At the police station he pulled the razor out of his pocket. There was no blood on it. He then said, "I wish I had done it on her properly." They had both been drinking, but they were sober.</p>

I was not drunk; I knew what I was doing. I had cleaned my buttons and had just lathered myself to start shaving before catching the 7.15 train to go back to barracks. She started to argue the point and I said I did not want any words with her. She picked up a jug to throw at me and I took it out of her hand. It was in the struggle that her neck got cut. It was a pure accident. Her mother and cousin were in the room at the same time. My wife was drunk, because she had been downstairs drinking after we had had our dinners. The cousin does not drink and I would like to call her.</p>

                  </persName>, shipping agent, 179, Shaftesbury Avenue, W C. On April 24 I was in Regent Street about midnight, waiting for a bus to go to the Marble Arch. A fellow came up and asked me for a light, which I gave him. He asked me in which direction I was going. I told him, and he said he would accompany me as far as Oxford Circus. He was a very civil and gentlemanly fellow and asked me if I would go home with him and have a drink. I at first refused, but as he insisted I did so, in order to get rid of him. I went with him to 6, Southampton Street, Fitzroy Square. After I had been inside about a minute prisoner and two other men entered the room. Prisoner said, "I suppose you have some money." "I have some," I said. "Well," he said, "I am very glad of that." He then said I must give them all I had and that it was no good resisting. I en<lb/>deavoured to resist when prisoner gave me a tremendous blow in the mouth; while he held my right hand the other man put a handker<lb/>chief over my mouth, and prisoner took all my money, £ 4 15s. Pri<lb/>soner then told me to go out. I went by the front door, and prisoner and the other two men went out by a back door. I met a constable in the passage outside and complained that I had been robbed. The policeman gave chase and arrested the prisoner. The other two escaped.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The man I walked with from Regent Street was a perfect stranger. It was impossible for me to prevent the men from taking my money, as there were three men there. I have been in England two years and have travelled a good deal. There was no question of playing cards, and that was not the object for which I went to the house. I was quite sober. Prisoner did say at the police station, "I deny it all."</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I endeavoured to shout, but on four or five occasions they put a handkerchief over my mouth.</p>

Southampton Street is a quiet street; there is no traffic, but it would not be possible to hear cries from inside No. 6, as there is a mews at the back where 150 horses are continually kicking and making a noise all through the night.</p>

I turned round and saw prisoner running up Tottenham Street towards Tottenham Court Road. I gave chase and caught him in Alfred Mews. On entering the mews he placed his right hand in his trousers pocket and threw something away, and I heard the clinking of coins. I stopped prisoner, who said, "What's the matter; it is all right." I took him to the station and Police-constable 463 and prosecutor followed on afterwards. On being charged prisoner said, "I deny it all. I struck him in self<lb/>defence.

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I do not live at 6, Southamp<lb/>ton Street, but merely use the house for the purpose of gambling—a club. It is a back room, they play cards and I take the deal money—so much a deal. On the evening in question I was going along Southampton Street with a friend I knew as "Fred," when I first saw prosecutor standing outside 6, Southampton Street with a casual acquaintance of mine named Leonard Smith. I said to Smith, "Hallo, have you brought a client along?" He Bays, "Yes, I met him in Regent Street." Smith asked me if there was any playing going on to—night. I said, "Yes, we can start at once if you like." Smith opened the door with a key and we all went into the back room together, on the ground floor. I lit the candle. Fred brought out the cards. We first played nap and afterwards changed the game to faro. In the course of playing prosecutor handed Fred a 5s. piece in payment of a debt; this coin passed round and finally I got it. I should think prosecutor lost about £ 2 17s. or £ 2 18s. We were going to finish when prosecutor said he had a £ 5 note, so I suggested that I should play him for it by picking up colours. He agreed. He brought out the £ 5 note and showed it to me. I said, Look</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140040"/>
               <p>here, I will play you for £1 a time." We kept on doubling the stakes up to its coming to £4. He then turned round on me and said, "You are cheating." I said, "No, I'm not." He said, "You are," and then struck me across the table by the side of the face. I naturally retaliated and struck him in the mouth, cutting his lip; then there was a scuffle. We both got up and prosecutor closed with me and, he being much heavier, I fell underneath on the floor; the table was upset and the cards went all over the place. Prosecutor continued pummelling me when Fred got hold of his collar and pulled him off, saying, "Now stop this blooming noise, we will all get turned out." Prosecutor's mouth was bleeding and Fred said, "Let me bathe your face," and while doing this I straightened the room and began to pick up the cards. I had just finished when Len said, "Mind, he has got a knife." I turned and saw prosecutor making towards me with a large clasp knife open; he had a peculiar expression in his eyes. He said, "I kill you, you cheat." He made a lunge at me and I dodged him, knocked the candle over and out, and ran out for all I was worth away from him; he was acting like a maniac. I was stopped by Drew at Tottenham Street, where I was searched. I had on me a sovereign and the 5s. piece. The sovereign was my earnings; the other fellows had won the other money. I did not throw any money away—I had not the opportunity.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Smith opened the door and we all went in. I was running away when Drew says he saw me, because I was frightened that the prosecutor would stick the knife in me; I did not want him to catch me; foreigners are very excitable people. I said, "It's all right," because I knew I was perfectly safe in the officer's charge I told Drew that prosecutor had threatened me with a knife. Verdict,

                  </hi>, cycle dealer, 8, Garrick Street, Long Acre. I was rung up on the telephone on March 27 by, I thought, Mr. Bleichert. I know him as being a gentleman with a car. He asked me, to go to his house, 41, Highbury New Park, to see two motor bicycles. I went, the door was opened by a maid, and I was shown the bicycles by Greenshields. We discussed the condition of them and I went back. I was again rung up by, as I thought, Mr. Bleichert, and we arranged the price. I cannot say whether one of the machines belonged to Franklin. I inspected two and arranged to pay £22 for them, and they were delivered the same evening by Greenshields with a van man. I identify the machines produced. I paid Greenshields for them by a cheque for £20 and £2 in gold. The cheque was made payable to Bleichert from whom I thought I was buying. I have never seen him and should not know his voice on the telephone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I never knew Bleichert to be in the cycle trade. I have known Greenshields for five or six years as a honest man. The £2 I paid him was not as commission, but I had been drawing rather heavily on my account and I was afraid I should overdraw if I gave a cheque for the full amount. This is my bank manager's ex<lb/>tract (produced); though that shows a balance of £127 on that date. I had cheques out. I know Greenshields has been a chauffeur to many people of position, including Mr. Justice Bargrave Deane. He did not tell me they belonged to Mr. Bleichert; I assumed they did, as he had been his chauffeur. I know now that Mr. Bleichert had left the country. I don't think the machines were worth much more, con<lb/>sidering their age. I sold them afterwards for £35.</p>

I let out vans, and on March 27 I received an older through my wife to take a van to Newington Green Road, Lees' bicycle shop, where I saw the two prisoners. We all drove to 41, Highbury New Park. They brought out two bicycles and told me to take them to Garrick Street, the corner of St. Martin's Lane, where they arranged to meet me. I followed Greenshields. He went into the shop and I waited outside. The motor cycles were unloaded and we took them into the shop. Lees paid me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I said at the police court that I did not remember what occurred. I have thought it over since. We have so many jobs. I am positive that Lees paid me 3s. 6d. We had a drink.</p>

                  </persName>. On March 25 I went to the garage in Swain's Lane, Highgate, belonging to Butlin. I found the lock had been forced off and I was informed that certain property was missing. I made enquiries and saw Mr. Cuthbertson. On April 4 I saw Green-shields at Highbury. I told him of the robbery and said I found that on March 26 he had negotiated the sale of two cycles to Lees. I said, "Can you tell me where you got them from?" He said, "I got them from a pal of mine, I cannot say who he is." I took him to the Kentish Town police station, and he then said to me, "I got those from Mr. Lees, of the Alma Motor Works." I then went over and saw Lees and brought him to the police station. On the 17th I confronted them and explained to Lees what Greenshields had said. Lees denied that he had had anything to do with Greenshields with respect to the cycles. I then showed Greenshields the cheque and said to him, "This is made out to your late employer, Mr. Bleichert, who is now abroad; he left on March 7 prior to this robbery." I asked him if he had any ex<lb/>planation to give and he said, "I cannot give you any explanation as to that." When he was charged he made no reply. I also showed him a receipt which I found in his pocket. This is a receipt issued to him on March 27 in the name of J. Cummings, "Sold to Green<lb/>shields two secondhand motor cycles, for £21. Received with thanks, signed J. Cummings." I asked him who J. Cummings was, and he said, "I cannot tell you."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Greenshield's statement was that he bought the cycles of Lees. He sent a letter from the gaol asking us to see him, and he was seen at Marylebone, and when he was there he said, "As Lees is locked up I refuse to make any statement now." Greenshields was chauffeur to Mr. Justice Bargrave Deane and a lot of other gentlemen. He has a <hi rend="italic">very good</hi> character. I do not question that at all.</p>

                  </persName>. On April 16 I went with last witness to 41, Highbury New Park, to arrest Greenshields for ware-house breaking at Swains Lane. Sergeant Page arrested him. Next day, from what we heard, I went to 63, Newington Green Road and saw Lees there at his shop. I told him that Greenshields was detained for breaking into a warehouse and stealing three motor cycles. I said,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140043"/>
               <p>"He states he got them from you." He said, "It is absolutely un<lb/>true." He accompanied me to the station, where he was confronted with Greenshields. I then repeated what Greenshields had said, and Lees said, "It is a lie." I took a statement from him (producing paper), At the time I took this statement I had no <hi rend="italic">intention</hi> of charging this man. On the 24th at Marylebone <hi rend="italic">police court, from</hi> what Greenshields told me, with Sergeant Page, I made further enquiry, and saw Charles Anthony, of Islington, and from what he told me I saw Lees and Greenshields again. I said, "I have seen Anthony, who has told me that on the 24th March you (Greenshields) engaged him to take two motor cycles from Garrick Street, and they paid you 3s. 6d. for the job." He said, "It is a lie." Greenshields said, "I handed him a cheque for £20 and endorsed Bleichert's name on the cheque and gave him £1 for his trouble. I did write Bleichert's name on the cheque. It is done every day in business." He was taken to the police station and made no further reply.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath), 41, Highbury New Park, Canonbury. I was chauffeur to Mr. Bleichert, a German gen<lb/>tleman, for 12 months. I lived with him on March 14th at Dussel<lb/>dorf. He gave me a good character, which has been given to Sergeant Page. I have also been chauffeur to Mr. Justice Bargrave Deane for 18 months. I left to better myself. That was my first private situa<lb/>tion. I was with Mr. Read five years after I left Mr. Justice Bar<lb/>grave Deane. I got a good character from him. No charge of any kind has ever been made against me until now. I was caretaker at Mr. Bleichert's house at the time of this occurrence. I got two motor bicycles from Lees, who keeps a cycle shop in Gray's Inn Road. I have known him for six months. I saw Lees the day before they were sold to Cuthbertson, and he asked me if I could find a customer for these motor bicycles and if I could store them at my place as he was busy in the shop and had not much room for them. I took them to my place; Lees took one and I took the other; I put them in my shed in the morning. Lees said that if I could get a customer I might get something for it, and I said I would try to sell them and would see Mr. Cuthbertson in the morning. I had known Cuthbertson as a cycle dealer for five years. I had to go to Cuthbertson in the morning to buy some piston rings for an engine I was repairing at Barnet that week. I asked Cuthbertson if he could do with two motor cycles, and he said he would like to see them. I told him I was going back and if he would like to come with me he could see them in my yard, and he did so. I told him the price was £24. He looked at them and offered me £22. I said I would see Mr. Lees and ask him if he would accept £22 and would let him know after dinner. Cuthbertson went back to his business. I had my lunch and saw Lees about two o'clock and told him what Cuthbertson had offered for the bicycles. Lees said he Would accept the offer, and I rang Cuthbertson up on the telephone and asked him when I should bring them down; he said</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140044"/>
               <p>I was to bring them down as soon as possible or before six. I went back to Lees and asked him if he could get a van to take the two cycles away and he sent for a van while I waited in the shop. We went back to my house and got the two cycles on the van and took them down to Long Acre, and Cuthbertson gave me a cheque for £20 and £2 in cash. I met Lees outside and gave him the cheque and left him. I I took the £2 as commission for having sold the bicycles. I expected to get £1 out of Cuthbertson and £1 out of Lees. I had no suspicion that the bicycles were obtained improperly. I had known Lees to be a respectable cycle dealer. The receipt found in my possession was given me by Lees, who told me he had received it from Cummings for the bicycles. I told the police I had it in my pocket and they found it. If there was anything crooked about it I had lots of opportunities of destroying it. I was at home with my wife till eight or nine on Sunday evening, March 24, and then I went to see some friends, Mr. and Mrs. Wood. I have not enquired whether they are here to-day. I was in bed after 11.30, leaving the Woods at 11. I was indoors all the afternoon. I had been to the "Talbot" public-house in the evening. I was in bed until eight o'clock the next morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I saw Lees the day before Cuthbertson received the cycles. Lees and I both went to Garrick Street because I had some business to do, and he wanted the cheque, so I asked him to go down with me. When I found the cheque was made out to Bleichert I mentioned it to Cuthbertson, and he said it was of no great import<lb/>ance. I had the £2 in cash. I in fact got the £2 out of Lees. I went down to see Cuthbertson first and rung him up after. I disagree with Cuthbertson when he says that the first he heard about these cycles was by telephone. I mentioned to him that they came from Lees and that I should have to ask him about the price of them to settle. I swear I told Cuthbertson that the cycles belonged to Lees. When Police-constable Page first asked me a question about these matters I told him I had got them from a pal of mine. I told him the name of Cummings later on. I did not say I got them from a pal and could not tell him who it was. I mentioned the name of Cummings and the police-sergeant called me a liar. Later on I said I got them from Lees of the Alma Motor Works. When Lees was brought in and we were confronted he denied that. I cannot explain why. When I was asked why the cheque was made payable to Bleichert, he having left the country nearly three weeks before the occurrence, I told him I did not make the cheque out and he was to see Cuthbertson about it. Sergeant Page found it on me when he searched me. I told him had it in my pocket the night he came and arrested me. I did not at once say, "1 got them from a pal of mine, I cannot say who it is." I told him I got them from Cummings. Page accused me of having the cycles, and I told him I had a receipt for them in my pocket within ten minutes of his being in the house. I believe when I said I got them from Cummings it was the first answer I made. I do not know Cummings. I gave Lees a cheque for £20 to pay for them, and he paid Cummings, and he told Cummings I had sold them. That is why my name was put on the receipt.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140045"/>
               <p>Re-examined. I never told Cuthbertson or led him in any way to beneve, that Bleichert used to sell motor bicycles. I told Page I had the receipt in my pocket, and he took it out of my pocket when I got to the station. There was nothing in my pocket of a compromising nature. I believed I was selling them for Cummings through Lees. I considered the deal absolutely straight. I said nothing to lead him to believe that they came from Bleichert. I asked Cuthbertson why Bleichert's name was on the cheque and he said it was not of great importance whose name was there. I did not ask him to make it out in his own name. When I told him I got them from Cummings it was untrue. Lees knew I had sold the machines and he saw Cum<lb/>mings and mentioned my name to him. Cummings did not sell any<lb/>thing to me. Page asked me who Cummings was and I told him I did not know. I afterwards told him I got the cycles from Lees.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I have been in business as a cycle dealer nearly seven yean. I have never before had any charge made against me or attack on my character. On March 26 a customer came to my shop and made a small purchase of some spokes for a back wheel of a cycle, which he said he was going to fit on. I asked him what sort of cycle he rode. He said he had an Indian motor bicycle. I said, "Are these the spokes you want?" He said, "Yes." I said, "The Indian bicycles are made with 28-inch wheels." He said he had an advertisement in the paper to sell two, and asked me if I would buy them. I said I would try to find a customer as I had not the money. He said he would, take any reasonable price as he was in trouble with the bailiffs in his house. I said I should like to see the cycles, and they were brought in in the evening. We tried to come to some arrangement, and he said, "Anything over £20 will suit me," and I was to have anything over that I could get. I did not ask him if they were his. He left them in my charge. Greenshields came along in the evening. We were pals. I said, "Do you think you can sell these? The man is in trouble and wants the money. It must be done quick." He said he would try to find a customer. I told him to get as much as he could. We were to do it, together. This is the receipt the man who left the cycles gave me the next day for the light<lb/>made one. I know now his name was Cummings. It shows that he bought it of Halliday. I asked Greenshields to take them, as I had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140046"/>
               <p>not room for them. He found a customer (Cuthbertson). We took them in Anthony's van to Long Acre, and met the carman in Garrick Street. Greenshields took the cycles out and gave them to Cuthbertson, who gave him a cheque for £20 and £2 in gold. I stood the carman a drink. One of us paid him 3s. 6d. There was a mistake in the spelling of the name on the cheque, which Cuthbertson corrected. The police accused me of selling the machines to Greenshields. I had not the money to pay for them. They were simply left in my charge. I was arrested about three weeks after the bicycles were discovered and a week after Greenshields. Cummings had been in the shop two or three times as a customer. I believed the bicycles had been honestly come by when they came into my possession.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Cummings said he was turning over the cycles at a loss. The document referring to Cummings buying from Halliday refers to the black bicycle. It states that he bought it on August 22, 1911. I did not know it was stolen. That is the receipt he got when he bought it. I thought it reasonable that he should sell the two for that price taking into account the deterioration. I have been down and ascertained there is no such address as that of Halliday's. Cum<lb/>mings made out that receipt to Greenshields on my instructions because I did not Want the customer to think that I had made a bargain out of his downfall. Page spoke to me in the presence of Greenshields and said, "Greenshields has told me he got these cycles from Lees of the Alma Motor Works." I understood he said I had sold them to him. I gave a statement to Goodchild, or it was made out in court. I understood it was ruled out. (Upon Mr. McDonald objecting to the admissibility of this statement, Judge Rentoul ruled it out on the ground that it might incriminate the prisoner in a charge of forgery.) That receipt from Halliday to Cummings so far as I know is absolutely genuine and was given to me by Cummings.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses to character were called on behalf of Lees.</p>

                  </hi>, traveller, 9, Charles Street, Stepney (examined through an interpreter). I have known prisoner for two years. I speak English a little. On April 25 I saw prisoner in Fieldgate Street, Whitechapel. He asked me if I would like to make some money. I said "Yes." He said he would call on me the next day and tell me the business. He called on me the next day and said he wanted me to play a trick on his brother-in-law, Bernstein, in order that he should be arrested. Then he showed me some pieces of cloth in a sack, which he said had come from his brother-in-law. He said he would bring some counterfeit coins which were to be placed between the pieces of cloth wrapped in paper, and I was to take them to Bernstein's house. Prisoner called again on the Sunday and brought four half-crowns; two were good and two were bad. I met him by appointment at 10 o'clock on the Monday and he said "Keep this bag and meet me at 12 o'clock at the corner of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140049"/>
               <p>Jubilee Street, outside the public-house." I then went to Leman Street Police Station and made a statement to the oplice. I returned to Jubilee Street, and prisoner was arrested. I was about two yards away and did not speak to prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was to go to prisoner's brother-in-law and ask tor samples of stuff. The money was already in the sack between the rolls of stuff. I was to buy the stuff and leave it in the bag and then prisoner said he would go and tell the police and they were to find the bad money in his brother-in-law's possession and he would be locked up. He promised that if the business went off all right. I should have other business and make £50 or £100 a week. He said that if Bernstein was arrested he (prisoner) would be able to buy Bernstein's stock cheap. I have been in England about four years and have had deal<lb/>ings with prisoner. I did not have any conversation with the pri<lb/>soner on Sunday about some buttons. It is not true that I then owed prisoner £1. He once bought goods to the amount of £96 and done me in for 30s. He was to give me 6d. in the £ commission, but has only given me £1. I deny that on Monday at 12 o'clock I planted in prisoner's hand the packet of counterfeit coins saying, "Here are the buttons."</p>

                  </persName>, H Division. On April 29 Green came to Leman Street Police Station and made a communication, and in consequence of what he said I and Sergeant Weston went to the Com<lb/>mercial Road, near the "George" public-house. I there saw Green on the opposite side carrying a sack. At 12.15 prisoner came from Jubilee Street and stood outside the public-house. He had his right hand in his coat pocket and looked up and down outside the public-house. On seeing Green he beckoned him to come. As he did so Sergeant Weston and I went up to him and got to him before Green. There had been no communication between Green and prisoner. I said to prisoner "We are police officers. I have reason to believe that you have got a number of counterfeit coins in your possession and I am going to take you to Arbour Square Police Station." He made no reply, but he pulled his hand out of his right-hand pocket and handed me what 1 afterwards found 19 half-crowns. He said, "I don't know if they are counterfeit; he has just given them to me." I said, "Nothing of the sort; I have had you both under observation." Going over to Charles Street prisoner put his hand into his left-hand trousers pocket and withdrew it, and I noticed that his hand was closed. I seized his hand, which contained four half-crowns, two good and two which I afterwards found were counterfait. When I seized prisoner he said, "You think you are clever, I shall say he slipped them in my pocket," meaning Green. I conveyed him to the station, when he was charged.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had never seen Green in my life before he came to the station.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I live and carry on business as a job dealer at 80, Bedford Street, Mile End, and have done so for 11 years. The first transaction I had with Green was over three years ago. I have only had two deals with him. He introduced people to me who wanted to get rid of their stuff, which I purchased as a job dealer. Upon the Sunday in question he owed me 27s. 6d., and he borrowed another 2s. 6d., which, made 30s. He called at my place and said he knew of a line of trimmings, and he thought the price would suit me. If I bought he wanted 5 per cent, commission. He said he could not see the people that day, but would see them on the Monday. He met me at the "George" at 12 o'clock on, Monday, and showed me the samples. He walked across the road to me, and said, "I can't go with you to the place, but here are the samples." He handed me a small parcel wrapped in brown paper, which I put in my coat pocket. Then he said, "I had a bit of luck this morning, Mr. Nathan, there is 10s. on account of what I owe you, and don't be nervous about it." Immediately after Sergeant Wright walked from the back of me, touched me on the shoulder, and said, "I have reason to believe you are in possession of counterfeit coin." For the moment I did not know what "counterfeit" meant, so 1 looked up to him and said, "All the money I have got on me is all good money, and if there is anything bad it may be in this parcel that this man gave me." I then put my left hard in my trousers pocket and said, "This is the coin which Mr. Green handed to me, you can have this and see if there is any of that money about it." I was then taken to the police station and charged, and Green was let go. I am on the best of terms with Bernstein, my brother-in-law; he is one of my sureties.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I deny that I saw Green on the Friday; 1 had no discussion with him with regard to getting any stuff. When I went to his house on the Sunday the door was shut but not locked. The whole of his story about Bernstein is untrue. I did not say to the detective, "You think you are clever, don't you; I shall say he slipped them in my hand."</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I swear that Green handed me a parcel before I was arrested.</p>

                  </persName>, City. On May 2 I was with another officer (Dorey) in plain clothes in Fore Street at about 5.50 p.m., when I saw prisoner and Haycock. They went from Fore Street through Wood Street and Hart Street into Monkwell Street. Meredith went into No. 31, Haycock remained outside, apparently watching. Mere<lb/>dith came out in about two minutes and spoke to Haycock and then crossed the road to No. 5, Monkwell Street. He went in, Haycock remaining outside. He remained inside for one or two minutes and when he came out they went through Silver Street into Wood Street.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140052"/>
               <p>Meredith went into No. 59, Haycock remaining watching. They then went back to Hart Street, "when Meredith went into one of the warehouses, Haycock again remaining outside for a few minutes. They then went to Falcon Avenue. Haycock stood at the corner of the avenue and Meredith turned into the avenue and went into No. 3. He came out in a minute or two and spoke to Haycock. Constable Humphreys, in uniform, then came along the other side of the avenue and prisoners stood talking and looking towards the constable and when he turned into Noble Street Haycock left Meredith and stood apparently watching Humphreys. He then returned and after speaking they both went into No. 3. They remained in there a minute or two and then both came out hurriedly. I followed them across Falcon Avenue to Friday Street, where Meredith went into No. 46, Haycock remaining outside watching. When Meredith came out they went through Friday Street and turned to the right into Cannon Street. Dorey and I were about to turn out of Friday Street into Cannon Street, when prisoners came back and tried to avoid us by stepping into the road. I caught hold of Mere<lb/>dith. I said "I am a police officer and am going to arrest you." He immediately became violent and struck me several times in the stomach and said, "You bastard; I'll make a mess of your b—." He attempted to strike me with his knee in that part and I got it in my side. He was taken to the station and made no reply to the charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I asked for his address and he gave me a wrong one. May 2 was a Thursday. The warehouses prisoners visited are let out in floors to different firms, and between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. some of the occupiers are gone—say on the third floor—and some working on the second floor. They are Manchester warehouses principally. Some remain open till midnight. There were plenty of people about, mostly leaving business. I did not know that these men had been convicted before. I caught Meredith with my left hand and put my right hand on his shoulder. As soon as I got hold of him, I told him I was a police-officer. He did not say I was not. I arrested him at 6.30. I commenced to keep him under observation at 5.55. I saw prisoners doing things I thought improper. I have no independent witnesses as to the assault on me. It was not possible to get anybody. Re-examined. As soon as I caught hold of Meredith's right wrist, I told him I was a police-officer. He began to struggle, and then I caught him with my right hand. I could not blow my whistle. It is a very difficult thing to take a prisoner and to ask a bystander to blow your whistle. I am quite certain that prisoners are the men that I and the other detective were watching. I had seen them once before.</p>

                  </persName>. I was in Fore Street on May 2, when I saw these prisoners. They came up Fore Street and turned into Wood Street, and then went to the right of Hart Street, and then to Monk<lb/>well Street. When at Monkwell Street, on the right-hand side, they halted outside No. 31, and Meredith went inside, Haycock remaining outside on the footpath. In a minute or two Meredith came out; they then got speaking to one another and went across the road a little</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140053"/>
               <p>further up Monkwell Street towards Silver Street. Then they halted outside another warehouse—I believe No. 5—and Meredith again went in, Haycock stopping outside. Meredith came out after a few minutes, and they went to Silver Street and turned into Wood Street, and, coming along Wood Street, they halted outside No. 69. Mere<lb/>dith did exactly the same thing there. They then went up to Monk<lb/>well Street, and Meredith went into the warehouse he went into first, and then went up to Falcon Square and turned into Falcon Avenue. Then Haycock halted a little and Meredith disappeared round the corner. I got opposite and saw Meredith go in at the last door on the right, No. 3, and the same thing occurred, Haycock waiting outside. Meredith came out and spoke to Haycock, and went back again, and went in at the same door. Just at that moment a constable in uniform appeared opposite. Meredith came out, and Haycock spoke to him and went across Noble Street, and looked up to see which way the constable had gone. Then he disappeared, and came out again and ran into Oak Street Lane into Wood Street into Friday Street. In Friday Street they halted on the left-hand side, and then Meredith went into another warehouse, No. 46, Haycock remaining outside. Meredith came out and went into Cannon Street and turned found the corner. When two or three yards off Friday Street they came back and met us practically face to face and turned off into the roadway to avoid us. I then arrested Haycock, and Bradshaw arrested Meredith. They were got to the station. I was present when Meredith was charged. He made no reply. I have no doubt as to the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not know them before. Bradshaw had seen them before, I think. Brads haw called! my attention to them and said he saw them acting suspiciously on the Monday previously. I was on ordinary plain-clothes duty. I usually make a note; but in this case it was not necessary. I have a notebook, but not with me. If I had my pocket-book here I could find the address of Meredith and Haycock. I made a report from my diary. In this case I had nothing to put in. I did not see any assault committed on Bradshaw. We were close together at first. I did not see Bradshaw holding Meredith. A civilian stood at the corner of Friday Street blowing Bradshaw's whistle and another one was blowing mine. The next thing I saw, prisoners had moved about 12 yards up the street. I have not anyone here who blew the whistles. There was plenty of business being done round there at that time of night. I do seriously suggest that these men at six in the evening, with thousands about, were waiting to commit a crime, or we should not have arrested them. I do not know that I have made a mistake yet in regard to police court cases. I kept prisoners under observation from 5.50 till I arrested them. I have been getting on for 12 years in the police force.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. There was no denial by prisoners that they were the men, nor did they cross-examine me to that effect. I could not say what was happening to Meredith, because I was having a very rough time myself and I am still under the doctor.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). At 5.30 p.m. on May 2 I was told by my governor, Mr. Higgins, that as he had nothing for me to do I could go out and look for a job with Haycock, and I went to Gutter Lane. He said it was down by Knightrider Street:, so me and Haycock went to go there. We went out from where I lived from Queen's Road, Dalston, down to Cambridge Street till we came to Norton Folgate. We turned down Worship Street and got to Wilson Street, where there was a large cigarette factory and a lot of females there and we saw a lot of these girls coming out. We saw one of Carter Paterson's van-horses down and we helped to get the horse up and got hold of the shafts and Haycock helped me to pull the van on one side in the gutter. Me and Haycock assisted the carman to put the strap through the crup. We left the carman and went on our way to Gutter Lane. There was supposed to be a building to be erected. I am a carpenter and I was going to see if it was possible to start the following morning. We went down and turned into Moorgate Street into Fore Street and turned down Fore Street and got to the corner of Wood Street at 6.25 and went straight through Wood Street right away till we got to Cheapside and turned to the left, as I knew it was near Knightrider Street. We turned down Friday Street and when we got to the other end a man caught me by the throat and, of course, I done the same as anybody else would. He said, "Down him, down him," and a lot of men ran out and I had no chance. He said, "Blow my whistle, will you?" Some<lb/>body blew his whistle and I was taken to the station and charged with assaulting the officer. He did not tell me he was a police officer. The carman is here to-day. It is absolutely untrue that I ever, entered one place. I have been doing honest work since August last. I came out of prison, I think, in July.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was before the Alderman in the City on May 8, 10, and 13,' and heard the evidence given. I was stopped by the clerk at Guildhall. I told him if he would let me I would ask a police officer and I was just going to ask him about entering these places when Mr. Savill said, "Yes, I have heard all about that," and I was shut up. I never said that I had assisted a carman to get his horse up. I never said anything about reserving my defence. I got my brother to find out who the carman was. I wrote a letter to Mr. Savill asking him would he subpoena the carman from Curtain Road. I gave a description of a dark gelding And a carman with a red face. That was at the second hearing. What the officers have said is absolutely untrue. I swear that I was going to Gutter Lane to get a job. I do not know any of the warehouses that have been mentioned. I know those streets. Haycock and I were employed at the same place. I was not out with him the previous Monday night.</p>

On the 7th a letter was received at the Guildhall Police Court from Meredith, saying that he had helped a man to get his horse up, and he wanted this man called. The letter was handed to me. This was the first time Meredith had said this. I went to Carter Paterson's depot in Shoreditch and saw the manager, who told me that no one had reported any horse down on that day, but if I would call later he would make inquiries. I went back at seven o'clock, and he said he had interviewed each of his carmen but had been unable to find anyone who had a horse down on May 2.</p>

The appeal was heard on April 29th, and dismissed (7 Cr. App. R., 233). Prisoners were now brought up for judgment.</p>
            <p>Mr. Muir appeared for the prosecution; Mr. George Elliott, K.C., and Mr. Russell Davies for Castiglione.</p>
            <p>Mr. Elliott urged, on behalf of Castiglione, that, while there might have been an abuse of the process of the Court and technical perjury committed, as a matter of fact he had not defrauded anybody. Every witness called for the prosecution not only repudiated entirely the suggestion that anybody was defrauded, but said again and again that no one who attended the sales had made a single complaint. No one said he had been misled. Nor was there any evidence that Castiglione had fabricated one single picture.</p>
            <p>Witnesses were called on behalf of Castiglione to testify to his excellent character.</p>
            <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM STEVENS</hi>, Scotland Yard, said that in 1901 Porteous was convicted at this Court of obtaining money by false pretences and sentenced to three years penal servitude, that charge being in relation to a fraudulent bucket shop. In 1907 he was con<lb/>victed of uttering a forged affidavit and sentenced to three months' hard labour.</p>
            <p>A written statement was handed up by Porteous in which he said he most humbly apologised to the High Court, from the Lord Chancellor down to the youngest clerk, for having abused the process</p>
            <p>of the Court. He only got 2s. 1d. for each affidavit. He did not attend the sales and did not have any profit from them. All he did was through adversity. He had never defrauded anyone in his life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="smallCaps">CASTIGLIONE</hi> said he was never advised that he was doing anything contrary to law. He injured no one. He had never fabricated "old masters "; they were to be bought every day from a few shillings to many pounds, according to the state they were in. The money he got he spent in keeping modern artists who to-day were neglected for the sake of old masters. Several men whose names were of repute to-day were brought up by him in his business. He maintained that he had been a benefactor to art, and the only reason he used the Sheriff was to get people together, because there had been so much rubbish on the market that one could not attract people by advertising. The pictures he sold were good pictures; they were not spurious. Many of his pictures were in the museums of the country.</p>
            <p>Judge Lumley Smith observed that prisoners had been guilty of a persistent course of perjury extending over many years. This was a serious crime and must be punished.</p>
            <p>Sentences: Castiglione, six months' imprisonment, second division; Porteous, twelve months' imprisonment, second division; to date from the first day of the February session.</p>

                  </hi>, dressmaker, 74, Albany Street. Prisoner called on me on October 17 about a book named "Cassell's Lawyer," in respect of which he was canvassing. He told me that he travelled for the Sun Insurance Company and was also a private debt collector of 159, Newington Butts, S.E. I gave him 4s., with which to insure two of my workgirls. I also gave him 1s. for expenses in collecting £2 8s. owed me by a Mrs. Cox. He came again on November 11 and asked for 5s. to take out a special summons against Mrs. Cox, but I did not give him the money till November 13. He did not bring the insurance policies and I told him I wanted to insure another girl. He told me he had made a mistake and that the premium was 2s. 6d. for each girl and not 2s. Therefore, I gave him another 3s. 6d. He said he would bring the policies on November 15. On that date he did not bring the policies, but said he would see to it. He came on the Friday, the 17th, and said, "You must not be afraid, you are insured and I will send the policy on to you." I gave him 2s. 6d. for debt collecting expenses on the Thursday. He came again on the Saturday and asked for the loan of my three volumes of "Cassell's Lawyer,"so that he could show them to Dr. Maugh, who lives a few doors away. He never returned them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I gave prisoner 2s. 6d. to collect £4 8s., which a Mme. Elizabeth had owed me for two or three days. The reason was that he told me she was a bad payer. She usually paid on delivery and there had been some trouble with the alterations. I asked prisoner to try and make her pay and she came and paid on the Friday afternoon. He had told me when I first gave him 1s. that his charge for debt collecting was 6d. in the pound. The second time on which he spoke to me I did not tell him that I would not bother about insuring the girls and that he was to use the money for the purpose of collecting debts. After November 18 he did not call on me and, therefore, I did not refuse to see him.</p>

                  </hi>, trading as Mme. Casanbon, dressmaker, 100, New Bond Street. Prisoner came to me on December 13 and told me he represented an association for collecting debts and that the subscrip<lb/>tion was 26s. a year. I said I already paid a guinea a year to the Trade Protection Society and he said that if I paid 5s., the difference between a guinea and 26s., I could belong to his association.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140059"/>
               <p>I gave him 5s. and he gave me this receipt: "105, Lorrimore Road, Kennington, December 13, received from Mme. Casanbon 5s. re legal aid." On December 16 I gave him the name of Mrs. de Haviland, Guernsey, who owed me 16 guineas, and he told me that all there was to do was to summon her. I gave him £1 for the summons. The next day I gave him the names of Miss Dunn and Mrs. Thew. He came back on the 19th and said he had traced Miss Dunn and the only thing to do was to send her a summons. On that day I mentioned a Mrs. Corlton Smith and he said he would send her a summons as well and he wanted 30s. for the two. I gave him the money. He never asked me for any money for expenses. On December 30 he told me he had found Mrs. Thew and asked me for 15s. with which to summon her and I gave it to him. He said he had taken out sum<lb/>monses and sent them to the others and we should have to wait till the Court day. Later I wrote to him and got no reply and then I sent an assistant. Prisoner came and saw me on January 18 and said he could not get on any quicker and I must wait till the case came before the Court. I was suspicious and I asked him to write down his charges, which he did as follows: "5 percent, money recovered, 5s. expenses, H. Lamb, 159, Newington Butts, and 145, Lorrimore Road, S.E." I think he said the name of his association was the Legal Aid Society.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. When prisoner came to me he mentioned the name of Mme. Orf and when I inquired she said she was satisfied with the first case prisoner had dealt with for her. The money I gave him was not for expenses to trace these debtors, but for sum<lb/>monses. He never asked me for money for anything else but that.</p>

He was to have 5 per cent., but when he had collected the debt he wanted 10 percent, and eventu<lb/>ally I gave him about 7 per cent.

It was arranged that I should have the three volumes of that book and my debts collected for 6s. 6d. a quarter. He came a week later, and I gave him 6s. 6d. I did not get the book. He gave me this receipt: "145, Lorrimore Road, January 5, received from Mrs. Thompson, 6s. 6d., quarter's payment, Legal Aid Society, debts collected." Miss Bateman owed me over £8, and I gave him her name and address. I gave him her account (produced) for £8 7s., but I did not write on it "Solicitors' expenses, 10s. 6d." Two or three days later he told me he thought Miss Bateman's money would be all right, but that another lady I had mentioned (Mrs. Matthews) would have to be sum<lb/>moned. He came a third time, and said he would have to take a summons out against Miss Bateman. He asked me for 5s. for that purpose, and I gave it him. I have not received any money which he got from Miss Bateman. He did not tell me he had made an arrange<lb/>ment with Miss Bateman to pay by instalments.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was not arranged that I should have the debt collected instead of the books. I have since learnt that prisoner visited Miss Bateman and she agreed to pay a sum of £1 2s. 6d. every Saturday till the debt was paid, and that she paid him the first instal<lb/>ment.

He asked me for a guinea subscription, but we came to terms, and I paid him 10s. 6d. for six months. I gave him the name of Mme. Statathos, who owed me £20 6s. Two or three days later he told me that from in<lb/>quiries he had made, the only way to make her pay was to summon her. I gave him £1, and asked him if it would be enough, and he said if it was not enough they would trust me for the balance. On the next day or the day after he said £1 was not enough, and that he wanted another 6s., which I gave him. He said he had been to Bloomsbury County Court to take out a summons. I gave him other names. Pri<lb/>soner went away, and I did not see him again. I saw Mme. Statathos, and as a result I wrote prisoner several times, and finally registered a letter, in which I demanded the return of the money, and withdrew all authority to collect debts for me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. All we received as a result of Mme. Statathos being seen was that she handed to me some pawntickets for jewellery, which had been pawned for £38 to £40.

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath): My full name is Walter Herbert Andrew Lamb. I saw Madame Orf about "Cassell's Lawyer" in 1910 and collected two debts for her. That is how I began. When I saw Madame Froissard in December, 1911, she said the books were no good to her, but that she wanted some debts collecting. I then told her I had a small debt society at my house in Lorrimore Road and at my brother-in-law's place in Newington Butts. I referred her to Madame Orf and she took up that reference. I was not holding myself out to be a large society. I might have said I was trying to work up a business. There are many one-man businesses of this character in London with a nice high-sounding name. Madame Orf paid me 5s. as a kind of retaining fee and expenses. The next time I saw her she asked me to collect £16 16s. from a lady living some<lb/>where in Guernsey named Mrs. de Haviland, and I said I would endeavour to find out where she was living. The word "summons" was mentioned only in this way, that after the debtor had been traced it might be necessary to summon her. She gave me £1 either then or a day or two afterwards, and I told her it was going to be a very troublesome matter. On another occasion Madame Froissard gave me the names of Miss Dunn, Mrs. Thew, and Colonel or Mrs. Smith. After spending the best part of a day I found that Colonel Smith's address was at the Cavalry Club, Piccadilly, and I reported what I had discovered. Then I failed to discover Mrs. Thew, and I told Madame Froissard I was not going to walk about London all day without expenses. She paid me a small amount for expenses in that case. Dunn was said to live at Brighton, and for that case and Smith's I received 30s., and for Thew's case 15s. It is a deliberate lie to say I obtained this money by false pretences. Through Madame Froissard's introduction I went to Mr. Dubrill and he gave me 10s. 6d. and the name of Madame Statathos. I spent two days on that case. I did not receive £1 from Mr. Dubrill for pretending I wanted to take out a summons. That 26s. was paid me for three other cases, a Duchess in Piccadilly, a Miss Moore (her daughter), and a Miss Ashton. The Duchess was not amenable, but the daughter did pay £1. Miss Ashton refused to see me, but I believe that through my persistent work he has had a settlement there. I did all I could. I received only 10s. 6d. and 26s., and did not receive any commission on the jewellery got from Madame Statathos or the £1 paid by Miss Moore. With regard to Madame Orf, I had great difficulty in tracing Mrs. Carlyle Carr. There was nothing to be got out of her. Mrs. Thompson paid me a retaining fee of 6s. 6d., and I called on Miss Bateman about six times. I wrote "Solicitor's expenses, 10s. 6d.," on the bill in order to try and get the costs out of her and because she had given me so much trouble. Miss Bateman agreed to pay me £1 2s. 6d. a week off the debt, plus 15s. expenses, and my employer would have seen that I had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140063"/>
               <p>got those expenses. I received the first instalment on a Saturday and I was arrested the following Wednesday. It is the custom for a debt collector in most cases to have a monthly or quarterly account. I intended to pay; I have paid Madame Orf and others. I did not get 5s. from Mrs. Thompson because I was going to take out a sum<lb/>mons; she told me on no account to sue as her mother, whose busi<lb/>ess it was, had told her not to give credit. On October 17, 1911, I took an order from Mrs. Marquard for "Cassel's Lawyer" and we got in conversation about debt collecting. She asked me to collect Mrs. Cox's debt, but I could not trace her. I saw Madame Elizabeth with regard to her debt, but she afterwards sent on a cheque to my client. When I ascertained this I went to Madame Marquard, and she refused to see me. Up to that time I had had 12s. 6d. from her. On November 18 I borrowed three volumes of "Cassell's Lawyer" from her because I had prospective customers near there. It was absurd to say I mentioned the name of Dr. Maugh, because he had had the books. I made no attempt to dispose of the books and pro<lb/>uced them at the police court. As to my use of the word "Solicitor." one has to bluff sometimes in this business. I may have said, "I come from a firm of solicitors."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did say that I had a small debt-collecting society. I should say I was the Legal Aid Society. With regard to the insurance of the work girls, it is not true that I said on more than one occasion I would send the policy on. I seriously state that the lady told me to keep the money and never mind about the insurance. I may have put down two addresses on the receipts I gave in order to make them believe it was a bigger business. In the case of Mrs. De Haviland, of Guernsey, I agree that I got £1 from Madame Froissard and that in that particular case little else was done but write to Guernsey. I might have said it may be necessary to take out a summons in the future.</p>

                  </hi> (through an interpreter). I live at 70, Newport Dwellings, Soho, and am a bookseller. I am an Italian, and have been trading in England about 10 years. Have known prisoner about 30 years, and have seen him many times since I have been in England. About April 23 somebody handed me circular (produced) in Church Street, Soho, and I saw other people with copies in their hands. The same evening I received another copy by post.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am not a publisher. I was a personal friend of prisoner up to about six months ago, when the Italian-Turkish War started. I have sold a lot of books, some very ancient ones. I produce list of some of the firms in London from whom I bought books. I paid in cash, and all the receipts I have I produce. It is not true that the documents I have produced only show dealings amounting to £10 or £12 since I have been in England. I also bought books from firms in Italy and sold them here. I do not keep books of account as I pay in cash. I have no invoices or documents to show that I have sold any books, but I have sold many to various ladies and gentlemen. I make a profit of £250 to £300 a year. I have no banking account. I have no plate on my door showing I am a book-seller. I have two rooms and a kitchen at my flat, and live there with my wife and six children, and carry on my business from there. I sell my books outside. I keep all my books in my flat. I have at present 700 or 800 francs worth. I may not have a large number of books as perhaps only one is a very valuable book. I have had several very valuable books which I have sold, one I bought in Farringdon Street for a few shillings, and sold to Professor Pascal in Italy for 700 or 800 francs. That was about three years ago. I pay 9s. 6d. a week for my flat. Anita Pizza lives with us; she is a friend, not a servant. I did profess anarchy at one time, but after I saw that anarchist ideas were not fit for myself or others I gave up anarchy. That is a long time ago, more than eight years ago, and I very seldom went' to any of their meetings. I did go to the International Anarchist Congress at Amsterdam in 1907 with prisoner's brother, who is not an Anarchist, but only as a matter of curiosity, not as a member. I paid my own expenses. I have never been an Italian police spy, and have never received any money from the Minister of the Interior in Italy. I never sent money to the Anarchist Congress, and have only bought their newspapers; 15s. or 20s. is all I have ever paid towards anarchism in my life. I am told defendant is an Anarchist, and he says he is. I do not know whether it is one of the tenets of anarchism that there should be no war between nations. I have never asserted that defendant had sold himself to the Turkish Government as a Turkish spy. I did not write an article in reply to the challenge of de<lb/>fendant, and never gave such a thing to anyone to print for me. I know nothing about a proof or proofs of document (produced) to me. It may be that defendant and I have fallen out in consequence of the war, but my wife broke the friendship off at the time of the Hounds-ditch affair because the police were calling at my house asking me if I knew persons who participated in the murders. It may be that some</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140065"/>
               <p>of my friends in the Italian colony have broken their friendship with me or shunned me since this libel charging me with being an Italian police spy, but never before. I take defendant's circular to be an act of vengeance because I put him out of my house. I have never made the statement that he was a Turkish spy. I turned him out of my house six months ago because he said that whoever killed an Italian was his friend, and my wife would have given him some kicks if he had not gone. I did not know that the point was going to be raised that I was not a genuine bookseller. I was told two days ago to bring any receipts and vouchers, but I have not had time to look for all the papers.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I am agent for five or six foreign firms. I have always got an honest living by the sale of books.</p>

                  </hi>, 70, Newport Dwellings. I have seen the circular produced, and once showed it to defendant about a week before the police court proceedings. He told me that he had published it, and that he had also said it before 200 people.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I take Signor Belili's children to and from school. I am not paid; I am just as a daughter in the family. Signor Belili does work as a bookseller. He has about 400 or 500 books now, I do not know how many he sells; it is not my business, but I should think 10 or 12 a month. He is also the representative of bookselling firms. Sometimes he makes as much as £1 a day, at other times less. We live very modestly. Before the war defendant used to visit Signor Belili. He also gave lessons in arithmetic to his daughter. I have never heard Signor Belili accuse defendant of being a Turkish spy, rather that he could not have acted as a spy, because his behaviour was not that of a spy. I have never heard of Signor Belili receiving a remittance from the Minister of the Interior of Italy. I do not know whether he has ever been an Anarchist.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I am an electrical engineer, carrying on business as E. Malatesta and Co., 13, Windmill Street, Tottenham Court Road. I am an Italian subject. I have been in England for the last 12 years. I go up and down from Italy to Eng<lb/>land. I am not a professed Anarchist, but I believe in liberty and justice for everybody. It is 12 years ago since I came to settle in England. When I came to England the last time I had four years' deportation to the island where I was. The police have a right to deport. I was obliged for four years to live on one of those small islands in the Mediterranean. I escaped and went from Malta to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140066"/>
               <p>England. I first met prosecutor in London 10 years ago. He was an Anarchist and went to Anarchist meetings. He was a frequent visitor to these meetings. One of its tenets is hatred of war between nations. Belili posed as a bookseller. I published this circular. As far as I know Belili is certainly not carrying on a legitimate business as a bookseller. I have said that I believed him to be a spy and he has said that I have sold myself to the police. Bellili has told me nothing. When he says he is not an Anarchist it is a lie. He did not turn me out of his house. His wife insulted me and I went out. He then tried to put himself on good terms with me, but I refused. Belili has never called me a Turkish spy, but has said so to other people. He has no business at all. He lives in three small rooms with his wife and six children. I have been there many times, because I used to give his children arithmetic lessons. One of the rooms is used as a kitchen. He has only a few books for private use. I have never seen a new book to be sold. Twelve years ago he used to sell some books. 1 purchased a few from him. I have ordered books from him, but could not get them. Ten years ago I saw him supply books; not the last five or six years. He has only private books in his house—some 100—what anybody would have. Bellili and I have lad a controversy over the Turco-Italian war. He was a partisan of the war. It became a little violent, because he called himself an Anarchist, being in favour of the war. I was sure he was not an Anarchist. He never told me he was in the pay of Turkey. In my opinion this document has a very great interest in London for political refugees. Bellili attended a conference of Anarchists and posed as an Anarchist.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. When I published the circular I said that many people might think Bellili was an Italian police spy. When I say that he is not doing an honest trade as a bookseller I mean to imply that he is getting his money as an Italian police spy. When I say he is a liar, I mean it. When I said I could show how I get every 6d. of my income I meant I was getting my living honestly. I challenged Bellili to do the same. I have been sentenced in Italy, but always for political offences—never to 30 years' imprisonment or anything of the kind. I did not go to Bellili's house on purpose to say that I disagreed with the Italians over the war. I did not say I was against all the Italians—I am an Italian myself. Bellili said at the Italian Colony that I wished all the Italians would get killed—or something of the kind—to influence the Italian Colony; but he has failed. Mrs. Bellili told me that she had a brother, who was a lieutenant in the Italian Army. I used no violent language, but Bellili was not ashamed to put his wife in the question. I do not like to quarrel with ladies. I did not say that everybody who murdered an Italian was a friend of mine, or that they should be crucified. I was a frequent visitor at Bellili's house until his wife insulted me and then I went away. Afterwards I met Bellili at a shop kept by a friend of mine. I have seen Bellili on several occasions, but have had no conversation with him. It was in April I issued the circular and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140067"/>
               <p>had it printed. It was printed in Paris. I had about 500 copies distributed.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I never said that Bellili was an Italian spy until I proved that he was.</p>

I have known Bellili for about 20 years. I met him in Dean Street, Soho on April 24. I gave him a copy of Malatesta's circular. He said, "Call at my place to-morrow morn<lb/>ing and I will give you a copy of my reply to print. He said he wanted to call a jury of honour, three or four of his friends and three or four of theirs to decide whether he was wrong or whether Malatesta was wrong. I saw him again on April 25 and he gave me a copy reply to Malatesta and asked me how much I would charge for print<lb/>ing 1,000 and 1 said 15s. Bellili did not say that he was a police spy. He said he was going to reply to the circular. I am not friends with Bellili over this. I have never seen him sell books to anyone; I have seen some books.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Two days after I gave Malatesta's circular to Bellili he handed me the manuscript of his circular, which was type<lb/>written. I do a cash business and do not keep books. I printed three proofs and gave one to Malatesta.</p>

                  </persName>. Prisoner has been known to the police as an Anarchist of a very dangerous type for a great number of years. He has been imprisoned in his own country and has been expelled from France. He has visited Egypt, Spain, France, Portugal, and, I believe, America, in the interests of Anarchy, and wherever he went there was a great deal of trouble. He is known as the leader of militant Anarchists in this country—in fact, in the world. Many of his former colleagues have passed through this court and had penal servitude for coining. Gardstein, one of the Houndsditch assassins (see Vol. CLV., page 79), had been using prisoner's workshop, or working with him for 12 months. A tube of oxygen that was used on that occasion was traced to prisoner, who stated that he had sold it to Gardstein. That is all that was known. He has never been in the hands of the police in this country, but on one occasion was fined for assaulting a school teacher who chastised his son at school. Bellili is also known in the Anarchist movement. He has been expelled from Belgium, but has never been in the hands of the police in this country.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. With regard to the coiners with whom prisoner associated, I make no suggestion except that they were associated in Anarchy. Prisoner had a workshop and has still. He does electrical engineering to a certain extent, I believe. I do not agree with what Prince Kropotkin says in his book in praise of prisoner. As to pri<lb/>soner being a Count of Italy, I have heard several things like that, but never took much notice of it. I do not know that he has renounced all his property in Italy for the purpose of his propaganda. I do not know much in his favour. He gave evidence for the prosecution in the Houndsditch case; he was brought there.</p>

                  </hi>. I was leading fireman on the steamship Highland Corrie, on a voyage from Buenos Aires to London. On April 14 at one o'clock in the morning I was on duty and ordered prisoner to get on with his work. He was grumbling all the time. He dropped his rake at the door and made for me. I grappled with him and we had a bit of a tussle, and the next I knew was that I had a lump taken off my jaw. Dr. Gray dressed the wound. At 3.55 I was going down to the engine room to report to the second engineer. I met the pri<lb/>soner, who said I had hit him on the head with a file. That was untrue. Prisoner had a razor in his hand. I closed with him and he slashed at me, cutting my chest, arm, and thigh. I was placed in the ship's hospital, where I remained till her arrival in port. I was then removed on an ambulance to the Seamen's Hospital, being detained there for eight days. I have been unable to work since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I may have called him "a black son of a bitch" and said "I'll brain you. I deny calling him a "dirty, rotten black bastard."</p>
               <p>Re-examined. It was after he had bitten me that I said "I'll brain you."</p>

               <p>the quarrel. I was raking my fires when he commenced to grumble and called me a" black bastard. "He said, "If you don't go ahead, I'll knock you down." I said, "Look here, you make a mistake; you might catch a fox." He hit me in the eyes with his right hand. Then I held him and bit his face, because I could not hit him quick enough. At three o'clock he passed me and called me a "black bastard." He attacked me again and I injured him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prosecutor attacked me with a file which I threw into the sea. I got the razor because I expected trouble, as he had threatened me twice in two hours.</p>

                  </persName>, Special Branch, New Scot<lb/>land Yard. I was present at a meeting of the Women's Social and Political Union at Steinway Hall on October 26. Among the speakers were Miss Christabel Pankhurst and Miss Evelyn Sharp. I took long<lb/>hand notes of the speeches and on the same night made up, from my recollection assisted by the rough notes, a report of the speeches. One extract from Miss Christabel's speech is as follows: "The answer Mr. Lloyd George gave to the deputation of the Men's League was quite easy to understand. Mr. Lloyd George wanted to make the Concilia<lb/>tion Bill so expansive that many who now supported it would drop it."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by F.W.P. Lawrence. I have very little recol<lb/>lection of the meeting beyond my note. I understood Miss Pankhurst to say that "militancy" was not going on at that time, but she said, "If Mr. Lloyd George forced his wrecking amendment militancy would be again started." She explained that Mr. Lloyd George intended to alter the whole character of the Conciliation Bill when it went into Committee and that he proposed to move an amendment to make the Bill a very wide one, enfranchising seven million women. It was because she thought Mr. Lloyd George's proposal would make it an unworkable Bill and that it was not in her opinion likely to get through the House of Commons that she was watching Mr. Lloyd George's action; and so long as he refrained from taking steps which she considered would wreck or injure the chances of the Bill she would advise the members of the Union to remain peaceful—in other words, there would be no militancy if what she regarded as fair political tactics were continued.</p>

Miss Pankhurst made a very ardent appeal to those present to join in a deputation to the Prime. Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140073"/>
               <p>on November 21. The report of this meeting in "Votes for Women" of November 17, 1911, was correct, though greatly abbreviated.</p>
               <p>To F.W.P. Lawrence. In my opinion the principal part of Miss Pankhurst's speech was her appeal for volunteers; I mean the principal part from my notion of its legal effect. One great point she made was that up to the previous Tuesday the women had relied upon the promise of members of the Cabinet that full opportunity would be given in the House of Commons for the discussion of the Conciliation Bill; that on the Tuesday the Prime Minister had put forward a proposal to enfranchise the whole manhood of the country, a proposal which rendered a non-party solution of the Woman Suffrage question impossible; in other words, that the Conciliation Bill had been ruined by the Prime Minister's action In "Votes for Women" of November 17 is an article headed, "The only terms of Peace"; this is an extract: "This decision to establish Manhood Suffrage, a decision due in no small measure, so we understand, to the inspira<lb/>tion of Mr. Lloyd George, finally disposes of the hope of carrying Woman Suffrage as a non-party measure. The introduction of a Bill abolishing all franchise restrictions means that the question of Woman Suffrage now becomes entangled with that of Universal Suffrage. As a result those who believe that franchise restrictions should be main<lb/>tained are alienated from the women's cause, while those who support Manhood Suffrage only are not won over to it. The agreement brought about by the Conciliation Committee, and afterwards rudely shaken by Lloyd George, is now put to death by the Government's threat of Manhood Suffrage. Are we not justified in saying that 'an enemy hath done this thing'? The Government, to state the matter in the most charitable terms, have made Woman Suffrage a party question. Therefore they are in honour bound now to make it a party measure. We demand that they shall do this. So long at there was a prospect of success for the Conciliation Bill, and so long as the effect of that measure would have been to give women virtual equality with men and a guarantee of equality under future franchise laws, the Women's Social and Political Union observed a truce with the Government. But now that the Government have destroyed these two conditions, the truce can be observed no longer, unless they consent to give certain reasonable undertakings. These undertakings, these terms of peace, are as follows: That the Government abandon the Manhood Suffrage Bill and introduce in its stead a measure giving precisely equal franchise rights to men and women. That the measure be car<lb/>ried through next Session, in order that the protection of the Parlia<lb/>ment Act shall be secured. That the Government stake their existence upon the Bill as a whole, and undertake to stand or fall as much by the provisions for Votes for Women as by the provision for Votes for Men. We cannot with safety, we dare not, accept any pledge less full and less explicit than this." (Other extracts from "Votes for Women" were read.) It appears from this paper of November 17 that about 60 meetings were being arranged by the W.S.P.U. in that week in London and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140074"/>
               <p>40 or 50 in the provinces, making a total of something like 100 meet<lb/>ings held in a particular week throughout the country, presumably of an educational kind, on the votes for women question.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. In the same paper there is a paragraph headed,"Be prepared for action." Also a paragraph, "A Call to Arms! On Tuesday next, at 7.30p.m., the Caxton Hall will be crowded with women who will assemble for the purpose of resolving upon such action—whether militant or otherwise—as the Prime Minister's statement may render necessary." Following that in big type was an intimation that it was most important that those who wished to participate should write with<lb/>out delay to the headquarters of the W.S.P.U.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by E. Pankhurst. This meeting was a very large one; about 9,000 people attended, every seat being paid for; the audience consisted of very well-to-do ladies and gentlemen; they were very enthusiastic, and there was only one dissentient to the resolution at the finish.</p>

               <p>Mr. Healy submitted that this evidence was not admissible. The prosecu<lb/>tion could not present evidence of individual acts before they had proved con<lb/>spiracy linking those acts with these defendants.</p>
               <p>Mr. Graham-Campbell said the' conspiracy charged was between these defen<lb/>dants and certain other persons, amongst whom was Sarah Bennett. In Arch<lb/>bold, 24th Edition, p. 1423, several cases were cited for the proposition that "The prosecutor may go into general evidence of the nature of the con<lb/>spiracy, before he gives evidence to connect the defendant with it."</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Coleridge held that, in the speeches so far proved, there was no direct evidence that any of the defendants had incited Sarah Bennett.</p>

                  </hi>, manager St. Clement's Press, Portugal Street, W.C. My firm has printed "Votes for Women" by contract with Mr. Pethick Lawrence. He paid for the work by cheque. About 30,000 copies were printed weekly and were delivered at the offices of the Women's Social and Political Union, 4, Clement's Inn. I do not know Mrs. Pethick Lawrence. Beneath the title of the paper was printed the information that it was edited by "Frederick and Emme<lb/>line Pethick Lawrence." I recollect that on March 4 last a proof reader called my attention to a certain article. Upon that I wrote to the prisoner, F.W.P. Lawrence.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140075"/>
               <p>Mr. Healy objected to the reading of this letter. Witness had not yet stated that he printed the paper by the authority of Mrs. Pethick Lawrence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Coleridge said that the letter was evidence against F.W.P. Lawrence, but at present it would not be evidence against E. P. Lawrence.</p>
               <p>The letter was then read. In it witness objected to print certain matter. Witness continued: The number was issued with several blanks. In December, 1911, I printed 20,000 copies of an article, and in March last the matter was re-set as a circular. I saw the proof and objected to print it. The matter I declined to print appears in "Votes for Women" of December 1, 1911, under the heading, "Broken Windows." Exhibit 39 is a proof of an article set up by us for the March number, and which we declined to print, with the result that the space for the article was left blank in the paper.</p>
               <p>To F.W.P. Lawrence. I am not prepared to say that all cheques in payment of our accounts bore your signature. After "copy" is set up a proof is sent. The proof is corrected and in many cases the matter is substantially altered. In some cases the matter is still further altered on a revised proof, so that only a final proof can he said to represent the considered opinions of the writer. The leaflet headed "Broken Windows" was first published as an article in "Votes for Women" of December 1, and subsequently as a leaflet in December. I refused to re-publish the same article in March because, in conse<lb/>quence of what had happened one of my directors came to see me, and after a consultation we decided not to print it.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Healy. I also declined to print the following: "I lay down this proposition—democracy has never been a menace to property. I will tell you what has been a menace to property. When power was withheld, from the democracy, when they had no voice in the Govern<lb/>ment, when they were oppressed, and when they had no means of securing redress except by violence—then property has many times been swept away.—(Mr. Lloyd George at Bath, November 24)."</p>
               <p>Re-examined. In the number of December there is also printed: "The Next Protest.—Names of volunteers for active service continue to come in; they include those of many who took part in the demon<lb/>stration of Tuesday, November 21, while others are of women who have not yet taken militant action. The following are typical letters: 'As I was discharged at Bow, Street last Thursday, I am ready for the next. Please enter my name upon the militant list, for I have not "learnt better," as Mr. Muskett advised me! You may count on me till the crack of doom! If it is a mere question of the more the merrier I don't think I could stay away. In the future, when we have reached our goal, I can imagine what a mean cur I should feel at having watched other people doing the dirty work without having raised a finger to help.' Names should be sent to Miss Christabel Pankhurst, 4, Clement's Inn, W.C."</p>

                  </hi>, manager, Temple Bar Branch of Barclay's Bank. The Women's Social and Political Union has had an account at my bank for many years past. The account was operated upon by four signatures, F.W.P. Lawrence, E.P. Lawrence, Mrs. Mabel Tuke, and Miss Christabel Pankhurst; one of any two signatures must be that of E.P. Lawrence or F.W.P. Lawrence. On July 1, 1911, the account showed a credit balance of £9,306, on December 31 the balance was £10,628, on March 1, 1912, £7,362. On March 6 there is a debit entry of £7,000, by a cheque dated March 1, payable to Mrs. Ayrton, signed by E.P. Lawrence and C.H. Pankhurst. ("Witness was taken through a number of entries, showing that pay<lb/>ments were made for the hiring of halls and the printing of "Votes for Women," with some payments to the "Women's Press.") F.W.P. Lawrence had also a personal account with us. One of the cheques upon that account is dated February 29, 1912, for £1,000, payable to Mrs. Beatrice Sanders, who is, I believe, one of the officials con<lb/>nected with the Union.</p>
               <p>To E. Pankhurst. We have no accounts with the local unions; all that passes through our hands is exclusively the money of the National Union. I should describe the account as an active one; it has been a growing account; since it started, I dare say about £100,000 has passed through the account. I cannot say whether the amounts paid in and out in respect of meetings show a profit upon that part of the work. I should agree that this organisation is one which is increas<lb/>ing in popularity and strength, so far as finance can give evidence.</p>

About 180 were brought in, and 175 were bailed out. Fifty of the women gave their addresses as 4, Clement's Inn. F.W.P.

I heard the under<lb/>taking given. He had a list of the names, and his signature appears in the bailing-out book (produced) 175 times as being surety for that number of women. (Witness gave the names of some of the women who were bailed out.) I was again on duty at Cannon Bow on March 1, when 10 women were charged. F.W.P. Lawrence did not become bail on that day for anybody. I was also on duty on March 4, when about 50 women were charged, and I attended to the bailing-out of 47 of them. Some of them gave the Clement's Inn address. About 11 o'clock Mr. and Mrs. Pethick Lawrence came to the station. F.W. P. Lawrence again gave an undertaking that the women would not offend until they had been before the police court the following morn<lb/>ing. The women gave the promise to him collectively.

                  </persName>, New Scotland Yard, produced a file of "Votes for Women" from November, 1911, to March, 1912, and a number of extracts were read upon which the prosecution relied. These included a report of a speech by E. Pankhurst at the Savoy Theatre on February 15, in which she said that, "Great as had been the need on previous occasions, the need now was greater still. No matter how obscure any woman thought herself she could rise to the level of the highest. The people of China won freedom at the price of blood, but the women of England would win freedom only at the price of a few panes of glass. I have come to the conclusion,' said Mrs. Pankhurst, 'that if I had broken a pane of glass with other women when younger than my daughter, women would have had the vote long ago. Since we cannot get our freedom by women's ways, then I am going out to throw my stone with the rest of you." (E. Pankhurst asked that the whole of her speech should be read. This was done.) A further extract was, "She would only refer to the political situation to say that the proposal, as the Union understood it,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140078"/>
               <p>was that Mr. Asquith meant to introduce a Bill to extend the franchise to men to the exclusion of women. This treatment after fifty years of constitutional agitation and six years of a passionate agitation of an un<lb/>constitutional kind, showed the status of woman in this country, and there was no excuse for those who had not revolted at the injustice of these proposals." In an article in the same number occurred the passage, "In the later stages of the militant campaign some members of the public have found that they do not altogether escape the uncom<lb/>fortable consequences of the warfare between women and the Govern<lb/>ment. When this happens on a sufficiently extended scale, and the public at large feel that they are directly concerned to secure the capitulation of the Government and the concession of women's claim to the vote, then victory will be ours. We also shall secure an Act of Parliament for the abolition of our grievances. The position has got to be carried by storm. The militant woman must create a crisis—a difficulty from which all concerned are eager to escape. Then, and then only, will women become politically free. "This issue also con<lb/>tained the invitation to men and women to go to Parliament Square for the March 4 demonstration, but there was no reference to anything that was going to happen on March 1.</p>
               <p>To F.W.P. Lawrence. In each issue of the paper there are about two pages devoted to what is called "The Campaign Throughout the Country "-in London and in the provinces; roughly, fifty or sixty meetings were being held in London and the same number in the pro<lb/>vinces each week, that is over a hundred meetings of the Women's Social and Political Union each week. There is in each issue from half to a whole column of names of contributors to what was called he £250,000 Fund, and there are special paragraphs relating to pro<lb/>tests from time to time; these did not form a large feature of the paper. (Witness, at the request of F.W.P. Lawrence, read a number of extracts from "Votes for Women"—reproducing, under the heading of "The record of postponement and evasion," letters and, speeches by Mr. Gladstone, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, Mr. Asquith, Mr. Lloyd George, and others.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Coleridge, interposing while F.W.P. Lawrence was continuing the reading of these extracts, reminded prisoner that the allegation of the prosecution was that he and his co-defendants entered into a conspiracy to incite certain persons to commit breaches of the law. Anything that had any bearing on that issue the Court would listen to at any length, but how the mis-deeds of the Govern<lb/>ment, if they were mis-deeds, or the changes of policy of this or that Minister could have any bearing on the issue now being tried it was difficult to see. What Mr. Lloyd George or Mr. Asquith had said or done had no bearing on the case, unless it had some bearing on whether these accused persons incited any persons to conspiracy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Healy submitted that, the file having been put in, it was open to the defendants to read anything from the papers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Coleridge said he did not exclude anything. Mr. Healy. It is part of the defence that these, occurrences arose not because of the incitements in these papers but because of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140079"/>
               <p>breaches of faith of the Ministers who are attacked in these columns, We say, and we are entitled to say, that what gave rise to these mani<lb/>festations is not the result of the action of the prisoners primarily, but is due to the antecedent breach of faith from which the general body of those who claim the vote suffer, be that view right or be it wrong.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Coleridge. I follow that, but what we have got to decide now is whether the accused had any part or not in the incite<lb/>ment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Healy. According to our contention, the real criminals, if criminals there be, are not the persons in the dock. The persons who caused these demonstrations are the persons who are guilty of this breach of faith—the Ministers of the Crown.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Coleridge. We may all assume that the few persons who acted in the manner described had, or thought they had, a grievance. The question is whether these quotations are relevant as to these persons having, or having not, incited others to commit breaches of the law. Accusations against this or that Minister do not seem to me to have any bearing on the issue. The file of the paper is in evidence; in addressing the jury the defendants can read any portions they please.</p>
               <p>F.W.P. Lawrence said he would be strictly reasonable, and only read what was absolutely material. He proceeded to read a number of further extracts, the principal of which was from an article by Mrs. E.P. Lawrence in the number of February 23, entitled, "Inciting to violence"—"In the Colston Hall, in Bristol, the Right Hon. C.E.H. Hobhouse, at an Anti-Suffrage meeting, said (vide report in the Press) 'that in the case of the suffrage demand there had not been the kind of popular sentimental uprising which accounted for Nottingham Castle in 1832 or the Hyde Park railings in 1867. There had been no great ebullition of popular feeling.' We have often said that members of the Government do not understand the language of reason or of argument, nor the appeal to justice, and that the only argument that carries any weight with them is the argument of militancy. Mr. Hobhouse on Friday last bore irrefutable evidence to the truth of that statement. He altogether ignored the constitutional agitation for Woman Suffrage, which is the greatest agitation which has ever been carried out in this country for franchise reform... We challenge any student of political history to furnish us with facts showing that franchise agitations in the past were carried out on a constitutional scale comparable to the Woman Suffrage agitation in this country during the past six years. The only way in which the Woman's Suffrage agitation was outdone by the franchise movements of men in the past was in violence and destruction of property and of human life. It is this fact which, the Right Hon. C.E.H. Hobhouse selects with which to taunt the Woman Suffrage Movement with futility and failure. It is well that women should take this lesson to heart, and that they should go back to the history of the agitation in 1832 in order to glean from it reasons for the conduct of their own campaign. By holding up to women the example of men in 1832 and in 1867, when the Hyde Park</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140080"/>
               <p>railings were pulled down, Mr. Hobhouse takes the very grave respon<lb/>sibility of inciting them to serious forms of violence, in comparison with which Mrs. Pankhurst's exhortation is mildness itself. It is undeniably true that the history of the Women's Movement shows nothing in any way comparable with the violence and destruction wrought in Nottingham and Bristol. Neither do we believe that it will ever be necessary for women to resort to these extreme measures Women to-day are less emotional, less hysterical, and more politically minded than were the men of the country in 1832. They are prepared to go just as far in their demonstrations of public uprising as is neces<lb/>sary in order to convey the fact that they are determined to win their freedom and no further. They make up in individual self-sacrifice, and in readiness to accept the consequences of their action, what is lacking in destructive violence."</p>
               <p>To Mr. Healy. I selected these passages as, in my opinion, inciting to violence, and as being calls by the leaders to take part in the de<lb/>monstrations.</p>
               <p>Mr. Healy put to the witness the following passage: "The days are past for rioting, and we do not need to have recourse to bloodshed or violence to carry on our schemes of progress and reform, because we have a fairly good franchise, which is an assurance that the will of the people, in these democratic days, must prevail. Formerly, when the great mass of the people were voteless, they had to do something violent in order to show what they felt; to-day the elector's bullet is his ballot. Let no one be deceived, therefore, because in the present struggle everything is peaceful and orderly, in contrast to the disorder<lb/>liness of other great struggles in the past," and asked whether that was an incitement to violence. Witness declined to express an opinion. (The extract is from a speech by Sir Rufus Isaacs.)</p>

Chief-inspector John McCarthy, Special Branch, New Scotland Yard. On March 5, about 9.30 p.m., I went to 3 and 4, Clement's Inn with other officers and arrested F.W.P. Lawrence and E.P.

Lawrence asked, "Have you a search warrant?"; I told him that the warrant I had was sufficient; he formally pro<lb/>tested. Christabel Pankhurst is named in the warrant; we have made diligent search for her but have been unable to find any trace of her. Witness produced a great mass of documents found on the premises.

Then we shall go into prison, and leave the others to join us, one by one, after they have done their bit. We mean to be militant throughout this session; there shall be no peace for us or anyone until this matter is settled. Some people tell us that we ought to have chosen a different moment for the protest because the coal strike is in progress. The miners are fighting for something that is important, no doubt. They are fighting for bread and butter. Votes for Women means bread and butter too. But it means something infinitely more. I dare say it is an embarrassment to the Government that the miners and the suffragettes should be fighting at one and the same time, but if either of these fighting armies is to give way to the other, we say let the miners wait until Votes for Women is settled, for we shall wait for nobody."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">F.W.P. LAWRENCE</hi>, cross-examining, put to witness the following passage: "Parliament has never been hearty for reform or for any good measure. It hated the Reform Bill of 1831-1832. It does not like the Franchise Bill now upon the table. What should be done, and what must be done, in these circumstances? You know what your fathers did 34 years ago, and you know the result. Men who in every speech they made insulted the working men, describing them as a multitude given over to vice, will be the first to yield when the popular will is loudly and resolutely expressed. If Parliament Square, from Charing Cross to the venerable Abbey, were filled with men seeking the Reform Bill, these slanderers of their countrymen would learn to be civil, if they did not learn to love freedom." Witness declined to express an opinion as to whether this would be evidence of inciting people to take illegal action. (The extract is from a speech of John Bright in 1866.)</p>
               <p>To Mr. Healy. Mrs. Pankhurst has already served a term of imprisonment for her own action on March 4; Mrs. Lawrence has also been in prison for an offence in November. The number of women who have been imprisoned in connection with this movement would run to several hundreds.</p>

                  </persName>, Criminal Investigation Department. I was present at the Savoy Theatre at a meeting of the Union on November 23, and took notes of the speeches in longhand on the margin of a copy of "Votes for Women" which I bought in the theatre. I made my report, based on these notes, next morning. The speakers were Miss Christabel Pankhurst (presiding), Mr. Pethick</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140082"/>
               <p>Lawrence, Mrs. Cameron Swan, and Miss Evelyn Sharp. My report was made from my notes and with additions. The facts were fresh in my memory when I made it, and it is an accurate note.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Coleridge. You cannot rely upon the witness's recol<lb/>lection for verbal accuracy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Graham-Campbell submitted that "the witness will be allowed to refresh his memory from any book or paper made by himself or seen and examined by him shortly after the fact occurred to which it relates, if he can afterwards swear to the fact from his recollection." (Arch-bold, 24th Ed., p. 487.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Coleridge. One cannot help knowing that a man who is taking longhand notes of a speech which is rapidly delivered is not in the best position to recall what was said that he has not taken down, because his attention has been directed to what he has taken down, and therefore his memory is not so good as that of a man who takes nothing but relies on his memory alone. If you are relying upon verbal accuracy of phrasing and so forth, which I presume you are, then it is merely discretionary on the part of the Court to admit it or not.</p>
               <p>Witness's report of the speeches was then read. Miss Christabel Pankhurst said, "They all felt the deepest gratitude to those magnificent women who had so nobly responded to the call on Tuesday night. Their heroism was all the greater because of the memory they retained of 'Black Friday,' and also because the great bulk of those women took a new departure in militancy which meant still more stringency and more violence from the police.</p>
               <p>The Government did not come to the women with false promises until the women were in a position of power. When asked if he objected to violence. John Bright said, 'Not if it rests on a moral basis,' and, concluded Miss Pankhurst, in words that rang solemnly, with a warning note, 'Let them beware how they incite us to do worse.' " Mr. F.W.P. Lawrence said, "Tuesday's demonstration was a great victory, because it had shown the world that the members of the movement were determined, and was also the triumph of the indomitable spirit of the women themselves. His wife sent this message from Holloway Gaol—Be ready."</p>
               <p>To F.W.P. Lawrence. This was a crowded meeting, and, judging by the size of the collection, and the promises made, the audience was composed of people of position and standing. It was an enthusiastic and approving audience. It has been my duty to attend a good many meetings with a view of ascertaining if anything was said that transcended the proper limits of public speech. (The following passage was put to witness: "Violence is always deplorable, so is loodshed, yet violence and bloodshed in Ulster would be an incom<lb/>parably smaller misfortune than cowardly acquiescence in a revolu<lb/>tion, which, if consummated, would assuredly plunge the whole country into civil war.") I should regard that as a serious state<lb/>ment, and if it had been made at a meeting at which I was instructed to be present I should have noted it down. (The extract is from a recent speech of the Right Hon. F.E. Smith, K.C., M.P.).</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140083"/>
               <p>To E. Pankhurst. I have heard a good many speeches by you and other prominent members of the Union. I may have heard these speakers say that if women had the constitutional means of redressing their grievances that men possess there would be no militancy, no violence. I have heard some of the speakers express concern as to the future and the hope that the Government would take this question seriously and deal with it before the women got out of the hands of their leaders.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Healy. After I had made my report from the notes I took I threw away the newspaper on the margin of which they were written.</p>

I attended a meeting of the Union at the Savoy Theatre on December 23; Miss Christabel Pankhurst was in the chair, and speeches were made by F.W.P. Lawrence. I took a verbatim short<lb/>hand note, and the same night I made, not a transcript, but a con<lb/>densed report—a synopsis. (It appearing that witness had not kept his original shorthand notes, his evidence as to this meeting was not taken.) On February 15 I attended a meeting of the Union at the Savoy Theatre; I have here the original shorthand notes that I took. (Witness's notes of speeches were read.)</p>
               <p>To F.W.P. Lawrence. I was not at a meeting at Croydon re<lb/>cently when a speech was made by the Right Hon. Sir Edward Carson, K.C., M.P., in which he said, "There is a point at which resentment becomes so acute—that we are entitled to adopt any method of preventing liberty of discussion being taken away, and we tell Mr. Asquith that he had better count the cost." I do not know as a fact that men are now being drilled in different parts of Ulster.</p>
               <p>To E. Pankhurst. Before I joined the Force I have, as a newspaper reporter, attended many meetings of the Union. Until recently I do not consider that the speeches have been violent, but it always seemed to me that they hinted at some possibility, some force behind the move<lb/>ment, some hidden weapon. I have heard speakers say that it was necessary to find some way of bringing pressure to bear on those people who had power to give us the vote to women and refused to do so. I have heard you say that men had won their freedom at the price of blood, and that you wished the women would imitate them. I do not recollect hearing you say that you wished to win reform without going to the lengths that men had to.</p>

I saw the two prisoners Lawrence, also Miss Christabel Pankhurst; she left about three in the afternoon with E. P. Lawrence and I think Dr. Ethel Smyth, and they returned about 5.35.</p>
               <p>To E. Pankhurst. I have been to 4, Clement's Inn, before this, but I do not remember the dates. Clement's Inn is a very large place, and there are many tenants besides the union; there are a number of resi<lb/>dential flats; taxis are constantly in and out there every day. On March 4 there were more visitors than on an ordinary day.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Healy. I was first instructed to take notes at Suffragette meetings about two months before November 11; I cannot say whether it was not before a member of the Cabinet had been interrupted at a meeting.</p>

               <p>To F.W.P. Lawrence. The transcripts are correct according to my notes; they are not verbatim. I hold a certificate for writing shorthand at 110 words a minute. I do not agree that what I have put down is a series of extracts joined together by me to make com<lb/>plete sentences; what I have got down are whole continuous sentences. (Witness was taken very closely through a number of speeches, and various instances of omissions and inaccuracies were pointed out to him: he confessed that he did not regard himself as a verbatim short<lb/>hand writer.)</p>
               <p>To E. Pankhurst. I have a knowledge of "familiar quotations"; 1 do not know very well the phrase, "Who would be free himself must strike the blow." (In one speech of Mrs. Pankhurst's, as reported by witness, the words represented to have been used by her were, "Who would be free herself must strike the first blow.")</p>
               <p>Several other witnesses were called to complete the evidence as to damage to windows on November 21 and March 1. One of the women, when charged with malicious damage, said, "I have accepted Mr. Hobhouse's challenge"; another said, "What I did was done on my own entire responsibility"; another, "I am here by my own deliberate act"; another, "This attack was entirely due to the speech of Mr. Hobhouse at Bristol.</p>

I also attended the meeting of the union held in the Pavilion on the afternoon of March 4; the reports of the speeches that have been read are to the best of my memory correct. About 900 attended the meeting at which there was considerable interrupt on. After the meeting I went to the vicinity of the Gardenia restaurant.

               <p>To F.W.P. Lawrence. I am acquainted generally with the his<lb/>tory of the agitation of the W.S.P.U. It has undoubtedly organised many demonstrations of a peaceful and orderly character; its meet<lb/>ings have been well attended, well conducted, and enthusiastic. (Witness was asked whether, if these demonstrations had been made by men, he would not have expected that the reasonable demands of the demonstrators would have been conceded. Mr. Justice Coleridge said that this was matter of argument rather than evidence. The issue was whether these disorders were due to the incitement of the defenders.)</p>

                  </hi>, dressmaker, Tooting. I am a member of the Balham branch of the W.S.P.U. I was one of a deputation to the House of Commons in October, 1910; on that day I got my foot hurt and was taken in a taxi to Caxton Hall. In November, 1911, I received a type<lb/>written message inviting me to go to the Women's Press, in Charing Cross Road. I went into a room upstairs, having given up a card which had been sent to me. In the room were a number of ladies. were two or three ladies. A lady asked me if I had a pocket in my skirt, and I said no. The lady then gave me a bag of stones, which was tied around my waist, under my coat. I said it was too heavy, and some of the stones were taken out. We were told to try to get to the back of the House of Commons and break the windows. With two other young ladies, similarly equipped, I went to the House of Commons. I remained walking about there from 8 to 9. There were a lot of policemen about. I went home without having used the stones, but I kept these in a bag. In February this year (having in the meantime served a term of imprisonment) I received a circular addressed to members of the union asking those who were willing to take part in a fighting policy to send in their names and saying, "Militancy alone can bring pressure to bear upon the Cabinet"; this is signed by E. Pankhurst. I sent in my name. I received other communications, including one which enclosed a card of admission to the Gardenia restaurant on the evening of March 4, and a paper reading, "Instructions to volunteers. When arrested and taken to Cannon Row or other police station you will, after an interval, be bailed out; then return to your home or hostess. In the morning you should surrender at the time mentioned on your charge sheet at the police court, bringing with you a bag with everything you are likely to need during your imprisonment.

               <p>I left the paper on Mrs. Fagent's table. On March 4 at 6 p.m. I went to the Gardenia, and on showing my card was admitted. There were many women there. A lady asked me if I was prepared for a long or short sentence. I said a short sentence—not more than seven days, because I could not remain longer away from home. I was then told to go to the United Service Museum in Whitehall, because there were small panes there and I could not possibly get more than seven days. I was given a hammer, on which was a motto in writing, "Better broken windows than broken promises." I was advised to put the hammer up my cleeve. I did so, and went off with two other ladies. We were told to do it before nine o'clock. I broke a window of the United Service Museum. I was arrested and taken to Cannon Row Police Station and was afterwards bailed out by Mr. Pethick Lawrence. Next morning I went to Bow Street, bringing things with me. I was sentenced to two months' hard labour and have served that sentence. When I went to the Women's Press in November, 1911, I, acting on written instructions, did not wear any badge or colours. I had the same instructions on March 4. None of the ladies wore them on those occasions.</p>
               <p>To F.W.P. Lawrence. On the occasion of the deputation in October, 1910, I was wearing a badge. We were set upon by a mob and scattered in all directions, and my foot was injured; it was not the result of an accident; the onset was intentional. After that experience, I agree that it was advisable afterwards not to wear a distinctive badge.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Healy. As to why the police selected me to give evidence while 1 was in Hulloway I signed a petition to the Home Secretary; this petition was at my home when the officers called about my bag of stones, and I suppose they got my name from that. I know of no reason why I should have been picked out.</p>

Pankhurst his reasons for haying made inquiries at the Inns of Court Hotel as to payments made by her while staying at that hotel He explained that the object was to ascertain whether the accounts were being paid by her personally or by the union. (Mrs. Pankhurst asked whether the inquiries had anything to do with a statement made recently by Mr. Lloyd George, when some women interrupted a meeting of his, that such interruption "was a poor way of earning a day's pay." Mr. Justice Coleridge said that any statement by Mr. Lloyd George had absolutely nothing to do with the issue here.)</p>

                  </hi>, Rector of S Ethelburga, Bishopsgate. (To F.W.P. Lawrence.) I have known the work of the W.S.P.U. for three or four years. I have attended several meetings and have heard speeches by Mrs. Lawrence and Mrs. Pankhurst.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lawrence asked, "What was the general tenor of those speeches?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Coleridge said that he could only admit questions</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140087"/>
               <p>directed to particular speeches. If the defendants were accused of being members of an illegal association, it might be then material to inquire into a hundred thousand meetings; but the association to which they belonged was a perfectly lawful association.</p>
               <p>Mr. Healy pointed out that the prosecution had alleged, as con<lb/>spiracy, a number of acts of a supposed criminal character; he sub<lb/>mitted that the defence was entitled to bring before the jury that there were a great many spheres of legitimate activity connected with this movement.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Coleridge said the sole question for the jury was whether the defendants incited by speech or by conduct on certain definite occasions the commission of certain definite acts.</p>
               <p>E. Pankhunst. Not being a lawyer, I cannot say whether this is legal evidence, but I submit that there is a higher law. We stand here in this dock defending ourselves Against a charge which not only may mean long terms of imprisonment but may reduce us to the level of the lowest in the land. I appeal to you to allow this evidence to be given as to the motive, as to the need, and as to the urgency of the case.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Coleridge. My ruling is that you must confine your evidence to the material matter which is before us, and that is whether or not you did or did not commit the acts complained of in the indict<lb/>ment.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Esmond, generally known as Miss Eva Moore, an actress, vice-president of the Actresses Franchise League. (To F.W.P. Lawrence.) I have been acquainted with the work of the W.S.P.U. for several years. I was present at the Albert Hall meeting on November 10 and heard speeches of Mrs. Lawrence and Miss Christabel Pankhurst. It did not seem to me that the speeches partook of the nature of an incite<lb/>ment to violence; their general trend was that work was needed from all of us to further our cause.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the Attorney-General. I did not understand that what was advocated was that the militant campaign must go for<lb/>ward more than ever. As to the passage in Mrs. Lawrence's speech, "If we don't get what we want to<lb/>morrow the militant campaign goes forward with more vigour than ever." I have no suggestion to make as to what was meant. I do not remember attending meetings at which people were asked to come forward in the campaign of window breaking. I have not myself taken part in window breaking. I con<lb/>cluded that "militancy" meant deputations to Parliament.</p>
               <p>To E. Pankhunst. I have heard of "The Church militant." Mili<lb/>tancy, I suppose means being very determined to work in every possible way for something that one thinks right.</p>
               <p>Sir Edward Busk, M.A., LL.B. (To F.W.P. Lawrence.) I have been acquainted with the W.S.P.U. from its initiation. I was pre<lb/>sent on February 16 at a dinner given to women recently released from prison, Mrs. Pankhurst being in the chair. From the speeches of the women I derived the impression that they were persons of considerable cultivation, of great strength of mind, and of high character; I was convinced that they had all adopted the course they had adopted by</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140088"/>
               <p>their own deliberate intention; they did not seem weak-minded people likely to be influenced by others.</p>
               <p>To E. Pankhurst. I have heard several speeches of yours; the speech on this occasion was, I think, the most violent I have heard you make.</p>
               <p>To the Attorney-General. I recognise that it was a serious speech to make. I gathered that one of its objects was that other persons should imitate the excellent example of those who had been sent to prison for throwing stones. That is a part, but a very small part, of the work carried on in this movement. I admit that I would not myself have made that part of the speech; I think it was a very dangerous form of speech; but, politically, you and I have gained our votes by the same kind of argument. I suggest that we, who have possessed the franchise all our lives, cannot judge the position of these women who do not possess it, and I decline to judge them.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by F.W.P. Lawrence. I have heard Mrs. Pankhurst say that it was only because women had not the vote that they took this method. I have heard her quote Lord Haldane as asking "why the women had devoted themselves to a policy of pin-pricks," and Sir Edward Grey as saying "he objected to violence, particularly to petty violence."</p>
               <p>•Mrs. Morgan Dockrell, president of the London County Council Women Teachers' Union, said that she received the circular giving the invitation to join in the "great militant protest" of March 4. She took it as merely an invitation to go to the House of Commons to petition them on the subject of woman suffrage, and did not under<lb/>stand that there would be any stone or hammer-throwing.</p>
               <p>To E. Pankhurst. I have never heard you speak. The demonstr<lb/>ations of the W.S.P.U. have always been called "militant" from the first, before there was any breaking of glass.</p>
               <p>Miss Jessie Murray, M.B.Sc. (To F.W.P. Lawrence.) I knew in advance that the demonstrations of November and March were to be held. Several women had told me.</p>
               <p>F.W.P. Lawrence was proceeding to question the witness about incidents in November, 1910, when.</p>
               <p>The Attorney-General said there was no case mentioned by the prosecution until the end of 1911.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pethick Lawrence said that Lilian Ball had given evidence as to what took place in November, 1910.</p>
               <p>The Attorney-General said the only reference to 1910 had been to connect the defendants with the incitements of 1911 and 1912.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Coleridge said that if he had been appealed to at the time as to the importance or relevance of statements made in evidence with reference to a deputation to the Prime Minister in 1910 he might have ruled that they had no bearing whatever on the issue. The inquiry here was as to the events of November 21, 1911, and March 4, 1912. If any lady was prepared to come and swear that nothing said or done by the defendants had induced her to commit the act she did commit on November 21 or March 4, that might be relevant evidence. E. Pankhurst. The present witness is a medical woman, and we</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140089"/>
               <p>thought she might replace those women, many of whom have been in prison for a long time, and have been forcibly fed, and are not in a fit state of health to subject themselves to the further ordeal of examina<lb/>tion in this court.</p>
               <p>F.W.P. Lawrence said that in view of his lordship's ruling he would not waste the time of the Court by calling the other ladies and gentlemen who had come prepared to give evidence. In these circum<lb/>stances his closed his case.</p>
               <p>The Judge. Are you, Mrs. Pankhurst, calling any witnesses?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Pankhurst. I am not able to call the only witnesses I should desire to call. They are the Right Hon. Mr. Hobhouse and the last two Home Secretaries and the present-Home Secretary.</p>
               <p>(Tuesday, May 21.)</p>

                  </persName>, doctor of music. I am a member of the W.S.P.U. (To E. Pankhurst.) I was present at the meeting at the Pavilion Theatre on February 26 and heard your speech. I was not incited by anything you said to take the part I subsequently took. I did not wish to take any part in your militant agitation, because I was too busy. Then came the refusal of the Home Office to permit the inquiry into the conduct of the police on Black Friday. I know what these women had been through. I then wrote straight away to Mrs. Lawrence to say that I intended to take part in the next protest. I went so far as to say that I hoped whatever the protest might be, it would not be such a protest as the one on Black Friday, because I did not think that any women should subject themselves to that sort of usage again. If that letter has disappeared I am rather glad of it, because I think that it might possibly be cited as a case of inciting my leaders to violence. Before I heard your speech I had made up my mind to take part in some form of protest; that was in November; I was unfortunately prevented by illness from doing what I had volunteered to do. I was asked to take part in the protest of March 4; I declined, as I wanted to get on with my work. Then, when I was in a sanatorium at Cardiff, came Mr. Hobhouse's Bristol speech, and I wrote and said, "I am coming." I did not see how any self-respecting woman, after that, could stay at home, I took part in the protest, broke a window, and was sentenced to two months' hard labour, which term I served.</p>
               <p>This concluded the evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Healy submitted that the indictment was bad. In fifty odd counts the frame of the charge was "soliciting and inciting," and alternatively "com<lb/>mitting." The offence described in the Act (24 and 25 Vic, c. 97, a. 56) was "aiding, abetting, counselling and procuring" the commission of the mis<lb/>demeanour. This being a purely artificial and technical offence and the crea<lb/>tion of a statute, the words of the statute itself should be used in the indict<lb/>ment. Secondly, to constitute the offence it was necessary that, the mind of the person solicited should be reached. (R. v. Krause, 66 J. P., 121.) Thirdly, there was no evidence of "committing" within the words of section 51; the count for "committing" could only be supported by reference to section 56; therefore, if the first objection were upheld, the "committing" count must go.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191205140090"/>
               <p>Mr. Muir was heard to support the submissions. Taking count 4 as an illustration, there was no evidence to show that, assuming an incitement to have been uttered, it ever reached Sarah Bennett. There was proof that some persons were incited by language and acts of public men, apart from anything said by the defendants, and it was merely a possibility that Bennett may have been incited by the defendants; there was no evidence that incite<lb/>ment by the defendants ever reached her mind; such evidence was clearly necessary according to R. v. Krause (ante) and also R. v. Banks (12 Cox, 393). The Attorney-General pointed out that inciting and soliciting persons to commit a misdemeanour was in itself a common law misdemeanour. Secondly, in R. v. Krause Lord Alverstone expressly said "I am clearly of opinion that it is not necessary to show that the mind of a man had been effected. So to hold would be contrary to R. v. Most." In the latter case (1881, 7 Q.B.D., 244) Coleridge (L.C.J.) said, "An endeavour to persuade or an encouragement is none the less an endeavour to persuade or an encouragement because the person who so encourages or en<lb/>deavours to persuade does not in the particular act of encouragement or per<lb/>suasion personally address the number of people, the one or more persons, whom the address which contains the encouragement or the endeavour to persuade reaches."</p>
               <p>Mr. Healy: In Most's case there was a charge of encouraging and en<lb/>deavouring to persuade to murder "certain persons whose names to the jurors were unknown." Here the indictment is for inciting named persons.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Coleridge held that there was evidence to go to the jury on all the counts.</p>
               <p>The Attorney-General said that with regard to Mrs. Pankhurst, she was in America last December, and therefore, the charges against her relating to that period were withdrawn. Of course, this did not affect the conspiracy charge.</p>
               <p>The defendants E. Pankhurst and F.W.P. Lawrence addressed the jury; Mr. Healy followed for E.P. Lawrence; the Attorney-General replied.</p>
