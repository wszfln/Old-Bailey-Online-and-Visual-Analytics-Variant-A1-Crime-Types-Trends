On Saturday night, the 18th of January, I opened my shop after our Sabbath was over, and there I hung up my stockings, there were about ten dozen of stockings there, dirty and clean, I had hung them up for sale, on two lines inside of the window, I put a gimblet in the window, to fasten it down, and I went over the water to see my father, and I left my wife alone in the place.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you leave your wife at home? - About seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you come back? - About ten in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know any thing that they were missing till you came home? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen them since? - Yes, the prisoner offered some to sell to me the Wednesday following, she offered me first one pair, and then another pair, and then two pair; I asked her if she had any more? she said she had not; says I then, good woman I must stop you with these, because these are my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it this woman offered them to you to sell? - In Rosemary-lane, in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any other goods to sell besides these stockings? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she a dealer in goods there? - I suppose she is, but I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. She offered them to you as such? - Yes. When I told her that I must stop her; she says if you will go with me to Petticoat-lane, I will shew you the person that I bought them of. As we were going along, she said, she did not know the person rightly, but if I would go with her to her father's in Winfield-street, he knew the person; I went with her down to her father's, in Winfield-street, into a back place, and when I came there I again asked her if she had got any more? she said she had not; at the time I spoke to her she had her apron tied up, as all these women have; as soon as we got into the door she whispered something to her father, and I had some suspicion, and I saw her throw seven pair down into the kitchen. I told her what a wicked woman she must be to tell me she had no more, and yet had more concealed; I went down the stairs and picked them up, and I went with her and them into Petticoat-lane, and I gave them to the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all the articles that you gave to the constable the same you took from the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your wife here? - No, she is very big with child, she could not come here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see that woman in your house yourself? - No, not to my knowledge.</p>

The chaise was stopped by five footpads together, two of them opened the doors, one of each side, and thrust their pistols in; they struck the other gentleman and they struck me against my side, and they afterwards searched my pockets and took five guineas out of my right hand breeches pocket. I lost a pair of saddle bags, it was underneath the seat of the chaise; they came in strait up and pulled them out, there was a grey frock coat in them, a kerseymere waistcoat, a pair of jean breeches, three pair of stockings, and two and three shirts,</p>
               <p>Q. How long might they stay with you? - I suppose on the whole about three minutes, or not quite so long.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know to whom it belongs? - To Mr. Duberley.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know it by any marks? - No, I have no other reason than finding it in his possession, and his coming out of the cutting room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing? - He said he never took any before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made him any promise or threats? - No, none of any kind, it was all voluntary.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he said that he had never taken any before, or that he had never taken any? - He said something of that sort.</p>

               <p>Mr. Wentworth. Has there not been some difference between you and the prisoner? - Never, it is all a malicious report.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a report? - I suppose it must be a report by your speaking of it; I never heard of it before.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you miss that cloth from? - I suppose it was missing from the board he cuts out on.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not hesitate to take it out when you told him? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you pretend to say that that is Mr. Duberley's? - He did not go from the board where he was cutting out on without my keeping my eye on him.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this? - About five or six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you, on your oath, say that it was not between three and four o'clock? - Yes, I will, it was a little before six.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it? - It is valued at seven shillings, but it is intrinsically worth more.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you suppose he was going? - Out at the street door, he was going the broad way for it.</p>
               <p>Q. However he made no hesitation to shew you what he had got? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever recollect refusing to let the prisoner have his beer? - I recollect that they used to have beer coming in at all times of the day, and it impeded the business very much continually, and I spoke to Mr. Duberley about it, and he said that they should have it brought in at stated hours of the day, but as to this prisoner at the bar, I never spoke particularly to him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you miss any cloth at all from the warehouse? - It is impossible to miss a piece of cloth like this in our warehouse, there is such a quantity there.</p>

               <p>I am an Army Clothier, the prisoner was employed by me as a cutter. Among the thousand yards of cloth we have it is almost impossible to identify any, but this particular piece of cloth I can. In consequence of the scarcity of cloth, I had this cloth dyed in town; and it is seldom that I look at a piece of cloth or see it, but this piece coming from the Dyer's not so good in point of colour as we had used to have it, it made me examine the cloth very minutely, this was about two or three days before it was taken, I observed the fag end of the piece particularly torn in this manner, and another circumstance in the dye of the cloth itself, on a minute inspection, it will be found full of little<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300013"/>black dots, which is almost imperceptible unless closely looked into, which induced me to dye no more in town.</p>
               <p>Jury Is it customary for to give a piece of cloth to cut so many garments? - No</p>
               <p>Q. How are they employed as cutters? - They cut all by patterns which they have of a person who superintends that branch of the business, and the prisoner was the only man that was cutting this species of cloth, at that time as this was found upon him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wentworth. I believe usually you do not give the cutters a whole piece of cloth to cut from? - I deliver nothing myself, there is hardly any thing delivered but a whole piece, except by accident.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is possible that this man might have part of a piece given him to cut out from? - On the contrary, because I can swear to its being a whole piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear that that piece of cloth was delivered to the cutter? - It was, because I see him cutting the cloth, going in by accident at the time, and seeing the cloth, not liking it at all.</p>
               <p>Q. There are other Army Clothiers in town, and there may be the same cloth? Is it not possible to find cloth of the same kind and dye in other parts of the town? - Yes, it is possible, but not with these marks upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. He worked with you for four years during the American War, I believe? - He worked some time, I cannot say how long.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did you stay there? - I did not stay with her five minutes that time. We made an agreement to go out of the public house and to go to her apartment, and we stopped there about five minutes; I was to give her a shillings, I had no shilling about me, only half a guinea, and I said, she might hold my watch while I went down to change the half guinea; I gave her the watch and went to the public house and got change at the bar with the landlord, when I came back I gave her the one shilling that I owed her, and she gave me the watch again. I put my watch into my pocket and went into the public house again and sat down with my company that I at first went into the house with, and she came and sat down at the end of the same box, and we had something to drink more, some beer and some gin; we stayed there till between six and seven o'clock in the evening; my uncle then asked me what o'clock it was? and I pulled my watch out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300014"/>of my pocket and told him, and put the watch on the table that he might see, she sat the outside of the box, and took the watch up, and went out to the door with it, I got up in less than a quarter of a minute after, and went out to see for her, and there being two doors to the tap-room, I chanced to go to the wrong door, and I did not see her afterwards, nor have not seen the watch since.</p>

I said yes; says he, if you will go up stairs I will give you a shilling, and I being a poor woman, a shilling was very acceptable to me; and having a child to keep; and I said to him, I will go up with you, and then before any thing passed, I asked him for the shilling, and he said he had not a shilling, only a half guinea, and he gave me the watch to hold while he got change for the half guinea, so afterwards he went and got change for the half guinea, and I gave him the watch out of my pocket. Now, says he, come in along with me and I will treat you, and I went in and sat along with him and his companions, and we had about six half pints of gin, and six pots of half and half, after that, being disguised in liquor, I went and laid myself down by the side of my child, and Mr. Ash, belonging to the public house, came and took me up.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know of his having lost any printed callico? - Yes. On the 24th of April he lost somewhere about ten yards, I cannot say exactly, I was serving in the shop, and a neighbour came and told me that a person had took a piece of callico away from the door; I asked him the description of the person; he described her as a person with a red cloak; I pursued her and overtook her in about half a minute, it was the prisoner, and she had a piece of printed callico under her cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen her in the shop? - She was not in the shop, the callico hung at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take on yourself to say that that callico had been hanging at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300015"/>door just before? - I had seen it just before.</p>

It was a strange woman in the street that met me and gave it to me to hold.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you pushed by force or did you go voluntary? - By force, as near as I can recollect, for I was in liquor, it was about nine o'clock at night. I had been drinking down East Smithfield. I found myself robbed the time that I was being pushed.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you when you got into the house? - I came out again as soon as I was robbed.</p>

               <p>Q. What part of the house did you miss your watch from? - I cannot recollect nothing but the entry; the girls that shoved me in I suppose robbed me, I did not go further than the entry; I struggled and would not go any farther in.</p>
               <p>Q. Who you saw in that house you cannot tell? - No, I cannot recollect.</p>

               <p>I am an inspector of the letter carriers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you so on the 20th of August last? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time was the prisoner at the bar employed in the Post Office? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his employment in the Post Office the 20th of August? - As a <rs id="t17940430-14-deflabel68" type="occupation">letter carrier, and he assisted in subsorting of the letters</rs>

               <p>Q. What was his duty in that character? - The letters are sorted first by twelve sorters in twelve divisions.</p>
               <p>Q. When they are sorted by the twelve sorters to whom are they delivered? - To the letter carriers, who subsort them into the different districts to deliver them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that part of the prisoner's duty on that day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the letters directed for Gerard-street fall among those that he sorted? - It might or might not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is his walk to carry letters in Gerard street? - No, it is not. There are one hundred and ten districts and twelve divisions; and there were ten districts in this division that he forted. The first sorters make them into twelve divisions, when the postage is tolled and the letters are delivered to the carriers, and they are subsorted by the letter carriers of that division, and they are subsorted by the letter carriers of that division, and they subsort them, and each one take to deliver to their own district; one of them divisions are delivered out to the letter carriers, who subsort the letters for their own districts; there were ten in this division.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Gerard-street in that division in which that man was one of the ten to sort? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Gerard-street must be among them sorters? - Naturally speaking it must be, but it might be given to others, being put in wrong by the first sorters under a mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any particular period in which the letter carriers make their payment at the Post-office? - Every other day.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the days? - Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.</p>
               <p>Q. In the week in which this 20th of August fell, was the prisoner at the bar regular in making his payments on the Monday, Wednesday, and Friday-(Produces a memorandum book.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Are the entries in that memorandum book, made by yourself? - They are. On the 21st of August he was deficient eight pounds and four-pence on that day, Wednesday, by two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he in fact pay it? - Not till the day following, Thursday, it was paid into the revenue on the Friday following, but I think he paid it on Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the consequence if a letter carrier does not make good his payments? - The post master's order is, that he be suspended till such times as it is paid.</p>
               <p>Q. According to the rules of the Post Office when would he have been reported? - On Friday, if it had not been paid.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. If I understand you right, there were nine others into whose hands these letters might have fell? - Yes, there were.</p>
               <p>Q. There are a great many persons by at the time that this process takes place? - Yes, I believe one hundred and ten.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300020"/>Q. Is there any strangers admitted? - Yes, sometimes they come in enquiring for letters, and when the gates are opened they will come in to enquire for letters, but not in general till the sorting is all over, except an old woman, that supplies the letter carriers.</p>
               <p>Court. Are there any other sorters in the room besides these ten sorters of this division, when they are sorted by the letter carriers? - All the divisions are sorted in the same room, they are three rooms, but they are all connected together.</p>
               <p>Q. So that all the sorters have access to all these rooms? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. If I understand your description right, there is a class of sorters, and a class of subsorters? - There is.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time the prisoner at the bar was employed as a subsorter, and not as a sorter? - It was so.</p>
               <p>Q. In these twelve divisions it sometimes happens that a mistake happens, a letter gets into a wrong division frequently? - It is impossible to avoid that.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor's Counsel. When a mistake happens what is done with the letter? - There are boxes for each of the twelve divisions, they are thrown off to the division it belong to.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you live in the month of August last? - No. 2, in the Terrace, Tottenham-court-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you change a bank note for Shillcock at any time? - Yes, it was either on Tuesday or Wednesday, I think it was Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. What month? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you was examined at Bow-street? - I think about five or six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with that note? - I took it to Mr. Underwood, and got it changed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you received it from Shillcock, was it you changed it with Mr. Underwood? - Within two hours.</p>


               <p>Q. What did you do with the change? - I carried it to Mr. Shillcock and gave it him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rains. You have a very imperfect recollection of the day in which this transaction took place? - It was either on a Tuesday, or a Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Or a Thursday perhaps? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect yourself Mrs. Bailey, when it ought to have been more recent in your recollection, you was more doubtful concerning the day? - I think it was on a Tuesday, or a Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect yourself, in short you cannot at all remember precisely the day of the week, so it might have been on Monday.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor's Counsel. Was it the same day you changed it with Underwood? - It was.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. At his own lodgings did he say any thing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Before he said any thing of this sort, did any body tell him he had better give some account of it? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was there any thing before that said to him, either to induce him to say it, or to threaten him to say it? - He was in bed when we went to the house, and Shillcock by the direction of Miller, desired him to come down; when he came down stairs, he was asked by Miller what he had done with the fifteen pounds bank note? he hesitated some little time, but however by interrogating him with some degree of spirit, he said it was all gone different ways, and said if we would let him alone, he would make it up in the morning; very little more passed then, he put his clothes on, and we took him away in a coach, and we brought him down to the Brown Bear, the next morning he was examined at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. At Bow-street there was some memorandum made in a book? - I will not take on me to say positively there was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. But as to the time you was going to speak of, was there any thing in writing taken down at that time? - I rather think there was not; it was what I did not much attend to.</p>

               <p>I am one of the clerks to the public office at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the original minute book to see if there was any examination of the prisoner taken? - There was only three or four words, a sentence begun but not finished, no more than that it begins, "the prisoner saith that."</p>
               <p>Q. The question was not what the clerk had writ on any subject, but on your search did you find any one syllable which imported to have been said by the prisoner? - No, I did not, nothing only,"the prisoner saith that."</p>
               <p>Court to Wedd. What was done with the letter? - I put it in the Post Office myself at Cambridge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rolse. I keep the Post Office at Cambridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Who assists you in it? - Nobody, but my wife occasionally.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a memory of any such letter as that coming into your office? - That is impossible; I generally keep it myself, sometimes my wife, but that Monday evening the 19th, I was at home and my wife had no part of the business at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately in the evening had you sealed that bag that night? - At the time that the Wisbich Mail comes in, that commonly comes in a quarter after ten, sometimes sooner, and sometimes later, I delivers it to the guard. I put the letters into the bag before, I shut the box at nine o'clock; it is a bag sealed for London only.</p>
               <p>Court to Peter Wedd. You say you put the letter in the Post, did you pay any thing with it? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you put it in? - Between eight and nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put it in? - Into the letter box.</p>
               <p>Rolfe. I saw Mr. Wedd go to the box, and had some particular conversation with him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore if Mr. Wedd put it in you are absolutely certain you forwarded it in proper time? - I am.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am conscious of my innocence, I was out nine weeks on bail, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300023"/>twice surrendered myself, and my bail even persuaded me to be absent if I was guilty; I told my bail I was not guilty and I would take my trial like a man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is certainly true that this man did twice surrender himself, after having been out twice upon bail to take his trial.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called twenty-one witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

On Sunday week I went down to King's Langley, in Hertfordshire, in consequence of a letter having been seen in her box, dated from that piece. I found that she had been down there in a post chaise on the Saturday,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300024"/> subsequent to the robbery, and I traced her back to Watford, she there took another post chaise and came to the Green Man at Islington; but I should tell your lordship first, that I saw the boy at Watford that drove her, and he told me that there was part of the property left at the Green Man at Islington, which I have got here and can swear to some part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at the Green Man when you found the property? - No, she had been gone some days; the property was brought forward by the landlord and landlady of the house, the landlord's name, I believe, is James Thomas.</p>

               <p>The prisoner took a place at our coach office for Kingston, from Kingston to London, she booked the place on the 26th of March in the evening, outside, she came up by the coach on the 27th of March, she came to the Angel, the back of St. Clement's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she the bundle with her then? - I did not see the large bundle, that she did not carry, but she had a small bundle then in a small silk handkerchief; and she went back with me to Stones End to know if the bundle was come by the other coach. She went with me on the box to the Stones End, to the Horse Shoe, where she found it was come to the Cross Keys, in Gracechurch-street; but I bought a watch of her in the day time. left her at the Horse Shoe.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you buy that watch? - Between the hours of one and two on the 27th.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you bought it? - At the Crooked Billet, the corner of Wych-street, I went with her from the Angel Inn to there, it was only across the way.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it happen, had you had any talk about that watch? - She had something of a twist about her finger, and I asked her about it, and she said she was at play the night before, and had broke her ring, and she pulled her housewife out of her pocket to shew me a ring, and she could not find it; but she found a mourning ring, which she said was her grandmother's; she then opened her bundle and took out a tea caddy, she then took out two watches, one was a plain gold one, and the other was a green studded case watch. I asked her if she would sell the plain gold watch? she said, I should have it if I chose; I asked her what I should give her for it? I told her I did not know the value of such a thing, but I would give her what she pleased for it; she said it was a very old watch, much battered and bruised, and it was her grandfather's; but if I had it cleaned it would go well, and I should have it for my own price. I said if she would I would give her three guineas for it; she said I should have it. and I bought it of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know it was gold then? - I did not. I took it to the Angel Inn, and shewed it to one of our clerks, and he said it was not worth more than fifteen shillings, but afterwards it was shewn to a watch maker, and he said the outside case was worth two guineas; we went then to Stones End, in the Borough.</p>

Mr. Cooke made a mistake in saying I slington. She came to me the latter end of March, the day I cannot say, it was on a Saturday, and she came away the Saturday following; she said she had been in search of her brother, and her money ran short, and she wished to leave a few things that she had got, and desired to have a guinea and a half on them, and she would send for the things in a day or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any bundles with her at that time? - Yes, I cannot say to more than one, and that I can hardly say, only I see the porter have it on his back when she went out of the house, she left a piece of muslin, a blue sattin cloak, with black lace, and a check apron she gave my servant, and a mourning ring.</p>

I broke the pendant the night before the robbery, in consequence I did not take it up stairs that night as I used to do, but I left it on the chimney-piece. It cost me nine guineas, I bought it as second hand; I suppose it is worth now six or seven guineas, the cloak cost about four pounds, the muslin cost three shillings and six-pence a yard, the rings are worth three pounds.</p>

After I had got him in the cage went back to the watchman, got a light, and see who it was, and went afterwards with the light to the shed and we looked to see how the prisoner had got in, and we see half a dozen pantiles were off, over the lost where some old iron lay.</p>

               <p>Q. How high was the roof from the ground? - The top of the roof was about sixteen or eighteen feet from the ground up.</p>
               <p>Q. How many feet do you think the floor of the lost is to the roof? - About five feet.</p>
               <p>Q. How many from the shelf to the floor of the lost? - About two feet. I looked into the bag directly, and saw the iron.</p>

               <p>Q. Now, looking at that iron was you able to say whose iron it was? - Some of it; I could say to one piece I had in my hand in the day time before this happened that I could swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you seen that piece in the day time before? - One of the men brought it in out of the yard and put it in the lost, I tossed it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the only piece of iron that you could speak to? - I did not take particular notice of any other piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take this piece of iron out of the bag in order to look at it? - In the shop, and afterwards I put it into the bag along with the rest and tied the bag up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it again before the justice? - Yes, and I am certain it is the same piece.</p>

I had not been in the habit of visiting many of my servants<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300035"/>trunks when they left my service, but perceiving if I did so in this instance, it might lead to the unfolding something very unfortunate that had happened in my family, I determined to discover what was in her trunk, I therefore demanded of her, her keys, she refused to give them, I called up my servants that they might have the testimony of what I did, I told her it was in vain to deny, for the more she denied the more I would persist, and she at last gave the keys up to the butler, the trunk was opened, and the first thing that discovered itself was the callico breeches and waistcoat of mine, they are of a very fine description of cloth called, Isares. On this I went to the police office in Marlborough street, for a constable, I did not choose to proceed farther of myself, a constable, of the name of Hamilton, was sent with me, and he examined and found all the articles contained in the indictment, which are my property. I have undervalued them considerably in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you missed any articles before this time? - Never, not during this woman living with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had this woman lived with you? - She had lived with me two periods, and I took her back the second time because I thought her an excellent character, she had lived with me formerly as a nurse maid, she attended on me in my illness; the last time she came to attend about the house, occasionally to attend my wife, the first time she lived with me fifteen months, the last time about two months; I took her in again merely because I thought her an excellent character, and as such I should have given her to any other place had I not found this out.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you found these things in the box, had you missed any of them? - None, I had not a suspicion of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any reason to open the box? - Yes, I had reason, but not expecting or suspecting any thing of this.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any thing in the trunk besides your things? - Yes, there were some articles of her own.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any articles there which she claimed to be her own? - Yes, she had some.</p>

               <p>I am a constable belonging to Mary-le-bone; I saw the box opened; it was the prisoner's, she was standing by and acknowledged it to be her's, there were some little things of her own in it, and the greatest part of the articles, which I produce here, were found in that box, some I found in another box up stairs, which had never been removed.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the box above stairs was the prisoner's? - Because she brought it down herself into the entry where the other was. It was a small paper box.</p>
               <p>Court to Prescott. You say that the articles which were delivered to the constable are belonging to you; and all the articles are put in the indictment? - They are, I believe them all to be mine; I can swear them all to be mine. The fine shifts are marked I. B. with a cross, they have never been marked since they were washed in India; I can at all times tell things that have been washed in India. I do not conceive, from the circumstances I have collected in my family, that the prisoner could have taken all these things at one time.</p>

               <p>Q. Where had you last seen it before it was missing? - Outside of the door on a box, there was a string across, but the prisoner slipped it from under the string, and put it under her cloak; they were not very fast.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you seen it before it was taken? - In the morning, or perhaps it might be an hour before, they were left out all the day, we never all leave the shop at once, the mark is P. N. with two crosses underneath.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom was the mark made? - I cannot swear to the hand writing, but it is one of our young mens that is not here, I know the mark, that is our mark that we usually mark goods with.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you miss a piece of that size and pattern by the information of Mrs. Stragnell? - We did not miss it any otherwise, we have had a dozen of pieces of this pattern or more; the only thing I know it by is the mark.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wentworth. You say that she slipped it away, and put it under her clothes; how do you know that? - By finding it on her.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that she slipped it away? - By the information of Mrs. Stragnell.</p>
               <p>Q. This was on the 10th of March; did you observe any body with her that day? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray had you ever seen the prisoner in your shop yourself? - Not that day, I cannot say that I ever saw her before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot swear to that mark, who made it? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not a vast number of them pieces in your shop? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance might you take the prisoner from the door? - About fifteen or twenty yards.</p>

               <p>My husband is a carpenter.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at any time? - I think I remember something of her face; I was going by, and I saw her take that piece of printed cotton at the door, it was laying with other pieces on the board outside of the door.</p>
               <p>Court to Nicholls. Is it callico? - It is.</p>
               <p>Stragnell. This is a piece I see her take it from the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it tied to any thing, or was it loose? - I cannot say to that.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do then? - I see her take it off, and put it under her clothes, and cover it over, and walked gently by the door, and I went into the shop and informed them, and Mr. Nicholls and the young lad went out; it was rolled on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300037"/>wrong side so, but I believe this is the piece, I did not notice it much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it taken from her? - I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wentworth. You say that the prisoner covered it over? - She covered it with her gown, I believe, to the best of my memory.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to her person? - She was not out of my sight till the gentleman brought her back and took it from her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it all to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses to her character.</p>

               <p>I came home from the chambers between nine and ten o'clock, on Saturday night, the 12th of this month. I am a laundress, in Gray's Inn, and put my cloak and bonnet where I always do, in my room where I live in Clement's-lane, and then I went out of the room, and went into the shop where my husband was, and I was coming back again into the back room where I put my bonnet and cloak, and I met this man coming out of the door with my bonnet.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there light enough for you to distinguish his person? - There was a light in the shop, and a snuff of a candle in the back room.</p>
               <p>Q. You had light enough to see him? - Yes, I had, I perceived the bonnet in his hand, and I asked him what he wanted? and he asked me for some name, I don't know what name; but I said directly he was a thief, and he had got my bonnet, and he took and throwed the bonnet out of his hand, when I called for a light on the stairs, when I went into the back room to see if he had got any thing else, and he was stopped immediately by Mr. Evans; I stopped him myself, but the man shut too the door and kept him in; the cloak was taken away the same night, but he had not got the cloak, the watchman stopped another man in the street with the cloak; I am certain this is the man.</p>

I lost a sow pig, on the 27th of March, I found it on the prisoner, in his sack, dead, the same day, between five and six in the evening; he had a sack on his back, and the pig being fresh killed the blood was running out behind, he had only part of it in the sack, the two quarters of one side, and half a head and two feet; he was in the street when I stopped him close by my own door, I missed the pig about half an hour before; I know the prisoner, he belongs to Mr. Morgan's brewhouse, it goes by the name of Picard's now; I examined him concerning the pig, and he owned that the property belonged to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise, or use any threats to induce him to discover? - First of all when I stopped him, he said that he knew the property was mine, and begged I would not expose him in the street, if I would go home with him he would give it me, he said there were three others concerned, and then he would send for the other three, and they should pay me what I pleased to charge for the property; I made answer, that if he would pay me for the property, on account of his family, I would not hurt him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You say you knew the prisoner at the bar? - I did, he is a <rs id="t17940430-24-deflabel125" type="occupation">brew-house servant</rs>

               <p>Q. Have they never strayed into other persons premises? - They might stray in the brewhouse for what I know.</p>
               <p>Q. When a pig strays into the brew-house, don't the brewhouse servants think it belongs to them, and immediately cut it up.</p>
               <p>Court. I shall not take such a question.</p>
               <p>Q. When this man came up to you he was coming up to your own door? - He was taking the pig home to his family; he has four children, and his wife ready to lay-in again.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time did you say any thing to him, that it would be better for him to tell all about it? did you say any thing to him till he got home to his wife and family? - He owned at the time that it was my pig.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was a side of pork? - It was quite hot.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw a side of pork it had been scalded? - But there is a difference between my scalding a pig and them that don't understand it. I can give you the description and marks of the pig likewise, a bit cut out of the ear and off the tail, only the Sunday before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long he has worked at this brewhouse? - He has lived there twice, six months each time.</p>

               <p>I live in Charles-square, Hoxton, with Mr. Southam, the little lad came and told my sister that two men were stealing the carpet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the prisoners? - Yes, I followed them.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time of the day was it? - About twelve o'clock. I ran out and ran round Charles-square, and down Pitfield-street, I turned myself round into Old-street road, and saw the thieves running with the carpet, these were two of them, one had the carpet, I saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were these persons that were running? - I don't know their names, them there are the two fellows, they were running together.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them had the carpet? - I cannot tell, but I believe the biggest had it. I hallooed stop thief! and they dropped the carpet directly, they ran on about twenty yards after they had dropped the carpet, and they were stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pick up the carpet? - No, a gentleman picked it up and took it into another gentleman's house in Old-street-road; I saw the person pick it up. As soon as the men were stopped they were brought back by some young man.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were they stopped from the place where the carpet was dropped? - About twenty yards, I did not see any more of them till they were brought back, I went to take care of the carpet. I am sure that is the carpet they dropped, because I know it, and have seen it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that that is the carpet, that either of the prisoners dropped? - Because there was never another on the road besides that.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was you from the carpet when it was dropped? - About two hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up to the carpet as soon as it was dropped? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the carpet after it was dropped by one of the prisoners, and before any body picked it up? - Yes, I ran to pick it up, and the gentleman he ran before me, and picked it up first.</p>
               <p>Q. When it was picked up did you examine the carpet? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a carpet that you knew very well? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had it been usually hung at your master's door? - About a week or a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at it for the purpose of enabling you to say whether it was your master's carpet or not? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it opened? - No, it was rolled up all of a heap; I am sure it is Mr. Southam's carpet, and I did undo it a little, to look at it, but not all.</p>
               <p>Q. But how are you sure that that is the very carpet, that one of the prisoners dropped? - I am sure it was, I saw it again as soon as the prisoners were taken in Old Street-road, in another gentleman's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the size of the carpet? - Three yards by three and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. When you received the alarm, did you observe that the carpet was gone then from the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wentworth. I am for Bennet. When you first missed the carpet and ran out, did you see Bennet? - No, not either of them, but when I see them in Old-street, I never lost sight of them till I got to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300042"/>Q. I believe you don't know which had the carpet? - Yes, the biggest had the carpet, (Bennet.)</p>
               <p>Q. You say you was about two hundred yards from them at the time the carpet was dropped? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are very positive that Bennet had it? - The biggest had, I am positive.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never taken any particular notice of the carpet before? - Yes, as it hung out at Mr. Southam's door, I saw it had a dark colour and a light colour, and was a kidderminster.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had it hung out at the door; can you be positive, had it longer than a week? - I cannot say, it might hang more, I think it was about a week or a fortnight; I know this is the carpet, there is a piece set in the middle, and this is the same pattern.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Monday, the second of April, I was crossing Old-street-road, about twelve o'clock in the day, I heard the cry of stop thief several times, I turned round and I saw the two prisoners come running, first they were coming down Pitfield-street into the road, they were running gently together, I made a stop the space of half a minute; I should have wished to have run after them, but my hands were tied with several articles that I had in my hand, and I could not, and I delivered the articles into my wife's hand, and I pursued them before ever they dropped the carpet. I saw the carpet drop before I could get up to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see who dropped the carpet? - Not punctually. I could not with to swear to that; before I could get up to them they were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the carpet picked up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was that boy there when it was picked up? - I cannot say whether he was before or behind; my being a particular acquaintance of Mr. Southam's made me officiate in the business. I was told it was his property before I ran after the man. I saw the carpet drop and I ran after the prisoners, and I saw the boy go and claim the carpet. I assisted in taking the prisoners before the magistrate, and I was bound over.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wentworth. The prisoners were running gently when you see them? - Yes, when I first see them, but afterwards they mended their pace.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say who had the carpet? - I could not wish to say that.</p>
               <p>Q. The boy did not claim the carpet at the time? - It was not taken up nor dropped at the time, I almost got the start of them, but they were taken before I quite came up.</p>
               <p>Court. They were running as in company? - They were side by side.</p>
               <p>Southam. When I first purchased this carpet, I purchased it from a gentleman in Little St. Thomas Apostles, and it was cut to sit the room, the fire place was in the corner, and it made the carpet very aukward for another customer, I therefore took off the corner that projected out and made the carpet a square one, and there had been a hole burnt in it, and a piece that I cut off from the corner, I grafted in myself with my own hands; I had purchased it a considerable time, but I had hung it out for sale for about a week or fortnight. I can positively say to that being the carpet, I put out that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you had it back again? - From Friday, the 4th of April, the day that they had their second hearing, and Mr. Colquohon desired I would take it home, it was hung out on my premises where I always hang out things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bennet. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jones. I know nothing of this young man here.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300043"/>The prisoner Bennet called five witnesses, and the prisoner Jones two, who gave them good characters.</p>

            , I was in her mother's room, she went out and called to me, and told me my door was open; on this I answered her my door was locked, and ran out immediately. I was on the same floor, only the passage parted the two apartments. When I came to my own door, I saw the man run out of the front door of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What door was it you locked? - My own apartment on the ground floor, that was the only door that I locked; there were other lodgers in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You say something about his being stopped, was he stopped near the door, or where? - I ran after him, he was stopped down the court, an officer belonging to Queen's-square stopped him; he is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he run all the way till he was stopped? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the man that was stopped? - The man at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any part of your property brought back? - When I returned to my apartment, I found my drawers opened, and a good deal of property taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you miss? - Not any thing, every thing was there, they were put on the bed they had been taken out of the drawers, a silk handkerchief, three linen sheets, one gown, two waistcoats, one petticoat, two child's frocks, one child's petticoat, a woman's shift, and a pair of flannel drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these articles left when you went out of your apartment? - In one and the same drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the drawer locked? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen them there? the same day, I had occasion to go to the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were laying on the bed were they tied up or laying loose? - Laying loose, one on the top of another, and one sheet taken off the bed and laid on a chair by the side of the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your apartment broke open, or how? - I cannot say that the lock was injured at all. I am very sure I left it locked, and there was no appearance of violence to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it an upper or lower drawer? - It was the top but one, not the top, but the next to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lose sight of the man who ran out of the house? - No, never did.</p>

               <p>I am an officer of Queen's-square. On this 19th of April I was just coming home, (I live in the same street,) it was about a quarter before five, between four and five, and I heard a noise of stop thief! I stopped, and I saw the prisoner at the bar run by, he ran from a house, No. 3, and these two witnesses, the prosecutrix and the other, following him, then I ran out as hard as I could run after him, and he turned into Poultney-court, a short court in Little Windmill-street, there is a throughfare in that court, but there is some posts goes across, and that is how I catched him, because he could not pass the post so quick.</p>
               <p>Q. You are very sure that the prisoner was the man that these two women were in pursuit of? - Yes, I am very certain it is the same man, I apprehended him; and he says, what do you lay hold of me, for? I told him I would tell him soon what I laid hold of him for, and I took him back to Mrs. Sedgeworth's room, and found the door open, and seeing this property, which I have got here, laying on the bed in one heap, one upon another, then I saw the other sheet spread on a chair, close by the other things, then I took and bundled it all up together, and have had it in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The gentlewoman took the property from the constable; I had the privilege of going for a soldier, but having the venereal disease, they would not take me, till I was cured; I was taken away for two days.</p>

               <p>Creedland. I did give them back to the woman for a short time, for about an hour or so, and she gave me the same articles back again.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Sedgeworth. These things are all mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming past this woman's house, and I had got about twenty yards from the door, and they cried out stop thief! I walked about fifty yards, and then three curriers took hold of me, and they took me back to the woman's place; I was going after a place where I had been to work.</p>

The 16th of February the bullock was taken out of our cart house, it was put in the 7th at night. In the afternoon we missed him, between the hours of twelve and one, Friday morning, midnight, we may say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any search after him? - The watchman came to me at that time, and called George, through that I immediately arose (the watchman's name is Campbell) he gave me some information about the bullock, and I immediately got up and pursued to the Green-yard, when I came to the Green-yard I knocked at the gate, and I said have you got ever a bullock brought there about half an hour or twenty minutes ago? they said yes; I said I should be glad if they would let me see the bullock? he said if I would describe the marks he would; I did not see him that night, I saw it the next morning along with my master; it was in the forenoon, about ten o'clock, I cannot pretend to say particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bullock then produced to you that which was your master's? - Yes. I see a lad at the Green-yard, when I went in the night, who is admitted an evidence, and these two at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with these two boys? - No, I said my lads, you have been doing it very nicely, taking my master's property away in this manner, and I asked if there was any watchman near, and I gave charge of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The watchman who called you is not here? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. The ox you found in the place where he would be if he had strayed, in the Green-yard? - I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that if a beast is lost, it is customary to take them to the Green-yard? - It may be so.</p>

               <p>Q. When did she come to you? - She came to see me on Wednesday, the same week that she was stole away on Friday, she is my neice, I believe it was the 26th of March. She staid with me till Friday, when she was taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what occasioned her leaving you? - No, I cannot say, she was at play in the market; I saw her about half after twelve o'clock, I missed her a little after, I recovered her about ten minutes after one; I found her at the bottom of Well-street, in Mile-end New-town, she was coming up Dean-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she alone when you found her? - No, she was along with the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p> Q. When you see her what passed between you? - I sat my self down on the stone steps, I was so glad I had found the child, I could not go any farther, and this woman came up with the child, holding the child in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the child crying or distressed? - No, very quiet.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way was she going with the child? was she coming towards where you live or the other way? - It was not towards where I live. On her coming up to the steps of the door, I said to her, good woman, where did you find this child? - She said, she found it in High-street, and in my flurry I did not know that she had enticed the child out of the market, and I asked her if she chose any thing to drink? she thanked me and said no, I took the child and came away with it towards my home.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the child dressed as when you see it last? - Nothing was taken from her, no clothes off at all. I came along the street towards Well-street, with the child in my hand, and I said, Mary, how came you to go away? says she, aunty the woman took me from behind the broken pump; I was very sorry, there were several people about, I said if I had known she had enticed the child away I would not have let her gone, and somebody went back and stopped the woman.</p>
               <p>- PIKE sworn.</p>


               <p>I stood facing my shop on the 28th of March, I saw this woman going down the street with the child, and another child, and I see her turn round several times and speak to the child, and I said to my wife, I dare say that woman is decoying the child away; my wife said, go along you fool, Mrs. Hannock has sent somebody with it. Presently there was an alarm made about it, and I went to seek after it, I went up into Brick-lane, and came down Brown's-lane, and there I meets this woman, and she runs past me without the child, and I stopped and watched her almost all the way up Brick-lane, and at the top of Brick-lane I ran up and catched her and told her she must go back along with me; so I brought her back and we took her to the magistrate, and he bound us over.</p>

I was going to a customer of mine in Lincoln's Inn-fields, on the first of march, about seven o'clock in the evening, in crossing of Holborn I observed the prisoner standing in a leaning posture over the shew glass of Mr. Stubbs, his shop is at the corner of Turn stile, I saw him in that posture which called my attention, and coming up to him and looking over his right shoulder, standing rather behind him, I observed his hand in the shew glass at the time, attempting to get a locket out, at that time the glass was broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him break the glass? - I see him break it further, he could not get it out with the hole that was then in it, and I saw him take out his hand and push in a bit more glass with his thumb, the hole being made bigger by pushing a bit more in, I see him take out a locket with a ticket to it, and a piece of cotton hanging to it, which he attempted to shake from it, and finding he could not shake the cotton off, he then made an attempt to put it in his pocket, or the folds of his apron, I cannot positively say which, he could not come at the place where he meant to put it, being in a leaning posture, he went to get up and he touched my shoulder with his, and he looked about and see me, and that alarmed him, and he turned towards me with an intent to go off, I laid hold of him directly by the collar before he got one step from the place, and a struggle ensued, he struggled very much, and in the struggle he kicked my leg, which I had a bad leg for several days, I says, you villain you have robbed the shop, he denied it, but still I kept hold of him, and called for assistance, and Mr. Stubbs's lad in the shop came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here? - Yes, we took him into the shop; and says I, it is very proper now to search him, we searched him and did not find the locket on him, that I see him take out; I says to the young lad in the shop, you go out immediately, for you will find the locket on the ground; he went out, and returned immediately with the locket in his hand; and then from that we searched him further, and we found a knife on him, and some duplicates, and that was all the property we found about him.</p>
               <p>Q. You see nothing of any rings taken by him? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor only one locket? - Only one.</p>
               <p>Q. This shew glass is on the outside of the house? - Yes, it is, it pushes out without the window.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did it take him up doing this? - It might be the space of half a minute, it was done very shortly.</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Stubbs. On the 1st of March, I had been up stairs, I had been out of the shop about twenty minutes, Mr. Stubbs was in the back parlour, I came down stairs and was called out of doors, a person called and said, a man had been breaking the windows and taking out some things; I turned round and saw Mr. Brooks had hold of a man(who was struggling to get away) he begged me to come to his assistance, which I did, and brought the prisoner into the shop; Mr. Brooks said, he had the things in his pocket or apron; we searched in his belt and in his pocket, and nothing was there; Mr. Brooks said, then he has dropped them, for I saw him take out a locket; I took a candle and looked where the scuffle had been, and I found the locket and a paper, which belonged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300050"/> to one of the rings, but there was no ring to it; I observed the shew glass broke when I came out of the door, I know what was in the glass, there were a variety of articles in it; I missed four rings and three lockets, including one that I found, I did not find any more than that one locket, and the rings were on separate papers, and the lockets like wife.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen all the lockets and the rings? - I had seen them several times that day.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not sold any of those articles that day? - No, I had not. The prisoner was secured and taken to Bow-street; this is the locket that I picked up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know it to be Mr. Stubbs's? - It was sewed on the card as it is now, and there is the shop mark, and it is my own writing; there is also the paper on which the rings were put, it is my own writing likewise, I marked them all myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming down in Oxford-road, going past this shop on Saturday night very late, I was looking into the shew glass as many other people were, and this gentleman came and laid hold of me, and said I had robbed the window; and since, this Mr. Stubbs has sent me word that this man has got so linked in with the officers, at Bow-street, that he would prosecute me for the sake of the reward.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to be awake at that time of the night? - I had occasion to be awake, I sleep up one pair of stairs; I rose up and hallooed out to him, and he returned; this blind fell on my bed.</p>

               <p>Q.

I know every one of these things, being in the house, all the articles in the indictment, Mr. Sharp found the adze on him.</p>

I got a warrant for him for not finishing his work, so when I went to serve him with the warrant he was at work with this tool, and he made his escape from the constable and me, and got across the water. I missed a great many tools out of my shop.</p>

               <p>On the 15th of February I carried two hats home to Mr. Nock's, I delivered them to Mrs Nock, one was for Mr. Nock, and the other for his son.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his son, a boy? - Yes. As I went down the alley with the hats, I observed a boy in the alley, behind me; the hats were in two boxes, when I was delivering in of the hats, he went by the door, when I came into Whitechapel again, he was behind me again, and he followed me home from there; our house is in Leadenhall-street. About eleven o'clock we heard from Mr. Nock, he enquired whether we had sent the hats home? we said we had sent them home; he said we had not, since we sent for them back.</p>
               <p>Q. How near your house did you see the boy? - I saw him at Mr. Lane's, the bookseller's, three doors from our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you had not sent for these hats at all back, had you? - No.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see him again? - On the 1st of March, I see him by chance at the Exchange, I was going to Piccadilly, and going by Exchange-alley, I see the boy, and a man with him; I recollected he was the boy directly as I passed him, he turned about and looked at me, and I did at him, and he turned up Exchange-alley.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen him before this 15th of February to your knowledge? - Not to my knowledge; I directly followed him and collared him, and brought him to Mr Plastow's, and from thence we took him to Mr. Nock's, and from thence to the police office, and then Mr. Nock appeared in the evening at the examination, he did not see the boy before; I am very certain to the boy.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the same dress when you saw him in Exchange-alley, as when he followed you? - Yes, in the same dress.</p>

               <p>Q. Who looked at them? - The prisoner, and he said there was no name inside of them; and my mistress asked him what difference it could make, there being no name inside of them; he said if you please I will take them back; and my mistress let him take the hats.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he take them away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How am I to reconcile this evidence of your's; that he said when Mr. Plastow sends the hats; and his asking your mistress to let him look at the hats? - My mistress told him that Mr. Plastow had sent the hats, and then he desired to look at them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he came as if coming from Mr. Plastow? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again, after he carried away the hats? - I see him the 1st of of March again, when he was taken.</p>

I told her I was going home to my lodgings, and we walked together to George-yard; in George yard I felt her hand about me, she put her hand immediately away from me, and said, the watchman is coming? I felt her hand about my right hand breeches pocket; she put her hand against me, and pushed me away three or four yards, and I saw the other girl come from the corner of George-yard, and they stopped to speak to one another, and they passed one another, and I walked on till I came to Cheapside, and it struck me then that she had picked my pocket.

On the 28th of February last, about nine o'clock I went into my own cellar, and his morning clothes hung up in the cellar, having some suspicion of him I had the curiosity to feel his pockets, and in his waistcoat pocket I found a little parcel, three slips of cambrick in this piece of paper, this was fast day, Friday; the Wednesday before I saw the piece that these came from, and had it in my hand, it was a remnant, two yards three eights; I saw it in my own shop; on looking at it I thought it was my cambrick. These that I have got in my hand are all slips cut off from that piece, the marked end and the fag end.</p>
               <p>Q. What appears on them? - On one of them is my private mark, on the other is two yards three eights, and the third slip<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300055"/>has nothing at all; it is obvious for what they were cut off. I am perfectly satisfied it is my cambrick, I could swear to it see it any where; when I looked at it I thought it was my piece, and I took my stock book and found I had this piece, two yards and a half, we do not take the eighth; I sent for the constable and he was not in the way, I then sent to Mr. Kirby, and he sent me a couple of officers, and I gave him in charge; when he was taken in charge he said he found these pieces in the shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe you had his house searched where he lived? - I had, where he said he lived.</p>
               <p>Q. It was where his wife lived? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You found nothing there? - Because it was too late.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search his box? - He had nothing in his box, his box was at our house, there was nothing there.</p>
               <p>Q. This man was out at the time that you found this in his waistcoat pocket, he had leave to go that day? - He took leave and went out.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no employment for him, and he went out, he left this openly in the cellar? - He certainly did to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. This was not wrapped up in any thing to conceal it? - It was secured up in a bit of paper very tight.</p>
               <p>Q. There are not many yards? - He has taken care of the other part.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that he has taken care of the rest? - There is no doubt of it, it strikes me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Who sells in your shop besides yourself? - Only my son.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body had bought a bit they might have dropped it in the shop? - There was none of it cut.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that, though your son is not here? - I will.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the coat? was there any thing found there that you claimed? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the breeches? - There were none.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you had this man of Mr. Gedge in Oxford-street? - No, I had him of Mr. Moon or Mr. Maul, in Bishopsgate-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you go to Mr. Gedge for his character? - I did, and he gave him a good one, and he had a very good one of his last master.</p>
               <p>Q. How came your son not to be here? - There was no occasion for him to be here.</p>
               <p>- ROBERTS sworn.</p>
               <p>I was sent for to apprehend this man, I did not search him, I searched his boxes, he gave me the key himself at the watch-house, I found, I believe, a waistcoat or two of his own, and their was a pair of ruffles found, but nothing that belonged to Mr. Webb.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

             went out and left my wife; she had come to nurse her while she was laying in, she had been in the house from the Friday evening before; she went out about four o'clock Monday morning, and was gone some time, and then I came back again; I left the house Sunday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you return to the house? - I returned to the house the next day; I was at work in Bridge Water-gardens, pulling up beer for Messrs. Cox, King and Curtis.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go home then and find these things missing? - Yes, and I went down to the public office, and took a runner along with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the prisoner at your house when you went there on Monday?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300059"/>- No, I did not, I went in search of her, but we did not find her that evening, but I found her on Wednesday morning, in Allen-street, Goswell-street, laying on a bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the room where she was laying on the bed? - Yes, I said to her you must get up and go along with me; she said for what? what had she done? and the runner insisted on her coming along, and we took her to where I live, to my house, when I found her she had one of my handkerchiefs on her neck, a white muslin handkerchief, and a white pair of cotton stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed the stockings before you took her home or after? - I observed the stockings as she was laying on the bed; I asked her about my spoons and buckles; she said she had done nothing with them, but gave them to another girl to pawn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make her any promise? - Something of that sort, the runner desired her to tell what she had done with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the runner tell her it would be better for her? - I never heard any thing of that.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know what you meant by something of that sort? - There were many words passed between them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any words that imported promise of favour? - No promise of favour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she mention the name of the other girl? - The name of Robinson, I think, and he said he should go and look after that other girl; I left it to the runner; he asked her where she had done the things? and she said she did not know, she had given them to another girl to pawn; then he asked what she had done with the other pair of buckles and silk handkerchief? she said she had pawned them in St. John-street, and we went to the pawnbroker's the same day, Higgs, in St. John-street; we took her there, and we found the silk handkerchief, and a small pair of child's buckles, and at Mr. Lowe's, the pawnbroker, in Clerkenwell-green, we found the spoons and the other pair of buckles; they are small womens buckles, my wife's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else? - A check apron at the pawnbroker's, in Barbican, Mr. Burrows, who delivered that up as soon as the runner went in.</p>
               <p>Q. These then were all the things you lost? - There was a black silk cloak that we found laying on a little table in the room, in which we took her from.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that these things were in your house at the time that the prisoner absconded? - I had pulled out the child's buckles out of her shoes when she went to bed on the Sunday night before, and I laid them on the top of the table, in the room where my wife sleeps, I have but one room; I cannot say that the other things were there on Sunday evening, I did not see them.</p>
               <p>Q. But do you know them to be your property? - The spoons are marked W. M. P. the child's buckles, one of them, has been soldered in two different places, the spoons were in the drawer, I had not seen them for three or four days.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the cloak? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The cotton stockings were they your own or your wife's? - My wife's. The silk handkerchief is like that on my neck, I had not bought it above a fortnight, and had never worn it. The apron is an old check apron.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor said, when he came into the room, that he had missed these things, and in short, I must have them, and if I would tell him where they were, he would not hurt me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never promised her any favour, nor heard the runner, nor any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300060"/>body else, I did say to her mother before I found her, that if I could find her, and get the things again, and find out where they were pawned, I would not trouble her any further about it.</p>
               <p>Q. But then she did not come to you voluntarily, but you found her out? - I found her out.</p>
               <p>Q. You found a pair of child's buckles and silk handkerchief at one Higgs's, in St. John-street; did she tell you they were at Higgs's? - She went along with me to Higgs's herself, and she went and took I and the runner to find the other girl.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The runner told me if I knew any thing of the things to tell him of it, for it had better be cleared up before I went to the justice.</p>

I told her to get up, and when she got up I searched her and found one duplicate about her; I asked her where the rest where? she said, she did not know.</p>
               <p>Q. What promise of favour had passed between you and her? - I never promised her any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. And did not the prosecutor say any thing to her? - Never. I asked him if he knew any thing that she had on? he said, he was not sure; and I took the woman to the wife's, and I took the handkerchief off her neck, the wife said, this is my handkerchief, the prisoner said not a word to it, I asked the woman if that was her cloak? - she said, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that cloak on her when she was laying on the bed? - No, it was laying on the table, about a yard from her, I told her to pull the stockings off and show the woman her stockings, and she did, and the woman said they were her stockings; she then said that she did not pawn the buckles and spoons, but Sal Robins had.

               <p>Q. What are you? - I goes out to work; and I got my pocket picked of my money and all my duplicates; I don't remember I gave her the money; I don't know what I lost, for somebody took me home and put me to bed, it was seven o'clock when I awoke.</p>

The prisoner was the person that robbed him, I did not see her take the goods, she came in for half a yard of callico, between five and six in this evening, and I was obliged to turn round to take the callico down from the shelf; when I turned round again I missed the goods, I missed two gowns, two pieces for gowns, it made ten yards of printed callico together.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these gowns laying? - On the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she near that counter? - She was.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you observed nothing about her at the time, that could lead you to suppose she took it? - No, I did not. When I cut off the quantity that she wanted, I objected to the shilling that she put down to pay for it, I objected it not being good, that I might look on the shelf to see if I had put it on the shelf before I challenged her with it; I looked on the shelf to see that I had not laid it off from the counter, that I might not be mistaken before I laid hold of her; I then went round and lifted up her cloak and found the two pieces of callico under her arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing about it? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300067"/>Q. What may be the value of this callico? - Thirty shillings, it cost Thirty-one shillings and six pence within six months, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept that piece separate from the rest? -  Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you produce it, were there any marks on it by which you know it to be your's? - There are private marks, one is marked B and S, and the other R and S. I had seen it on the counter not a quarter of an hour before. I can swear to it being ours.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body in the shop at this time besides yourself? - Nobody, but myself and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other witness? - None but the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was their nobody at all about your premises but yourself? - Nobody at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have got so far as this to say, on the Saturday I went to buy them things of this gentleman, some callico, and he told me it was a bad shilling, which I told him I took it at next door, I had an ounce of tea in my hand, he stood some time and said; it is a bad one and I will not take it; sir, says I, if you think it is a bad one I will go and change it, at last after a good deal he came round to me, and there was nothing on me, and he said he had missed some things the Wednesday before, and he kept me in his place I dare say for an hour and a half, and another man came down some time afterwards, and they sent for an officer, and none would come, I told them if they thought I was guilty I would deliver up my keys. About the evening there was a patrole the other side of the way, and he came in and they took me up to the office, I staid there very late that night, and on the Wednesday following I was brought up to have my hearing. I went home, and I gave my birds water, and I shut my shutters, and I returned to the office again by a quarter before four, I went in to have my hearing again, and the patrole said that I had several duplicates in my house, and if I would give them up I should be acquitted on Friday, and I was never carried to prison till one o'clock in the morning, on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. To Leadbetter. Was not she immediately committed? - The justice wished not to commit her till the week following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the justice that you took the property from under her cloak? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen her in your house before? - Yes, several times; she was not committed at the first hearing, she was kept in custody.</p>

               <p>I am a hair-dresser and perfumer; I cannot say that I know any thing of the loss; I saw this man frequently come of a morning, and I thought he was of a suspicious character. I mean the old man at the bar, Gummell; he used to come sauntering about the street of a morning. I live about three or four doors from Mr. Hodges, on the same side of the way; I told Mr. Hodges of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Don't you know that this man is a porter, and has frequent jobs that way? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wentworth. Do you know Napper? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you intimate with the family? do you know that he was intrusted with the shop? - I do not, I believe he was an apprentice; I only just as a neighbour gave the information to Mr. Hodges.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable. On Thursday the 5th of March, I took the prisoners, Napper and Gummell, into custody, and having a search warrant, I went and searched Gummell's house, with Mr. Hodges, No. 24, Gray's inn-lane, and found that property that Mr. Hodges said was his, that is all I know. I took eleven brooms, four pair of bellows, three wooden bowls, a sieve, a wooden measure, a clothes brush and a band brush, and a wooden chair that was put outside of the door for sale; one of the wooden bowls was found in the back kitchen, which Mr. Hodges can swear positively to, the other things were found about the shop, and in the window, I think some of the brooms were found below stairs, I think one or two were fetched up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You found these things disposed just as you would in any trades, man's shop? - Just as I told you.</p>
               <p>Q. This man keeps a shop of this sort, and buys and sells old clothes, and china? - Yes, and all sort of things.</p>
               <p>Q. One of these wooden bowls were found in the back kitchen? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. I fancy when you took Hodges first to Gummell's house, Hodges was not able to identify any thing? - He believed them to be his, but I was in a doubt whether I had a right to take them or no; then we took Gummell into custody, and I told Hodges we had better go to the magistrate, and have his advice, and then afterwards we went back and found a wooden bowl on the second search, and then he said he had not the least doubt about the things being his.</p>
               <p>Q. Gummell himself acted as a porter I believe? - I don't know, I have known them some years, but I did not know that he kept such a shop as that before.</p>
               <p>Court to Hodges. Napper was your apprentice? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him the whole care of your business, or give him authority to do any business without your knowledge? - By no means.</p>
               <p>Q. He acted as your apprentice? - As that only.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300070"/>Q. Did he at any time put any of these goods that were lost to any account? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever sell goods when you was out of the way? - He did, and if any thing was had away on credit, he set it down on a slate, and when I came home I booked it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you very much at home yourself? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. With regard to these goods that have been produced by the constable, look at them? - I can positively swear to this bowl, having once sold it, and being returned; this broom I can swear to, having a remarkable large knot in the wood; I know this hair broom by a creese which the hook has made, in putting it out at the door. A mark is cut out, or scraped out of all the goods. The bellows I know to be mine; the maker's mark and my mark is cut out.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the marks that are cut out, were all marked by you? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you swear to the whole of this property produced? -  To the best of my belief I can swear to every article.</p>
               <p>Q. It appears by the evidence, that you had some intimation of this; how soon did you charge Napper with the offence? - In an hour after.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing put on the slate in the course of that hour? - Nothing, I particularly asked him if he had taken any money? Not a halfpenny he said.</p>
               <p> Mr. Knowlys. I take it for granted that you was always as sure of the property as you are now? - I had not a doubt of it at the first moment, only the marks being erased, I thought fit to ask the magistrate whether I should bring them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never said to any body, that you could not swear to them? - I never said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say that you was sorry that you had gone so far, because you could not swear to them? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you generally sit up late? - That is irreverent to the subject, and I am not bound to answer all your questions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wentworth. How long has Napper been your apprentice? - Six years.</p>
               <p>Q. You have trusted him occasionally in the shop? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. How much has he took in a day? - Five or six shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Not a guinea? - He might.</p>
               <p>Q. Two guineas? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Napper. I was intrusted in the shop, and I always accounted to my master for what I took. My master has often returned from drinking, and taken the money, and then gone to the public house again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Gummell. I wish the jury to consider this gentleman's propriety in swearing to the things; when he first came to my house, he could not swear to any thing, he went to Bow-street without taking a single thing with him; as to his swearing to the things having the marks scratched out, they are things that I have bought at different sales, and if they were marked with twenty marks, I should scratch them out, to put my own mark on. This gentleman has been employed in the lottery line, taking insurances.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300071"/>Q. Do you know any thing of the bowl, in which the money was put? - Yes, further I have known him to have the care of that shop ten hours out of twelve for several days together; I have known him in the course of two or three hours to take gold.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not possible that he might have taken three or four guineas a day, and don't you believe that he seldom took less than a guinea? You never considered Mr. Hodges as very attentive to his shop? - No, it was left there to the lad.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Has Mr. Hodges said any thing respecting the property since the prisoner has been in custody? -  He has said that he has not lost the things that he supposed he might, and that he was very sorry for what he had done, and that he was persuaded to do it by his neighbours.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he said that once or more than once? - I heard him mention it once, but to the best of my knowledge, no more than once.</p>
               <p>Court. How long have you been his journeyman? - Ever since November.</p>
               <p>Q. You have assisted in the shop sometimes? - I have, and have till within these two or three days.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Napper called seven witnesses, and Gummell ten, who gave them good characters.</p>
               <p>Court to Hodges. You have heard what your journeyman has said, is it true? - On my oath I never said such a thing, in my life, to my knowledge.</p>

On twelfth Day at night, between seven and eight, I was coming along the court, there was a large confectioner's shop, and a very great light, and a great crowd of people, which I went to get by, quite close to the wall to avoid them, the prisoner stepped up to me, and with his left arm he struck me against the wall; I gave him a punch of the breast, and said, you villain, what do you mean? and the moment I struck him I turned myself, and I felt my watch drawed out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe particularly how your watch went from you? - I felt it draw out of my fob, my fob was very tight, that made me feel, I put my hand so, and said, my watch is gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body by you, except the prisoner? - Yes, there were three or four by me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any motion of the prisoner's other hand? - No farther than his pushing me against the wall, and I see him turn up his other hand under my coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing in his hand? - No. Two boys standing close by me, on my right hand side, when I said, my watch is gone, they said, I know him, that is the man that took your watch, and I turned in that way and manner,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300072"/>and followed the prisoner along the court, and the boys followed him; the boys pursued the prisoner, and I followed him to the end of the court and the next street beyond, which, I think, is Brewer-street; they followed him close up all the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner walk along the court? - He did, he never run. When I came into Brewer-street, I made a stop, and I thought myself perhaps there may be a gang of them collected, and so I went no further.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him afterwards? - Yes, I see him go out of the court, into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. After that where did you see him next? - I did not see him till I came to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q.What sort of a watch was your's? - It was a silver watch with double cases, a ribbon, and one key.</p>

               <p>Q. Tell the court and jury what you see that night? - The first that I saw of it; A gentlewoman went into the pastry cook's to buy a twelfth cake, and when she came out Loraine and three more of his companions, shoved her and put their hands into her pocket; and Mr. Salts stopped there and he went and shoved him, he gave him a shove so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it with his right or left arm? - I cannot recollect that, then one knocks his hat over his eyes and he takes his watch.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever lose sight of him from the time he committed the robbery to the time he was taken? - No, I was close to him, and I had seen him before he took the watch. He was about the place a good bit; I am sure he was the same person, and he is the same person that I saw at Bow-street, Jones was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was apprehended by the patrole did he say any thing? - The patrole said I had better go and seek for the gentleman; I left him when the patrole got him.</p>

               <p>Q. A good many people were between you and the prisoner at this time? - No, I was close to him, because when I saw what he had done to the lady I followed him close.</p>

               <p>I am a plater; I live in King-street, Drury-lane; I am a journeyman to Mr. Walker in Great Wild-street. On the 6th of January I was coming down Coventry-street, I heard the cry of stop<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300077"/>thief this prisoner at the bar was coming along side of me, walking, and I catched hold of him, a patrole came up directly, and laid hold of the other side, and Glover, the other witness, he laid hold of him likewise; the patrole came up behind me, and held the staff over my head, and told me to loose him; I told him I should not loose him; he asked me if I knew what that was? I told him I did not, nor did I care, and I kept him by the collar till I delivered him into the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend the examination before Mr. Bond the next day? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that young lad there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand something passed between Mr. Bond and the boy? - Justice Bond asked him what he saw concerning the business? he told him that the prisoner at the bar came behind the prosecutor, and knocked the hat over his eyes, and then with his right hand pulled she watch out of his pocket. Mr. Bond asked him what colour the watch was? he said he could not tell whether it was yellow, white or green, but that it was a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask him any questions about the person of the prisoner, or how he was dressed? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He asked him in regard to the prosecutor, whether he knew him.</p>
               <p>Court to Henry. Was this man there? - Yes, he came up in Piccadilly.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say, I leave it all to my counsel.</p>

Where was the watering house? - In Bishopsgate-street; I don't know who was in the coach, I was desired to go to the May Pole, East Smithfield; and when I came there, they made me go a little further, and I went to the right hand, about four doors beyond Nightingale-lane, and before I could get off my box, they were out of the coach, and the first that went off had a little bag under his arm, the last that got out paid me, I had no suspicion at all of the affair, and I did not observe the men.</p>

               <p>Q. You was a workman belonging to Mr. Gibson? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you so on the 12th of April, the day that the robbery was committed? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell the court and jury distinctly, and go slowly, what you know about this business? - I will, to the best of my endeavour. About three or four months ago I became acquainted with Wybrow, by using the Black Bull, Dunning's alley, in Bishopsgate street; I had not used the house, more than the space of a week, before Wybrow asked me to go up to the other end of the town, he knew some girls.</p>
               <p>Q. Confine yourself to this business of the 12th of April? - On the 12th of April, about seven o'clock or half after, I met May at the Black Bull, and we had some supper together, and we had two six-pennyworths of gin and water together; after that he asked me if I would go with him to the Queen's Head, in Paternoster-row, to a raffle there? I told him I would; he said he expected to meet Wybrow there; we went there, and had one pint of porter, and Wybrow did not come, I went out to seek for him, I went out to the Black Bull, and there I found him, I brought him to the Queen's Head.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you bring him? - About half after nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was May there when you came back? - He was. As we were coming along, we bought some bees and ham, and had it for supper; when we came there we joined the raffle, we staid there till half after twelve o'clock, and had a glass of rum, and went away, we went to Mr. Gibson's house, all three of us, with an intent to do the robbery; there were some pailisadoes before the house, and Wybrow shoved a good many times against the gate, but we could not open it, we then examined the bag we had with us, and we thought the bag was rather too small. May brought the bag, and a chissell; there being a great many people passing and repassing, and the bag was too small, we judged it expedient to go to the person that was to buy the property, to get a larger bag, we went to East Smithfield, to one Joel; Wybrow<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300081"/>threw up to the window, and Joel came down, and let us in, and we all three went up stairs, when he gave us a larger bag and a dark lanthorn. We then came away to Mr. Gibson's house again; (this was about half after one in the morning) then May got over the pallisadoes, and with the chissel he wrenched the boards down, that guarded the cellar window; he then came out, and Wybrow and I went in, I put the nine pieces of mode into the bag, and Wybrow held it; we then came out and pulled the outside shutter to, and handed the bag over to May, who was outside; after that Wybrow and I came out and we all three went together, and May carried the pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a bag was it? - A white canvas bag, it was properly of a canvas colour. We went as far as the corner of Catharine Wheel-alley, and then Wybrow went and fetched a coach, the coach came near to the end of the alley, and we all three went into the coach, May had the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect particularly where you got into the coach? - I cannot say, it was near the alley. As soon as we got in the waterman shut the door, and I gave the waterman a shilling myself, we told him to go to East Smithfield, but he set us down near the end of Nightingale-lane; the coachman then came down to open the door; I took the goods myself and went down an alley, a few doors from where the coach stopped, and went into a necessary, while Wybrow threw up to the window, and broke several panes of glass.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that for? - Joel told him before not to mind breaking two or three panes of glass, but to throw up hard, when he came. Joel came down and opened the door, then we all three went into the house, and went up one pair of stairs, and then we shut the door to, and he told us to be as quiet as we could, and they assisted me in cutting off the ends, and the marks off this silk; after that we agreed about the price for the goods, when we asked forty guineas for the goods; Joel he then bid twenty guineas; Wybrow he said he could not take less than twenty-four; (that was eight guineas a piece for the three) he said he would split the difference, and give us twenty one guineas, (that was seven guineas a piece, and he gives us one guinea on the table, and told us to call at two o'clock. We went down to Hornsey; I left them at eight o'clock and the next morning May gave me seven pounds; I went to the public house and sent for him.</p>
               <p>Q. You forgot to tell us what you gave the hackney coachman? - May said he gave him five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. This is the truth of the business, is it? - It is. On Monday Mr. Harper and Armstrong were at our house, and they said they had a suspicion of me, because I put the goods down the cellar on Saturday night, and they apprehended me on Monday night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I will not waste much time with such a witness as you, but I will ask you one or two questions. In the first place you say you supped at this place, at the Black Bull, and you went from there to the Queen's Head? - I did.</p>


               <p>Q. The landlord is full as honest as you are, I dare say; the landlord swears that May came in alone? - He might be in first.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you think may be the better character? - I have no doubt at all.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a deep laid plan. You knew very well that the goods were not to be removed of a Saturday night into the cellar? - I knew the goods were laid there every night.</p>
               <p>Q. Now hear, man, don't you know that you was not to have removed the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300082"/>goods there on Saturday night! - They have been put in the cellar before that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that there were orders that they should not be put there on Saturday? - No, I have not heard that.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not you put them there for the sake of robbing your your master? - To be sure it was done for that purpose. It is customary to lay them in the cellar every night.</p>
               <p>Q. Except Saturday night? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you lay them? - They were spread on both racks as usual.</p>
               <p>Q. You was called to an account about this before your master? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath was you not promised that your life should be saved if you could convict any other person that was with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore to save your life you must convict somebody, you accuse these men to save yourself? - I say the truth to save myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you come here and accuse these men, and believe that you shall save your life, by the accusation, and perhaps have some little reward besides? - I should expect it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I am done.</p>

On the 22d of March last, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner, in company with another man, came into my shop, I was at the farther end of my shop, at the parlour door, with my back towards the door, hearing a noise I turned about and saw the prisoner and another man, the prisoner immediately ran away, I followed him to the door and hallooed out stop thief! he ran a few paces from the door and threw down a piece of callico, which he had concealed; into the middle<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300083"/> of the street; I see him do it, he ran a little further and was stopped, I picked up the callico myself. I am certain I saw him drop it, I took him then before a magistrate who committed him. I never lost sight of him, except merely in the action of picking the callico up. I brought him back immediately, the other man went away, I past him in following this.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you the whole house as well as the shop? - Yes, the shop is a part of my dwelling house. The callico is here, my apprentice has it; I have kept it ever since myself.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed the over night? - About eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to see whether every thing was fast before you went to bed? - I believe it was fast, I was last up, and I always look round to see that every thing is fast.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do it that night? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you alarmed in the night? - I was alarmed in the morning about half past three, one of my lodgers that had occasion to get up and do his work, he went down stairs, and found the wash-house door open, I was alarmed by him, and got up immediately; and when I came down stairs I observed that the two doors were standing open, the door of the room, and the washhouse door.</p>
               <p>Q. Are either of these an outer door? - Yes, the wash-house door is an outer door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had that wash-house door been shut at night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it broke at all, or only standing open? - Only standing open, not broke.</p>
               <p>Q. From any thing that you see, could you tell how the door was opened? - No.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it loose money or in a bag? - It was in a bag, a kind of a little canvas bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get it again? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How high was you up in this house? - Up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it your house, or do you only lodge there? - It is my house, and I let lodgings.</p>
               <p>- HARPER sworn.</p>
               <p>On Monday morning last, the 28th of April, a young man came from the prosecutrix, to tell me that there had been a robbery done, and I went to the prosecutrix's house, there were several of her friends there, the house had been broke open, and as the lodgers being there, I begged it as a favour that they had better go up to the justice's together, I got them altogether at the justice's and the justice thought the most blame laid with this man, and he postponed it till the evening, in bringing the man out of the office, one of his brother workmen was there, and I heard the prisoner say to him, it was hid (he did not say what) between the rafters and the tiles.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you said to this man before he said that? - Nothing at all; when he told his brother workman that, I took that man to the justice, and told him that he should mention to the justice what that man said to him. However, I went with him to his workshop, and got on the top of this workshop, and went to the end, and the prisoner at the bar was there, in the workshop at the same time, and he said, you are too far to the left; and I looked about a little while, and then I came a little farther to the right, and then he said, now it is right over your head; I put my hand up there, and there I found this purse with this money, there is nine guineas, three half guineas, two half crown pieces and six shillings and eleven-pence. I came down from that place, came down to the workshop; the two witnesses that are here now, see me with the money, and I shew it before the prisoner's face; I shew the woman the money when he was examined before the justice. This shop is where the prisoner works, it is not in Mr. Shaw's house.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Shaw. The prisoner lodges with you? - He has, about eight months.</p>
               <p>Q. That morning that you was alarmed, was he in the house then? - Yes, he was in the house at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you said that you had not seen your money since, it turns out that you have seen your money since? - I see it at the second examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any part of the money or bag that you can swear to? - No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect enough to say whether you had so many guineas, so many half guineas, so many half crowns, and so many shillings? - I cannot be certain to the sum.</p>
               <p>Q. How was your bureau? - It was not broke at all, the lock seemed to me as if it had been put back with something, the lock is not broke.</p>
               <p>Harper. I asked him afterwards how he came to do such a thing to a poor widow woman? - he said he did not know how he did it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to Harper. Let us have a little of the truth of the matter, if we can. First of all when you went to the house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300085"/>the prisoner was at home at his master's? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him that you suspected him or some people in the house, and that he must go with you to the justice's? - I told him I would be glad if he would go to the justice's, along with the rest.</p>

               <p>Q. And he was so good, in the hearing of a public officer, to say that it was hid, and he was so good to say where it was hid? - He did indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. You had said nothing to the prisoner to induce him to confess? - No, God forbid.</p>
               <p>Q. You never say any thing of that sort; a shocking piece of business this? - I did, after I got the money.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say about saying it before? - I did not indeed, he had told me truth, or I had not found the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to recollect a little whether he did not say that this money was his own? - No, never, at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did not he at any time say that that money was his own? - Yes, after he was committed, after he had been to gaol, and come up again.</p>
               <p>Q. If it was his own he was the best person to tell where it was? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe this young man was a good deal alarmed at first, when you came to take him, and charge him with the offence? - I did not charge him with any offence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the young man, at the time you apprehended him, alarmed? - I did nothing to alarm him.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that he was not frightened? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you it was his own that day? - He told me after he was committed that it was his own.</p>
               <p>Q. Do recollect again, before you stand down, whether he did not say that it was his own before? - On my oath he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he appear in such a fright that he did not know what he said? - He might be for what I know, he looked very pale and comical.</p>

            , that is now in Court. The prisoner's wife informed me he was in London. The warrant was executed the 20th of March last; we found the things in the bed chamber, in a box the greatest part were, and some few of the articles in a closet, in the chamber. There are two striped cotton shirts, two remnants of Russia drab, two remnants of linen check, two Russia duck strocks, one pair of Russia duck trowsers, four pieces of Russia duck, in the shape of trowsers, three remnants of brown broad<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300087"/>woollen cloth, containing in the whole three yards and three quarters. This was all found in the box except the linen shirt which was in the closet in another box.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the boxes locked? - They were not.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose custody have they been ever since? - In the custody of Mr. Kershaw.</p>

               <p>Q. It was the 23d of November that he quitted Mr. Darby's service? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. All the time that he was in the service of Mr. Darby, there was no suspicions against him at all of any kind? - Not immediately on him, I don't know that there was.</p>
               <p>Q. None were found, nor you never heard of any till you went down to Gumersall; when you went there you found only his wife? - He was gone up to London.</p>
               <p>Q. You collected there that he had been in the woollen business before? - I had no such knowledge, I had heard that he had been in business, but I don't know what.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Have you known Mr. Woodhead long? - I knew him when he was a child.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been in business for himself? - He was apprentice to a woollen manufacturer.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he quitted Gumersall before he came down the second time? - It it about this time twelve months, he sold wool, but I never heard that he was in the manufactory.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know him when he lived at Blackburn? - I heard of his going there, but I don't know what business he was in there.</p>
               <p>Nett. This is a piece of Russia drab, of the same fabrick that we had during the summer that he lived with us.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there such fabrick to be found with other dealers? - O, yes! This is a Russia drab frock, it is an article that we supply, by contract, to government, for the navy; I know them by the measurement, we are confined to measurement in every part exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you sold any of them for common use? - To government only, we deliver them at somerset House; the sleeves are cut the cross way of the stuff, because in the very large quantity we cut it is a saving, which is not common, I do not perceive that they have any particular mark. Here is also a pair of Russia trowsers, which Mr. Darby furnishes, by contract, according to these dimensions, they are very uncommon dimensions in the trade; here is another remarkable thing, they have two seems in the legs, which seamen, in general object to, but we are obliged to make them so for government, and they have a mark on the waistband, which our people put the initials of their name on them, M. and made by Mrs. Moore.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you make them sort of trowsers for any body else? - Only for Mr. Darby. They have been worn, but they have been damped to get the mark out.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300088"/>Prisoner's Counsel. Is there any thing particular in the way of marking by you? - I can swear to my mark.</p>
               <p>Nott. Here is a remnant of bottle green cloth, a yard and a quarter, it has no particular mark on it, I only know that we had cloth of that colour and quality at the time he was in our service; the next is a remnant of one yard and three quarters of drab cloth, I know it by the colour which is a remarkable one, the quality, the width, and the selvage; it corresponds exactly with part of the cloth which is now unsold in Mr. Darby's possession, which cloth is now at hand. The selvage is taken off all along but by chance there is one thread left on. Here is another remnant under the same circumstances; here are four pair of trowsers cut but one made up, cut according to our contract; the next is the remnant of linen check, they are the width, the quality, and the pattern that we supply the Navy by contract.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you swear that Mr. Dalby has missed any property? - He has, I know it by taking stock, we miss a larger quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take stock before this loss? - Christmas, 1792.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you last take stock? - Mr. Darby took stock on receiving my letter, I was not present then, I came back the 22d of March, 1794. I examined the stock, I believe on Monday I found we were deficient in these cloths in particular. When I came back I afterwards went to the prisoner's lodgings in London.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you ascertain them to be the prisoner's lodgings? - He was taken at his lodgings on Saturday night, and the search was made on Monday, April 24th 1794.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find at his lodgings? - Six or seven new coats, the fifteen yards of cloth which is in the indictment, it was made into coats.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to ascertain that these coats were made of the cloth that belonged to Mr. Darby? - I do not mean to insist upon that point, in so altered a state.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. The last time the stock was taken was in Christmas, 1792, that was near six months before the prisoner came to live with Mr. Darby? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to these different articles, the cotton shirts they are of a very common sort of a pattern, and may be met with any where? - But it is very seldom that two slop sellers cut so near alike.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Darby is not the only Navy contractor? - Certainly he is, there can be but one at one time.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to the drab cloth, do you mean to say that that is the only piece of drab cloth that was ever made of that quality? Do they make only one piece of a sort and quality? - Very rare, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it not happen very often that the selvage is not torn all off? - It is rather remarkable.</p>
               <p>Q. It is so remarkable that you can venture to swear that these cloths were taken from Mr. Darby? - I can and do.</p>
               <p>Darby. I can swear to the trowsers, they are the contract sort, I never sold any in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner purchase any things of the kind of any of these things? - Never; I can swear to the drab cloth, the two drab frocks I believe are mine by the dimensions.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you had the contract? - I had it June, 1793, I gave it up then, and put in the lowest for it and got it again.</p>
               <p>Q. Of whom had you the character of this man? - Of one Mr. Bailey, he was in the cotton way.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Did not you understand this man before he came into your service was in business for himself? - <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300089"/>He told me that he kept a livery stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know when he left you, that he went down into Yorkshire in order to collect some debts? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. He lived with you six months? - He did.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you this contract before he went away? - I had.</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Naylor, I took a parcel of sugar from the prisoner; on the 5th of April, I took two pounds out of his pocket; he was Mr. Naylor's porter in the house. In going out of the warehouse on Saturday, the 5th of April, I brushed against the prisoner's coat, I thought it felt hard, I examined it, and took a parcel of sugar out.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300090"/>Q. By examining it you mean you felt in his pockets I suppose? - Certainly. I put the sugar in again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this coat on his back at the time? - No, it was hanging up, afterwards I called the men to receive their wages, and the prisoner came, and he put his coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it you perceived the coat with the sugar? - Past seven o'clock in the evening. When we got the men into that part of the warehouse where they are generally paid, I accosted the prisoner about having some sugar about him, more than he ought to have; I asked him if he had not a parcel about him, which was not his own? he turned out one pocket, there was a bit of bread in that; I asked him what there was in the other? and desired him to take it out; he turned out a parcel of sugar in a paper, and in a paper bag likewise, I had before seen it, it was opened then, and I saw it contained sugar; we asked him what he took the sugar for? and he -</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did not you tell him it would be better for him if he was to tell how he came to take it? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell him it would be better to confess? - No, I did not, I only asked him how he came to do it, and what was his motive? he muttered something, but I could not hear what he said exactly; the constable was sent for to take him to the Poultry Compter; the sugar I kept in my possession, it is impossible to swear to it, because there are sugars of all qualities, but we have sugar in the house exactly of that quality.</p>

               <p>Q. And so may a great many people? - There is no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Was these any thing in the bag that you could swear to? - No, I believe it was the very bag that he brought his victuals in the morning with.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of sugar was it? - East India raw sugar.</p>
               <p>Q. It was impossible for you to have missed such a quantity as two pounds? - It was, Mr. Naylor is a wholesale grocer.</p>

I said, yes; he said go and search him, if you can find any duplicates; I did, and could not find any; before he went to the justice he desired to speak to his wife, and I let him, and he asked her whether he knew any thing at all about her coming away from Mr. Nutting; says he, did I know any thing at all about your pledging of it? no, she said, he did not, and she was drunk, or she should not have done it. Then I took him into the magistrate, and the followed Mr. Nutting, and begged of him to be merciful, and her husband should pay for the watch as he could, if he would not put the law in force against her.</p>

I had one hundred and five bales of bacon come from Ireland, containing two hundred and ten hogs, they came about three or four weeks ago; but on the 18th of April my young man, my partner, came down to Holloway, where I live, and told me something, and I went to the public office, Worship-street, and I found some of my property there, bacon; when I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300094"/>came down there I saw one

               <p>Q. Where was it you saw Cooke? - In Golden-lane.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Did you afterwards take him before a magistrate? - I did, in consequence of information I received, there I apprehended Parker; I searched his house, I did not search his person; Parker was with me and the prosecutor; I went and took Parker into custody; and I secured him, and told him I was going to his premises; I secured him in Goswell-street, at Mr. Hawkes's, I told him he should go along with me, for I was going to search his premises; going along I told him I was going to search his premises for bacon; he said, that I might do with all his heart, for I should find no bacon there; I searched the first room, and found none; I then went down to the cellar, and there were a great number of butts, and I searched them all, and in a butt that stood up in a corner I found half of half a side of bacon; there were some boards over it, it was in a very dark part of the cellar, I took it out and brought it up stairs, and I said to his wife and parker, you have found yourselves deceived, for I have found some; Mr. Hawes was very angry with his wife, and the answer parker made was, don't be angry with her, for she knows nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the half guinea taken from him? - Yes, I did; he was searched in the public house adjoining the office, and half a guinea was taken from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him make any declaration previous to his being searched? - Yes, he said he had nothing but a few halfpence about him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the half guinea that was taken from him shewn to Cooke in the presence of parker? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. All the information you gained on this subject was from Cooke? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. He was charged with having stole the bacon? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Cooke throwed it on Parker? - No, first of all he said he had it from Ward.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he said he had it from Parker? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether any body lives in this house besides Parker? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that he occupies the whole house? - I don't know either one way or the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what business he is? - He is a butcher, I believe; I asked Parker's wife whose cellar it was? Parker was present; she said the cellar belonged to them.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you concerned in searching the house? - No. I searched Parker at the office, I asked him if he had got the half guinea about him that he had of Cooke for the bacon, the last night? he said he had got none, he had only three halfpence in his pocket; I searched his left hand breeches pocket, and found half a guinea in it, and nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew that half guinea to Cooke in the presence of the prisoner? - Yes, and I asked Cooke what sort of a half guinea it was before I shewed it him; he said it was a strait one; that was all he said. I shewed it him in the presence<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300096"/>of Mr. Parker, and he said he believed that to be the half guinea.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You asked Parker whether he had got half a guinea that he received of Cooke? - He said he had none that he had received of any body.</p>
               <p>Q. The half guinea you attempt to say that Cooke knew it, because it was a strait one; it would have been as likely for him to have known it if it had been a crooked one? - I don't know about that.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am in the tobacco line; I work for Mr. Bailey, in Redcross-street. About a fortnight after Christmas last, I met with Thomas Ward, in Redcross-street, he asked me to buy some bacon that he had; I asked him the price of it? he said, three shillings a stone; which I told him to bring me some of it at night, as it was Saturday night, and I would take some of him, which he brought me as much as came to sixteen shillings, at three shillings a stone; the next day I cut a bit off and put it in the pot to boil, and it was not good, rather damaged, and on Monday morning my wife went to Ward and Parker, to fetch the bacon back; they fetched the bacon back on the Monday night following; they neither of them had the money to return me back; when they took the bacon away they ordered me to come the next night.</p>
               <p>Q. About the 18th of April did you purchase any bacon of either of the prisoners? - On good Friday I purchased some of them. Ward came to me about two o'clock, and told me that this Parker had got some bacon to sell, which I asked him the price of it? and he said about a groat a pound; I told him that I would come up at night to the Two Brewers, Goswell-street; I went there; Ward came up with half an offall of pork, and some pork chops, Ward there got a fighting, and a man cut him over the head with a quart pot, which he went off then; and afterwards Parker came into the public house, and asked me if Ward had told me about the bacon which I said, yes; he asked me if he had told me the price? I told him he talked about a groat a pound for it; Parker made answer and said, it was worth six-pence halfpenny a pound, which I agreed to give him, provided the bacon was good; I gave him half a guinea in part of payment, and he fetched me the bacon, these two pieces; I asked him if he had weighed the bacon? he said, no.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he fetch the bacon to? - Into the street, near the Two Brewers, near his own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appoint to meet you in the street, in order to receive it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing about this half guinea that you should know it again? - I cannot swear to it, it is a very hard thing to swear to money. He told me that he would call on me the next day to weigh the bacon, and I was to pay him the odds at six-pence halfpenny per pound; and I was going home with it, and these gentlemen stopped me with it, Mr. Blackiter and three more that were along with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You was taken up unfortunately for this business at first? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You have the good luck to be a witness now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So of course, you save being tried yourself by giving your evidence? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The half guinea, you say, you don't know at all? - It is impossible for me to swear to money.</p>
               <p>Q. You dealt in bacon perhaps before? - Yes, at a former time, once</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen any Irish bacon before? - I am not a judge of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you attempt to swear to Irish bacon, Mr. Cooke? - I would not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300097"/>Q. You would not believe any body perhaps, if they were to swear to Irish bacon? - Why, no, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you admitted an evidence before the justice? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you come here in custody? - No, I came with the officer.</p>
               <p>Court to Blackiter. Produce these pieces you took from Cooke? - It is these two pieces, a middle piece and a hind piece.</p>
               <p>Ray. I found the fore quarter, they all together make up one stitch.</p>
               <p>Hawkes. These three pieces all belong to one side, and are my property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I would ask you whether you did not put a mark on this bacon before the magistrate? - I did, merely to compare the three pieces together, the first, second, and third.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the only judgment that you have about this bacon being your property, is the one that you have described coming over from Waterford, and being your cut? - It is so,</p>
               <p>Q. I will venture this question to you, whether you are not induced to swear to that property from the marks that you made before the magistrate, and not by the marks that you described to the jury before? - I swear to it by the long hocks, all others in Waterford cut the hocks short; there is not a side of bacon long hocks from Waterford but to me.</p>
               <p>Jury. Have you not sold some of this bacon since you have had it, to some shop keeper? - Several of the same sort.</p>
               <p>Q. then how can you take on yourself to swear that the long hocks are your property, and that you had not sold them? - As soon as ever this man was taken in custody the magistrate desired that we would see whether we had lost a side; we goes directly and undoes all the bales of bacon we have, which were one hundred and five bales; I was present, and when we came to count them, after we had undone them all, we found but two hundred and nine and a half side instead of two hundred and ten, and accounting for one hundred and sixteen, which we had sold.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You swear to this bacon by its being a long hock, and by the cut; supposing by chance, in this great town there should be found exactly of the same quality of bacon with a long hock, should you be able to swear to it then? - I can swear to this by the cut and long hock.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had seen this in the possession of other sellers of bacon you would not have known it to be your's? - I don't know that I should.</p>
               <p>Q. You speak something about the cut, what do you mean by that? - It is a different cut to any other man's in Waterford.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray have you not sold some of this bacon with long hock, and cut in that way? - I have sold one hundred and sixteen.</p>
               <p>Jury. Pray who might you have sold them sides to? - To different cheesemongers, it is not every cheesemonger that knows the Irish from the English, when it is cut in that way.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the reason of the long hock? - Because people have a preference for London bacon.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any difference in the price? - They will give a penny a stone more for the short hock than for the long hock, because of the weight of bone. These pieces make a whole side, except, I believe, the police officers had a bit to boil with some spinage.</p>
               <p>Ray. It is a mistake, the police officers having the bacon, it was Parker's wife had a piece boiling with some spinage.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Ward, called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Hawkes. Ward has lived with me five years, and I believe him to be a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300098"/>very honest man, but I cannot say so of Parker.</p>

On the 22d of March (Saturday) about eight in evening I was in our counting house, and I heard one of our shopmen say that a man had got a bag of sugar out of the shop; I immediately ran out, as did several of the servants, and came up with the man, whilst he was struggling with the shopman, who gave me the information; we secured him, and brought him to the shop again, it was the prisoner; we sent for an officer, and took him before a magistrate; when I laid hold of him the sugar was by him, he had put it down, it was close by the side of him when I first see it in the street, the sugar was in a bag, going into the country, with a direction it; I believe one of our porters took it up, and brought it back, and I have kept it separate from that time to this.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you last observed it before it was missing? - I did not particularly observe it before.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say certainly that such sugar was missing of your knowledge? - No, I cannot, no further than having seen it by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask Mr. Gilbert whether he saw me take the bag up, or whether he thinks that I was the person that took the bag up.</p>

               <p>I am a shopman to Messrs. Gilberts. The prisoner came into the shop about eight or nine o'clock, for a quarter of a pound of moist sugar, and a halfpenny-of allspice, which I served him, he gave me a shilling, and I gave him change, when I served him I expected he would go, but he seemed in no hurry; in that time there was four more young men much of the same appearance, came into the shop, and I had a suspicion of the prisoner, and when he went out I looked at the window, and I see him with this bag of sugar, in this manner, in his arms, and stooping, in going by the window, and when I looked through the window, he was looking me full in the face; I called immediately to our porter, and desired him to go after the man; he went out and did not go the right way, I ran out immediately after him, and got my eye on the prisoner, he got about thirty or forty yards, he had quitted the bag when I collared him; I did not lose sight of him after I got out, I don't know particularly what passed between him and myself at the moment, but I saw the bag at his feet, and his hand on it; he let the bag fall, I see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you see him go by the window had you missed any thing out of the shop? - No, but when I saw it, I knew it was a bag which had been laying in the shop among some other bags. I, by the assistance of Mr. Gilbert, brought him back to the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought back the sugar? - The porter, he is not here; the sugar was put in their shop again, there was a label on it, where it was going, into the country.</p>

               <p>I am an officer of the parish, I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner that stands at the bar; on a charge of felony, with stealing this sugar, I sealed the bag before ever I delivered the prisoner out of my hands, momentarily as soon as I quitted him at the magistrate's, I went back and sealed it at Mr. Gilbert's; it was in Mr. Gilbert's shop; I know nothing more than taking the man before the magistrate, and from thence he is come here, this is the self same sugar on which I put my seal.</p>
               <p>Court to Gilbert. Did you know there was such a parcel going into the country? - I knew there was such a parcel but I did not put it up. I saw a bag of sugar lay by the prisoner in the street, and I saw a parcel of sugar brought in, which I know to be ours, by the bag and direction, this is the same.</p>
               <p>Constable. I was obliged to call a coach to take him away, for fear of his being rescued.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I called at Mr. Gilbert's shop for a quarter of a pound of moist sugar, and a halfpennyworth of allspice, the mean time a person came in with an empty bottle for half a pint of raisin wine; he told him he could not serve less than a pint, and he went out of the shop, and there were three or four more about the shop door, it was Saturday night, and when I went out, he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300100"/>given me change for a shilling, and I had the change in one hand, and the sugar and allspice in the other, when I came out I saw a man run by with the sugar, and he put it down, and when I came up to it, I put my hand down to see what it was, and they came and took me, Mr. Gilbert's son said in the shop that they thought I was not the person.</p>

               <p>Q. Had your watch any seals to it? - Yes, a metal seal, metal cases, a plush steel chain, the seal was red, with hope engraved on it.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen this watch? - When I came out of my friend's house I looked to see what it was o'clock, and I put it in my left handwaistcoat pocket. I discovered it again, so far again as to know where it was pawned, by distributing hand-bills in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen that woman before? - Not before that night.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be in her company? - I suppose about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Where there any lamps thereabouts? - We were between two lamps talking in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that that is the woman? - I am very certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see her again after that night? - It was about twelve o'clock, after I had been to Mr. Edwards's, the pawnbroker, I saw her coming from a passage by the door of Mr. Edwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the passage where you had been with her? - No, it was in Portpool-lane, they call it Tash-court.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened? - I told her she had stole my watch; she denied it, she said she had never seen me before in her life.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300101"/>Q. Did you take her into custody at that time? - Yes, and she was taken to the police office in Hatton-garden, and committed.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Where did you keep this watch? - In my waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you always keep it in your waistcoat pocket? - No, not always.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was in your waistcoat that very night? - I am very certain that after I had looked at it about one o'clock, I put it in my waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not put it in your waistcoat pocket in the house, but after you left the house? - It was after I left the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you saw the woman? - It was before I saw the woman, I mean to swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to swear before that when you saw your watch the last time, it was in the house where you left your friends? - It might be in the door; It was about the time I was leaving the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Then before that it was in your fob? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to put it into your waistcoat pocket? - I used to do it at night because I thought it was much faster of a night, because I buttoned my coat over it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not perceive it go from you at any time? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not the least idea of its going? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure that this account is the true account of it? - It is as exactly as I can remember.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it ever dropped out of your breeches pocket? - I am very certain that when I went into her company I had the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that it could not drop out of your breeches pocket? - I cannot take on myself to swear it could not drop out of my breeches pocket, it could not drop out of my waistcoat pocket unless it had been taken.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alby. You are an excise officer? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You had no intention of prosecuting this man, for this casual affray, unless it had been advised to you by other persons? - The matter was reported to the Board, and they ordered the prosecution.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you on the oath you have taken, was Jones in the house at the time that you came into the house? - I did not see him first, I saw his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you tell the wife you came about? - I told her I had a warrant to search her house for illegal goods.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you was not permitted to come into the house at the time? - Yes, the door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. What is become of this warrant? - It is mislaid.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not above half an hour subsequent to your entering into the house, that the prisoner at the bar entered into the house? - No, it was not so much.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it twenty-nine minutes do you think? - No, it was not so much, it was a very little time, I was in and turned round, and the man of the house had come into the house at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. The wife and you entered into a scuffle was not this woman with child? - I believe she was, she has had a child since.</p>
               <p>Q. And you sir, as a man pretend on your oath to say that she was able to assault you? - I did not raise my hand against her, because I knew she was pregnant.</p>
               <p>Q. You have always sworn positively<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300104"/>that the prisoner at the bar and his wife assaulted you.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not this unfortunate woman knocked to the ground in the scuffle? - No such thing by me, I did not see her at all on the ground.</p>

               <p>I am in the excise.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on the 14th of September go with the last witness, Mr. Edwards, to the house of the prisoner? - Yes, I went with Mr. Edwards, my brother officer, to search this house; and we went into the house, and the warrant was presented, at first I did not see Jones, but the wife only, I told her that I had a warrant to search her house for smuggled goods; she told us we were very welcome to search, that we might take her word that she had none; we proceeded to search; Mr. Edwards gave me the warrant, he had the warrant at that time, and went into an inner room, he said it was his duty to search, and went in in order to search, a little time after Mr. Edwards calls to me, and says, Mr. Price, come here, there is something here, I went into that inner room, as I was going in, Jones's wife took Mr. Edwards by his two ears, in her two hands, she said d-n your eyes Edwards, you are at some mischief always; Jones by this time was in that room, he came from without, he was not in the house before; he was by this time in the room where Edwards, and his wife were; Jones was sitting by a bench, by the bed side, and I took him by the hand, and told him he must get from there, that I might see what was under the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do it with any violence? - No; then he struck me till I was reeling down, with his fist, Mr. Edwards by that time came between us; by that time I stooped down under the bed, in order to see a bag of tobacco there; by that time the wife came up to try to take the bag from me as much as she could, she broke the bag, and strewed it about the floor.</p>
               <p>A. How much do you think there was in the bag? - The quantity I took from there, was seventeen pounds, if not more.</p>
               <p>Q. After she strewed the tobacco on the floor, what more was done? - We went into a scuffle then, and she took me by the collar, and there were people came in to our assistance, and I was determined to lose my life or keep the tobacco.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know this man before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know you and Edwards were excise officers? - Yes, perfectly well; we had made seizures there before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby. She told you at first that you was welcome to search? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took up this tobacco, the tobacco bag was broke, and then you got into a scuffle? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby addressed the Jury on the part of the defendant; to which Mr. Garrow replied.</p>
               <p>Jury to Edwards. Was the warrant produced to the man or woman? - To both the man and woman, the other officer told them the particulars of it.</p>

               <p>I live in Cleveland-street, Frtzroy-square; I lost my handkerchief going to Cannon row, the foot of Westminster-bridge; I had been in the City, and as I was going by Westminster-bridge I missed my handkerchief, nearly, out of my pocket; at a considerable distance, from Temple-bar, I missed it partly out, but not quite, then I put it in, going on, partly to Charing Cross, I missed it partly out again; I put it in again; very near to Cannon-row, I observed the prisoners behind me, almost to Cannon row, in <placeName id="t17940430-63-crimeloc333">Cannon-row</placeName>

               <p>Q. Were they together when you observed them behind you? - Yes, I did not turn about to look particularly at them, but I observed them just behind, just at the end of Cannon-row, I had an occasion for my handkerchief, and I put my hand into my pocket to feel for it, and the prisoners immediately ran forwards before me, which gave me every reason to suspect they had got it, one of them. I run after one of them, and called, stop thief! they went towards the foot of the bridge, from Cannon-row; I laid hold of one of them, the tall one, which is Sullivan, and I told him that either him or the other had got my handkerchief; which he strongly denied, and he pulled a considerable quantity of handkerchief out of his pocket, but I perceived there were neither of them mine; I then took off his hat, and found the handkerchief concealed in the crown of his hat; the other was secured by the people about, at the time Sullivan was stopped; he did not run, he would have run if he had not been secured. From thence they were taken to the justice and committed, I have the handkerchief, there is a black stain nearly the middle, and several holes and white spots; the letters of my name are on it, in the midle, but I did not know it at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure they were both together when you looked behind? - Yes, and they both ran forward together.</p>
               <p>Q. How near did you take him after you pursued? - He did not run fifty yards, and the other ran with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen any thing before the prisoners ran by you? - Not any thing.</p>

No, says he; thank you, sir, says I, I am very much obliged to you; with that I walked on, and the man cried out stop thief! and stopped me close by the watermen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Pasmore. I was going over Westminster Bridge, and I met this young man, and he asked me where Captain Ogleton lived? I told him I did not know, and when I came to the watermen I was stopped; I did not see what it was for.</p>

On the 21st of March last, I was going through Longacre with the horse and cart of Mr. Maskill's; I was driving the said horse, I was sitting inside of the cart, it is an open cart, I sat upon some callicoes, and there were thirty pieces of Irish in a wrapper, in the hind part of the cart, and luckily I happened to turn round to look at the goods, it was about half past seven in the evening; looking about I see the man, the prisoner, handing to the other, on the opposite side of the flag stones, a piece of cloth, I mean the flags on the other side of the street to where my cart was, and he was clapping it inside of his great coat, the receiver of the cloth was doing this; so that I should not perceive them if I happened to turn round; with that I hallooed out stop thief! my cart was going on when I saw this; accordingly he was pursued, they both ran when I hallooed out stop thief!</p>
               <p>Q. Did they both run the same way? - Yes, as far as I could perceive; I staid by the horse and cart for fear I might lose the remainder of the goods, and it would have been an unlucky circumstance for me if the prisoner had not been taken, there is such a scandalous character of the porters; I staid by the cart till the man was brought back, which was in a short space of time.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was brought back, the man that took it or the man that received it? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought him back? - Rowan. When the man was brought back I got the goods into my custody as soon as possible again, I think Crooks produced it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that piece of cloth that was produced to you, one that had been taken out of your cart? - That I cannot say; it was missed, but I cannot swear to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any marks on the cloth? - Yes, it is numbered, the man of the shop is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is the man they brought back? - The prisoner at the bar; the porter is here that put in the thirty pieces, and when I got home there was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300108"/>only twenty-seven, there is two pieces quite gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go directly home? - No, I went to Bow-street, and left the horse and cart at one of our customer's door, in Bow-street; Mr. Davis and one of his men sat in the cart during the time that I transacted business at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose property was this? - I believe my master was answerable for it while it was in my custody, he had it to calender for Messrs. Turner and Whiteside's, in Fleet-street; I had taken up all the thirty pieces at Messrs. Turners and Whiteside's.</p>

               <p>Q. Who put them in the cart? - Messrs Turner and Whiteside's porter, and I had seen thirty pieces counted.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had it been put into your cart before you got to Long-acre? - I believe between two and three hours; I had been up as far as Oxford-street, Cavendish-square, and stopped to deliver out goods and take in goods.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any body drop that piece of cloth? - I did not, I was not nigh enough to see them drop it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the man that was stopped? - I don't know only by seeing him at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether he was or was not one of the men that you saw running? - I cannot tell, no otherwise than by their stopping him, and his being in custody when I came up; I gave the cloth to the porter, and we all followed the cart together to Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any with him? - No, he was running very hard; I ran into the road, and immediately laid hold of him; he came from the pavement into the middle of the road.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might this be from the top of the street which leads into Longacre? - About twenty yards; I saw the cloth underneath his coat, before he dropped it, he had it so when I first saw him, he dropped it the instant I laid hold of him; I saw it was a bundle, but I could not tell what it was till it was brought up by Mr. Crooks. He instantly gave me a violent blow on the side of the head, which made me stagger, but having hold of his coat I recovered myself, and took hold of his collar, and called for assistance, he had gone three or four yards further then in this time, from where he quitted the cloth; at that instant Mr. Watts came up to me, and we secured him; Crook brought the cloth immediately as the prisoner was secured; when I laid hold of him there was no other person in the street.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any body else in the street at that time? - No, I saw the prisoner drop the cloth, I and Rowan secured him, and we conducted him to Long-acre where the cart was, and from there to the office in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. In the scuffle had you gone from the place, where the cloth had dropped. at all? - The prisoner had by some means or other got a little beyond the cloth.</p>

               <p>Oneal. This is the piece of cloth given me, and I have had it in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that to be one of the pieces put into the wrapper yourself? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the wrapper as soon as the man ran away? - No, I could not; when the cloth was brought back I examined it then, and I can safely say that I lost no goods after that, because I watched the hind part of my cart very particularly.</p>
               <p>Fellows. This is marked No. 11, like the mark that I made, but I cannot swear to it, and that is cloth of the same kind and quality.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say; I should be very glad to go and serve his Majesty, if he would permit me. I have no witnesses here; I am a very poor man.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the young one's name? - Eversfield. He made use of a great many bad words; they said they would cut me open, and he gave me a violent blow across my nose and my eye; the justice saw what a terrible black eye I had; and then he ran after the other; I then got up and went and looked after the watchman, and could not find him, and a gentleman went to seek for him, and he came and found me; I went away with the watchman to look for my pattens, and went with him to his watchbox, and then while I was there this gentleman called out for assistance; then the prisoner was taken; the patrole went to him, and the gentleman came back holding the prisoner, the young man Eversfield; I said that is the person that has left me, that used me so, says I, the other is a thicker set person. He was secured.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the magistrate the next morning? - No, I did not go till the third hearing, Mr. Burrell appeared the first and second hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Raine after that night? - I did not see him till I came to the justice; when I was there the justice had him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they produce any thing to you at the justice's? - The things that are set down; the officer has them.</p>

On the 5th of March, I was officer of the night, I was on my duty at ten o'clock; Eversfield was locked up in the Cage, and the officer was gone to look after Raine; at eleven o'clock when I was going to take Eversfield to the watch-house, some of his friends said, it was a pity I did not go and seek after Raine, and I did go and take him.</p>

               <p>Q. Dark? - Yes, moon light.</p>
               <p>Q. It was so dark you could not discern a person? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw the prisoners, were they not on the opposite side of the road? - No, they were on this side.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you or did you not speak to Eversfield before he spoke<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300111"/>to you? - No, they came speaking to me, and then they sidled me into the field, as I before mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hesitate much to go into the field, Mrs. Carter? - They sidled me there, and then tripped me down.</p>
               <p>Q. They talked with you very kindly, and then you withdrew with them into a field? - No, they sidled me into the field, and tripped me down.</p>
               <p>Q. There was some conversation passed between you? - Not very much.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they keep speaking to you? - Not two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q.Pray, ma'am, how do you get your living? what employment have you? - I have lived on a great many good things, since my husband died; I live by needle work when I can get it to do, and I had been to a shop to ask for work then.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never offered to make this business up with the prisoners? - They came to me to make it up several times; I did not go to them, Raine's wife came to me and made me go to Newgate to see Raine; they were always coming to me, and would not be easy without I would go.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you or have you not, at any time, now speak the truth, heard any thing like a reward, some money to be had provided the prisoners were convicted? - I never heard any thing about any money.</p>

               <p>I am a workman with Mr. Wheeler, I was not at home when he was robbed; in returning home I detected the prisoner coming out of the shop; the shop is in Holt-court, I stopped her and asked her what she had got there? she said it was nothing of mine; I desired her to come back, I examined her apron, and found the mattrasses concealed in her apron.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know in what manner the house was broke open; do you know any thing about that? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the things? - They were delivered to the constable, as soon as Mr. Wheeler came home.</p>

               <p>Hill. I understand them to be the property of Captain Dundas, sent in to be made, under the care of Mr. Wheeler.</p>
               <p>Court to Wheeler. If goods are sent to be made, you are answerable for them? - Most undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Hill. I know them from this circumstance, when they were made up for Captain Dundas, there was one wrong marked.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen them about the premises that day? - I had, they were laying in the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no question; only be as merciful as you can. I never was brought before a bar, or a justice in the world before; I have no friend alive, they have been all dead long since.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it linen? - It was. In pursuing him he turned up an alley, to go into Paternoster-row, and I called out stop thief! and there was a boy that tripped him up in the kennel as he run; as the prisoner fell, I saw the handkerchief drop out of his hand, and I picked it up, and gave it to the constable.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable of Dowgate Ward. On the 17th of February, a little before nine at night, the prisoner at the bar passed me in Thames-street, near by Mr. Calvert's brewhouse, between Mr. Rutt's warehouse, and London Bridge, with a bag; I asked him what he had got there? he rather hesitated, and said, it was not nine o'clock; I asked him what he had got there? he said he had some bark, or drugs, he did not give me a clear answer; I asked him where he had brought it from? he said he had brought it from Rutland-place; I asked him where Rutland-place was, and asked him where he was going to take it to? he said he was going to take it into the Borough; I asked him what weight it was? he said he did not know; I asked him if he had got a bill of parcels? he said he believed it was in the bag, along with the other goods; I desired him to put it down, he did; I untied the bag, and I did not find any bill of parcels at all; there was a bundle that had some bark in it, that I thought was very slovenly tied, that gave me more suspicion, it was tied up nearly the same as it is now; says I, I shall be glad if you will go with me back to where you have brought it from.</p>
               <p>Q. What else was there besides bark in that bag? - Nothing but elecampane roots and the bark; I told him I was afraid he did not come honesty by it; he said he had; he said he would rather I would go with him where he brought it from; I told him as it was very little way where he said he brought it from, he had better go back, I took him back, he went very quietly along with me; he walked along till we came to the Fortune of War, just by Paul's Wharf; says I, this is not the place where you said you brought it from.</p>
               <p>Q. It was in the road there? - Yes, it is all the straight road; he said there was a man in there that saw a man give him a shilling in the morning, to carry it into the Borough; I told him that I did not choose to go with him into a public house; I brought him back till I came to our own ward, when I took him to the Compter; after I had been to the Fortune of War, I brought him back to London Bridge again, in order to carry him to the Compter. I asked him why he told me false? he told me that a man brought it in a boat to Paul's-stairs, in the morning, and left it at the public house all day, and he was there in the morning, and he gave him a shilling to carry it at night into the Borough; to the best of my knowledge, he said the man's name was Fox; I asked him what Fox was? he said he believed he was a smuggler, or a lumper, or something of that kind. I put him in the Compter, and he was up the next day before my Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to proceed on to the regular place? - He said that the Fortune of War was the place where he had it from.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did not he tell you that he was going into the Borough, to carry it to a person of the name of Fox? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now he offered at the Fortune of War, as you was going by, to go in and shew you a person who had given him a shilling to carry it; why did not you go into the public house? - I did not choose to go into the public house amongst strangers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you that he lived in Kutland-place? - He told me he lived somewhere near there; I asked him what? and he said he was a <rs id="t17940430-69-deflabel369" type="occupation">porter</rs>

               <p>Q. You went along, my friend stated it that he told you there was a hill of parcels, but he only said he believed there was a bill of parcels; on searching it was found he was mistaken, there was none? - It was exactly so.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300117"/>Q. He offered to take it to this very place where the man was to be found of whom he received this parcel? - Yes, he wanted me to go there, but I refused.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Pray when was the last weight of that cask taken? - The first or second of January, when we took stock, the prisoner assisted in weighing it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what was the weight at any intermediate time, between the 1st of January and the 18th of January, you cannot say? - I cannot, the cask was opened about the beginning of February, to take a sample out of it, I did not see it opened, but I went up and took a sample out myself. A few days after that there was two hundred weight took out, and put into a drying stove; there was none of it sold; and on the 18th of February we weighed the cask, and what was taken out to put in the drying stove, and the deficiency was a hundred and a quarter, and if we allow for the drying of the two hundred, it makes about a hundred and four or five pounds short.</p>
               <p>Q. What does that weigh now produced? - I was told half a hundred and sixteen pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you learn that the prisoner was taken up? - Not till the next morning, the evening before that I see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of this parcel of goods, or how he came by them? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing passed about those goods, in the morning, or that evening? - In the morning I heard say he was taken up, and I went to see him in the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of this transaction? - He was called out to carry a load about half after eight at night, the night before I visited him in the morning; a man called out, and said, he wanted a porter; the prisoner went out of doors to the man, and came in again.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the man ask for a porter for? - For to carry a load, I did not go out to see.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the prisoner answered the call? - He did; when he came in again, he asked me if I would go to his club with him? I told him I would; he went out again to the man that asked for a porter, and they both went together, then I went on to the club afterwards, and I did not see him any more till the morning; I never see the parcel at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When the prisoner came in again, he asked if you would go home to the club, and you told him yes; why did not you go with him? - Because he told me to go on, and he would come after me, but he did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Pray how came it you did not tell this story before the Lord Mayor, when the prisoner was there? - I never was called.</p>

               <p>On the 24th of February, Mr. Oliver of Holborn, sent two pieces of printed furniture, to my shop, to be glazed; they went home by two o'clock, and one of them was missing, on enquiring I could not find it in the shop; it contained twenty-eight yards; I missed it out of my shop, Blue Boar-yard; I had seen it about twelve o'clock in the morning, of the 24th; I missed it about half after one, I recovered it about three I suppose, in a manger, in an old stable, in Blue Boar yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the stable belong to you? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you recover it by any person leading you there, or by accident? - By making a search for it.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300119"/>Q. Did the prisoner work with you? - He did, before that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had he quitted your service? - I suppose three weeks or a month.

The prisoner came forward into the stable, about seven o'clock, and took it out, and I see him with it under his arm.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did he stay in the stable? - I suppose about half a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him bring out any thing when he came from the stable? - I see him bring out this piece of callico, and the man laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that a piece of callico was found in the stable originally, and the man who put it there, you knew nothing at all about; therefore any body else might have put it there? - The prisoner went exactly to the place.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you do with the duplicates? - I went to two different pawnbrokers, one was in Princes-street; I found an handkerchief, in Princes-street, and I found a pocket handkerchief at the other pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lodged in this house? - About five months.</p>

On the 17th of March last, I lost a coat, a shirt, and a table cloth; I lost them from my house on Sunday night, I put them in my box, and the next day they were gone; the prisoner she lived next room to me. I found the property at a pawnbroker's, the 18th of March, and that led me to suspect the prisoner. The things are here.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were these things kept? - in the front parlour that Mr. Gerot occupies. I stopped him in the entry myself, and he was detained till the constable came, I called the postman to my assistance, who was going by.</p>

               <p>Q. How did the prisoner behave? - He said nothing to me; I said hold of him by the collar, and he begged my pardon, and that was all; he did not abuse me, he laid the things down on the mat in the entry of the passage. I am positive to the great coat, because it was in the parlour but a few minutes before, with the caddy; I see him delivered into the constable's hands, by the postman.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see them after you missed them? - Not till they took the prisoner. I went to the bottom of the yard, and I saw him with the things under his arm, going across the field from our yard, I hallooed out to him, you have got my shirts, and some people ran after him, and he was taken; I lost sight of him before he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was in your sight, had he the things or had he parted with them? - He had not parted with them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wentworth. You say you hung them out about seven in the morning, and you missed them about nine; then they must be taken in that interval of time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your yard adjoins to the field? - It does.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that your yard is considerably above that field? - No, the bank of the hedge is higher than the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the yard is on a level with the side of the bank? - Not quite, it is almost as high.</p>
               <p>Q. Still the yard is higher than the field? - No, not higher, the yard is rather the lowest</p>
               <p>Q. There is a path way over that field? - No, only a gap, which people make where the hedge is broke down.</p>
               <p>Q. People do pass and repass, otherwise how could he have seen your linen? This was the 6th of March, Friday, I think windy weather? - It might have been windy.</p>
               <p>Q. I mean at the time that you lost these handkerchiefs? - It might have been so.</p>


               <p>Q. And these things might have blown off this hedge? - I cannot say but they might.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever, at any time missed any things that you hung on this hedge? - No, not before.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to say that these things were hung on a hedge or on a line? - On a line.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wentworth. Might not these things, by any possibility, be blown out of this yard, by the wind? - They might.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Leech? He acted as headborough when this man was taken, I believe? - He is out of his office now.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a man of the name of Craig? - He was the first man that was after the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any difference between Craig and the prisoner? - No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Court. When the prisoner was going across the field, what pace was he going, was he walking or running? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wentworth. You lost sight of the prisoner before he was taken? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you saw nothing of the prisoner, you saw a man passing with some linen under his arm? - No more.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to say that you don't know that was the man that you saw with the linen on him? - That<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300124"/>was the man that had the linen on him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wentworth. What distance might he be from you? - About half way across the field.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see his face when he was walking across the field? - Yes, I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Who brought the linen out of the hedge? - I know not, the linen was given to me at the time; I have got the linen; the woman has kept it till now, I gave it to the woman, I brought the linen here from Mill Hill.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutrix. Did you give the man the linen that was brought back to you? - Not till he came on last Thursday, I did then. It is what I took in to wash; there is W.B. on two of the shirts, and Jones on the other; the cotton handkerchief is marked L. I have no doubt of the things.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pawnbroker, I live with Mr. Parker, in Princes-street; I know the prisoner, I see him on the 6th of March, in the evening, he came with thirteen silver tea spoons, for which he wanted six and thirty shillings. I asked him who they belonged to? I am not sure whether he said his name was Miller, or whether he came from Mr. Miller, I told him that I thought Mr. Miller was not in a situation to part with tea spoons, and should send there, and I sent to Mr. Miller; when Mr. Miller came he said that the tea spoons had been offered to him, and he refused to buy them; when Mr. Miller came he said they were his own, and he bought them at Brighton, and that he was not accustomed with pledging, and he had been with Mr. Mortimer, an auctioneer, who had sold a number of things for him, and Mr. Mortimer told him he might pledge them in what name he liked; he said he had exchanged the spoons at Brighton for a watch; I told him he might come honesty by them for what I knew, but I should detain the spoons, till I had further proof, how he came by them; and he said he would bring Mr. Mortimer, the auctioneer, to prove the spoons were come honestly by; about ten o'clock in the evening he came back again, and said that Mr. Mortimer was busy, and could not come, and he would come the next day; he came the next day, and he said, Mr. Mortimer was still busy, and that I might deliver the spoons; the day after he got an affidavit at Bow-street, that the spoons were his own, and brought a very good tradesman with him, and we delivered up the spoons to him, and have never seen them since.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300126"/>Q. Do you know what is become of these spoons? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see them after they came out of Mr. Parker's? - Never.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Don't you know that these spoons, or some spoons, were got in exchange for a watch at Brighton? - He told me so, I heard him say so two months before this happened.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see your watch again? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any body shew you your watch again? - Yes, the officer (Dawson) I know it by some pale gold, and some yellow gold.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you by the appearance of the watch and chain, safely swear it to be your's? - If I was to see it I should; the constable has taken care of it. The prisoner lodged in the house at the time I missed it; when I missed it I did ask every body in the house immediately, I asked the prisoner in a minute, he said he did not know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity was he? - He was lodging in the house till he could get a place; he was in the house when I came into the house, and I was not willing to turn him away; he had no fixed bed, sometimes he slept in one bed, and sometimes in another.</p>

I said no, I had had part of a pint of beer, and would not have any more.</p>

               <p>I am a sail-maker, I saw the man take the things, on Tuesday, in the afternoon, the 25th of February, I was in my warehouse, attending my people, which were opening a sail, which having laid by some while in the house was dusty; I ordered them to throw my window open, soon after which I heard a carriage draw up the street, and pass by the warehouse, I thought it had stopped at my door, and might be goods for myself, it drew my attention to the window; soon after I saw the prisoner at the bar come to the off side of the cart, went to the off wheel, put his hand through the spokes of it, and with one hand took hold of a sack which lay in the cart, and in the other hand having a knife, he was cutting the tyer, or whatever it consisted of; in the act of doing this, he cast his eyes up to my warehouse window, which enabled me to take a full view of his countenance; in the moment it struck me, it was the carman robbing his master; I thought I would go and see who the cart belonged to, and drop them a line of their servant's conduct, but to my amaze, in about ten minutes time, I saw another person come up with a whip in his hand. I believe, I fogot to tell you, that after he had cut the sack, he took a sack out of that sack, and put it under his arm, and walked down the street; I observed there were letters on that sack, but what I could not tell, the man when he came up with the whip in his hand, had two other men with him; I called to him, and asked him if he was the carman belonging to the cart? he said yes; I said, my friend, your cart has been robbed; the man looked up with amaze at me, and he and one of the men that were with him jumped up into the cart, shoot the sacks that remained out of that sack that the prisoner cut open, and one of them said, d-n it be has got the money; I told him that I had taken very particular notice of the man that committed the robbery, that he was a tall man, very aukwardly made. I know him to be the prisoner, I can swear it; they got him and brought him to my house the next morning, and I told them that he was the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me cut the sack? - I saw him cut the tyer, a string of some sort, but what I cannot tell, off that sack, that he took the sack out of.</p>

               <p>I am a constable, I have got a corn sack and fifteen shillingsworth of halfpence; I took the prisoner and he took me to his lodgings, and he went and leaned over a bedstead with the bed on, and there he took these halfpence down, the bag was on another bed, and he took that from under two mens heads, in the same room, that laid on the bed, he gave me the bag and the halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there were other men in that room? - There were.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this lodging? - On Salt-Petersbank.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go there? - About nine o'clock, the man came to me, I suppose it was between eleven and twelve, by the time I got there, it was the 26th of February.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a lodging house, or what place was it? - It was a very infamous place indeed, it appeared so to me, one man was sadly cut indeed that lay in bed, the prisoner told me, at the time he gave up the sack, that he wanted the sack, and had he known the halfpence had been in it he would not have taken it at all; I have kept these things till now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You say how that there were two men in bed, it was a man and his wife? - They were both without caps.</p>
               <p>Court to Jessop. Was the halfpence in that sack? - Yes, four papers of five shillingsworth done up. This is the sack that was in the other, and lost out of the cart, I cannot speak about the papers of halfpence, but I know there were four.</p>
               <p>STANBRIDGE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a corn chandler, I delivered the halfpence to this carman myself, four crown papers bound up in another paper.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the carman to do with them? - To take them to his master, Mr. Houlditch, the prosecutor, he is in the corn way, we deal with him for corn, the money was in part of payment, for his servant to give to his master.</p>
               <p>Q. You pay in halfpence sometimes? - I did on this occasion, and had done before; when the papers were first brought to our house they appeared to be the same, but it is impossible to know them now, because they are all to pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did the sack belong to? - It was given as one of Mr. Houlditch's, but it was given in mistake, but I did not know that till my husband came home, but a young girl that lives with me can swear to the sack, because she took particular notice of a mark on it.</p>
               <p>sworn.</p>
               <p>I live with Mrs. Stanbridge, that sack was delivered to the carman, the money was in it. I know it is the same by a red mark that is on it, a red star, I remarked it very particularly when it stood in our shop with some barley in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming down the Wharf with a waggon load of coals, and this cart stood right facing Bushell's-rents, and the carman said to me, put that cart up, that I may come bye, and my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300130"/>breeches being torn I took this sack out to mend them.</p>

               <p>Q.Whereabouts was this silk in your shop? - It lay in the window for shew. When he was secured we carried him up the street, towards the office in Bow-street, in passing our own door I took the silk into our own house; I have kept the silk ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark at this time? - It was light enough to match colours for I had been matching some at the door just before.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish his features? - His features I could; I did not see his face till I took him with the silk.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing after you had taken him and he had escaped out of your hands, was there so much light that you should have known him? - O! yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it? - I apprehended it was about half afterseven, as near as I can calculate.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was at home in your house besides yourself? - Mrs. Noble and the shopman; I left the prisoner with Mr. Lany while I went into the house and I came out again and went to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the worth of this piece of silk? - Six or seven pounds; it is evident by the dirt it got in the street; it has my private shop mark on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the pane of glass out? - It did not all fall out, it is a very large square, this silk laid directly behind that square.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think from the situation in which it lay, it was taken out from that window which was broke? - Clearly so.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is it a private mark in figures or in characters? - It is in characters, the mark of the shop is Cumberland; it is in my own hand writing.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Was not the window broke before? - There was a little crack in the square, but no part of the glass out.</p>
               <p>Court. But suppose that little crack had been loose, would it have let out such a piece of silk of that size? - No.</p>

               <p>I am a perfumer in Tavistock-street, I was standing at my own door, the same side of the way as the prosecutor, at seven doors from him; I heard the noise of some glass breaking, and I turned my head down that way and immediately heard the cry of stop thief! I perceived that man running down the middle of the street towards me, the nearer he came towards me the further I advanced in the middle of the street, in order to seize him as he came by me, but before I laid hold of him a man ran from the opposite side against him and turned him about, which turned his face to my face, I immediately seized him by his collar, and the other person seized him by the hair, he had a piece of silk hanging over his shoulder some part before and some behind, and while I held him by the collar somebody cried out, saying, he is getting something out of his pocket, I looked at his pocket, and I see his hand at his left hand pocket, out of which he produced a knife and swore that he would stab any one, if we would not let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the knife in his hand, or did he take it out of his pocket? - The prisoner took it out of his pocket, it was partly open in his pocket, only having but one hand at liberty, he could not get it quite open; I secured his arm above his elbow, in order to prevent his stabbing any person that was before him; while I held him by the elbow, a neighbour that is here forced the knife from his hand, by this time there was a number of people collected, and I left him in the hands of Mr. Lany, and Mr. Noble that was robbed, and went into my own shop, having no person in it but myself. I am very certain the prisoner is the man.</p>

               <p>Delafontaine. I had orders to go to different people, inconsequenceof that, the girl told me that Fishbourn was her father, but he denied that, I requested to know what duplicates Fishbourn had got about him? I found about two hundred, but he informed me of this girl and told me that he was not her father.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I lived with Mr. Thomas about six weeks, when I lived there this young woman came to me and asked me if I could let her have any money? I said I could not; she asked me if I had any thing that I could make any money of? I told her no; and then she asked me if I had got any thing that I could pawn for her, I told her no; and if I had I did not know how I should get it out again; and she urged me for something to make up two shillings to get out something that she had pawned of a young man's, this was Monday, and she got this silk handkerchief of me on Wednesday, and promised to get it out again on Saturday. My master and mistress and I, had a few words, and I slipt over to this girl's house and asked her if she could not get that handkerchief out that she had to pawn? she said she could not get it me; I asked her what it was in for? she said three shillings, and I offered her part of the money to get the handkerchief out if she would but replace it, she said she had none but she would see what she could do, she did not get it out.</p>

               <p>I am a carpenter, I work for Mr. Thorowgood; on the 27th of March I was going down to my dinner about a quarter after twelve, and I saw this young man come out with a saw in his arm, then he looked about and see no one passing, and he put it under his coat; I observed him come out of the house, opposite to where I was at work, in Tabernacle-walk; he came out of the back window, it is an unfinished house not inhabited at all, he went out of the gate into Tabernacle-walk; and walked on to Tabernacle-square, and I followed him into an acquaintance's house of mine, his name is Hazeman, that house is in Chapel-street, I asked my acquaintance if he saw any one run past? he said yes; says he, what do you want with him? I said he had stole some saws; and he opened the door, he was in the passage, and put him out, and he had the saw with him under his coat, this is it, I had never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man that got out of the window? - I am.</p>
               <p>Plaine. This is my saw, I know it by a tooth broke out, and the maker's name. I am sure it was left in the building.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went in there, and I saw this saw lay in the back window, and I took it out, I was going to work, and I had no saw just then. I have no friend at all in London.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the deaf and dumb man before? - I never saw him before, I cannot find out where he came from, nor what his name is; he told me that the man had been robbed by some women in <placeName id="t17940430-85-crimeloc456">New Gravel-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q.Who pointed out the house? - The deaf and dumb man, and the lad. Then the lad he described one of the prisoners particularly; I then desired him to go with the old man again up into the same house we had come from and I would enquire into the business; in about two minutes afterwards the two prisoners; Burn and Kent, and another that was discharged before the magistrate, all came up to the house, and I then took them into custody; the man, as soon as I took them to the Virginia Planter, he began to rave and point at them; and the lad likewise pointed to the prisoner Kent, that she was the person that hauled the bag off the man's shoulder; in a few minutes afterwards the prisoner Mead, came to see them, I asked her what she did there? and the deaf and dumb man immediately ran to her, she said to me immediately, I did not rob him, it was Burn and Kent that robbed him, I will shew you where the bag was. Burn and Kent were there at the time secure. I went down and found the bag on the landing place of the one pair of stairs in the same house where he pointed out, not in any room; as soon as he saw the bag, he ran to it directly, and there was a particular coat that he held up, and he made signs that it was his own. I searched all the prisoners and found nothing on them.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he express himself? - He pointed to Kent that she took something off his back, and he made motion that he lost money; we shewed him a shilling, and he marked 33, and pointed to a yellow button. We shewed him half a guinea, and he put his finger on it, and held up one; and he made motion that he lost a quantity of halfpence; he cannot read nor write.</p>

               <p>Q. What did she come behind him? - Yes. Then she went up stairs, then when she got up stairs, I heard the cry out of murder! and there were two or three women standing at the door, and persuaded somebody to go up for the woman was being murdered; then presently Ann Kent came down stairs, and said, if the man came down he would bang her again, and then Kent ran away, then the man came down, and he made motions that the woman had been taking his money; then I was desired by a woman to go and ask for Mr. Cooke, at the Virginia Planter.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure, in the first place, that it was Ann Kent, that did this? - I am; the other women were standing at the door.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go afterwards where the bag was found? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. When she came down, where was the bag? - I don't know, she swore he had been banging her, and he would bang her again if he came down, and then she ran away.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon did he follow her down stairs? - Close immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. What sign did he make use when he came down? - He made signs in his pocket, that they had been robbing him of his money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she run away when she came down stairs? - When she found the people getting about the door, she ran down the lane directly.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did she return again? - I did not see her again till the officer brought her to the Virginia Planter.</p>

I went out to buy something for my supper at the tripe shop, as I came back I met this woman Burn, and we went up stairs, and this man followed us with the bag on his back, and he went up stairs with us, and he made motion that he wanted something to drink, and this woman went out for a pot of beer, and while she was gone he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300141"/>wanted to be very rude to me, and because I did not like it, he began beating me, and dragged me by the hair of my head; so this woman and a good man, ran up and got me down stairs, and the other woman came down also, and we went over the way to get something to drink because I was so saint, and as we came back Mr. Cooke took hold of this woman and me, and said we had robbed the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Mead. I was looking out of my own window, Good Friday, between seven and eight, and I heard the cry of murder, and I went up to see what was the matter, and after that I went up to these women to know if they wanted any thing, and Mr. Cooke took me into custody immediately.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Burn. This man met this woman and me, and we went up together, and I went out for a pot of beer, and before I could come back again they were crying out murder! and there was a great concourse of people.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. On the 16th of February, which was Sunday morning, about eight o'clock, I saw Prosser and another man walking on Thames street, towards London bridge, Prosser had this bundle under his arm; they went out of Thames-street into <placeName id="t17940430-86-crimeloc461">Little Bush-lane</placeName>

When I got into the warehouse Prosser said, here is another of us coming, I asked him what was that he brought? he answered me, why, if it was mine, I might have it or take it; I asked him again, what it was? he said, it is ginger; he broke the paper, made a hole in the paper bag, and said, you see it is ginger; I asked him what he was going to do with it? I am not positive to the answer he made me directly at that time; but he said he was going to carry it to one Mr. Hanson's, Maid-lane, in the Borough. Mr. Jones said, Mr. Wainwright it is only fourteen pounds weight of ginger, it is not worth notice, and not of any account. Prosser said, he had brought it from St. Saviour's church yard; I told him I thought it very odd he should bring it from St. Saviour's church yard and have it to carry again to Maid-lane, almost there again. I told him I was not satisfied with that, I should take him into custody; I said Mr. Jones do you know the man? he said he knew him very well; says I, do you think he has come honestly by it? he said he did not doubt but what he had, I told him I was rather dubious of the matter, I should take him into custody; why then, says he, I have brought it from Smithfield, and I was to deliver it last night, and I am going to deliver it this morning, he said he was a <rs id="t17940430-86-deflabel462" type="occupation">porter</rs>

Mr. Jones, I had not him in custody at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Does this Mr. Jones deal in ginger? - I don't know, he <rs id="t17940430-86-deflabel463" type="occupation">deals in indigo and drugs</rs>

               <p>Wainwrigt. Here is a note that Prosser produced before my Lord Mayor, where he bought it; before my Lord Mayor on Monday, he said he had a friend in the country that had sent him a letter out of the country, with an order to buy him fourteen pounds weight of ginger, and that he bought that fourteen pounds of ginger, and that he called on Mr. Jones, Sunday morning, to know whether he could get it ground, and he said he bought it of Mr. Hamson, Maid-lane; I asked him what he gave for it? be said he gave fourteen shillings for it, he said he had not got the receipt, but he believed he could find it; my Lord put him back till Tuesday, and ordered me to get Hamson, to know whether he had bought it of him or no, and Mr. Hamson said he had not.</p>

               <p>I am watchman of Broad-street Ward; on the 20th of February, in the morning, hearing that many houses in the court had been robbed of their knockers and bells, I shut my box up to see if I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300145"/>could see any lurking people about; about a quarter before seven, I saw the two prisoners at the bar lurking; I went past them, and went up into a corner, Burkitt he went on, and Brame stopped, I hid myself in a corner, and see them return to Mr. Porter's door, and then he wrung the knocker off, he broke it short; I followed him and I sprung the rattle, and called out, stop thief! he then dropped that knocker and two more, and Mr. Sparkes, that is here, stopped him in Trogmorton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him? - Only at the turn of the corner, I see him drop all the knockers, I am certain he is the man; Burkitt after he turned the corner, I never saw any more after that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Burkitt, in conversation with Brame at the time? - He was with him in the court, but not by him when he wrung the knocker off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear them converse together? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took up these knockers? - this man took up one, and I took up one; the officer has got them.</p>
               <p>- SPARKES sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 20th of of February I saw the prisoner running at the same time as Mr. Buck speaks of, I saw him running in Throgmorton-street very speedily towards me, Brame was the man. When I seized hold of him, he dropped the knocker down by the side of him; I saw him, I picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any more about him? - No, he had a screw-driver, a small rule, and some little pieces of brass.</p>
               <p>Court to Buck. I thought you said he dropped three? - He dropped one first, and one after, and one by Mr. Sparkes's feet, he dropped three in all; all the three were delivered to the officer, I picked up that that belonged to Mr. Porter.</p>
               <p>Sparkes. The knocker I picked up was carried to the officer, and delivered to the officer in the watch-house.</p>

The prosecutor said that he would give me something to go along with him, and there was a light a coming and be said, O! here is the watchman, no says I, it cannot be the watchman, it is not eight o'clock, and who should it be but the lamplighter, after that he dropped something, and I said hold, that is something dropped from me; no said he it is from me, and then I asked him to go to a public house; and he said no, we will go in here, and it was a little watch-house, and he put me in there, and there they searched me and found the half crown.</p>

               <p>Q. The whole of this you say is not the hand writing of the prisoner? - Yes, I verily believe it is. In his parlour there was a large glass bottle of brandy which is in court, in a cupboard in that parlour was another such bottle of rum which we forgot to bring away, in the kitchen below there was a bottle of brandy, five bottles of rum, and one hullage bottle of tent wine, all the rest of the goods were in the cellar; these things have been in the constable's care ever since. The prisoner had a hearing before the Lord Mayor on the 8th.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you identify this property? - I cannot positively swear; I have been robbed of a deal of property for more than a twelvemonth past, it is the nature of this trade that hardly any one thing can be identified, I have no doubt but the property is mine, but it is best to be cautious, I have tried the goods in regard to the strength and they are exactly of the same strength; I am sorry I do not stand upon better ground. I have been robbed seriously indeed.</p>

I told him I had, he said he was recommended to me from Mr. Price, over the way, to sell a parcel of juniper berries, which he had bought of a captain of a ship; I looked at them, and see they were not fit for the scale, they might do for distillers; I asked him what quantity he had? he said he had twenty hundred weight, at eleven and six-pence per hundred; he called a few days afterwards, and said, that he had got some more from the same captain, and on the same recommendation we took them also, and continued that from different periods, till I took thirty-seven hundred weight, from the 3d of December, to the middle of January; we weighed them, and they weighed on an average, an hundred weight in a bag, one with another.</p>

               <p>I am a carpenter.</p>
               <p>Q. To Taplin. Where did you get that sack? - From under the stairs in a closet, between the hours of five and six, the time that the prisoners were in the house; I went in company with Griffiths the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any thing said by the prisoners when you took that? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any appearance of business carried on in the house of Carter, is there any shop or any thing? - No.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I cannot say that that sack is mine.</p>
               <p>Kirk. I have got some sacks four of which Mr. Cunden gave to me about the beginning of March, I had no other sacks in my house but these four.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did Mr. Cunden tell you how long he had had these sacks? They were very old sacks, were they not? - They were old rubbishing sacks laying about the floor.</p>
               <p>Cunden. The four bags that I gave to Kirk were what I received of the prisoner, I cannot speak to the mark of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Whether these had been in your warehouse before or after Christmas you cannot tell? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Here is a bag I have no doubt belonging to me because I marked it myself, I marked it with an F in black ink, here are six bags in all.</p>
               <p>Kirk. I brought two bags besides the four that Mr. Cunden gave me in all they make six, this one marked F was given me by Mr. Cunden.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Have you ever sold any with that mark? - I don't think that I have, I had a great quantity of things to bring from on board of a ship, and I got up all the bags I could, and I remember this one going on board a ship to be filled, and if it did not come back Carter must have stole it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Cunden. You never took any particular notice of the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. That bag if it ever was in your warehouse probably came there before Christmas? - It might, I cannot say whether it came before or after.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. You say you believed that that bag has been out of your possession? - It certainly has been out of my possession or else Mr. Cunden would not have had it.</p>
               <p>Q.Certainly it also has been out of your possession in the course of your trade? - Never till it went out at that time on board of ship.</p>
               <p>Q. That letter F may of course be found on many bags? - It may, but I marked this myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300152"/>Q. You yourself parted with a number of bags marked with F. - We sent a number of bags on board, and amongst which was this one marked F. I sent, I suppose, about a hundred on ship board; as to the juniper berries, it would be difficult for any man to swear to them.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact you have never found any berries at Mr. Cunden's? - I have never been at Mr. Cunden's, but Mr. Cunden brought a sample before my Lord Mayor, that I should think were of the same quality of mine, being damaged berries, some oil having got among them.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not taken stock from Christmas 1793? - No, not from Christmas 1792, and I had not taken stock in March, if it had not been for this information.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. How long had Cooke been in your service? - About six or seven months. Carter has never been my servant, I don't know that he ever had access to them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was informed Mr. Fonblanque, that you would with to make up your damage, and therefore you employed a parcel of soldiers, in order to weigh your stock; while these soldiers were weighing your stock, you was up stairs in the counting house; they called the weights, and as they called the weights, you put them down on a bit of paper; you took the weights from their assertion, and never saw the weights they alledged to you, and soldiers are men that know a little about half hundred weights, as many that are here know about pounds.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I saw the greatest part weighed myself if not the whole, and I have made on allowance of almost twenty hundred weigh.</p>

The handkerchief was in my right coat pocket, and the money was in my waistcoat pocket. I lost a knife, but I did not know that till she was taken into custody, and it was found on her; she was searched in a public-house in Church-lane, at the watch-house door in St. John's, Wapping; she dropped the silk handkerchief, and returned me part of my money. I see her drop it, I picked it up; I have had the handkerchief in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she not to be searched at the watch-house? - The watch-house door was not open, and an officer coming by, I gave her in charge of an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. You see the knife taken from her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a clasp knife? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you ever find your money again? - I had four farthings and a penny returned; the silver I never got, we did not find it on her.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you sure that you had two shillings in your waistcoat pocket? - I believe I had more, but that I am positive.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to ask him whether he did not pull me down an alley first, and give me sixpence farthing in money and the knife along with the halfpence? - It is not true, she dragged me off the pavement with her hands about my waist.</p>

               <p>I am an headborough; on Monday the 2d of April I was coming down East Smithfield, and I saw the prosecutor and prisoner struggling together; I told him if he was robbed that I was an officer, and I would take and secure the prisoner for him; says he, you take hold on one arm, and I will take hold of the other; accordingly we took her into a public-house and searched her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he charge her with stealing? - He did not say any thing then, but I am robbed! I am robbed! in searching her I found these two knives, one of which the prosecutor claimed immediately as he saw it, and I found a few halfpence; she had no silver about her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was standing at this here alley last Monday night, and it mizzled with rain a little, and this gentleman came and pushed quite against me, and I said, I with you would give me something to drink, and he gave me some halfpence, and then I was going to the public-house, and he pulled me down the alley, and in pulling me down the alley he tore all my bed gown, and then he took hold of my wrist, and charged me to this gentleman, and this gentleman searched me in the ale house, nigh the watch-house; the next morning he had his own silk handkerchief in his pocket, and shewed it to the justice, and he went to give it to the constable, and Mr. Staples said, no, keep it yourself; and he told the justice that he found seven shillings and sixpence in his outside coat pocket next morning.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was you in liquor at all? - I had been drinking a little, but I was not any ways forward.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him when he did this? - No, I did not; he was a <rs id="t17940430-96-deflabel527" type="occupation">carter</rs>

               <p>Q. How far was this, where he threw it down, from your master's place? - Pretty nigh an hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was not put there for any purpose that related to his master? - It was not for my master's use, I am certain of that.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300154"/>Q.When did you first tell the prisoner of it? - Not till he was taken the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not stop him at the time? Why was not he taken up before? did he continue in the service? - I waited to see who took the hay, I stopped there and let him go for his load of turnips; I stopped there from about a quarter before four, till a quarter past six in the morning, and I kept walking backwards and forwards to see whether any body would come, and I happened to see one of my fellow servants, and I called him, and he came; and just before we got within two or three yards of the door, I saw this Shaw come and take this truss of hay in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Shaw put it in this place? - I did not see him take it into the stable; at the time I called my fellow servant, the man came out and it was gone; and I went and I said to Mr. Shaw, that truss of hay that you have got here on your premises, belongs to Mr. Kendall. He did not say a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever go on his premises, and see whether the hay was there? - I never see the hay since; the prisoner was taken up the next morning after.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you charge the prisoner with it? - No, I did not; my master charged him with it; he did not say one word, but only asked what is the matter? what have I done?</p>
               <p>Q. To Kendall. I suppose you have never seen this hay since? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what quantity of hay was in your stable, so that you could say what was missing? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was up that morning just as the clock went two; I went down to my stable about ten minutes after two, and fed my horses the same as usual; and I never went out of the yard till the clock struck four, then I was getting my horses out as the clock struck, and I went out for my load of turnips as usual.</p>
               <p>Kendall. He has lived with me as a weekly servant near three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you impute any thing to him before this? - I should not have kept him if I had not thought he had been very honest; every man I keep I hope they are honest till I find them otherwise.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Jury to Morley. Had there been any dispute between you and the prisoner? - Always very good friends.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever lent Mr. Shaw any hay, or Mr. Shaw lent your master any? - No, never.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner take it? - I did not; I missed the pot, I went into the tap room, and missed the pot;the prisoner had been in the house several times that day, for a penny worth of beer at a time; she had used the house for a long time, and a number of other houses that way. I then followed out the prisoner, who went up a passage. I called the gentleman who is here as a witness, I desired him to follow her, that I might not be at the back of him, and she might not see me, I supposed she had got a quart pot of mine, she went up to the top<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300155"/>of the alley and he followed her and went up to her, and took this quart from her arm, which she had covered over with her cloak.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not go out of the alley.</p>
               <p>Green. This is the pot, my name is on it, and as soon as I took the pot I put a private mark on it, and it has never been used since, nor been out of my possession. When first I caught hold of her I asked her where she was going? and what she had got? she said she had had nothing; I then turned back her cloak, and found the pot. When she went before the magistrate she said she was going to the workhouse that evening, and that she took it for the purpose of boiling water in it; but when I caught hold of her, she said she was going to bring it back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going to the workhouse that very night; I lived thirty years with one woman in the same place, and that woman died about a fortnight before this happened to me. I never was in gaol in the whole course of my life; one and another asked me to drink as I was going to the workhouse that night, and I was really over come with strong beer, and I did not know what I did.</p>

The very Saturday evening that these things were found, I received five shillings from my mistress and three shillings I had in my pocket, I purposed going after them, and I had not power when I was asked for them on Saturday night; on Sunday I was asked for them again, and was abused very much, I could not get them, I then went out to see if I could redeem the things, but I could not.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker, I live in Bridge's-street, Covent-garden. I took in these things of the prisoner at the bar, in December and January; the 27th of January she pawned a curtain for two shillings; on the 27th of December two curtains for five shillings; on the 28th of December, a counterpane for eight shillings; on the 24th of December, two curtains, for three shillings; the 1st of January, a bolster for half a crown; the 3d of January, a candlestick and flat iron for fifteen-pence; the 4th of January, a pillow for a shilling; on the 16th of January, a kettle for a shilling; the 18th of January, a blanket for three shillings; the 21st of January, a blanket for eighteen-pence; the 25th of January, a looking glass for a shilling; the 1st of February, a flat iron for eighteen-pence. I knew the woman before, she said, that she was married; I asked her whether they were her own property? she said they were, I have known her above a year and a half, and I knew her always by the name of Watson, these things are all in the name of Watson.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I believe them to be mine, the fire shovel my husband had a mouth put to it a day or two before, and the looking glass has a crack at the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. When was she apprehended? - The 24th or 26th of January.</p>

The week after I went to Mr. Higginson's house, my husband was taken ill, with on inflammation in his bowels, and he made me pawn these things, to get through his illness, he told me that he had some money coming to him in King Edward-street, Wapping, and he should get the things out again, and he went out to get this money, and he was pressed, and he has sent me a letter that he was on board the Minerva. I have no friend within four hundred and forty miles from here.</p>

On Friday, being Good Friday, the prosecutor came to me again, and asked if Solomon or Sullivan had left a bundle or parcel in my bar, I told him no, there is nothing left there; he says it is very odd what they have done with it, he said down by Whitechapel they took it from me; this past till Saturday when

After that I was informed that Nowland had taken Askins. I went to different shops to see if I could find the cloth about Bishopsgate-street, but I could not find any thing of it, but in the course of two or three days afterwards, I was told that it was pawned at a shop in Holborn, I went there and asked for a piece of cloth pawned for five shillings; which the pawnbroker produced.</p>

               <p>Q. To Webb. Where they drunk or sober when they went out of your house? - I cannot say, I drawed them one pot of beer while I was there, what my servants drawed them after, I was out, I cannot tell.

On the 12th of March about a quarter before six in the evening, I and another young man was in the warehouse, we perceived a man lurking about the street and looking through the window two or three times; as there had been several robberies committed in that neighbourhood about that time of the evening, we suspected that he had a design, in consequence of that suspicion I went into a place myself on a stair case, which is situated exactly opposite the door, so likewife the other man secreted himself in another part of the warehouse, and we staid there a little time, when the prisoner at the bar came into the passage; he opened the door, which occasioned the bell ringing, (I am certain it was him) hearing of the bell he withdrew for the space of a minute or two, and finding that nobody attended to the bell he came forward again in a minute or two, and the door being before opened, he went to the counter, where there stood some goods, and took hold of a piece of linen, and was in the act of taking it away, when Mr. Walton, who is the other witness, came forward, the prisoner, when he heard him coming forward, he turned back and placed the piece of goods in the same place from where he took it; I saw him coming forward also, and pursued him; he had taken them up from the counter, and turned his back on the counter going off; the goods were in his hand, going out with it, and in going out Mr. Walton had come to the door and rather jammed to the door, which detained him. but having gone so far that we could not stop him there, I opened the door and rushed on them, and took him about two paces from the threshold in the street; I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Davis lives there, it is his house? - It is. This is the piece of goods which he took up, and which I marked before the alderman.</p>
               <p>Q.Was Mr. Davis at home at the time? - He was up stairs; he don't know any thing of the transaction.</p>

             came on the 2d of March to Mrs. Tyson's, where I lodged then, and she asked for a lodging; and we told her there was not room enough, and she said, sooner than go to a strange place she would sit up all night; I did not like to let her sit up all night, I let her sleep in my place, and I went and sleeped along with Mrs. Taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before she had lodged there? - About a week before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her your bed? - Yes, for that night. Then she got up about half after six the next morning, and took the things away with her, a gown of mine, and eighteen-pence out of my pocket, and a pair of worsted stockings, and half a white handkerchief, and a patten; she left the other patten, because it was broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these things the over night? - I hung my gown across the chair by the fire, before I went to bed; I laid my stockings on the gown; I laid my pocket in the chair, at the foot of the bed; and my landlady found my pocket on the stairs in the same house.</p>
               <p>Q.Then she got up before you was awake? - Yes, before I was awake. We found some of my things on her, I was present, the next day when she was apprehended; we found a pair of stockings of mine, and the patten she had on her foot.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the stockings? - I had mended them a good deal, I know my own work.</p>

She said if I could not make enough of her gown I was welcome to eighteen-pence more, which was in her pocket. The coloured apron Mrs. Tyson gave me to wear while I washed my own; the skirt and stockings I put on by mistake. On Monday morning I was coming to Mrs. Tyson's to ask pardon for what I had done.</p>
