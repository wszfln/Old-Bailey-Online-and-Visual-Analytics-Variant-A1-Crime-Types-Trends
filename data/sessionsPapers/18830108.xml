I am inspector of police, employed at the East and West India Dock Company's premises, at the dock-house, Billiter Street—the defendant was the principal foreman in the ivory and tortoiseshell department, and had been in the Company's service 29 years—being in that position, he was not liable to be searched on leaving the premises—labourers in the Company's employ are searched—on Saturday afternoon, 28th October, about 6 o'clock, I went to the ivory store-room after all the men had left, and in a box there I found nine pieces of tortoiseshell—the tortoiseshell room is on the first floor—these pieces had no business to be in the ivory room—both rooms were under the prisoner's charge—I left the nine pieces there—on Monday afternoon, 30th, I watched at the gate for the prisoner about half-past 4—I saw him come towards me from a van in the yard with a note—he was about 20 yards from the ivory room—it was the duty of the van-man to give me a note—the prisoner took the note from the carman—he said "May I leave this in the box?"—I said "Yes"—I took the note from him, and then he went back again and tried a look that he had already tried before, which he had no occasion to do, to see if it was locked—then he came back and attempted to pass me to go into the street—I touched him on the shoulder, and said "I want to speak to you, Mr. Smith, in the office"—as we went into the office his coat was buttoned up—he pulled his two coats open and his waistcoat, and there I saw two pieces of tortoiseshell in front of him, with his braces over the ends of them—he attempted to to throw them down, but before he could do that I took them out of his hand—these are the two pieces (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I took him into the inner room, and said "Have you any more"—he said "No, that is all I have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188301080004"/>
               <p>got"—I left him in charge of one of the constables, and went back to the box in the ivory room on the ground floor, where I had seen the nine pieces on the Saturday—I found that two particular pieces which I had looked at were gone from the nine, and the two pieces under his coat were the two—these are the other seven (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the two are quite different pieces—after that I returned to the place where I had left the prisoner, and gave him into custody—after he was taken to the station and charged I went with a City officer, Wright, to the prisoner's house at 59, Denton Place, Kennington, where I found the seven other pieces of tortoiseshell, and 24 bird skins (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are of different kinds, coming from different consignments—there are also some ostrich feathers, some Indian ones, and some from the Cape—the total value would be about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the two pieces found on him about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we returned to the police-station with the things, and showed them to the prisoner—he took up the ostrich feathers and these others, and said "I have had these for a long time, some of the bird skins I had given me, some I took from the warehouse," and taking up a large one, he said "This I took from the warehouse," and taking up one piece of tortoiseshell, he held it up to the light, and said, after some hesitation, "Yes, I took that from the warehouse in Billiter Street"—he did not say anything about the other six—before the Magistrate he said something about having his right hand free to sign the board—he would have to sign a board, but I went and looked, and found that he had signed it before he came into the yard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been there 34 years—there is no mark on any of the articles—they are sent over by merchants in packages—these were at the warehouse; not at the docks—the birds were found at the prisoner's house—there is nothing to indicate that they came in packages—there are seven iron doors at the warehouse, which have to be closed, and the prisoner had to sign that they were closed—the board he had to sign hangs up outside—the box in which I saw the nine pieces on the Saturday was on the ivory floor—I had noticed it before, because I had seen other parcels placed there in this way—he did not put his cans of tea or bottles of ale in that box; he had another box for that—about a dozen men work on that floor—they would not pass the box, it was in a corner—the prisoner had charge of that corner, and the labourers had no business there—they might pass it—I could not say that the box might not have been there for years—it had no lid or lock—it could not be seen in pass<lb/>ing; it was in a space at the back, and a gunny bag put to hide it—I believe tortoiseshell comes over in casks—after the prisoner's statement that the tortoiseshell found at his house came from Mr. Frolich, the manager of Messrs. Falconberg and Hessey, I called there—I did not inquire if they had drawn samples of what are called "hoofs" from the docks—hoofs are imported separately, not mixed with the tortoiseshell—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a hoof; I got it from the warehouse to show—the prisoner was wearing two coats on this occasion—I am prepared to swear that I saw the tortoiseshell round his body—he did not tell me that he was about to take the carman's delivery note back to the warehouse, and place the tortoiseshell back in the box.</p>

               <p>him to the station—the charge was read over to him there—he made no reply—I afterwards went to his house, and found the articles produced—they were shown to the prisoner at the station—I said "Take the birds first; where did you get the birds from?"—he said he had brought some of them from the warehouse, others he had picked up, and some he knew nothing at all about—I said "Where did you get the feathers from?"—he said he had had them in his possession a long time—I then said "Where did you get these seven pieces of tortoiseshell from?"—he said he had brought them from the warehouse in Billiter Street—he picked up one of the large birds, and said "That is one I brought from the warehouse"—I told him he would be charged with stealing the whole of the property—he made no reply.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I knew he was deaf, but I spoke very loud to him, so that I made him understand—he did not say that he kept the pieces in the box for the purpose of making up deficiencies in weight—he did not say that the feathers were brought by Mr. Fearneaux, who had married his sister.</p>

I am the prosecutor's and Mrs. Seabrook's daughter—my father came in on this night and said he would have murder, and started picking up plates and saucers, and he picked up the paraffin lamp to throw, and mother pushed him back against the shutter—Laura was at fur work when mother pushed him against the shutter—she got up with the knife in her hand which she used for fur work—it was not my little brother's knife—the prisoner did not come in while my father was there—whoever stabbed him, the prisoner did not.</p>

                  </hi>. My father keeps a china shop at 84, Caledonian Road—on 4th December, about 8.30 p.m., I was standing at the door, and the prisoner and another woman came up—the prisoner walked on, and the other woman picked out three plates, which came to 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and gave me a half-crown—I gave her two single shillings change, and she went up the Caledonian Road—she afterwards came back with the prisoner and bought a basin for 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave the prisoner a half-crown and the prisoner gave it to me—I showed it to my mother, who broke a piece out of it—I got a policeman, came back, and found the prisoner in the shop, but the other woman had gone.</p>

I said "Yes, Will, darling"—he then kissed me, smoothed my hair back from my forehead, and took the clothes from my mouth, and said "You get so hot, you will sleep better"—he again told me to go to sleep—I think he left the room then, the last I saw of him—he came back again in about a minute, and stood by the child's cot again; he did not shut the door after him, it was open—the cot was close to the bed—I saw his right hand behind him—my eyes were partly closed, he thought I was asleep—I then heard a tremendous noise, and felt blood pouring down my face—I held my hands to my head and shrieked—I groped my way out of bed; there was no one in the room then—the child was gone—the bedroom door was shut—I went out on to the landing—I saw the servant standing outside her bedroom door with my child—I heard the hall door slam, and directly after I heard a knock at the door—I said to the girl "Don't go"—I afterwards went down in my nightshirt and heard Mrs. Strahan outside, and after speaking to her I opened the door and let her in, and then I went with her up to the ser<lb/>vant's room—I there lay down on the bed till the doctor came—the doctor came in about five minutes with my husband—the doctor attended to me—a few minutes afterwards my husband said to me in the doctor's presence"<hi rend="italic">Mag,</hi> how can you say I have done this?" I said "May God forgive you, you stood by my child's cot and did it"—he made no reply to that—he went downstairs—I saw nothing more of him that night—I</p>

               <p>poisoning was more in temper than in earnest—he said once that rather than put up with what he did he would do away with himself—I suppose he referred to my speaking about the girl—I spoke to him frequently about his conduct with the girl, and he did not like it—I do not know that he has said the same things to persons in his father's employment—our first occupying different rooms was owing to my husband going out early—he slept in the spare room so as not to disturb me and the child—I think that was about May; it was the very hot weather in the summer—that was before the suspicions arose with regard to the girl—he occa<lb/>sionally slept with me—I suggested he should go back to the spare room because I knew he was going to Acton with this girl in the morning—I believed him when he took his oath that there was nothing wrong between him and the girl, but I found he had made a false oath—he did not go to his father's business early in the morning; he had never been used to do so—I do not mean he would be going to Acton when he got up at 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning—my husband was in bed with me on Monday night, 27th November—he did not sleep; he was out of bed two or three times during the night, and he went very early in the morning—he asked me if I would mind his going, and I said "No"—he complained of diarrhoea in the night, not in the morning—on Tuesday, the 28th, he went out and bought the whisky; half the bottle was not con<lb/>sumed; he had three small glasses—I was reading in the breakfast room, and he asked me to put down the book and talk to him—that was before the servant came home, before we went upstairs—it is true we had no words; he was very good that night; he was holding my hand—after we were upstairs he said he would not interfere with me, and called me "Mag," and he said he was afraid he would have to go downstairs with the diarrhoea—I said "Poor fellow, I am sorry," and hoped he would be better soon—he said "I dare say it will be all right directly"—we were on the most affectionate terms then—I took his hand and fondled it, but he drew it away—I did not see him kiss the child in the cot; he kissed me—I did not hear him muttering about poor little thing, it was the last time he should see it—the last words I said were, a minute or two after the doctor came, "May God forgive you, you stood by the child's cot and did it"—he was removed from the house in custody the same night—Mr. Stevens did not read that letter to me; I knew he had it when he showed it to me at the Court—I had no message of affection or anything else—I wrote these papers from some other paper after I had been to Craven Street, and then I had the interview with my husband in the presence of Mrs. Strahan—I told him I had copies of bills issued by Bearnett's, in Craven Street, on 14th and 30th October: "You have been there with a girl"—he said "I have been there," and that nothing im<lb/>proper had taken place.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I copied the bills from the original bills, which I found in my husband's bag, and which I put back there—I also found this card there: "Barnett's, Craven Street;" it is a private hotel—I did not see the original bills again—I have no vindictive feeling against the prisoner, and I recommend him to mercy—I told him he had been very extravagant in having four dozen oysters at 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for champagne, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for apartments, and 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for luncheon—he never slept away from home during October.</p>

JUSTICE HAWKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">interposing, said: "Counsel for a prisoner cannot in his speech be permitted to state matter of fact not in evidence nor proposed to be proved by evidence, but only alleged by Counsel to be instructions from and assertions by the prisoner himself. The rule formerly rigidly adhered to by many Judges was that a prisoner who had the services of counsel to defend him could not be allowed either to speak for himself or to make any statement of fact. That yule, however, has for some years past been considered by, I believe, most if not all the judges, to be a hard yule. And it has been modified to this extent, that although a prisoner cannot have Counsel to speak for him and also make a speech for himself, he may make a statement of such facts as he relies on for his defence, but he must be strictly confined to such statement. If a prisoner avails himself of this privilege to state new facts, the Judge has, in my opinion, a discre<lb/>tion as to allowing the prosecuting Counsel to reply, not generally on the whole case, but only on the allegations of fact introduced by the prisoner. I desire to lay down no general rule as to the time when a prisoner's statement of fact should be made; my own opinion is that it is discretionary with the Judge to determine whether it shall be before or after the Counsel's speech. In the present was I will permit the prisoner to make any statement of fact he may desire to make at once, before his learned Counsel proceeds with his address.</hi>"</p>

Sir,—The professed head of Liberalism, what benefit are you to the country? Liberal indeed to those who are not in want; but under your Liberal guidance in what state are the hard-working classes of the country? Hundreds and thousands about the streets actually starving, but willing to work for a very small pittance. If I should over come across you or the Prince of Wales, or any such who are petted with their thousands, wherever it happened to be, would have a rough time of it, for I would not stand particular what I would do, so take this warning, for I don't care.

                  </hi>. I am a widow and am a stamp and seal engraver, at 36, High Holborn—the prisoner is my husband's sister's son, and was 18 last July—when his father died, seven years ago, I took him into my house and gave him board, lodging, and pocket-money; and since June last I have paid him 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—his duties were to keep the books and take care of the shop—I cannot see very well and am not very accomplished as a bookkeeper—I paid the petty disbursements from what I received in the business, and when I had not sufficient I used to pay it out of my private purse, and tell Aitken, who entered it in this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and what I received as well—it has "Receipts" on one side and "Paid out" on the other—it was added up every week—if we had not time on Saturday when the place closed I used to settle it on the Monday and take what was due to me—each week I deducted the amount paid from the money received—we used often to let it go two weeks; I did not sign a cheque till I really wanted it—I some<lb/>times signed cheques in blank and Aitken filled them up, and the amount was entered in the book—I used to examine it, and he would say "There is so much for you to have and so much for you to pay in"—here is 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on one side and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the other, in Aitken's writing—the body of this cheque of October 27, 1882, for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is in Aitken's writing, and I believe I received that from the prisoner—the amount in the next week is 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the two weeks making 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and this cheque for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is Aitken's writing, but I only received the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this cheque, in Aitken's writing, for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., dated November 3rd, and drawn from the bank on</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Dated</hi> 23<hi rend="italic">rd May,</hi> 1882, <hi rend="italic">from Thomas Forster and Co., acknowledging the receipt of patterns, and enclosing order for</hi> 12 <hi rend="italic">pieces to be sent to Joseph Hobson, of</hi> 10, <hi rend="italic">Honey Lane Market.</hi>) I also received this letter.

               <p>been sent to Hobson, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the interest—since then I have seen the other 24 pieces at different pawnbrokers'—no goods were supplied to the prisoner on his own account while I was supplying Hobson; my trade with Forster during 12 months was between 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid him his commission on those sales and he had overdrawn something—I settled it all up to October 16th, 1882.</p>

I am a porter to Emil Weidlich, of 77, Watling Street, an agent—on 18th December I was delivering five parcels for him on a trolley, in Knightrider Street, about 2.30—I had delivered four, and on coming back I missed the fifth, which contained 33 yards of sateen—this is the parcel—its value would be 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

I am a warehouseman, of 30, Larkhall Lane, Clap<lb/>ham—on Friday, 15th December, at 12.25, I was in the Britannia public-house, Hackney—I saw Cross there, and left with him and another man, who I cannot swear to, and some females—we left the females in Morning Lane, and went to Retreat Place, where I was surrounded, and received a blow on my ear and another on my mouth from two parties, and was knocked down—they rifled my pockets, and took 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and my tobacco pouch—I do not recognise Baker, but Cross is the man who struck me on my mouth—I had had a little drink, but I knew what I was about—they ran away, and I jumped up to catch them, but caught my feet on the kerb, and fell again—a constable took Baker and brought him to me as another constable was raising me from the ground—there was a deal of</p>

I had been out spending the evening, and had some rum to drink there, and some ale—I got half a quartern of rum in a bottle at the Britannia, as I did not know how far I had to go to the lodging which Cross and the other man volunteered to show me, and I knew the public-houses would be closed—I also had a drop of ale or some spirits in a public-house in Morning Lane—it was a foggy night, and this occurred at a very dark place—it all occurred very quickly—Cross was dressed in a long light coloured overcoat, there is no mistake about that, and a round felt hat—he was not dressed like that when I picked him out—if I said "I think that is the man" it was a mistake, because I was sure he was the man, but I will not swear that I did not say "I think"—I had no purse; I took out some money in the women's presence—I knew them to De prostitutes—they were in my company ten minutes or a quarter of an hour at the most—I was going home with one of them, but somebody said that they would very likely rob me—I was with them ten minutes in the Britannia, and five minutes after coming out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am potman at the Crown, Mare Street, Hackney—on 15th December Cross came in about 10.30 or 10.40, and left at 12.24, when Mr. Jones began to put out the lights—whether he played a game with the others I don't know, but he stood with his elbow on the mantel<lb/>piece looking as the others playing—it is impressed on my mind, because in the day time, between 12 and 2 o'clock, he came and asked me if I could let him have a pair of boots—I said "Yes, if you can come down in the evening"—he did so, and put the boots on, and said that he would pay for them by weekly instalments—several others were with him—I am positive Cross was there at 12.25—I generally get the doors tem<lb/>porarily fastened by the half-hour—when I came out after dosing I noticed nine or ten young men outside, standing against the lamp-post, and I called Shee away—I saw Cross twice that day; he was dressed in dark clothes the second time with a white collar and a black tie, I believe—he had no overcoat or ulster, but a coat like he has on now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Several of them were at play, and Cross was looking at the game all the time—they were <hi rend="italic">chaffing</hi> him about wetting the boots—I do not think Shee played, he was sitting on one of the other tables—the Britannia is about a quarter of a mile from the Crown, and a very short distance from Morning Lane.</p>

I said "No, you are talking to one of his pals, where is Tom Harriett?" he said "Up in the top back room, go and get the bleeding watch, we'll soon settle the copper"—I said "Will you? I should like to have a look at you"—I took hold of him and he struck me in the head and kicked me—I took him out of the passage into the court, where it was light—I knew him and let him go—then I went up to the back room at the top—I burst the door open—I found Hartnett and took him into custody—he struck me several times and kicked me—Brooker, who was on the top of the stairs, also kicked me—I brought Hartnett downstairs after a great struggle and got out into Oakum Street—Brooker came up again, and struck me a violent blow in the mouth, broke one tooth, and knocked another out—Hayes then came up and struck me a violent blow on the ear—after about half an hour, while I was holding Hartnett and the prisoners kicking me all over, a police sergeant came to my assistance and I took Hartnett to the station—the others got away—I suffered pain for a considerable time and I only returned to duty yesterday—on 2nd January I apprehended McGreevy at Hounslow barracks—he was a private in the Middlesex Militia—the recruits are out for training—McGreevy said "I expected you before"—I had not then said anything to him but only touched him with a stick—he is the man I took out in the light—he was dressed in a light jacket with a cap and peak—I had known him for years.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 20, Davis Street, Peckham—I have retired from the business of a licensed victualler—on 25th December, about 9.15 or 9.30 a.m., I was in Farringdon Street waiting for an omnibus—I was wearing a gold watch and chain with a spade guinea attached to the end of the chain—my great-coat was buttoned up—I also wore in my tie an old-fashioned pin that I had had for thirty years; it was an enamel; the diamond was lost years ago—I carried a leather bag—I was not quite sober—the prisoner and two others came round the corner of the street and surrounded me—the prisoner with his left arm suddenly jerked me under the chin, and put his hand into my breast pocket and jerked my watch and chain out and passed them to his chief companions—a policeman came up and I called out"Police"—I was on the ground, and scrambled up and seized the prisoner with my right hand—I gave him in charge—the policeman afterwards showed me the bow of the watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not miss my pin till three or four days afterwards, when my sister saw it was gone—I kept hold of the bag till I got to the station and booked the charge—I felt I was hurt—I sub<lb/>sequently went to St. Bartholomew's Hospital—the policeman took me—the doctor said I had one broken rib and one fracture—I must have been kicked.</p>

Burt and Co., of Cornhill, through the telephone, the value of them—Mr. Percival then telephoned to Mr. Burt, and got a reply of the quoted price—I brought the bonds to him from private room, where the prisoner was speaking to me—I was then called away upon other matters, and left the prisoner in the private room—this is our cheque for 202<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it is signed by me—it has been paid through our bank—</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Brixton—I am corresponding clerk to Sir Robert Carden—on 19th July I saw the prisoner in the private room; Mr. George Mayor called me in—I must have seen the bonds—in con<lb/>sequence of what Mr. Mayor said to me I telephoned to Messrs. Burt, the money-changer's—that was in the public telephone office—I took their reply back to the prisoner—I said the bonds were worth about 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—if any one is in the private room they can hear what is said in the pubic office if they listen—I believe Mr. Mayor had left before that—the prisoner hesitated, and then said "I must confer with my friends"—I asked for his address, and he gave me this envelope out of his pocket, "8, Cowley Street, Palace Yard, Westminster," and to that address I afterwards communicated—he mentioned the name of Stephen<lb/>ton and Co., of Westminster, in connection with the bonds, leading me to think that they were connected with them—he left the office pre<lb/>sumably to see if his friends would accept the value I quoted, and on the same morning he came back, and said "The price will be accepted"—that was in the private room where Mr. Mayor had been—some one went round with the bonds—we telephoned a second time—the prisoner was away 20 or 30 minutes—there were 12 bonds—I received back from Messrs. Hurt a cheque for the bonds—I then handed the prisoner this cheque for 202<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., payable to the order of G. Reid—it is endorsed "G.

                  </hi>. I am a curtain dyer and cleaner of 11A, Anne Road, Hackney—on 4th December I saw this advertisement in the Daily Chronicle, and in consequence of that on the morning of 6th Dec. I went to 11A, Lavington Street, the address named in the advertisement—I said "Is this your advertisement?"—he said "Yes," and took me into the stable and showed me the two horses advertised in the paper—he asked me which one I had come about—I said the one advertised as a laundry horse, to suit a laundryman—he whipped one up behind and said that that was it, and he wanted 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I said "In the advertise<lb/>ment you offered to lend it out for two months for its keep"—he said "Yes; you will have to leave me a deposit of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and then you can have it for the two months. I am not here to-day and gone to-morrow," and he looked round the yard at the vehicles—I said I would consider the matter over and call again—he did not tell me then what he was—I went and saw him again on the evening of the 14th December—he said, "The horses I have shown you before I have let out on the same terms"—I was about to leave the yard, he followed me and said, "I have got another one that will suit you, you can have it on the same terms, but at present it is out"—I left him—about a month afterwards he came up to a public-house where I was and whistled at the door—I went out to him and he said "The horse I spoke to you about is just come in, will you go down and see it?"—I went down with him and saw the horse—he said "If you like to take that one and leave me a deposit of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you can have the horse away, and if it does not suit yon, you can fetch it back and I will return you your 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; this yard is mine and the cabs you see and horses are mine, you see I am not here to-day and gone to-morrow. I don't want to have you and you would not have me"—he said all that without my saying anything—I said "I want a receipt for the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he would give me a receipt and a warranty too that the horse was sound, and the full price of the horse would be 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he gave me this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produce</hi>)—I wrote it at his dictation. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>:"Received of Charles Pearson the sum of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit on a chestnut horse, warranted. quiet in harness and sound; if not approved within this time three months I will return the money in full.") I gave him the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I then went with him and the man who had gone with me to the stable, and I told the man, "Put the head stall on and take the horse away, you have got to ride it down"—the prisoner said "No you don't"—I said "What do you mean?"—he said "That is what I mean, you will have to pay me the other 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before you take the horse out of the stable"—I said "That is not what the agreement was, that is not what was arranged'—he asked what I took him for—I whispered to my man to</p>

               <p>go for the police—the prisoner heard it—he said I could fetch forty policemen—the man came back and said he could not get a policeman—another man had come into the stable—I told my man to go to the police-station, and after he had gone the other man commenced knocking the horse under the belly and jumping it about and saying "This is a good one"—the prisoner said "Why don't you go yourself for a police<lb/>man?"—I said I was not going unless he gave me my 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back—he got very quarrelsome and said for two straws he would pull my nose—I then went to the police-station and complained and then went home—I saw the prisoner next day at Clerkenwell Police-court—he was charged with obtaining this money under false pretences—he told me his name was Atkins when I wrote the receipt, and he put his mark to it—I gave him a copy of the receipt—I parted with my 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. because I thought he would act honourably—I had no reason to suppose there was anything wrong—I believed his statement that the horses and cabs were his.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I offered him to go and see if I was a respectable man—he did not go—he asked for no other piece of paper than these two—he did not offer the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back—he has never paid me.</p>

I am a cabinet-maker, of 15, Lamb Lane, Hackney—I have known Mr. Embden many years; he came to me with Hertz on 15th November, who said "I am going to furnish a house at 30, Russell Square"—he arranged for me to inspect the house next morning, and to meet him at 18, Tavistock Street—he spoke in German—I am a German—he said "I bank with Rothschilds' at Frankfort, and Julius Hertz, of Hamburg, is my brother"—next day I went to 18, Tavistook Street, and saw both prisoners—Hertz complained of his head, and said he had had too much to drink over night, and asked me to wait a few minutes—they then both went with me to an unfurnished house, 30, Eussell Square, and Hertz wanted me to furnish six of the rooms by December 1st, as his intended bride was coming home from Hamburg on December 7th—he wanted them furnished in the best style, as he was a wealthy man, and people would come and see him, and that he had bought the lease for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 193/4 years were unexpired—I agreed, and measured for the carpets—I also arranged to supply him with some silk fur his mother at Hamburg—when he left he went into No. 29, and said that some relations of the Rothschilds lived there—he kept me outside three-quarters of an hour, and then came out and said "I am sorry I have kept you waiting; I will only be a few minutes longer," and went back—the prisoners then came out together, and Holtz had a letter in his hand, which he took to a house-agent's in Southampton Street—they then went with me to Lamb Lane, Hackney, where I showed them some patterns of silk, and Hertz selected the best—my partner, Mr. Finniberg, came in, and he went with Holtz to fetch the silk—Hertz told me that he met Holtz in London, but had known him in Ham<lb/>burg—Hertz remained with me while they went to Newgate Street—there was a Davenport writing-table in my shop, price 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which Hertz bought of me to make a present to a lady in Hamburg—I packed it in a case for him, and marked it "J. H., 1280"—20 yards of silk were brought there, value 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard—Hertz said that it did not matter about packing it, as he knew the captain of the vessel, who would take care of it; that he did not want any credit, as he paid cash for everything, but he only had German money—I refused that, and he said if I would send the goods to St. Katherine's Docks he would send the money back</p>

               <p>by my carman—the two prisoners and my carman left together in a trap with the Davenport and the silk—Hertz said in Holtz's presence that Holtz was his page boy, and before that day Holtz said that Hertz was a wealthy gentleman, and was going to establish a factory in England, and his bride was in Hamburg, and was a very wealthy woman—they started with the goods about 7 p.m., and the carman returned without them, and told me something—I then went with him to the cloak room, Broad Street Station, but the table and the silk were not there—we waited till the porter came back, and from what he said we went to Isaac Jacobs, a furniture dealer in Houndsditch—we got there at 8 p.m., and found the Davenport there unpacked and just ready to take out of the case—I have not been paid for it, or for the silk—the next I saw of the prisoners was after they were brought back from Manchester in custody.</p>

I am a wholesale stationer, of 2, Crane Court, Fleet Street—at the end of September I came from America in the Grecian Monarch—I saw Holtz on board—he said he had been in the employ of Spiers and Pond, and that he was acting as interpreter on board ship, and also as assistant to the surgeon of the ship—I am a witness that he did assist the surgeon—he gave me this card, "Max Hertz," and said "That is my card, it is written by my brother"—a fortnight after the ship arrived in London I met him at Walham Green—he said "I was coming to see you, but I have been ill"—I had given him my address and promised to get him employment—he came to my house and told me that his brother had 200 head of cattle on board a ship lying outside the Albert Dock—I went with him to the Albert Dock, and he wanted to draw 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay the rent for the cattle—I had not seen the cattle—he introduced me to Holtz, who he afterwards said was his brother—I understood Hertz thoroughly, and he seemed to understand me—he spoke good English when I irritated him—my friend had the money, but I would not allow him to pay 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit on cattle he had not seen—we went to the Trinity office and telegraphed and found where the ship was, but that there were no cattle on board.</p>

Spiers and Pond.</hi>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">a black</hi>). I am a ship's carpenter—on Sunday morning, 17th December, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was going towards home at the Sailors' Home, Whitechapel—I met four men and three women in Wells Street—the prisoners are two of the men—Poole asked me for my watch—I said "I have no watch"—Kennedy Said "What time is it?"—I said "I am no policeman to tell you the time"—Poole jumped behind Kennedy and showed fight with me, and I made that mark on his forehead—he struck me in my stomach and made a grab at my chain at the same time, but I knocked his hand off—my coat was only buttoned at the top, and the chain showed—he made a second attempt, striking me several times in the same spot, and my coat button was torn off—the others sang out "Go for him!" and he made a third attempt—I knocked his hand off and retreated; he came again, and I hit him on his forehead—there is the mark now—he spun like a top and fell—the others said "Go for him, youngster;" but when he made a grab he was too close to me and jumped backwards, and Kennedy grabbed at my chain and ran away—I sang out "Police!" and Nos. 90 and 150 came—the prisoners went into a thieves' lodging-house, but were taken in custody, and while in custody Kennedy struck me on my face.</p>

I only struck Poole once—I was brought up in Bahama—I did not take a glittering weapon from my pocket and strike Poole—I did not mention to the policeman any attempt to steal my watch and chain—I said I was molested by thieves—I was hit four times—I had been drinking with my governor, Mr. Samuels—I have drunk with Kennedy several, times during the seven weeks I have been in London, and I have given Poole a drink in Kennedy's company—where<lb/>ever I go a crowd follows me, and they say "Give me a drink," and I do so—I said at the police-court "I have been in London seven weeks this time, and have seen Poole almost every night and Kennedy every night," but I did not mean for seven weeks.</p>

At about 12.45 on Sunday morning, 17th December, I was with 115 H in Wells Street—I heard cries of "Police!" and ran into Cable Street—the prosecutor pointed out the prisoners and halloaed out at the top of his voice, and the prisoners ran off down Dock Street into a common lodging-house—I gave chase, never lost sight of them, and followed them into the house—poole went into the cellar used as a kitchen and got underneath the stairs—I took hold of him—he said "See what he has done"—I brought him into the passage—he had a cut over his right eye, and there was mud on the right side of his face where the cut was, and all down the right side—I was surrounded in the passage by 50 or 100 roughs, and had great difficulty in getting him out of the house—Kennedy was in custody of 115 H, and he struck the prosecutor in the pit of his stomach with his clenched fist—the prosecutor was quite sober; I was speaking to him about five minutes before this—he bade me good-night—the prisoners were sober—I took them to the station.</p>

I am assistant surgeon at the Middlesex House of Detention—I saw Poole on the morning after his arrival, examined and treated him—he had a dressing on his forehead; I undid it, and found a crescent-shaped wound over his left eye reaching down to the eyebrow—a bowie-knife or sharp instrument might produce such a wound—it was an incised wound; that refers to the appearance, not to the way it was caused—it was cut, not jagged—it might be produced by a penknife scooping down—Poole was under my care some four days.</p>

I live at 5, Batty Gardens, St. George's-in-the-East, and work at the match factory at Bow—between 2.30 and 12.45 on this Sunday morning I was in the company of Poole at the corner of Dock Street—Mary Coakley was talking to her young man there too—I and Coakley gave our evidence at the police-court—no one else was there—Kennedy was paying his lodging—poole was making a cigarette, and he turned round and asked the coloured man for a match—I had not seen him turn the corner—the coloured man growled like a wild beast and</p>

               <p>Whites in custody at Harpenden—I read the warrant to them—the male prisoner said "You must be wrong; I gave a bill which is not due yet"—Mrs. White said "Of course it is not"—the next day White asked me to read the warrant to him again—I did so—he replied "Oh, now I understand, but I have not seen Horne more than two or three times lately"—Mrs. White said "I have not seen Horne for 11 years"—I searched the male prisoner and found on him the papers produced—they lived in a cottage, for which they would pay about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—there was no shop nor any business—I found in an outhouse two barrels of vinegar, one of Mr. Engleman's, also a quantity of horse condiment—on 23rd October I took Whitehouse into custody in Bremen Row—I read the warrant to him—he said "I know nothing about it; I did not benefit by any of the customers"—I held a warrant for Phillips, but have not been able to take him into custody yet—I hold warrants for a large number of persons who were customers introduced by Phillips and White-house, but who I have not been able to take into custody—I found this book on Whitehouse, in which there is an entry of Horne and Co.—I went to Perks's house, 156, Neate Street, Camberwell—I found him occupying one back room at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or half-a-crown a week—there were no signs of business there—I took Barnes into custody in the Borough—I read the warrant to him charging him with conspiring with others to obtain vinegar by false pretences of Mr. Engleman—he said "All right, don't show me up more than you can help; let me go to my house and see my wife. I keep a public-house close here"—I went with him to the King's Head—a person who he said was his wife opened the door—he said to her "This officer has arrested me about the vinegar matter"—she immediately rushed behind the counter and took something from a drawer and put it under her clothing—I told her I was a police-officer, and I should expect her not to take possession of anything or conceal anything, and if she obstructed me in the execution of my duty I should be compelled to charge her—she then gave me up some papers and pawntickets, which are produced—there are writs at the suit of different persons in the Superior Courts and County Court summonses—the female gave me this small bag containing a number of duplicates—I also found on Barnes duplicates of goods pawned by Vanner.</p>

I am a grocer and baker at 54, Boyle Street, Luton—I have known Horne since 14th or 15th August—he was introduced by Dr. Slee; I believe he is an M.D.—he lived in the Albert Road, Luton—Slee and Home had called together during my absence; they left behind a sample of Engleman's vinegar—on 14th August I met them in the street, I was in my cart; they stopped me, and Slee introduced Horne, and said, "This is Mr. Horne, the gentleman who has the vinegar to sell; I left you a sample yesterday; have you tasted it?" I said "Yes, I don't like the taste of it much"—he said "It is German vinegar, but you will find it is better quality than the English"—I asked the price to sell; Horne said "You can have it at 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a gallon,"—I said I did not think it was worth that—he said I could have it for 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said I should want 100 gallons at one time, I might do with 50—I did not buy it on that occasion—I drove off—they said they would come and see me—I asked Slee what he knew about vinegar; he said he was a relative of Slee and Co., the vinegar makers, in London, and he understood all about vinegar—next morning, about 8, Slee and Horne called on me—they asked if I had made up my mind about the vinegar, if I would buy it; I said I could do with 50 gallons at 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Horne said "We don't want to make two bites of a job like that, if you take the whole of it you shall have it at 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," and I did so—Slee said he had tasted it and found it splendid vinegar; it was No. 20 vinegar, and I should have no difficulty in selling it—he said the German vinegar was made from wine, and the English vinegar was made from beer—Horne said he was an agent for Mr. Engleman, and had this vinegar to sell—he said he was sending it to a firm at Dunstable, but for some reason it was not to be delivered, that the money was not forthcoming, and he had orders to sell it at Luton to save the carriage back to London—he said he wanted the money; I said I should not think of paying for it before I saw it or received it—he said "Oh, it will be all right, if it is not you can have the money back"—he asked me to pay something on account, and I gave him a sovereign—about a week afterwards the 100 gallons was delivered—my wife paid the carriage, 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—next day Horne came; it was then I paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—I agreed to pay the balance on the following Saturday, and I did so, and he gave me this receipt—I handed him the receipt for the carriage—in September I found that two samples of tea had been left at my house—next day I saw Horne and Stratford—I knew Stratford through seeing him in the town; I never had any transaction with him, Horne asked me if I had tried the tea; I said "Yes," and I liked it very well—the samples were marked 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said I could have them at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said I liked the cheapest best, and I would take it at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he said "No, I can't do that, it cost me more money"—Stratford said "Let him have the two at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said I did not want two half-chests—however, I agreed to buy it at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound all round—I paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account, and the balance in a week—it was de<lb/>livered by Horne next morning—on 16th he came for the money, and I paid him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for 108lb.—I asked him for a receipt; he said he would</p>

I am a grocer and tea dealer, at Shadwell Street, Luton—in September last Home called and offered me three half-chests of tea for sale at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—I said I only wanted one, and the one at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. would suit me, but with a deal of persuasion I offered to buy the three at 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that would be at about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—it was to be delivered next morning, and I was to pay him part on Saturday night and the balance in a month—he said two were at the Midland Station at Luton and one at the Cock in Park Street—I tried to get it from the station, but did not—they would not allow me to have it without Home's signature—the ostler from the Cock brought me one chest—on the Saturday afternoon Stratford called at my place—I told him I wag unable to get the two half-chests from the Midland Station—he said he could get them, no doubt, as he was with Home when they arrived—he went to fetch them, and in the course of half an hour they arrived—Stratford afterwards arrived to see if they were all right—I saw Horne and Stratford together that evening at my shop—Horne wished to know what right I had for getting the tea—he wished to dispute the transaction—I told him that it was quite a bond-<hi rend="italic">fide</hi> transaction—I afterwards received a letter from Miller and Company, of Luton—I saw a gentleman named Pook connected with that firm, and in the presence of Stratford and Horne Mr. Pook asked me my version of the story—he said of course he could understand that it was a business transaction, but he would advise me to let Horne have the two half<lb/>chests of tea that I had not opened, and to pay him for the two that I had opened—I did let him have the two half-chests, less 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. off one—I gave Stratford 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account for Horne, and agreed to pay the balance—these are the receipts he gave me.</p>

Bank of England notes, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and some valuable securities, from. 60, Lincoln's Inn Fields on 15th November;" he said "I won the money at <hi rend="italic">nap</hi> from a man in the Euston Road, but I shan't tell you at what house"—I said "Do you know the man?" he said "No"—I said "How many notes have you changed;" he said "Only three, and those I changed at the Little Bell, Clerkenwell"—I said "Well, I must tell you that we have Blain in custody, and he changed one of the stolen notes, that makes four;" he said "Oh, you have Blain in custody, have you? he knows as much about the job as I do"—at the station he made no reply to the charge, but Blain said "I am not guilty"—on 4th December I took Shaefer at the Marquess public-house, Canonbury—I said "We are police-officers, you have changed some 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes lately in conjunction with a man named Mokes;" he said "I don't know what you mean"—on the way to the station he said "I admit I know a man named Mokes, but I changed no notes with him"—I took Povah on 9th December.</p>

P." for Povah, and then I made it Parker—I picked up the change, and he said "Here, hand it over, you can have it when the money is changed"—it had been agreed that I should have half—we then went to the Victoria, King's Cross, and after paying for some drink he changed another 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—from there we went to a public-house opposite the Midland Hotel; we had some drink, and he produced a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and said "You look the most swell of the two,</p>

               <p>you had better pass this"—I tendered it, and he picked up the change—I then began to lose my senses; I had had so much drink—I remember getting into a cab, but remember no more till the next morning, when I found myself in a large house in Pimlico—I don't know the name of that street, but I went to a house in Winchester Street, and went into a room where Shaefer was, and where four of us had brandy and soda, which Shaefer paid for with a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I suppose the change was sent for, as it was some time coming—Shaefer said "You had better not go to work to-day"—I said "I must, to stave off suspicion"—we took a cab, and I parted with him at the corner of Packington Street, and I did not see him again till I was charged with him—I went to the office that day, and continued there till 6th December, when I was taken ill, and was at home one or two days, and Nash, one of the clerks, came to see me, and I told him what I have told you now, I have only had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business with my mother and brother, at South May Mill, Elland, Yorkshire, as silk manufacturers—the firm is James Carter and Son—the father of the prisoner Ross was formerly our London agent, and when he ceased he recommended the prisoners Brown and Ross as his successors, and intimated that they were in partnership—I said I could not say anything about it till I got back home—they afterwards called at our place—we did not give them the agency then—I called at their place, 180, Aldersgate Street—their name was over the door—I saw a long narrow room and believed they were carrying on a genuine business, and therefore entrusted them with our London agency—I say them both, and they afterwards introduced about half a dozen customers; we have been heavy losers by most of them—in addition to those customers we supplied goods value £700 to Ross and Brown to sell on our account on commission—we drew a bill on them, which they renewed and ultimately met—we were sued on it; my brother can tell you about it best—we afterwards found that our goods were pledged—Brown took me to a place on Ludgate Hill, and told me that the goods were put there because they had not room enough in their warehouse—those were the goods which were sent on account of the bill—I said "You are sure this is right?"—he said "Yes,</p>

               <p>this is a friend of mine and of my father's when alive; we are going to alter our warehouse, and that is the reason the goods are here"—when Mr. Parker wrote to me from Leeds I found the goods were pledged—Ross and Brown introduced me to Jackson and Co., 28, Com<lb/>mercial Road—Brown said they were respectable, that they were doing business with them, and he would introduce me to no one who they could not trust themselves—I made inquiries about Jackson and Co. of the Trade Protection Society, after which my brother wrote to Brown and Boss; and Brown and Boss said in their office that Jackson was a good man, that they were doing business with him, and knew better than the Trade Protection Society, as they were on the spot—I then entrusted Jackson with goods; the first transaction was for cash, but I did not get it—I received these bills. (<hi rend="italic">For</hi> 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">each at four months after date.</hi>) Brown also introduced me to the prisoner Beil as Henderson and Co., of Plough Street, Commercial Road—he said that Beil was a merchant and a respectable man, and he would not recommend him only they trusted him themselves—Henderson and Co. ordered goods of us through Brown and Boss amounting to 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and paid cash—their second order was for 147<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; they gave a bill for that dated September 1, 1882, which was not paid—they gave us a further order for goods value between 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which we did not supply—Ross also introduced us to the prisoner Kahn, of 7, Water Lane, City, who he said was a respectable man, a shipper, and if the goods were right he could take a large quantity, that he could trust him, and he would not introduce any one who they could not trust themselves—Kahn then gave an order for goods amounting to 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for which he paid cash—he gave a second order and that was paid—he then ordered goods amounting to 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and another parcel amounting to 502<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked if he could pay cash—he said he thought he could, but if so he should want extra discount—I said if he paid cash I would allow him 3, and for a month 2 1/2, but preferred to give him 3 1/2 for cash—he agreed to that but did not pay cash—he afterwards gave me a bill for 612<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was the total of the two orders, in lien of which these two bills were substituted.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRAIN</hi>. I gave the bills to Mr. Miller for the purpose of swearing an information at Guildhall against Brown and Rose on 29th September—he was not to see whether he could squeeze any money out of Mr. Ross, sen., or Mr. Brown, or their relatives—I knew that Mr. Ross, sen., was a man of substance in the City, and that Brown's mother had money—I went to Mr. Ross, the father, but I did not say that unless he paid the money I would take criminal proceedings against his son—we tried our best to get the money, and when we found we could not we gave it into Mr. Miller's hands—this letter is my writing: "Sir,—You must be at Mr. Burnell's at 11.30, or there is no more chance for you. Mr. Jackson, Kahn, and Henderson are going to be there"—I don't know whether that was given to Ross or sent to his father's solicitor—some time in 1880 I saw Mr. Ross about his son going into the business—Brown and Ross called on mo in Yorkshire, and asked me whether 1 had any goods for sale in their way, and if they should represent us, and Brown said "Can you give it to us now? we are two young men with our way to make in the world, and we will do straight and honest to you"—our first transaction with Brown and Ross was on January 25th, 1882—this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) looks like my brother's writing, but he will answer for himself. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated Elland, January</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">th,</hi> 1882, <hi rend="italic">and was an agreement to keep</hi> 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">worth of goods at</hi> 180, <hi rend="italic">Aldersgate Street in consideration of being allowed to draw a four months' bill for</hi> 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.) I expect we received this bill for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it bears my endorsement—we discounted it with the Halifax Joint Stock Bank, and the money was put to our credit—I would rather leave it to my brother to say whether we paid it when it arrived at maturity—I know nothing about it; it will save time if you will let the thing pass till my brother comes—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my brother's writing—I know nothing of the contents of this other letter—I can't say whether I got a renewal bill and discounted it; I left it with my brother—we supplied the goods; they allowed us to draw on them, and we let them have the goods for security—I did not swear at Guildhall that I kept the books; you can't find my writing in them from beginning to end. (<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition stated</hi>: "I keep the books of our firm.") That is a mistake; I never swore that—I had a solicitor and Counsel to represent me; they asked me questions, but the thing was so muddled I could not tell how the thing was—Ross was before an Alderman at Guildhall Police-court, and the charge was dismissed—a warrant was out against Brown, and I may have given my solicitor instructions to get it—I never saw Mr. Natzler sign anything at the Thames Police-court—the solicitor may have applied there for a warrant or summons against Brown or Boss—I don't know whether Boss came to the police-court voluntarily and surrendered himself; I know he did not come to Guild<lb/>hall voluntarily—Mr. Mitchell and I met him, and asked him, and he would not open the door, and we threatened to break it open, and when we went the first time a lady said he was not in—this (<hi rend="italic">reduced</hi> is my brother's telegram: "To Brown, Ross, and Co., August 9th. Send bill 1,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for John Ross and Co. We will return ours by to-night. Wire back certain. Jeremiah Carter and Co.") I have not the least idea what that means, or these other telegrams—Brown told me that they had lost 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by Lavine—I did not hear that Lavine had re<lb/>ceived a number of goods, and had let in a number of Yorkshire manufacturers—it was proposed by Brown that there should be a</p>

               <p>subscription of 7 1/2 per cent, on their debts to prosecute Lavine, and I asked Brown and Ross to subscribe our proportion of 7 1/2 pet cent. on our loss, but alter ward a I said we had lost the money, and did not intend to throw good money after bad.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. My firm are subscribers to Stood and Sharp's trade list at Huddersfield—I should think we had had half a dozen reports from them—we made it a practice to communicate with them after June, 1882, when we began business with Brown and Ross—we made an arrangement that not only orders procured through Brown add Ross, but all sold by us in London, should carry a commission of 2 1/2 per dent.—I know nothing about Knight or any London house—this letter of 26th July meant that they could take the 2 1/2 per cent, on the goods we sent to Henderson—I did not inquire through the Trade Protection Society as to Brown's father having been in business 37 years—it was explained that Brown had been in partnership with his father; that the banking account was Brown and Son, and that when Boss came into partnership the account would not be altered in the books—I believe Brown told me the banking account was guaranteed by the widow, Mrs. Brown, to the extent of £600, and soon after he told me that he and his father had conducted an auctioneer's business, and that he did not pre<lb/>tend to know anything about the value of scourings or plaitings—we went to Henderson's—we may have made inquiries as to Hender<lb/>son's place of business; I can't say when—I do not know that early in August Boss was writing the firm's name as Brown, Boss, and Ob.—I knew nothing about it till I met Brown in Aldersgate Street, and he told me then he had dissolved partnership—the Gazette is of 11th August, with the notice of 2nd August—I met Brown in the lore part of Septem<lb/>ber—before we took Brown with Boss as our agents I had been to his place and slept there, and they treated me very kindly, and I have nothing to say against Brown except that he took me down to Ludgate Hill and showed me the goods there as his own, everything else was perfectly straight.</p>

I don't think our firm was pressed for money in January; I can't swear we were not—I believe we were turning out of our mills more than we could sell—we wanted to turn the stock into money—my brother came to London to try and find somebody to work off the stock—I believe my brother arranged that accommodation bill on 26th January, 1882, for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we had a heavy stock, and were in want of some money—we did not try to raise money in the neighbour<lb/>hood and fail—we got the acceptance of Brown and Ross for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and discounted it immediately at our bankers, and the amount was placed to our credit—it fell due on 28th May—on 24th May, at Ross's request, we sent up a cheque for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to our bankers to meet the bill—it was presented and dishonored, because there were no funds to meet it—we got another acceptance for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Brown and Boss in the place of this, and as soon as we got it we discounted it—it took the place of No. 1 at the bank—we had the money to pay off No. 1—that bill has never been paid—we never found any money towards its payment, as we agreed to do, because they held stock of ours for above that amount—we have never paid our bank the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Brown and Ross, or Ross and Co.'s estate are liable—I know nothing of Ross's bankruptcy affairs—I do not know that the bankers have proved on that bill—we never opened a com<lb/>mission account in our books with Brown and Ross—I do not think we received over 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. through Brown and Ross on which they were entitled to commission—I have pressed Boss to send in his commission account, but he neglected to do it—after Brown left the firm we wished in August to draw an accommodation bill on Boss and Co. for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., they were to accept it payable at their bank, and when we got it we were to discount it at our bankers—I can't swear I sent this telegram, it is in my writing: "Send bill 1050, as John Ross and Co.; will return yours by to-night; wire certain; come down on receipt to arrange terms"—I sent that because he had said we should draw on his father, as his banking account was not properly established—I understood his father was a sleeping partner in the firm of Brown, Ross, and Co.—I knew his father was trading in London as John Ross—I believed he was a respectable man—the bill was drawn on Mr. Ross, senior, because we knew we could not draw at that time on Ross, junior—we understood Ross, junior, was acting for his father—the telegram meant that he was to sign John Ross—I believe that was suggested by Ross that he should sign for his father—I am not aware that he refused to sign in the name of John Ross, and said he could only sign in the name of Brown, Boss, and Co.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a rug manufacturer, at Chatteris, Cambridgeshire—I know a man named Jackson, of 28, Commercial Road—on one occasion when I went there I saw Ross, Jackson introduced him to me; he said that he was a very respectable gentleman in the City, that he had retired and turned the business over to his son; anything I could do for him would be perfectly right and safe—I received this letter from Brown and Ross, and I bought one small parcel of serges of them—on 8th May I received this from Bishoffsheim and Co., ordering 100 serges at cash in 30 days—I made inquiries, and did not execute the order—on 19th July I received this memorandum from Kahn, ordering serges—I made inquiries, and did not execute it—about 22nd August I called on Jackson, and he went with me to Plough Street to see Beil—Jackson introduced him to me as Mr. Henderson—I bought a parcel of jute at 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had a small order from him to the value of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I delivered, and Jackson paid me for them—I did not know Beil as Bishoffsheim—I had every reason to believe Jackson to be a respectable man—I don't think Kahn was ever introduced to me.</p>

I am a farmer at Field Farm, Colemore, Hampshire—on the evening of 7th December I went to Waterloo Station between 6 and 7—I was too soon for the train, and went into the Olive Branch public-house near in the Waterloo Road—I called for some ale—I saw a girl there, I don't know her name; I saw her before the Magistrate—I talked to her, and I believe I treated her to some drink—I was sober—I was in the public-house nearly an hour, I suppose—I saw Donegan, Jones, and Fleming there, I believe—I don't think I saw either of the other two—I had my gold watch and albert chain safe at this time—I left the public-house, and was walking along towards Waterloo Station, when I was surrounded by these five men—Donegan took me by the throat, and pushed my head back, the other two took me one by each arm and took my watch and gold pin from my scarf and a part of my chain—I was standing up—I can't say which of them held my arms—I recognise all the prisoners as surrounding me—I commenced to halloa "Police," and they said "Shut up, you b, or else we will kill you dead"—they all five ran away together, and I followed them some little way—I did not catch them—I saw a constable in uniform, to whom I gave information—I saw no more of the prisoners at that time—I took a cab, and went to Ken<lb/>nington Road Police-station, where I found Donegan, Jones, and Fleming in custody—this was about 20 minutes after the attack—I recognised them I was told to wait—I went out for a few minutes, and when I came back King and Strutton were brought in in custody—I recognised the five as the five that attacked me in the Waterloo Road—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the watch and a part of the chain; the chain was broken with a jerk, and this portion left on my waistcoat—the value is about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never pair any of the men before, nor the girl at the public-house.</p>

               <p>Street Strutton and King remained behind, and then Strutton followed the other three across the road—I followed them till I met a constable in uniform; I then went across the road and stopped following Jones and Donegan—King and Strutton ran across the road—I said to Donegan "What is all this running about?"—he said "This man," pointing to Jones," has just given me a slap in the face; I have had enough of his nonsense; we are just having a few words about it"—James asked him when it occurred—he pointed somewhere down the road—James said "I heard you mention something else in Whiting Street about the f—lot"—no sooner did he mention those words than Fleming started off at full speed pursued by James—I took hold of Donegan and the constable in uniform took hold of Jones—Donegan put his foot behind me and struck me in the chest and knocked me down, and said "You b—s—, you shan't take me"—we rolled over in the mud several times till further assistance came—he was taken to the station, where I searched him, and found this gold watch and a portion of the chain in his left-hand trousers pocket—when I took it from him he struck at me, and said "That is my property; I can prove it; my uncle who went to America this morning gave it to me this morning"—ten minutes after the prosecutor drove up in a cab with the remaining portion of the watch-chain hanging from his waistcoat—he identified the watch—Jones was brought in with Donegan and Fleming was brought in about three or four minutes afterwards, and I am certain these are the five men I have spoken of—the charge was made—Donegan said "I hit him because he first caught hold of me," meaning me.</p>

What is all this running about?"—Donegan said "This man," pointing to Jones," has given me a slap in the chops for nothing; it is not the first time. I have had enough of his nonsense, and we were having a few words about it"—Jones said "It's all right now, governor"—I said "We must take you to the station as suspected persons"—Boswell took Donegan and Jones—I said to Donegan "Where did this take place?" when he referred to the assault—he said "Oh, just up here in Westminster Bridge Road, under the arch"—I said "I mean about half an hour ago, when you were in Whiting Street with the handkerchief round your head, and said 'I have got the b—f—lot; follow me"—he was confused and gave me no</p>

You will find nothing on me"—he had no hat on—he said "Let me pick up my hat; I have lost ray hat"—I said "If you had done nothing wrong you might have picked it up yourself; I shall take you to the station"—he said "You had better go and look after the others; you will find nothing crooked on me"—I took him to the station; there was nothing on him—I found Jones and Donegan already in custody, and the prosecutor was also there—Fleming said to the prosecutor "I was at the public-house with a young woman when you were there.

I have just left home. I live in the Pollards"—he was taken to the station at the same time as Donegan—he said to Donegan "You don't know me and I don't know you"—Donegan made no reply—at the station he said "I am a carman; I work for Chamberlain, in Belvedere Road.

You will have to go to the station; you may as well go quietly"—Strutton said "I will go with you, but I know nothing about it"—I said "I saw you both in Westminster Bridge Road at 8 o'clock, and followed you just as you passed the entrance to Astley's Theatre; when the other men were taken in custody you ran across the road"—he said "I was in Westminster Bridge Road.

                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist of Thomas Street, Kennington—on 14th December I went to bed at 12.15, leaving the shutters and door secure—I sleep upstairs—I came down between 8.30 and 8.45 and found the shutters partly open and my stock all gone, except a few</p>

               <p>penny cigars—I missed 70 or 80 cigars, and all my tobacco and cigar<lb/>ettes—I know the prisoners by sight, and for a reason I had I gave Howard in custody—I saw these two cigars found on him, one of which has a quantity of bird's-eye marks on it which are not generally on cigars.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>). On the evening of December 15th I took Howard at the Waggon and Horses, Thomas Street, Kennington—I told him the charge—he denied it, but afterwards told the prosecutor that if he would allow him to go to the shop he would pay him for all the cigars and tobacco he had taken—I refused that—I found these two cigars and some tobacco on him—he said a young man gave them to him.</p>

I searched Mr. Langley's premises; the outer shutter had been opened, the window had been prised, the shop was in confusion, and tobacco boxes were lying on the floor, and the contents gone—I was present at the station when Howard was brought—he made a statement—I wrote it down and he signed it—I went to Wilson's house next morning and told him the charge, and that Howard, who was in custody, had made a statement incriminating him—on the way to the station he said "I saw Howard get through the window; I only waited outside for the <hi rend="italic">copper"</hi> which means policeman—I then read Howard's statement, pointed to Wilson, and asked him if that was the man he referred to—he said "Yes"—Wilson said nothing.</p>
