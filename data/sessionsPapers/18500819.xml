                  </hi>. I was in the service of Mr. William Andrews, a surgeon, at Islington. On 26th Feb., about two o'clock in the afternoon, I heard a double knock at the door; I went, and saw the prisoner, and an older person—the elder one asked if the doctor was at home—I said he was not—he asked if I could tell him what time he would be at home—I said I did not expect him home till five o'clock—he said he was ill, and required some medicine, and asked if I would allow him to write a note, that the doctor might call upon him; and he and the prisoner went into the parlour of their own accord—I gave him pen, ink, and paper—he said Mrs. Smith was likewise not well, and she had lately been confined—the prisoner had a blue bag in his hand—the other man turned to the prisoner and said, "George, will you write it? you see how ill I am"—the other wrote it, but the prisoner was by—Smith then said, would I oblige him with a glass of water—I turned</p>

               <p>to the sideboard to get a tumbler, and went from there to the surgery to get the water—the sideboard closes in, and the glasses are on it, and the plate-basket stood under it—any person in the room could see the plate-basket when I took the tumbler out of the cupboard—I went into the surgery for the water, and was returning with it in my hand, and Smith met me just within the door—he drank the water very slowly, and remarked how good it was—after he drank it, I went into the parlour, the prisoner was gone, and the door was a little open—Smith seemed quite agitated—in a little time after he was gone, I missed a sovereign from the chimney-piece, which I am certain was there when the prisoner and Smith came in—soon afterwards I missed the plate, fourteen spoons, two sauce-ladles, and other things—they were worth above 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were my master's, and the sovereign also.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived with my aunt Josephine Lebas, at 58, Well-street, Oxford-street. On Wednesday, 12th June, there was a distress put in on my aunt's property—Moody and Jones were placed in possession—they came to the house about twelve o'clock in the day—they distrained the goods—they took the chairs and all that was in the rooms—my aunt occupied two rooms—I saw the things taken down to the cellar—they were the chairs, the table, the bed, the pillows and pillow-cases—after the things had been taken down in the cellar I saw a hat of Moody's, which was left on the floor in my</p>

               <p>aunt's front room—there was a table-cloth of my aunt's in the hat, which I had seen shortly before, in the next room—I took it out of the hat—after the things were taken down in the cellar, Moody took down two birds, and he told me if I went to the landlord, he would give them to me—I was gone a quarter of an hour, or half an hour—when I returned I noticed that Moody'a pockets appeared more bulky than they did before—I saw him go and look in the bed; there was an old black cloak, he said he should like to have it, and another article—I said they were not his to have—he said they were all his things—after that they went away, and locked the door, and told me to go away—my aunt was then in Paris—there was a lady who was sleeping with me—she came up into the room after me while the prisoners were there—she was not there while I went to the landlord to inquire about the birds—there was no one there then but the prisoners—next day I was passing along King-street, and saw some reels of gold in a little tin pan, in the parlour-window of Moody's house—I passed by, and when I came back they were not there—I went and asked Mrs. Moody where they were—she said the children had had them to play with—(she had seen me pass the house before, she was outside talking to a person in the street)—she said her husband would be there by-and-by, and if I liked to come in an hour or two, I should see him—I saw this book there, which I bought—I am not quite sure it is mine, but I really believe it is—I cannot read it—I can read but very little English—I got the assistance of Wood the policeman, and I went and asked Mrs. Moody where the reels were, and I saw she had a shawl on belonging to my aunt—while we were talking, Jones came out with a handkerchief belonging to my aunt on his neck—I told the policeman of it, and Jones went away into the passage, aod while he was away he changed his handkerchief, and appeared with another handkerchief on—after I had seen Mrs. Moody with the shawl on, she went in, and I stood amongst, the people.</p>

               <p>on, the pattern of which was very indistinct—he was asked what he had done with the other handkerchief, and was told he had got another handker<lb/>chief on—he said it was a lie, it was that handkerchief he had had all the day—at the station he was charged with stealing the handkerchief, and was locked up—when I went to the house the witness spoke to Jones, and while she was speaking Mrs. Moody came out, and said, "What is all this bother about?"—Jones said, "She has come about those reels of gold"—she said, "I told her the children had had them;"and she said, "I told you to come when Mr. Moody was at home, and he will account for them"—Mrs. Moody had a shawl, or neck-tie, round her neck, and the witness charged her with having stolen it from her aunt—I said I should be much obliged to her to account for it—she said she would not account for it to me, or to any human being—I said, "On that account, you must go to the station"—she said, "I will see you d——d first;" and she broke from me, and ran into the yard—she remained concealed for some time—after a time she came out, and ran into the first-floor—I went and fetched her out, and she had not then got the shawl on her shoulders—I said, "You must go with me to the station"—she said, "What for?"—I said, "For that shawl you had on your shoul<lb/>ders"—she said, "You must be blind or a fool; I have had none on but what I have now"—she had not any on then—I went into the yard, and put my arm round on the bricks of the water-butt as far as I could reach, and in the angle of the wall I found this shawl—I said, "Here is the shawl that you had"—she said, "What about it?"—I said, "This girl charges you with stealing it from No. 58, Well-street"—she said, "She is a liar, I have had it in my possession two years"—I found it in the same yard that I had seen her go into—she then invited me into her house, and said, "There never was anything brought into my house from No. 58, Well-street, only these reels of gold, that were given to the children to play with, being of no value"—when I first said I must take her to the station, she broke from me; and Jones stepped between me and the door, and said, "I will see and prevent that; you shall not take her to the station"—I afterwards returned to the house for the handkerchief that Jones had round his neck—I did not find that, but I found several things in a large box placed on a shelf over the water-butt—there were these five neck-ties, this eye-glass, two salt-spoons, a pair of scissors, a small copper pan, and a toilet-cover—I afterwards went to Jones,' and searched there—Jones' wife went with me—I have seen her since at the police-court—the house is No. 21 or 22, Lamb's-court—I found there a card-rack, two brass padlocks, a steel bracket, a brass crucifix, a knife and fork, a piece of bed-furniture, and several other things.</p>

               <p>—he said, "I have nothing but what is my own"—I searched him, but found nothing—I said, "You must go with me to your lodgings, I must search them"—he said, "You will find nothing there but what belongs to me"—I went with the prisoner, Mr. Higginbotham, and another officer to his lodgings, at Islington—I asked him which was his room, he showed it to me—I found there a great many table-napkins and towels—I selected from them twelve napkins and one towel marked with Mr. Higginbotham's name—I found some in an adjoining room, which belonged to the prisoner's brother's wife—I asked her, in the prisoner's presence, if they were hers—she said, "No"—I then asked the prisoner how he accounted for the property— he said, "I must have brought them in my pocket, and forgotten to take them back"—I said, "Is it proper for you to bring them away?"—he said, "No, I know it is wrong"—there were also some which had the marks taken out—they had been rubbed where the marks had been—there were long streaks, and some had been rubbed into holes where the name had been written in ink.</p>

I said, "I have given you a night's lodging, and treated you like a brother; what else can you expect?"—he took his oath that he would not give it me unless 1 gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l,;</hi> or he said, "I shall accuse you of an unnatural offence"—I turned round, and found I was locked in, and he had the key in his hand—I felt very much alarmed, and fainted away—when I came to myself, I was sitting on a chair by the side of the bed, and the prisoner was bathing my hand or my head with water—finding I was more collected, he opened all the drawers, and took out two waistcoats, but there was nothing in them—he went to the waistcoat I had worn, and took out 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or more, and put it into his pocket—I got up to snatch the waistcoat from him, and he demanded 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of me again for the watch and chain, or else he would charge me with an unnatural offence, and said that he had made 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by such a job—I said, "I will give you the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if you will let me let you out"—he helped me on with my trowsers and stockings to go down and get it—I could not put them on myself, I was in such a state from excitement and fainting—I opened the door at last, and called for Mr. Sarto, who slept in the room above—he came, and I told him the prisoner had my watch and chain in his pocket, and would not give it me unless I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; or else he would accuse me of an unnatural act—Mr. Sarto said, "I will go and get a police<lb/>man"—the prisoner said, "Yes, that is the best way"—he did not contradict what I said—he said, "You shall not say I have stolen your things, I will put them back again"—he went to the bed, turned them out, and said, "There they are in your dressing-case, now I shall go"—I said, "You shall not go," and tried to prevent him; but he dragged me down, and rushed down-stairs—I found the watch and guard in my dressing-case, but not the money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; Mr. Brown did not ask me to go—he said nothing about losing money when he said the man had his watch and chain—he said he had lost some, either before or while the prisoner was being searched—I think it was while he was being searched—I have not been talking to Mr. Brown about it since—I my have said it was an unpleasant affair.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single—I am the sister of Mary Whittaker Greene—I was present on 2nd February, 1848, when she was married to the prisoner—on 5th August, after it was discovered that he had been married before, I accused him of it, and he said his first wife had been kinder to him than my sister—my sister is about thirty-eight years old—I received this letter from him on 6th August—I know his writing, and believe it to be his—(<hi rend="italic">This letter being principally in French, was translated by Mr. Clerk the bar<lb/>rister as follows: Addressed, Miss E. Green.</hi> "Monday evening.—Made<lb/>moiselle,—I have prayed you almost on my knees to permit me to see for one instant my dear companion that God has given me, my wife, in your pre<lb/>sence. You have not had the heart to grant me this last favour. I swear before God that there exists no mortal being who dared to prevent me. You have not chosen that this should be done under the cloak of discretion, that all the blame should fall on you. To the insults which I have received from a member of the family I attach no importance at all. I regret that innocent persons have had to suffer for your obstinacy. I understand that it was easy to frighten a child with a policeman, but not me. Hide yourself—hide your sister, my cherished wife, if it appears good to you, but nothing in the world will prevent me from reclaiming her from you—it signifies not where you may go, even to Australia. You would not act so while you inhabited the house of that noble old man who is no longer in this world; and when you write to me that I wish my marriage to be kept secret, and let your sister disclose it to her family when she thinks proper; and when you pray me not to come to Richmond, that it would be only injuring you; and if the Colone✗) knew any<lb/>thing the consequences for you would be dreadful. I have not those letters, and what I heard of this morning at Richmond I dare not repeat. Bring me before any court of justices if you please, you will not spare the money, you will not find a jury to acquit you. I have friends who will protect me, but I promise you the public will have an historical romance to write which will not be a little interesting. There remains but little time for you to reflect before taking your part—reflect well. I insist once more to see my wife; refuse me if you dare.—I have the honour to be, &amp;c")</p>

My Lord, I was in the battle with Nelson when he lost his life; I am now turned seventy-one years of age; I have been sorely wounded in the head, that I am at times in a deranged state of mind. My Lord, I am innocent of the crime laid to my charge; I have only been six weeks discharged from the strong-room in the Infirmary of Greenwich Hospital, which can be proved by Sir John Liddell, the doctor of Greenwich Hospital; I trust in God, my Lord, you and my prosecutors will show me mercy, and send me down to Greenwich, and they will keep me confined at the hospital; I have an only daughter; I am afraid it will break her heart if I am sent to prison; I hope, my Lord, you will show me mercy for God's sake, as we all expect mercy from God; I can assure you I know not what I have done, or what has been done.—Your humble petitioner, Dixon Dawson. My Lord and Gentlemen, your most humble petitioner states that it is upwards of sixty years ago since I first went to sea; the first engagement I was in was the landing of the British troops in Egypt, in 1801, when Sir Ralph Abercrombie lost his life; the next was in the year 1803, in cutting out of Cape Legat a large armed schooner full of Spanish and French troops, and I received many severe blows on the head, which caused me to be in a deranged state of mind now I have advanced in years, and at times to be very troublesome; I likewise was on board the <hi rend="italic">Victory,</hi> in the battle of Trafalgar, with my Lord Nelson, when he fell wounded; I likewise was wounded at the same time, and fell close to him on the quarter-deck of the <hi rend="italic">Victory,</hi> on that glorious day, 21st Oct., 1805; and in 1807, I was in Gaeta, in Italy, when the French army stormed the fort I was in, and there I was slightly wounded in four places; and was at the taking of the Island of Capua, the mouth of Naples Bay; from there went to land Generals Moore and Fox on the Calabria shore, and beat the French army</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185008190047"/>
               <p>back into Naples; from there I was sent with Sir Samuel Hood, to take Madeira, which we did succeed; and was engaged off Guadaloupe, in the West Indies, with two frigates, French, and seven batteries on our ship for two hours and forty minutes; and likewise burning two frigates be<lb/>longing to the French, and taking the island of Martinique, in 1809; came home to England, and was sent on board the <hi rend="italic">Fatale Minotaur,</hi> seventy-four guns; I was one of the first men on board the eleven Danish gun-boats, that our ships destroyed by fire under the batteries of Copenhagen. In coming to England our ship was lost, and 600 men with her; I had to swim three miles, and was two hours and three-quarters in the sea before I got on Camperdown, made prisoner-of-war of, and sent to France; remained nearly four years in Valenciennes, half-starved, and when the French were in full retreat from Moscow we were marched 600 miles in that dreadful winter in 1814, through frost and snow, and almost naked, and nearly starved. My Lord, I was never in prison in my life for any crime till now; I hope and trust in God that some humane gentleman will come forward and plead my cause, and snatch two human beings from the brink of ruin; the daughter from a broken heart, and the father that will never be able to look up any more through disgrace; if Mr. Hawes is in Court, I call on him to be so kind as to give me a character since 1816 to July, 1850, and I will for ever pray for all. My Lord and gentlemen, I hope you will help me in the means of procuring a gentleman of the law to plead for me; I am afraid, if I am found guilty, of losing my home for life."</p>

To Miss Dawson, No. 24, Roupell-street, Cornwall-road, Lambeth, Surrey")—at the time he wrote this, his hearing and sight were not restored—he is deaf now; I have been obliged to get permission to have him close to the rails of the prison, to make him hear—a fortnight or less after writing that letter, he came to my house, and said he was quite in want of refreshments; he had come up for four days, and mast be nursed like a baby, and I must do it—he raved so for different people to be fetched that I thought it best to send for them, and when they came he scarcely spoke to them—I tried to get him home at the end of the four days, but he would not go—he went out for an hour or two, to go to Chelsea, and lost him<lb/>self, and did not come home till six o'clock at night; next day he was so much worse, his face was so red, that I was afraid he would go raving mad, and got him out—he said he had met with an omnibus-man who would take him down to Greenwich for 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I wanted to see the man, and he got in a passion, and set out to go by the train; then he said he would walk—I got him to a public-house in the Kent-road, and when I told him he must go home, he stamped and raved, and the police came; he went through the pub<lb/>lic-house out at the other door—I got him a good way down the Kent-road, and he would go no further, and I was obliged to go to Walworth with him to see a person to get him borne, and we went by the train to Greenwich-Hospital; I was from eleven o'clock till four getting him home—shortly after he came to me again, and said he had come for four days more—I was very much surprised, as I knew if he had his senses he would know I was not able to keep him; he came on Wednesday and staid till Thursday afternoon—he made this paper out at my house (<hi rend="italic">produced;</hi>) it has the name of Mr. Rivers on it, he is a lieutenant—I thought it was a forgery, and sent it to Mr. Williams at the Discount-office, and told him to take no notice of it; he said he would not—that was about the middle of May—he once sent me two looking-glasses and a pair of plated candlesticks, and said that he should come home with his pockets full of gold, and then how I should smile—"Mary," he said, "you will never believe me, but you will see what I shall give you. I will take a farm; what would you like?—should you like a farm? we can get one for eighty pounds a year, and you shall have a servant to wait on you, and nothing to do but to ring the bell; for you have worked long enough and hard enough"—at that time I am sure we could not produce five shillings between the two of us—when the man brought the glasses I said, "I have my bonnet on now to get him confined at Greenwich; take them away, do not let him see"—I went to Mr. Williams again, and got the loan-paper to take to Greenwich, to show that he was not in his right mind, but was too late to get it—I was told I must send him down by a policeman, for they could not interfere—I did not do so, because I was afraid he would be worse—I came home and found him stretched out in the passage, across the door<lb/>way, with his hat doubled up under his head, and he wanted to stay there all night—in the morning I persuaded him to get up at seven o'clock, and get off, and I understood from him that he was called before the council, but he came back the same day; one of the neighbours ran to tell me he was in the streets again—I ran after him, got him home, and kept him that day and part of the next—he kept wandering from one doctor to another, saying, "What</p>

               <p>a dreadful state my head is in, all faces coming before my eyes!"—after chapel on Sunday evening I heard he was driving about in a cab—I conld not find him—I went to Tower-street station, and told the police to take him up, and take him to Greenwich—they sent for me, and I found he was started off to Greenwich—I followed and found him in the guard-house; he had been away all Saturday, Sunday, and Monday night (Whit-Monday)—I saw him again on the Sunday after—he said, "What a while you have been coming! have you got the money? if you had only let me stop in town I should have got the money"—he said to Mr. Williams, who was going to London, "Will you send me the money?"—Mr. Williams said, "Yes"—at the time he wrote the paper proposing the repayment in two months, he had not the slightest means of repayment—on the Sunday week, after Whit-Monday, he begged me to give him some money; I gave him twopence—he seemed thoroughly rejoiced, and said, "Now I have got money"—next day he sent me a letter, but I did not take it in; I knew there was nothing of importance in it—I asked him afterwards what he sent the letter for; he said he wanted some money—three weeks after I had him confined I found him standing in my street, in a pouring rain, looking for me; he went wandering about to see if he could get some money—I never knew him signing people's names before he got bad in his head; a stricter honest man never was, he used to take my clothes home—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is his writing; it is from another loan-office (the Waterloo)—I sent to them and told them he was insane, but they took his money, three shillings, and told me they should give me in charge of the police if I insisted on having it back—I never knew him apply for money before he got bad in his head—he was very contented, and when he obtained the situation of mate in Nelson's Ward, he rejoiced because he could help me.</p>

I said, "Being so far off, business has prevented me"—he said quickly, "You could not let us have a sovereign on account, could you?"—he asked if a young woman had been there about him—I said, "Why do you ask?"—he said, "My daughter will come about me, but take no notice of her, for she is as mad as a March hare"—he appeared to me to be not in his right mind—the form has never been filled up properly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician, and medical-inspector of Greenwich Hospital. Mr. Littleton was the gentleman in attendance when the prisoner was brought down—I did not see him for four days after his arrival—he was then in the strong-room, which would be appointed for a madman, but it is a ward like the others—I questioned him repeatedly—he said his father had left him 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said nothing about 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it would be very diffi<lb/>cult for me to give an opinion whether the evidence given to-day indicates insanity upon some one point, because the whole of it might have been produced by intemperance—if he was proved not to be intemperate, then I should have a greater suspicion of insanity—I cannot discover any wounds on his head, but they may have existed previously.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> It was reported to you, on the authority of the daughter, that he was out of his mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; she did not say so; she said he behaved so wildly that she was afraid of him, and had brought him down to me—I placed him in a part of the building which would give me faci<lb/>lities for watching him; it is a case of daily occurrence in the hospital—I saw no indication of his having suffered from <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—it would not be apparent, except when the paroxysms were on him—it is the result of pro<lb/>tracted intemperance generally, and from accidents—I had not known him before in the hospital—if he had had any attack of any kind he would have been brought to me—I discharged him from the Infirmary.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are persons insane sometimes on one topic, and quite rational on all others? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; if a person said he was a captain in the Navy, and wanted to marry a pauper, I should have great suspicion of his sanity;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185008190052"/>
               <p>but he might have some object in view—I am not able to say whether at his time of life <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> might come on in consequence of previous intemperance which had been since abandoned—it generally results from intemperance that has been continued for a few days, but I should not say above a week—when it has once got into insanity it would be liable to break out at times again—a man is always liable to its recurrence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing he was deluded with the notion that he was made a captain when he was not, would not that indicate that his mind was not right? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would—intemperance is a very common cause of incurable insanity—the receptacles for insane persons are half filled with persons who owe their condition to their intemperance, and more especially as respects naval insanity—I think drinking porter and ale much more likely to cause it than spirits—if a man had led a drunken life up to three years ago, that would not be likely to produce a want of health in the mind now, if his health had been in a state of integrity up to that period.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fur-skin dresser, in business with my mother. I went on 9th July with Mr. Hatch to the prisoner's premises—Mrs. Turner was there—we asked the prisoner what he had done with the mink skins belonging to Mr. Hatch—he said, "I have not seen any mink skins"—Mr. Hatch said that he had, and I also said that he had—Mrs. Turner said, "You know you received mink skins from my husband; you know you came two or three times to our house, and I met you in Skinner-street, bargaining for skins in the street"—the prisoner said, "Well, Turner did come here and left a parcel of skins here: I did not know how many there were; I lent him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on them; he came again and took them away"—I said, "Why did you not tell Mr. Hatch this morning?"—he said, "That is my business; I do business in my own way; I lent the man 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on them, and he came and took them away, and what can you make of that?"—he said he did not know the number of skins—I said, "That is a very strange way of doing business, that you should take in skins, and lend money on them, without knowing how many there were"—he then made the remark to Mr. Hatch, that he took in goods of anybody without asking questions, and be did business in his own way—I got 168 mink skins from Turner's place.</p>

On 25th July, about ten minutes to one o'clock, I was in Church-street, Islington, and saw the prisoners, and two others going towards the Lower-road, in a direction from Barnsbury-mews—Bennett had something under his arm, wrapped up in two old handerchiefs, and Lewis appeared to have something under his coat—I caught Bennett, and asked him what he had there, he said, "Nothing"—I took this plane from under his arm—I asked where he got it, he refused to give any answer—I knew him before—I took him to the station—the other three ran away—at the police-court he said he bought the plane of a man of the name of White, and gave 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Grove, at Ealing. I am no relation of the deceased Elizabeth Wallis—she was a daughter of the prisoner by her first husband, and was about seventeen years old—they lived in Ealing-grove opposite to me—the prisoner had six children living by her second marriage—she is a laundress—the deceased died on Thursday night, 8th Aug.—I saw bruises on her—I saw her ill-treated by her mother about six months before her death, but not much since that—she was ill five weeks—she had been attended by the medical man of the parish—about six months before she died I saw the prisoner give her a blow at the top of the stairs, from the effect of which she fell down the whole flight, about ten steps—she followed her down, and beat her again with her hand for about a minute—she cried out—she was perfectly healthy then—I have not at other times seen her beat her more than is usual with mothers—about twelve months ago I saw her beaten with a rope across the shoulders, as if to correct her—she was not allowed to take her meals with the rest of the family when I have seen them—I have seen her have a piece of dry bread where they had meat—I have seen her mother throw her a piece of bread in another room where she was at work, when the others were eating their dinner, potatoes, or perhaps bread and meat—she did not complain to me till the day before her death—I was with her when she died—I tried to impress upon her mind that she was dying, and said I hoped she would pray to Almighty God for pardon, for I thought her time in this world would be very short, and if she had committed any faults she had better pray for pardon—she said she hoped she should be forgiven—I put several questions to her about trifling things which I was aware she had done, and asked her with regard to the truth of them, and she satisfied me so far that I told her if she made confession of it openly she would not have so much to answer for, and I hoped she would pray to Almighty God to pardon her—she repeated the Lord's Prayer, and some part of the Creed—I asked her if she realty felt she should die, and she said yes, she did think so—she then complained of being very hungry—I said, "Have you any meat?"—she said, "There is a mutton chop in that basket, but you had better not cook it, in case mother may not like it"—I said, "Never mind, the blame shall be laid to me"—I cooked half of it, which she ate, and some potatoes—I then said, "I do not think you will get the better of your illness"—she said she thought she was going—I said, "Going where?"—she said she did not know—I asked her if she thought that she should go to heaven if she died—she said she did not know—(<hi rend="italic">Thc Court did not consider there was ground for thinking she knew she was dying, and therefore excluded her statement</hi>)—the Inquest was on Saturday, the 10th—the body was at the mother's house—I heard the prisoner say, in the tap-room of the King's Arms, that if she got her liberty she would go home and throw the b——r out of window,<hi rend="italic">box</hi> and all—the coffin was there at that time—I had helped to put the corpse into it before that—I do not think she was called in at the Inquest, she was in the tap-room—in going to the station she told her husband he was not to follow the corpse to the grave; if he did, she would remember it when she came out; and if any one was suffered to go into the house, she would not live with him any more when she</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of Ealing, and act for the parish. On 11th July, I received an order to attend the deceased, and found her suffering from cold and fever at her mother's—she was up, as far as I recollect—I gave her medicine, and attended her up to her death on the 8th Aug.—I was not present at the inquest—I was directed to make a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I did so—the cause of death was inflammation of the air-tubes of the lungs—the other parts were healthy—she was suffering from inflammation of the chest during the whole time I attended her—that could not have existed more than five weeks—I found no bruises of any consequence; they were wearing off—they had been inflicted at least ten days or a fortnight; to the best of my judg-ment</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185008190072"/>
               <p>they were inflicted after I saw her—there were three on the shin, one very slight one on the lower part of the thigh, and a slight puffiness on the scalp—I examined the ear by the Coroners' direction, and found a swelling—I could not determine whether it was a congenital effect, or caused by violence at some remote period—it might have been born with her—the treatment I have heard of might have brought the body into that state of debility which would render her more liable to any exciting cause; to the effect of cold; anything which would depress the constitutional energy, would render the patient more liable—ill-treatment would aggravate the inflammation—she was not in a state to be up—the whole time I attended her I directed her to keep in bed, but used to find her up.</p>

I am a servant, at 16, Hopkins-street—I knew the de<lb/>ceased—on 29th June I was looking out of window, and saw a mob of persons right opposite—I went up the court, and saw Robinson accusing the deceased of stealing her dress—she denied it and called her a very bad name—she was turning away from her, and a female standing by told her to turn back and give her a good beating, if she did not give her the ticket of her dress—I saw Robinson strike her, and she struck Robinson, and tried to bite her foot, and to prevent her foot from being bitten she struck her somewhere in the face, and she fell with her head against the wall—it did not seem a very violent blow—they struggled very much for about ten minutes in the passage—I have been examined before—I have always given the same account—I saw the other prisoner there about five or ten minutes afterwards—I saw her strike the deceased in the left eye, take her by the hair of the head and knock her against the wall—I saw both the prisoners kick the girl when she was down, not at the same time; they were not both there at the same time— Johanna was not there for ten minutes after Robinson—they appeared sober—after Johanna had struck her she sat on the step of a door—there was a very great crowd—her nose bled—I then left.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon in Marlborough-street, West-minster. On 4th July I was called to see the deceased, at 2, Hopkins-street—she was lying on a bed in the parlour—she complained of severe headache, more particularly of the left side—I had her removed to the infirmary at the workhouse, and attended her there until the 21st, when she died—I first of all found a discharge from the ear, subsequently an abscess under the temporal muscle, on the left side of the head, and finally she died in a state of coma—I could not positively say how long previous the injury causing the swelling had been inflicted; it might probably have arisen from violence sustained a few days previously, but it was not necessarily the result of violence at all, from anything that appeared—I mean a person may have an abscess under the temporal muscle arising from other causes than violence, from internal causes possibly—it might possibly arise from constitutional causes, but it is not very probable—the pain never left the side of the head and ear until she became insensible—I made a post-mortem examination on the 22nd—I first examined the abscess under the temporal muscle—that had been emptied; I had cut it before she died, but there was a considerable sac, which had held a large quantity of pus—I also found an abscess in the middle of the brain, which contained about four ounces of pus—that was close to the abscess under the temporal muscle—the abscess on the brain was clearly the cause of death—that might have been caused by external violence—it need not necessarily have been of recent date; but the only opinion I formed of that circumstance was from the account that was given at the inquest—if she had had disease of the ear for two or three years I should have formed a different opinion—it is quite possible that a kick or a blow given three or four days before I first saw her might have caused the abscess—the other organs of the body were all perfectly healthy—there was nothing to account for death but the abscess on the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Viewing her as you first saw her, there was nothing to indicate that the abscess was the result of violence more than of constitu<lb/>tional or other causes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was not—there was no ecchymosis, nor any abrasions of the skin—an ill-cared-for girl, living on bad food, and sleep<lb/>ing out at night, would be liable to disease of the ear, or anything of that kind.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How far was the abscess under the temporal muscle from that on the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The bone only intervened, the <hi rend="italic">periosteum</hi> was denuded on both sides, destroyed by disease—my impression was that the two abscesses were connected, that the one depended on the other—I think it quite possible that a degree of violence might have been inflicted on the brain itself, so as to destroy some portion of the bone, and then the part so destroyed might have become the nucleus of an abscess; and in that case, the part exterior to the bone might also become the seat of an abscess—this is mere matter of opinion—on the other hand, it is quite possible that it might be produced by a long-standing disease of the ear—assuming that the girl was well on the morning of the day she received the blows, then I can form no other opinion than that all this mischief depended on the same cause, namely the violence then inflicted—blows of considerable violence do sometimes produce the evils which in this case arose—they commonly leave some external mark to show where they have been inflicted, but not always—some of the most severe</p>

               <p>contusions are not attended with exterior marks—I never knew, in my own experience, of a kick being given without leaving marks, but I know it as a matter of medical history—if the head was knocked against a wall, I should expect that abrasion would be produced, but I know that sometimes bones are broken without the skin being either abrased or ecchymosed—if the girl had received a kick in the head a few days before I saw her, it is quite possible that that might account for the mischief I saw.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the divisional surgeon. I was called to the Leman-street station, about three o'clock in the morning of 25th June—I found Moseley lying on his back with a deep wound on the outer and fore<lb/>part of the left thigh—it was about three inches in length, and I should think about an inch and a half in depth at the centre of the wound—it was an oblique wound—I did not ascertain that there was any other wound at that time, but when he was undressed at home I found a small very unimportant wound in the arm-pit—the serious wound was that in the thigh—it was a clean incised wound—it was not free from danger, though there was no large artery implicated—it was not in a dangerous part—had it been the ianer part of the thigh, instead of the outer, it might have reached the femoral artery—it was about a fortnight before it healed—I have attended him ever since—he is now too ill to be examined—I cannot refer his present illness to the wound simply—on the third day after this outrage he had an attack of inflammation of the lungs, and that has been of a very serious character—he has been delirious for some time—that would not result from the incised wound, decidedly—it might be caused partly by the outrage, and I rather think he was exposed to a draught of cold air afterwards.</p>

I said, "Yes;" he said, "I wish I had the hanging of every b—y Irishman in London," at the same time he threw the bottle away, and turned down Charles-street into Greenwood-street; I lost my senses directly afterwards; I have a slight recollection of the sergeant coming up, but I have no recollection of what happened afterwards, till I found myself handcuffed at the station next day; I then did not know where I was till I called to the</p>

                  </hi>. I am gate-keeper at Messrs. Joseph Somes and Frederick Somes's dock, at Poplar. On 2nd Aug. I went with another man to seek for a pump—I came to a ditch, 300 or 400 yards from Messrs. Somes's—when we got near it we heard a knocking, and when we got a little further on, the four prisoners, who were in the ditch, rose up, and walked away—they saw us—we walked after them, and then they all ran as fast as they could—we followed them, got help, and gave them into custody—we went back to the ditch, and found these two pieces of the pump there—I know it, and have no doubt of its being the prosecutors'—I found these chisels, a hammer, and another piece of the pump, in another ditch, a little distance off—I know all the prisoners by sight—Hillier has worked on the prosecutors' premises.</p>

The prisoner was his pot-man up to 15th Aug.—I had missed a key of the till about a month ago, while he was in our service, and I had got another key—I did not have the lock altered—I missed money from the till, and charged the prisoner with robbing it—he denied it—on the Saturday night before I went before the Magistrate, I put a sovereign and a half into a canvas bag, which I put into the far end of the till, and locked it with the key that I still kept—on the Tuesday or Wednesday I missed it—I had kept the key myself—after that I discharged the prisoner—on 17th Aug., the morning I went before the Magistrate, I spoke to a constable, and while I was speaking the prisoner came up—I asked him if he would give up that key that he had access to my till with—he said he had not got any key—the policeman asked him to show what he had got in his pockets, and he pulled out some tickets belonging to me, copper tickets which my husband gives to workmen—I knew them—the prisoner said that Kelly and two other men had each given him one—he had six, and he accounted only for three—he used to receive the tickets from the men for beer—when they were brought to me I used to keep them in the same till from which I lost the bag—I saw the bag at the station—this is it.</p>

The prisoner was employed about five months in my factory, as a marble paper maker—I do not know exactly the number of these papers; they are something short of half a ream—they are mine—I know them by these white marks about them, which were the occasion of their being thrown out as spoiled—it was manufactured by the prisoner, and when I made complaint of these marks, his reply was, "It is no fault of mine; you have used my trough for oil"—I missed this paper on Monday morning, 29th July, but this is not the paper I missed first—I had seen this safe on the Friday night, at seven o'clock, and had the whole of it through my hands—it was either ten or twelve sheets short of half a ream—I am quite sure it is mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married, and am forewoman to Mr. Myers, a government store-dealer, in Castle-street, Whitechapel. On 22nd July, I left the premises locked up, at seven o'clock, leaving the coats, metal, and writing—desk safe, and this metal (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—we had 1150 of these brass things, and I missed such next morning—these rags (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) have the Government mark on them—there is no particular mark besides, but we had such on the premises—this handkerchief is my master's, and was in one of these coat-pockets—I went to the premises next morning at seven o'clock, and found a candle and lucifer under the counting-house window, in which there were marks of some one having entered there—a large pane of glass had been broken before, and a board had been placed before it; that had been pushed away, so that any one could get in without breaking anything—they had got through the count<lb/>ing-house window with this knife—the window that was broken was about as high as a one-pair window from the ground.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber. On 13th Aug., between two and three o'clock in the morning, I went to see a friend home to Westminster—two other friends were with us—we went to the Bell, in York-street, ordered some refreshment, and while we were sitting there a young woman came running up to me, crying, and asked me if I would protect her from the prisoner, as he wanted to rob her—I told her 1 did not know about protecting her, as I knew a young man who had got into trouble for so doing, but if she liked to stand by me I would see that no injury came to her—the prisoner was then within hearing, and came up to me, and asked what I had to do with her, and hit me in the nose, which made it bleed—I struck him again repeatedly, and when he found I was too much the master he up with his foot, and kicked me in the privates—I reeled to the bur—I was in such pain that I could not stand—the landlord immediately put the gas out—one of my friends opened the door—I was led out, and tat on the step of an omnibus in the yard—I afterwards went to one of the witnesses' house, but did not go to bed—on going to work, at half-past six, I went to the public-house, saw the prisoner there, and asked him how he could use me in such a cruel manner, and the answer was a repetition of it, if I had not stooped, and caught it on my shins—I struck him again, and he ran away, saying I was too much for him—I thought it was all over; I was leaning on the bar, and all at once he rushed at me with a knife between his fingers—I did not see any<lb/>thing, but I thought my eye was pierced out—I was taken to the station, with the prisoner, and from there to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at 71, High-street, White<lb/>chapel. On 24th July, Mr. Elphinstone handed to me a small portion of a jam-tart, which I have here—I examined it—it contained a considerable quantity of cantharides—they were bruised, not powdered—I found portions of several flies; they are of a golden green colour—the effect upon a person from taking a quantity of cantharides, would be to produce very violent pain in the stomach, in fact the whole of the alimentary canal would suffer; it is an irritant poison—if the proportion in the rest of the tart was the same as it is in this, it would produce most alarming symptoms, and would probably lead to fatal effects—there is a great difference of opinion as to the amount requisite to destroy life—a very small quantity will have a fatal effect with some—with others it might pass off without any injurious, or perhaps slight, symptoms—that would depend upon the predisposition to irritability in the patient—I think a quantity put into a tart in the same proportion as this, would be destructive to life—I have attended Mrs. King—the symptoms under which she laboured, correspond with those which would be produced by taking cantharides—she is still in a very delicate state, and is labouring now from the effects—the piece of tart that was left, was something less than a half-crown in size.</p>

               <p>Trower, and Co.—I was given in charge when you were employed in that case, until I was arrested—I was discharged the following day, and arrested as soon as I was discharged—I do not believe I was ever charged with obtaining the wine-warrants by false pretences—I was given in charge by a person without character, reputation, or anything else in the world; a person that was paid for it, until they could get to arrest me.</p>

Lee, the same as this, and Mr. Lee in another Court has sworn, that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185008190111"/>
               <p>he never gave such a bill—I gave that bill back to Mr. Lee after it became due—I got another bill for it, and gave the difference, and gave the bill back to Mr. Lee, not to Goldsworthy—Mr. Lee did not pay the money—Golds<lb/>worthy brought me a bill for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., out of which I gave him the difference of the money, and took the bill for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back, but it happened to be in the hands of the acceptor at that time, and when I received it back I gave it to Mr. Lee, and he made no comment on the subject—I should not have taken these bills if he had said that was a forgery—he received the bill back not as a forgery, but as a genuine bill, and afterwards swore it was a forgery—that is my explanation—that is as true as that Mr. Lee gave me an acceptance at Euston-square in blank for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How could it be in blank, if it was for 60<hi rend="italic">l.? A.</hi> I met Mr. Lee at Webb's Hotel, where I was stopping; he said he wanted to borrow some money: from his high position in society, his father being so wealthy a man, I could scarcely credit that he wanted money; however, I saw him again in the afternoon, and he said, "I want 50<hi rend="italic">l;"</hi> I said, "What will you give for it?" he said, "I will give you 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., draw a bill at two months;" I said, "I will go and get you the money:" I went to a friend of mine, a monied man; he was at dinner; I said, "Have you got 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in your pocket? I have got the best man in England," for I considered Mr. Lee the richest man in Liverpool; when I got back to Webb's Hotel, he had gone to the station, I got into a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and followed him there, and he wrote, "60" not in the place where it is generally written, but in that place; and he wrote his name across the bill, in blank; I gave him the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on the bargain that he was to give 60<hi rend="italic">l.:</hi> he asked that himself, I should have let him have it for less if he had asked me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Samuel Howis Castle, of Turnham-green. His furniture was to be sold on Wednesday, 31st July—it was to be seen on the 30th—the prisoner came about one o'clock that day—I went up-stairs with him, and showed him the furniture—I came down with him to the drawing-room—there was a lady there—I saw the prisoner take up a cruet-stand from the drawing-room table—he took this mustard-pot out of the stand, and put the stand down on the table, but not the mustard-pot—there was no mustard in the pot, but there was a silver spoon—he went down<lb/>stairs directly—I ran down to the men, who were at dinner in the kitchen, and told what I had seen—Robert Bass ran after the prisoner, and he was brought back—he went down on his hands and knees, and said, if Mr. Castle would let him off, he would try and find the mustard-pot—they went away together, towards the Duke of Devonshire—this is the mustard-pot(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is Mr. Castle's.</p>

I let Steffan in when he came with Kessler, he remained eight days—Kessler used to come; I have seen him there twice in one day—I do not know whether he came every day, he came frequently; sometimes he rang the bell, and sometimes opened the door—the door was kept shut—I did not see a key in his hand—it is usual in our house for each lodger to have a key—I do not know of any other way of Kessler having a key except from Steffan—the only time Steffan went out was the next evening to the one he came, at a little after nine.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, D</hi> 7). I apprehended Steffan—I asked him if he could speak English—he said "A little"—I told him the charge against him was stealing gold-dust at the other end of the town—he said he did not have the gold-dust; it was Homann had it—I took him to the station, went to Kessler's and found him there—I asked him if he knew any<lb/>thing about Steffan; he said no, he did not—I asked him if he knew anything about the gold-dust robbery that had taken place at the east-end of the town—he said no—I said, "You must know something about Steffan; you recommended him to a lodging, and I am a sergeant of police, and have now got him in custody for the robbery"—he said he recollected recommending a person to a lodging, as he did at other times when he was full—I took no further trouble about it—I thought it very feasable, as they do that at that end at the town—I called the following morning and requested him to attend at the police-court, as I thought he would be wanted.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Thomas Webb, of West Ham. On 6th July, between twelve and one o'clock in the day, I was com<lb/>ing out of his yard—I saw Thompson open Mr. Stevens's gate, which is opposite Mr. Webb's, and the prisoner came out with a truss of hay on his back—I noticed the hay and followed him, and saw him take it to his father's—I went to his father's yard with a constable about an hour after, and found two trasses of hay—I believe the top truss of the two was the one the pri<lb/>soner was carrying; I believe it to be Mr. Thomas Webb's—the way it came to be in Mr. Stevens's yard was, because Mr. Stevens lent Mr. Webb his chaff-cutting machine, ours being broken—the hay went to Mr. Stevens's yard to be cut: I saw some there.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Clayhill-farm, Plum-lane, Shooter's Hill. I commenced living there about Christmas, 1848—I was put in by Mrs. Lidgbird, to do the best I could with the farm, and afterwards I was to have a lease of it for twenty-one years, if it answered—it was in as bad a state as it could be; everything was all to pieces—the landlady had the house repaired, and I had the painting and papering inside to do, stoves, and everything put into the house, built a stable and pigery—the farm was of about forty-six acres, and the cultivation had been very much neglected—there had been a person of the name of Wynn in it—I expended on the repairs of the house and on the land about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw Mr. Dallen, the clergyman of Shooter's Hill, Mrs. Lidgbird's son-in-law, about the farm—in Oct., 1849, Mr. Dallen came to me, and said Mrs. Lidgbird was in want of a little money, and would be glad if I could let her have a little—I sent her 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—nothing had been said about the rent for the farm until such time as I had the lease—there was something mentioned, but there was no kind of writing <hi rend="italic">whatsumever</hi>—on</p>

               <p>5th June last I was in the occupation of the farm—I had gone on cultivating and attending to it properly up to that time—there were several horses, and a cow or two, on the farm, two pigs, and one cart—I had furniture in the house, and my wife and six children resided with me—I had no servant—about March or April a distress had been put in for rent—they took the ploughs, harrows, breaks, and everything they could—if they had been fairly told, they would have been worth nearly 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but the ploughs, which cost me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., were sold for about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the harrows at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a piece—a man named Cahan seized them—I have received no account of that sale—on 5th June, about twelve o'clock in the day, the defendant, Graham, came to the door, and demanded 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, as rent, for Mrs. Lidgbird—I told him I did not see what business I had to pay any rent—he then went behind the house, and gave a whistle, and the four other defendants came running in directly, like to many wild beasts—Binks is a broker—I then went to the sty, and turned two pigs out into the yard—Hitchcock said, "Lock the b—up," and he went to take the pigs out of the yard—I went to shy a brick to drive the pigs back, to stop them, and it hit Hitchcock on the leg—I had told them the first thing to quit the premises, and I told them so several times, and asked what authority they had—they made no answer, but "Look him up"—Graham pulled a paper out of his pocket, something about this money—he said he wanted the rent for Mrs. Lidgbird—it was a bit of brick I threw which hit Hitchcock, not a brick—he then pulled off his coat, and challenged me to fight—Mrs. Cook was present in the yard at the time—I believe the children were in-doors, but do not know—Mrs. Cook came out of the house at the same time the men came rushing in—Hitchcock laid hold of a stick which laid in the yard, and ran after me with it; and I ran and picked up another at the back of the house, and defended myself with it—Harris also had a stick, and they all came on me together, saying, "Kill the b—"—I drove them all back, out into the yard, and from the yard into the lane—Harris there pinned me by the arms, and Hitchcock struck me on the head with the stick, and gave me a wound two inches long—I went to Mr. Turner's, a surgeon, afterwards—they then went into the village, and fetched two policemen to lock me up—the blood flowed from my head like a fountain—my wife washed my head, and had some difficulty in stopping the blood—the wound was very painful; I suffered from it for about three weeks, it is healed now—the prisoners did not go away, they remained about the premises, smoking and drinking a good deal, in the stables and in the garden—they were there seven days, night and day, all the five of them—now and then a <hi rend="italic">refreshing</hi> came, and the others went away, but they came back again—on the night of the 8th, Hitchcock and Harris attempted to break into the house, at a quarter-past one—I was outside, watching—they lifted up the window, and tried to force open the shutters—the other men were walking round the front of the house at the time—at the end of the seven days, they took away seven horses, and pigs, and a cart, and a quantity of harness—the horses were grass horses that I had, and belonged to other persons—two belonged to a dealer, that I do not believe had been on the farm, but they drove them on—I cannot say exactly what they did take, but I should say it was to the value of nearly 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received an account of the sale some few days after<lb/>wards—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is signed "William Graham," and states they were sold for 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

Mr. Dallen lives with her—I was put into the farm to do the best I could—they talked of rent when I took up the lease, but I never did—there was a bother about getting a man named Wynne out before I took it—I think when I took up the lease the rent was to be about 91<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it might have been 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I cannot say—if the farm turned out to our satisfaction I was to have a lease for twenty-one years—I had to lay out a good deal on it—I sold two houses for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Mr. Davis's estate—I had to pay a mortgage on them, but I got 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the mortgage might be about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I had got money to pay it—I went in between Christmas and March, about the middle of the quarter—I was to pay no rent till they granted me the lease—no time was fixed for granting it—I was to get the land into working order—I did not expect I was to pay a farthing—they were afraid to make any agreement because another man holds the lease, and how could they grant me one; I did not know that at the time—the first distress was about twelve months after I went in—up to that time I had paid nothing; not of rent kind—Mrs. Lidgbird sent down to me, saying she wanted some money, and I sent her up 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and this is the receipt she sent me back (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I sent it out of kindness—I do not know whether it was lent, paid, or given—I thought, perhaps, she might have been short of money—I believe she is a lady of for<lb/>tune—I thought we might arrange it somehow between us—it was neither given or paid—I thought we might come to some terms on different things—she put in the distress in March, for rent from March 1849, to March 1850—I did not replevy—I ordered the broker off the premises, and put him off—I shoved him off—he did not get his head broken—I did not strike him—he rolled over a small lump of dirt by the gate, and caught his heels as I pushed him back, and fell on his back—he was not one of the parties who distrained the second time—perhaps he had had enough of it—the greatest part of the land is grass land, and about fifteen acres of ploughing land—I have had no crops off it—how could I, when they took my ploughs and harrows away—I have had a little hay off the grass land—the two pigs were worth about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not let them out of the sty to prevent them being distrained, but because it is a thing we very often do in the yard—I should have let them out if Graham had not come—I threw the brick to stop them, to turn them back—Hitchcock could run as fast after he was hit as he did before—I might have pitched two pieces of brick; I do not know—the second did not touch the man or go near him—I did not have a bill-hook in my hand—there was one on the chopping-block at the back of the house—I will swear Hitchcock did not wrest it from my hands—I never had it in my hand—Hitchcock took it off the block at the time he took the stick—I hit Hitchcock and Harris with the stick, but the one they hit me with was as big again—I hit Harris on the hand, I think, and Hitch<lb/>cock on the thumb or finger—I went to the doctor the same day—I was afterwards summoned before the Magistrate, at Woolwich, by Hitchcock and Harris, and charged with an assault on Hitchcock with the bill-hook, and a further assault on Harris—the prisoners all gave evidence against me, and was bound over to answer the charge at the session—I immediately went before the Grand jury here, and preferred this charge against all five—I had previously taken out summonses against them, but there was no inquiry on my charge before the Magistrate.</p>

On 5th June, as my husband and I were sitting at dinner, I heard a rap at the door—it was Mr. Graham—he wished to go in-doors, and I wished to know why—my husband went to the door, and he said he was to distrain by Mrs. Lidgbird's orders—they stood talking outside, and I closed the door—I afterwards heard Graham whistle, and five or six men came into the yard to him—they came with very abusive language, not fit for me to repeat—Hitchcock threw down his coat and hat and challenged Mr. Cook to fight—Mr. Cook wished to know what they wanted—they said they had come for 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think—he wished to know what it was for, and they began with their abusive language, and would not tell him, no more than it was to distrain by Mrs. Lidgbird's orders—all this was before the pigs were driven out—after the pigs were driven out Hitchcock picked up a stick and followed Mr. Cook—he picked up another, and Harris held him by the shoulders while Hitchcock struck him a blow with his stick and made a wound—I was close to them—I saw the brick thrown—Mr. Cook threw one to defend himself from Hitchcock's stick—the pigs were then driven down the lane by Melton—Hitchcock was making his way towards Mr. Cook with the stick when the brick was thrown—he threw it to defend himself from him—Harris also had a stick; none of the others—Harris had no stick at the time Mr. Cook threw the brick, he took it afterwards—the blow Hitchcock struck Mr. Cook was a very severe one—I bathed his head with two pails of water and a soft towel; it bled very much—he said, "Fetch me some water to bathe my head, I am a dead man"—none of the children were at home—the prisoners remained seven days on the premises, all five of them, and sometimes more, and they were drunk the best part of the time—they made a great noise—the place was never quiet night or day—they were walk<lb/>ing about the premises all night, trying to get in—I was very much alarmed—I never went to bed one night while they were there—they had lights in the stable and straw to lie on.</p>

               <p>Lidgbird's presence, that the agreement with Cook was made—he offered to do the internal repair if Mrs. Lidgbird would do the external—he was to have a lease for seven, fourteen, or twenty-one years—there was no day specified for his having it—the arrangement was not that he should get the ground into good cultivation, lay out money for that purpose, and then that an amount of rent should be reserved, to be specified in the lease—he has never demanded any lease; I have never offered him one—Mrs. Lidgbird first demanded rent in Oct. 1849—I think I went to him one day for her, and one day with her—I heard Mrs. Lidgbird demand rent, and Cook admitted it to be due—I cannot say the precise terms in which I asked Cook for the rent in Oct.—I may have said Mrs. Lidgbird wanted money—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my writing—this is "Paid 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the use of Mrs. Lidgbird"—I do not know why I did not put "on account of rent"—it was a mere memorandum—the rest of the rent was to come up shortly, and then he would have had a proper receipt for the whole—I think I gave Cook the particulars of the agreement on a bit of paper—I have here a pencil memorandum which I made at the time (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>), "Rent to be paid, 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and lease seven, fourteen, or twenty-one years"—the farm was in a bad state of repair—Cook built a stable and some piggeries—I was before the Magistrate, and heard him recommend the parties to go before the Grand Jury and prefer their charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a broker, and live at 7, Grove-lane, Woolwich. On 5th June I went with Hitchcock and others to Mr. Cook's premises—I had a distress-warrant with me—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I received it from Mr. Binks—he could not perform it himself, and he employed me as his agent—I produced the warrant to Cook, and made a demand on him for the rent, 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as stated in the warrant—he saw it, and I read it to him in the usual course—he said, "I am very sorry; you know me very well; you should have let me know, and I would have made it all right"—I said, "I have a duty to perform, Cook, which I am sorry so to do, but I will perform my duty as mildly as I possibly can"—this took place opposite the door of his dwelling-house—we then proceeded round to the back of the house—I told him he had better allow the duty to be done quietly—he said, "I don't blame you at all"—I then said, "My men are close handy, I will give notice to them"—Cook proceeded into the farm-yard; and on seeing the two men to place in execution, and Mr. Binks, and a person named Melton, who was taking a walk up that way, and came in likewise, Cook used a dread<lb/>ful oath, stooped down, took up a brickbat, or a portion of a brickbat, and violently threw it at Hitchcock—it struck him, and he fell—he threw two bricks—nothing had been done with respect to the pigs previous to this—he went to the pigsty immediately afterwards, removed the pigs, and sent them down the lane; and I drove them back again—I said to him, "You must not let these pigs out"—he said, "Oh they are not my pigs, they belong to a cow-keeper down here, therefore you will let them go"—I said, "No, I can allow nothing to go off the premises;" and I and Melton drove them back—Hitchcock was not with me then—he was taking care of the premises—I did not send him after the pigs—when I returned, I found Cook attacking</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Duchess of Brunswick public-house, at Deptford. On Sunday evening, 11th Aug., I was in my bar—the prisoner came in between four and five, and asked for a pot of porter—he was tipsy, and I think he had no money—I said "No, young man, if you had your pockets full of money, you would have no drink at present; recollect it is Sunday, if you will come to-morrow I will give you a pot or a pint, or what you like, but it does not look well to see a young man tipsy on Sunday afternoon—he began abusing me, and call me all manner of bad names—I never touched him—he went towards the door, turned short round, as much as to say, "you be d—d," and his foot caught the door, and he made a slight stumble, and the latch of the door caught his cheek and caused a slight scar; the blood came from it—I went behind the bar, wetted a towel, and went towards him to wipe his face—when I came within reach of him he kicked towards me, and the last time but one he kicked me in the bottom of the belly—I said, "You have hurt my stomach"—he then made another kick at me, and upset a form in front of the bar—I stooped to pick it up, and as I was rising he took the pipe out of his mouth, and whether he threw it at me or jobbed it in my eye, the pain was so great and it was done so quickly, I could not swear—I put my hand up to my eye, and said, "Oh dear, my eye is out!" and he said, "Now I have got my revenge on you"—I have been under medical treatment ever since—I never applied any contemptuous name to him, that I swear, nor laid my hand on him.</p>

Walker, Eltham"—I asked Wood why he left it there—he said he left it for his horses—upon that I went to the cart, and found the nose-bags full, and another bag containing three bushels of mixed chaff, beans, and bran.</p>

                  </hi>. I am secretary to the East-country Dock Com<lb/>pany, Rotherhithe, and am in my seventy-fifth year. I know the prisoner, working in the docks as one of the deal-porters—on the morning of 26th June I found fault with the foreman of the deal-porters, and objected to the prisoner's being employed—he was discharged, by my direction, between nine and ten o'clock—about a quarter-past three, that afternoon, I was walking round the dock, my usual practice at that time of day, and at the south side the prisoner came up to me—he seemed to be waiting for me—I was walking on the edge of the wharf, as I usually do, going back to the office, when the prisoner came from among the deals, and said, "Sir, the foreman has dis<lb/>charged me this morning; I wish to know the reason why?"—I just looked at him; I did not want to speak to him, I said, "I am not under any neces<lb/>sity of explaining my conduct to you; go about your business"—he gave me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185008190156"/>
               <p>no answer, and I walked on—I passed him—there were gates on that side—I thought perhaps he had obeyed my order, and gone about his business; but I had hardly passed him a few paces, and was walking on the edge of the dock, before I received a tremendous push on my back, which launched me right into the dock, head-foremost, where it is eighteen feet deep—I went a good way below, and when I came up I as a good way from the wharf—I found I could swim, though I had not tried for forty years, and never with my clothes and heavy shoes on—however, I got on very well, and did not lose my presence of mind—there was no access up the wharf; it was six or seven feet up—there was not a boat on that side of the dock—some men came running to the spot, when I could not have swam much longer, for I found my legs going down before I got to the wharf—I got hold of one of the pillars, but there was no way of getting up—they lowered one man down, and I got hold of his legs, and he got hold of my hand and shoulder, and I was taken up—if I could not have swam, no man could have come to my assistance in less than a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and I must have sunk—the prisoner was quite sober when he spoke to me—he spoke quite distinctly, and walked perfectly well.</p>

On 20th June I was with Mr. Shirreff, and saw the prisoner come up—he walked past Mr. Shirreff while he was speaking to me—we were two or three feet from the edge of the wharf, which was repairing—Mr. Shirreff walked ahead, about fifty yards along the path by the side of the bason—the prisoner was waiting for him, and I saw them speaking—Mr. Shirreff walked two or three yards a head, and the prisoner ran with force behind him, pushed him into the water, and then ran away down the dock—Mr. Shirreff came up fourteen or twenty feet from the edge of the wharf, and swam to the edge of the basin—I lowered a man who was there, and Mr. Shirreff caught hold of his legs, and we held him for a few minutes till farther assistance came, and we succeeded in getting him up—the water was eighteen feet deep—it was seven or eight feet at the edge of the wharf—if he had not been able to swim we should have had to have gone round to the other side for a boat, which</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Brook-street, Lambeth. On Sunday night, 11th Aug., Rigby stopped me in Pleasant-place, Lambeth—she asked me to <hi rend="italic">stand.</hi> something to drink—I did not do it—she still clung round me, and I missed my watch, which had been in my left-hand waistcoat pocket—there was a chain to it, which went round my neck, and through a button<lb/>hole—she broke the pin of the watch in pulling it—there was at that time a man a few yards off—he came past, and I saw his hand and Rigby's touch each other—he said, "Look sharp, Julia"—he went away, and Rigby was going away—I was following her, and the policeman came up—I know I had my watch two minutes before Rigby came up.</p>

                  </hi>.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185008190166"/>
               <p>—there was a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note among the money, which I put into a little bag—on the following Thursday I went out, and pinned the bag of money in my bosom—we went to several places, and had some drink; and between four and five o'clock in the afternoon we went to Peter Paine's, at Brandon-street, Walworth-common—a Mrs. Allen was there, who is Mr. Paine's daughter, and the prisoner, who is a needlewoman, was there at work—I had tea with them;—I do not think my husband did;—he fell asleep—I had not taken my bag out from the time I went out in the morning—we had some liquor before tea, and sent a second time for more—I asked Mrs. Paine to lend me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or so—she said she would not—my husband awoke, and said I had got money—(I had not mentioned anything about having money before that)—I said I had money, but I did not want to take the bag out, for fear of an acci<lb/>dent—I then went to the bag—it was quite safe, as I had pinned it in the morn<lb/>ing, and the string was tied in a knot—I took the boy out, and could not undo the knot; Mrs. Allen undid it, but I had it in my hands all the while—I took a half-sovereign out, sent for some liquor, tied the bag, and put it back again—it was hardly a moment out—the prisoner was sitting at a little table in the room—Mrs. Allen offered to put it back for me, but she did not; she did not touch it—I left, with my husband, about half-past eight, went straight home, and went to bed, putting the bag under my pillow—I found it under my pillow at eight or half-past next morning, and missed the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note—I imme<lb/>diately told Mrs. Paine, Mrs. Allen, and also Mr. Eden, who had bought our shop—I mentioned it all over the neighbourhood, and offered half of it if it was brought back—I got the number, and stopped it at the Bank—about ten weeks afterwards I went to the Secretary's-office at the Bank, and, in consequence of what I learnt there, after a fortnight, which it took me to trace out all the particulars, I went to the prisoner—I told her I called respecting the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note; that I had traced it to her, and found it, and had been and seen it—she said it was not her; I must make a mistake.—that she had heard there was only a sovereign reward—I said she must make a mistake, for my husband said he would give half of it—I said she had better tell me the truth at once—she said it was not her—I told her that Mr. Alexander, in the Walworth-road, said he thought he could identify her, and asked her to go there with me—she said she could not go till the next day, for she was engaged out to work, and they must come to her—I asked her to fix some time, and she said she would go on the Thursday, at three o'clock—I went on the Thursday, and said I had come once more, and I hoped she would go to Mr. Alexander's—she said she did not think she could come then, made a pause, and did not wish to go—I said Mr. Alexander said it was gloves that was bought—she showed me a pair, and said they were the only pair she had—at last she said she would go if I would wait—I said I could not wait—I went and fetched a constable, and we went to Alexander's.</p>
