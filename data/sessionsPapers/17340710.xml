               <p>John Laws. Near 11 at Night, going by the Lock and Key, in Smithfield, the Prisoner catc'd hold of me, and ask'd me to give her a D am I went with her to a Brandy-shop in <placeName id="t17340710-12-crimeloc44">Duck Lane</placeName>

I was a little Suspicious, and therefore felt several times for my Watch, and still found it in my Pocket. But by and by, she suddenly call'd the Woman of the House, and gave her the Money for the Brandy, at which I was a little Surpriz'd, and feeling again for my Watch, I miss'd it. I held fast hold of the Prisoner, and call'd for a Constable, upon which two Men, who were in the Foreroom, for she and I were in a private Room backwards, came and hussled me about, and one of them pretended to be a Constable, and order'd me to quit her, but however I would not let her go, but carry'd her to the Watch-house in Cloth-Fair, and the Constable committed us both to the Compter - Next Day she offer'd to return the Watch for 2 Guineas, and afterwards the Man at the Brandy-shop promis'd to help me to it for a Guinea and a Half. <rs id="t17340710-12-verdict45" type="verdictDescription">

But one Night, when I was in Bed, I heard her blowing the Fire, upon which I got up anend, an asked her what she was about; she said, No harm - There was an Instrument full of Whiting, which was a Mould, that lay upon the Hearth; she put some Metal into two Tobacco-pipes, and put them into the Fire, and when the Metal was melted, she took the Mold in one Hand and the Pipe in another, and Teem'd [ pour'd ] the Metal into the Mold, and afterwards open'd it, and took out a Six-pence, and put it into her Pocket Apron, and so she did several times, but her Daughter was not with her all that Time. Mrs. Haycock (says I) I thought you were not guilty of such Things, but since I find how it is, in my Room you shall stay no longer: she said I need not be so uneasy, for no harm should come to me. This was on a Tuesday Night.</p>
               <p>M. Haycock. And why did not you inform sooner?</p>
               <p>Russel. Because I did not know who to apply to, but upon enquiring I found out Mr. North who belongs to the Mint.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you see the Girl Ann Haycock do any thing?</p>
               <p>Russel. I came up Stairs one Day, and knock'd at the Door, the Mother asked who was there? I said it was I, she did not open the Door directly, but when I got in, I saw two Pipes in the Fire, and the Mold upon the Hearth. She took the Pipes out and laid them aside, and put the Mold into her Apron, and her Daughter was then with her. I did not then see the Daughter do any thing. But once I saw the Daughter boiling something in a little Tin-pot, I look'd into the Pot, and there was 14 or 15 Shillings and Six-pences. I ask'd her what she was doing, but she took the Pot away and said it did not concern me - There was a sort of Red stuff in the Pot - Another time I saw the Girl with several Six-pences in her Lap, and she was rubbing them with Whiting.</p>
               <p>Mr. North. On the 27th of May, Ann Russel gave me much the same Account as she has given now - I appointed to meet her on Saturday, June 1, and accordingly, taking two (Mr. Morris and Mr. Atkins ) to assist me, we met. The Street Door was open: We went up softly, and Atkins being foremost he push'd against the Door of the Room, and it gave way, and we went in. The old Woman made a great Outcry of Murder, and was so turbulent, that we were oblig'd to tye her Hands, tho' we had some difficulty in doing it. There was a Candle in the Closet - Atkins said that he saw something glitter in a little notch in the Floor, just by the Wall, and there he found two counterfeit Six-pences, which he gave to me: Morris found three more, and these are the five - I take them to be nothing but Pewter. There were several Rags and Pieces of Leather that seem'd to be whited with Whiting. There was a Deal-box too: I ask'd the Girl for the Key of it, she said it belong'd to a young Woman who was gone out, and had taken the Key with her; upon which I was going to break it open, but upon second thoughts I resolv'd to search the old Woman first. I did so, and in her Pocket found this Key. It fitted the Lock, and I open'd the Box with it. There was a pretty deal of Cambrick in the Box, and several odd Things of little value, which I suppose they had bought in putting off their bad Money. At last I met with this Pair of wooden Flasks for Coining: The way is, to fill these with fine powder'd Chalk, and then make an impression of the Money they design to Counterfeit; there was likewise this little Box of Red Argol: 'Tis what the Silver-smiths Use, by boiling it with the Silver they have cast, to fetch the sand out of the Pores of the Silver, and cleanse it from dirt and soil. It appears to be the same that the last Evidence observed in the Tin-pot when the Girl was boiling the Counterfeit Money, for here is that Pot (which we found in the Closet) and some of the Argol is still sticking about the sides.</p>
               <p>M. Haycock. Was I in the Closet, or the Room when you came in?</p>
               <p>Mr. North. I am not certain which, but I think you were near the Closet, if not in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173407100005"/>M. Haycock. I was just stept into the Closet with a Candle in my Hand to fetch a Dish to take up my Husband's Dinner.</p>
               <p>Mr. North. When I first open'd the Box the Daughter desir'd me not to take the Linnen away, because it was all they shou'd have to live upon in Newgate. When I came to the Flasks, I said to her, You pretend to a great deal of Innocence; but how came you by these? She pleaded Ignorance; but while I was searching farther, she turn'd aside to her Mother, and said softly, Mother we are gone!</p>
               <p>I carried them before my Lord Mayor, and then I return'd to the Room, to see what else I cou'd meet with. I poked among the Ashes, where I found some dross, and little pieces of Metal, and several Tobacco-pipes, that look'd as if they had been burnt in the Fire.</p>
               <p>M. Haycock. Any body might happen to have a burnt Pipe in their Room.</p>
               <p>Mr. North. But these Pipes had Metal in them, and it was run a good way up the holes - Here is one that is broke, but the pieces hang together by the Lead.</p>
               <p>M. Haycock. Did you find any bad Money upon me when you searched me?</p>
               <p>Mr. North. No - I found some Money, but it was good.</p>
               <p>

            . I assisted Mr. North. I went up first, and found the Door ty'd with a piece of red Tape. I push'd it open, and went directly into the Closet, where the Mother was kneeling or sitting with a Candle in her hand; she set up a terrible Irish Hallaloo. I pull'd her out into the Room, but she was so very troublesome that we were forced to tye her Hands. I saw something glitter in a Crevice in the Closet Floor, just by the Wall; upon examining, I found two counterfeit Six-pences, which I gave to Mr. North. I heard him ask the Girl for the Key, and heard her say, that another young Woman had got it; and saw him take it from the old Woman, and open the Box, and found the Flasks; but I did not hear what the Girl said to the old Woman - And I was with Mr. North when he found the Pipes with the Metal in them.</p>

            , Clerk to Mr. North. Mr. Atkins went in first, and got the old Woman out of the Room; she made a great Noise and resisted; and thereupon we ty'd her Hands. Mr. North asked for the Key; it was deny'd, but he found it on the old Woman, and open'd the Box, and as soon as he found the Flasks, she fell into a greater Agony than before, and shriek'd out, Murder and Thieves! Atkins found 2 Six-pences, and I found 3 more.</p>
               <p>M. Haycock. It was not my Box, but Mrs Russel's where the Things were found.</p>
               <p>Russel. That's true, but I lent her the Box to put her Things in, and I made no use of it while she was there.</p>
               <p>M. Haycock. I had no occasion for a Box, for I had not a ha'porth of any thing to put into one, having been 5 Weeks in Prison, where I and my Daughter got the Jail Distemper - And I have 6 Children - It's very strange that after I had suffer'd so much on Suspicion of putting off bad Money, I shou'd venture to Coin in an open Room, that had no Lock to the Door: And besides, there was another Woman, Katherine Kelly, constantly in the same Room, and therefore they only swear this against me, for the sake of a Reward.

Tracey had a Pipe in her Mouth when I came in, and held her Apron up so. Judith Murray was cleaning a Pipkin, and Knight stood with her back against the Dresser. But as soon as my Brother had put them out of their fears, Tracey put the Pipe into the fire, and melted some Metal. Then she held her Knees so - And the Iron frame so - And took out the Pipe, and pour'd the Metal into the Frame, and when it was cold she threw out Shillings. I did not see Knight do any thing then; but afterwards I saw her clip the nobs off the Sixpences, and cut them smooth on the Edges, and then file them, and rub them smooth in a Flannel. At the End of August, or beginning of September, I went to Mr. Strong, [or Stahan's Cellar] at the Fox in King-Street by the Seven Dials, and there was Tracey and

Mother Haycock was making half Crowns to go into the Country, for she said they cou'd put them off better in the Country than in Town, for the Country People were not so cautious; but Six-pences were left for London. Damn me, says Tracey, if I would ever go into the Country with half Crowns, as long as I get a Crown a Night in London with Six pences. The Prisoners both engaged me to put off Money for them.

I told her Yes; and then she desired me to lend her a Candle, a Fire shovel, and some Small-coal; so she went into the Room, and lit a fire. I peep'd in, and finding what she was about, I push'd back the Lock, and she had got a Pipe in her Hand, and a Mould in her Lap, What are you at this Work? Says I. Aye, says she, I must do it here for fear the Metal should be found at my Lodging, tho' I have left 12 half Crowns under my washing Tub. I saw her make 12 or 14 Six-pences; it's true upon the virtue of my Oath; and then she said she must go to Strong's Cellar to finish them. I went thither after her, and there she was boiling Money; what I swear, is upon the Truth, and God's Truth; and she said, Give me the ten Shillings you had of Tracey, for the Colour is not good enough, and I must mend it, and so I gave her ten Shillings in the Plural Number.</p>

You shall see, says she; and so she took the Moulds out of her Pocket, melted some Pewter in a Fire-Shovel, and then threw it on the Hearth, and cut it into small Pieces. Then she sent my Boy for a Pipe, put some Metal into it, and when it was hot, she held the Mould on her Knee thus - and pour'd the Metal in, and knock'd it thus - to settle. When it was cold she threw out a King William's Six-pence, plainer on the Cross side than the Head. After she had done, she knock'd the white Stuff out of the Moulds, ty'd them in one Cloth, and the Stuff in another - I was curious to see the Moulds, before she broke them; but she would not let me, for she said, she had sworn to let no Body see them, but those that had seen them before - She clipp'd the Edges of the Six-pences with her Scissars, and then scraped them with a Knife, and went to a Brasier's, the Corner of Catherine-Street, and bought a warded File, with which she filed them, and then rubb'd them, and boil'd them in the Soap and a yellow Stuff that Dyers use.</p>

I said, What have you been doing? She answer'd, You know - St. Laurence shook her Head at me; and Brown being no great Acquaintance, went out. Then the Prisoner open'd her Apron, and shew'd me near 100 King William's Six-pences, and said, that she and Brown made them.

The Prisoner came out, hit my Fore-horse on the Head, and took me a good Knock; but for all that, I went to lead my Horse to the Pond, upon which the Prisoner took me by the Hair, and dragg'd me to his Door, and beat and abused me. Kirby said, don't abuse the Lad; but if he has done any thing contrary to Law, take the Law of him. And the Deceas'd (who was then unreining his Horses) said, If you want to fight, don't fight with a Lad, but with a Man; and so begun to unbutton his Coat. Upon that the Prisoner went in, and fetch'd out a three tined Dung-fork. Sure, says Kirby, you won't be such a Villain as to knock the Man down? The Deceas'd made no offer to fight; but the Prisoner struck him on the Head with the edge of the Dung-fork, and he dropt down immediately - We help him up, and set him against the Sign-post, and in less than a Quarter of an Hour got him upon his Horse; the Prisoner in the mean time was damning and swearing that no Body should come to Water at his Pond.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173407100012"/> The Deceas'd rode about a Mile, but dopt his Head like a drunken Man; but then he could ride no farther, Lord have mercy upon me, says he, he has almost kill'd me. So we put him into his Master's Dung-cart, and he lean'd his Head over the Side of it, and vomited a little Blood, and so he was carry'd to Hadley Windmill, where his Mother-in-Law lives. We felt on the Right-side of his Head, and felt it was broke: He was put to Bed, and, as I heard, dy'd in two Hours - Here is the Fork - the Prisoner held this, and struck the Deceas'd on the Head with this side of the Iron Tines - I live at Hadley. We were coming from London, and went to Water our Horses at this Pond, which lies in the Highway, and is a common Watering-place.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Is not the Pond rail'd in?</p>
               <p>Roberts. It is rail'd; but not quite round, there is a Cartway left for People to drive Carts and Waggons in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not deny your going in with your Horses; but I told you, that you should not draw your Cart in.</p>
               <p>Roberts. No, you did not speak one Word, but struck my Fore-horse; and when I took the Fore-horse to lead him in, you fell upon me - The Deceas'd had unreined his Horses, in order to Water them, but had not water'd them when you knock'd him down; for he came after you to speak to you for beating me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How far is the Pond from my House?</p>
               <p>Roberts. 4 or 5 Pole.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not 3 Men strip and follow me 30 Yards quite to my own Door?</p>

            . The Prisoner beat the Lad, and I said, don't beat the Boy, but if he had done any thing against Law, take another Course with him. The Deceas'd was then standing by the Highway 2 or 3 Pole from the House, and said to the Prisoner, don't beat the Boy, beat a Man. Upon which the Prisoner ran in and brought out a Dung-fork. His Wife follow'd him and said, What! have you a mind to be hang'd? And says I, sure you don't design to be such a Villain as to kill the Man? The Deceas'd never lifted up his Hand against the Prisoner, but was standing thus with his Coat unbutton'd, and just turn'd back over his Shoulder, when the Prisoner struck him on the Head with the Prong of the Fork edgeways, and down he fell. The Boy and I help'd him up. He loll'd his Head against the Horse block, but in a little time he something recover'd himself, and then we put him upon his Horse, and afterwards into the Dung-cart, where he spit Blood; and so was carried to his Father-in-law: He had a Bruise on the right side of his Head. We sent for a Surgeon, and then left him.</p>

            , Surgeon. On Saturday, June 8. I was sent for to Mr. Perry's at Hadley, where I found the Deceas'd extremely ill and speechless. He had received a violent Blow on the Head I let him Blood, he sigh'd once, and dy'd in a quarter of an Hour - On the Thursday following the Coroner sent for me. I open'd the Head of the Deceas'd, and found a large Contusion and a Fracture of 4 inches on the Temple-bone, a little above the Ear. A Piece of Bone as big as a Hazel-nut was broke quite round. I raised it up, and put a Spatula under it - I believe the Wound was the Cause of his Death.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The beginning of the Story was this. The Boy came up to the Pond, and I said, You shan't draw your Cart thro' the Pond, but take your Horses off, water them and welcome. Upon that, he struck me on the Head with his Whip, and the Deceas'd and 2 or 3 more stript, and said, God Damn him, let's knock him on the Head. And then the Deceas'd struck me with his Whip, and I knock'd him down.</p>

            . I was 20 Yards from the Pond. The Prisoner was going from the Pond, and 3 Men follow'd him; 2 of them were stript. He look'd back, and pacing they got Ground of him; he run to his House, and somewhere in the Stable he took up this unfortunate Weapon, and then coming to his own Door, he said, Gentlemen stand off! for I'll stand in my own Defence. But they made upto him, and he struck the Deceas'd; and then one of them struck the Prisoner in the Face.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the Deceas'd strike the Prisoner first?</p>
               <p>Bolton. I did not see that, but when the Deceas'd fell, the Prisoner flung down the Dung-fork and went to his own House, but one of them stript, follow'd him, and several blows past between them.</p>
               <p>Coroner. How far were you from them when the blow was given?</p>
               <p>Bolton. About threescore Yards.</p>

               <p>Bolton Yes.</p>

            . There were 4 Carters following the Prisoner as he was making towards his own Door.</p>
               <p>Court What Carters?</p>
               <p>Scot. These 3 Gentlemen here, and the Deceas'd, they follow'd him to his own Door - and he turn'd his Head - And as he was going to his own Door - He met me with this Weapon.</p>
               <p>Court. Met me with it? Where?</p>
               <p>Scot. Some where or other.</p>
               <p>Court. At the Door, or within the Door?</p>
               <p>Scot. I can't say as to that; but as he was coming along with this unlawful Weapon, he said, Gentlemen, take care, I stand upon my own Defence, and then the Gentlemen -</p>
               <p>Court. What Gentlemen?</p>
               <p>Scot. The Deceas'd made up to him, and the Prisoner struck him with the Pitch-fork, and then threw it down, and then the Boy struck the Prisoner - The Deceas'd lay 2 or 3 Minutes, and then got upon his Horse and went to his Team.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he get up himself?</p>
               <p>Scot. He got up, or was hold up.</p>

               <p>Court. Was the Deceas'd stript?</p>
               <p>Scot. Yes, he was - No he was not - But the Boy was.</p>
               <p>Court. How did the Deceas'd stand when he receiv'd the blow?</p>
               <p>Scot. Upon his Legs - He was unbutton'd and Rioting with the rest, but he gave no blow.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to be there?</p>
               <p>Scot. I had been a Haymaking for Mr. Milbourn, and was going home about 4 in the Afternoon; for we left off Work because it rain'd.</p>

               <p>Scot. He was with me; we had both been at work at the same Place, and were going together.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he behind or before you?</p>
               <p>Scot. Behind me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had no Malice against the Deceas'd, for I never spoke to him before, and little thought of killing him when I gave him that blow.</p>
               <p>Several Witnesses gave the Prisoner the Character of a very sober, honest, civil Man, and not subject to be quarrelsome.</p>

            , the Prosecutor's Servant. On the 18th of January my Master had a Sum of Money brought into the House, he told it over, and put it into a Canvas-bag, and laid it upon a Prayer-Book in the right hand Chimney-corner, near his Couch; then he got out of his Chair, which stood next to the Bag, and went to sleep upon his Couch. The Prisoner, who was then sitting on the left Corner of the Chimney, got out of her Chair and sat in his. I was then in the Yard, and saw her take the Bag and put it into her Lap under a Cambrick Apron that she was mending; upon which I came in, and ask'd her where the Bag was; she said, as it was left to her charge she had taken it into her Lap for fear she should fall asleep, and somebody should come in and steal it. So I went into the Yard again, and peep'd through a Crevice of the Door, and saw her put her hand into the Bag, and take a handful of Gold out, and put it into her Pocket. Then she ty'd up the Bag again, and laid it where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173407100015"/> she took it from. and then moved from my Master's Chair into her own - My Master had a Green striped Sattin Waistcoat, it was one that his late Wife used to wear; but she has been dead 9 or 10 Years. I ask'd the Prisoner, what was become of this Waistcoat? She said my Master had given it to her, and she had got it at her own House.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you acquaint your Master with what you saw the Prisoner do?</p>
               <p>Patrick. Yes, a Week or ten Days afterwards, I desir'd him to look into his Bag.</p>
               <p>Court. But why did you not speak of it sooner?</p>
               <p>Patrick. I was afraid of the Prisoner, for she bore a great Sway in the House - She was a sort of a Housekeeper, and often threaten'd to turn us away; but when I had told my Master, he turn'd her away in two or three Days after.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not live constantly in the House, but came once or twice a Week, and sometimes was there a Week together. I had no settled Wages, but took what he pleas'd to give me.</p>
               <p>Juryman. Was the Writ serv'd before or after she was turn'd away?</p>
               <p>Patrick. It was after.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was it before she was indicted?</p>
               <p>Patrick. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Goodcheap. The Prisoner's Husband ow'd me above 12 l. - above a Year ago the Prisoner promis'd to pay me 20 s. of it at such a Time, and when that time came, she brought me 15 s. and desir'd me to take this silk Gown, 'till she paid me the other 5 s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Prosecutor gave me that Gown.</p>

He gave Six pence to my Boy, who was 12 Years old, and bid him take care of the Fowls; and Six-pence more to my Child that was sucking at my Breast, and left another Six pence for my other Child who was not at home: Then, says he, your Husband told me he had got fine Pigs, and promised to make me a present of one; but I: will pay him for it. He said they were fine ones, and I am come to look upon them. The Sow and Pigs were in the Stable, and so I took a Candle and went with him thither, we came thro' 2 Doors, which he shut after him, and then came into the Stable.</p>

               <p>Betteridge May. I can't say whether it was lock'd, or only upon the latch - He look'd upon the Sow and Pigs, and said they were fine ones; and then he laid hold of me, beat the Candle out, and threw me down upon a Couple of Faggots, and had to do with me - I cry'd for help, but he put a Hankerchief into my Mouth, and used me so violently that I could make no Noise; but the Sow and Pigs cry'd out, and made a terrible racket.</p>

               <p>Court. Did he do all that was necessary on his part towards getting a Child?</p>
               <p>Betteridge. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Could he possibly do that if you would not comply?</p>
               <p>Betteridge May. Yes, He did it against my Will.</p>
               <p>Court. I don't find that he made use of any means to terrify you -</p>
               <p>Betteridge No.</p>
               <p>Court. Then would not the least motion of yours have prevented him from doing as you say?</p>
               <p>Betteridge May. It was not in my Power.</p>
               <p>Court. The Jury will judge of that - you were but a little way from the House, and if I understood you, the Prisoner did not stop your Mouth till after he had thrown you down. You say you cry'd out before that, but did you cry loud enough for your Boy to hear you?</p>
               <p>Betteridge May. I believe he might have heard me, if the Pigs had not made such a Noise - When the Prisoner had got his will, he said I should not go out in such a great flurry; and he did all he could to pacify me. I hope says he, you won't tell your Husband; but if you do, I'll turn him out of his Work, and lay him in a Jail for what he owes me. - My Husband ow'd him 7 Guineas and a half, and therefore, tho' my Husband came home that Night, I did not acquaint him with it.</p>
               <p>Court. But if the Prisoner had been convicted of so great an Offence, he must have been hang'd for it; and therefore your Husband would have been out of Danger.</p>
               <p>Betteridge May. I know nothing of the Law.</p>
               <p>Council. Did not you prefer an Indictment against the Prisoner at Hicks's-Hall in February last for a Rape?</p>
               <p>Betteridge May. Yes; but on account of some Objections the Bill was not found.</p>
               <p>Council. And then you indicted him for an Assault with an intent to Ravish?</p>
               <p>Betteridge May. Yes, but he got off.</p>
               <p>Council. Tho' it was but for an Assault, you gave the same Evidence as now; and swore a compleat Rape - How long was it before you acquainted your Husband with this affair?</p>
               <p>Betteridge May. Not till the Wednesday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173407100019"/> 7 Night after it was done: Tho' I soon found myself very much out of order, and had a violent Pain in my Back - On the 30th of January I apply'd to an Apothecary, and have been under his care ever since.</p>
               <p>Council. How came you to discover it at last?</p>
               <p>Betteridge May. My Husband went to Work on the Monday Morning, and that Night the Prisoner came and enquired for me; but I was a bed, and so he went away: But he came again on the Wednesday, and ask'd me if I had told my Husband? I answer'd No, I have not told him yet - I am glad of that, says he, and I hope you won't do it; but I was afraid you had, because he has not come up for his Wages; there is 10s due to him for 5 days Work; and now I'm here I'll pay the Money to you; so he gave me half a Guinea. I told him I could not give him Change; and he said it was no Matter, for I might keep the Six-pence for my self.</p>
               <p>On Thursday I receiv'd a message to meet my Husband the next Day at Mrs. Aylet's, the <placeName id="t17340710-33-crimeloc134">Bird in hand at Waltham-cross</placeName>

I did not know the meaning of it, but was afraid my Husband had met with another mischance, for once he put his Collar-bone out - So on Friday I went, though I was very ill, and the Woman of the House led me up stairs into a Room, where there was a Fire, but no Company. She said she kept a Fire there to dry Bacon. Presently the Prisoner came up with a Whip in his Hand, and said, by God you are all taken! I ask'd him if my Husband was there. He answer d No, It was I that sent for you; and God Damn it you shall stay Dinner; and if you make any disturbance here, it will be the worse for you; for I have got a pair of Pistols - A Fowl and Bacon was brought; but I had no Stomach, and could not eat any thing. After Dinner, I took my Hat and was going; but he said I should not; and so he laid 2 Pistols on the Table, shut the Door, stuck his Penknife into it, and hung his Great-coat upon it; and then threw me upon the Bed, and used me as he did before in the Stable.</p>
               <p>Court. What did he Ravish you a second Time? - And this in the middle of the Day, and at a Publick-house too?</p>
               <p>Betteridge May. Yes he did, though I call'd out - as I did before - But nobody came to help me - The Prisoner said, You may tell your Husband of this if you will; for now you come after me: And so I came away.</p>
               <p>Court. Why did not you apprehend the Prisoner then? Was there ne'er a Constable in the Town?</p>
               <p>Betteridge May. I was so ill, that I could not go to look for a Constable, but went di-directly home.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not you know it was the Prisoner that sent for you to that House.</p>
               <p>Betteridge May. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Who did you ask for when you came thither?</p>
               <p>Betteridge May. Nobody I went by the Door, before I enquir'd for the Bird-in-hand; and the Woman of the House was then at the Window, and saw me, and so she came to the Door.</p>
               <p>Court. Did she know you then?</p>
               <p>Betteridge May. No, I believe she had never seen me before, but the Prisoner had described my Riding-hood to her.</p>
               <p>Court. Upon your Oath did not you enquire for Mr. - ?</p>
               <p>Betteridge May. No, upon my Oath - My Husband came home the next Day, which was Saturday; but I had such a Dread upon my Spirits, that I was afraid to tell him.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to tell him at last?</p>
               <p>Betteridge May. I grew so bad, that I knew not how to conceal it any longer.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you send a Pig to the Prisoner on the Sunday Morning?</p>
               <p>Betteridge May. No, but my Husband did before I was up; for I was ill a Bed: But when he told me of it, I said, I wish'd he had not done it - There's a Bill against the Prisoner at Hertford for this last Fact - 'Tis for an Assault with an intent to Ravish.</p>
               <p>Court. Why for an Assault only, whereas you swear the Fact was compleated.</p>
               <p>Betteridge May. I did not understand the Law, but I told my Attorney how I was serv'd.</p>
               <p>Attorney. She told me it was only an Assault.</p>

            . I have work'd for the Prisoner near 9 Years, and indeed he has been a good friend to me. I owed him 7 Guineas and a half. I came home between 9 and 10 on Saturday Night, my Boy told me my Master - had been there, and given him and his Brother Six-pence a piece. My Wife said nothing of this Matter to me; and I had no mistrust of her or the Prisoner, for I knew nothing of their Contrigues. So I went to work again on Monday, and on Thursday the Prisoner came and said, do you go home to Night, John? - if you do, you shall never strike another stroke for me. Why, Sir? says I; where will be the harm as long as I keep my Time?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. But you had neglected your time very much by going home a Nights.</p>
               <p>John May. So I did not go home till Saturday Night, and then my Wife was very ill, and complain'd of a Pain in her Back, and said she believ'd she had got a Fever; and she cry'd - I had promised a Pig to the Prisoner, and so I sent one in the Morning before she was up: and he sent me half a Crown for it - On the Wednesday Night following I was very urgent to do what married Men should do; but she refused: And I insisted upon knowing the meaning of it; and so she was forced to confess, or else she had given it to me. She said that the Prisoner went with her into the Stable to see the Pigs, but did not lock the Door, and then threw her upon the Faggots and lay with her by force; but she said nothing of the second Fact, till after I had got a Warrant for him; and then she told me, and said she did not tell me sooner for fear I should turn her quite out of Doors.</p>
               <p>John May, the Son. I heard a Noise when my Mother and the Prisoner were in the Stable, but I thought it had been the Sow and Pigs; and when my Mother came in she had a high Colour, her Cap was tumbled, and her Hair about her Ears - Before they went into the Stable, the Prisoner sent me to get his Horse out of the Stable for fear he should hurt the Pigs - But Mr. Newman took the Horse out and put into the Wash-house.</p>

Our House joins to Mrs May's: I remember the Night the Prisoner was there, and saw them both go into the Stable; they staid there about half an Hour -I heard no squeeling nor crying - But we were spinning and our Wheels made a Noise. He came out of the Stable alone, and in a little Time he mounted his Horse and went away; but did not see her come out - The next Night she complained to me of a Pain in her Back, and a burning within - I ask'd her if it was a Fever? and she said No, I never was so in my Life.</p>

I look'd out, and he asked if Mrs. May was within - She is gone to Bed, says I; shall I call her? No, says he, it's no matter.</p>

            . I keep the Bird-in-hand at Waltham-cross - On Friday Morning the Prisoner was at my House. About 9 the Prosecutrix knock'd at the Door (tho' the Door was open) and said, Is one Mr. - here? I said, Yes he's in the Kitchen with some Men, will you please to go in? No, said she, if there is Company I had rather you'll call him out.</p>

               <p>Elizabeth Aylet. She ask'd for him by Name; and so I shew'd her into the Parlour, and told him; but he was smoaking his Pipe, and did not come presently. She complain'd there was no Fire in the Parlour, and so I led her up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173407100021"/> stairs - The Prisoner came up and said, So! So! have I catch'd you napping? Then he saluted her, and call'd for a Quartern of Brandy. She drank a little of it, but she chose to have a hot Pot, and so I made one, and after that another; they seem'd to be very friendly, and abundance of pretty Compliments past between them - He said she was an old Acquaintance that he had met on the Road, and would treat her with what the House afforded. I told them I had Bacon an Eggs, - No - Or Salt Fish and Eggs - No - Or a Pullet full of Eggs - Aye, says she, that will do; and he bid me get it ready; and so I did, and she eat part of a Wing - They sat at the Foot of the Bed, and I left them several times together, for I thought no harm.</p>
               <p>Council. Had he any Pistols?</p>
               <p>Elizabeth Aylet. Yes, and he laid them on the Chest of Drawers; for he usually laid them down when he came in.</p>
               <p>Council How came it that he did not lay them down in the Kitchen?</p>
               <p>Elizabeth Aylet. Because he was just a-going, but it raining a little, he sat down to smoak a Pipe, and was in the Kitchen about an Hour with 2 other Men.</p>

He answer'd; he has been a very good Master; and if my Wife had told me the Truth at first, I would have gone another way to work. went to the Prisoner, who said, I know nothing of it; but he owes me a little Money, and I suppose this is some Trick. So I went again to John May, and ask'd him what he meant by beginning such a Prosecution as might take away his Master's Life.

Allons! The Prisoner said, I'll fight you no more, for I believe you have got it - This is your own seeking, you forced me to it. Then they spoke French. I saw some Blood run from the Deceased's Back, under his Shoulder The Prisoner put his Sword up, and the Deceas'd put his Clothes on, and said to the Prisoner, give me my Hat and Wig. Aye, says the Prisoner, if you'll give me or that Gentleman your Sword first, for I won't trust my Life in your hands. Then the Deceas'd took up his own Hat and Wig, and we all went into the Lane The Deceas'd appear'd still full of Resentment, and therefore the Prisoner would not walk before him, but said, my dear Dubois (for they were both of the same Name, and both Masters of the Sword) if you will go before, I will take care of you; but I won't trust you behind me - You know you forced me to it. The Deceas'd made no answer; but to end the difference, I went between them, the Prisoner being on my right hand and the Deceas'd on my left: He bled very much; and so we went to the bottom of the Lane, and then I turn'd back.</p>

            , Surgeon. Between 3 and 4 a Clock the Prisoner came in a Chair to my House in Panton Square - He said he had walked two Miles from Berwick-Street, before he could get a Chair, and bled all the Way. He desir'd I would go home and dress him; but I advis'd him not to go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173407100022"/> home in that bloody Condition he was in, for fear of frightening his Wife. I saw the Wound was Mortal, it pass'd above the Right-breast, and below the Collar-bone, and cut the auxillary great blood Vessel that goes to the Arm. He still seem'd to retain some Animosity against the Person that had wounded him, tho' he would not name him, but said he had not done, if a Man on Horseback had not come up while they were fighting - The Deceas'd dy'd next Day, and the loss of Blood was the cause of it.</p>
               <p>Several Gentlemen of the Blade depos'd, That the Prisoner was a peaceable inoffensive Man, and gave a different Character of the Deceas'd.</p>
