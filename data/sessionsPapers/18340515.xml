             complained to me again, and I went to the table where the prisoner was at work - I asked him what he meant by such conduct, and was about to strike him on the face with the back of my open hand - he retreated about two yards from me, as if to avoid my blow, and then turned his back to me in a stooping position, and I struck him a blow with my first on his back - it was not a severe blow - it was a moderate blow with my fist - not a violent one - not as hard as I could strike - he raised himself up, and turned immediately, and I observed he had his hand over his head, rather above his head - I did not observe any thing in his hand - I supposed he had picked something up to throw at me from the position he was in - I immediately ran up to him and seized him, and I might have struck him at the same time - I am not positive - the moment I got my hand on his collar, I received a blow from a dagger, which went through my left arm, just above the elbow - it passed through it in a slanting direction, about two inches above the elbow - it went through the fleshy part of my arm - I said, "You villain, you have stabbed me," and I saw him throw the dagge rout of his hand behind him - it fell on a bag of corks - I then called William Hodgkinson, and desired him to take him into custody, which he did - Hodgkinson was in the warehouse - I called him up after I was wounded -

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. How old is the prisoner? A. I believe about sixteen - he has been with us about four years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been in the habit of striking the men or boys on the premises? A. Many times - I have not punished the boys severely - I never punished the prisoner except at the time I have stated - the only occasion on which I corrected the prisoner was five or six weeks before; he was cutting labels at the table, he spoiled some, and I pulled his ears - I was in a very great passion on the occasion in question - I am not aware that my passion increased while I was striking him - when I attempted to seize him, it is possible I might have struck him - I cannot say whether I did or not - seeing his hand raised, I thought he had something to throw, and went to stop him - at the time I received the blow, my arm was lifted up to seize him - it was extended away from my body, not down by my side - I seized him with my left arm, and received the wound in that arm.</p>
               <p>Q. The first blow you gave him was on his face? A. No; I attempted to strike him in the face, but I did not touch him - that was with the back of my open hand - it was not a violent blow - I struck him afterwards on the back - that was not a very violent blow, I will<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150004"/>swear - I do not know that any of the other boys were in the habit of carrying any thing like this dagger with them - I have since heard one boy had two fencing swords.</p>

On the 3rd of April, in consequence of Weston coming to me, I went to his assistance - he desired me to secure Quick - I said, "Quick, what have you been doing? - how came you to do this?" - he said, "Never mind, that is nothing to nobody; I have owed him a grudge a good while" - he had the dagger in his hand as I went down the room, and as I advanced towards him he threw it on the floor - there was a little blood on the dagger - the point of it stuck in the boards - I delivered it to one of the clerks - the officer has got it - I took the prisoner down stairs; and while we were standing in the lower part of the warehouse, a boy, named Joel, came up to him - I told him to go and mind his work; and, as he went away, the prisoner said, "Now, Joel, you may give them those papers" Joel had got some papers - I was not present when he gave them up - I saw the papers afterwards - I asked the prisoner what it was Joel had got - he said, "It is only some papers for the boys" - he did not explain what he meant.</p>

            . I was at work at Day and Martin's at this time - I was with the prisoner when he purchased the dagger, about six weeks before this happened - he gave 4s. for it - he did not say what he wanted it for - I think it was bought in Russell-court; it was at the back of Drury-lane theatre - the prisoner had given me a paper parcel on the morning of the 3rd of April, before this matter happened, about seven o'clock - he gave it me and said, "Do not open this till I tell you" - after this had happened he said, "Now, Joel, you may open that" - I gave it to Moel, one of the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you know what he bought the dagger for? A. No; I think it was to play with; because we used to play with such things.</p>
               <p>Q. With daggers? A. With knives, made like daggers - I and another boy and the prisoner used to play with them - we used to open them at one another - we used to play theatrically - I had a ground knife - I only had it one night, and I took it home - I put it in my breeches.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the knife open and shut? A. No; there was tin case made to it - I do not know that it would be dangerous to put it where I did, without a sheath - I put it inside my breeches - it was not sharp - it had not a very sharp point - it was not quite a point - if I had struck any body with it, I do not know whether it would have stabbed them - one other boy had a knife which, I believe, he used to carry up his sleeve - two of the boys had swords.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see the prisoner sharpen the dagger? A. Yes; I do not know how long it was before the accident - he sharpened it on a grindstone.</p>
               <p>MR. STAMMERS. Q. Did he sharpen it where you sharpened yours? A. Mine was not sharpened - I do not know whether the other boys sharpened theirs - I have seen the papers - I recollect that the prisoner once gave me some papers, three or four months before this took place - there was something written on it - it was not an authority to receive part of his wages.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not a custom among the boys to pass these papers from one to another occasionally? A. I have known it - I never saw a boy with a pistol nor a horn.</p>
               <p>MR. DAWSON. Q. Was it customary for the boys to make the papers into parcels, and give them into the custody of another boy to keep? A. I do not know about that.</p>

               <p>MR. STAMMERS. Q. Have you never told any body that the prisoner did not say what you now say he did say? A. No; I saw Quick's father yesterday at dinner time - I did not talk to him about it yesterday.</p>

               <p>MR. STAMMERS. Q. Did any other boys wear knives? A. Yes; I do not know where they wore them - they used to play with them - Mr. Weston struck the prisoner on the back once, and he stooped down up against the cork bag - he struck him the second time on the side of the head - as he struck him on the back, he stooped down - Quick got up, turned round, and Weston struck him on the side of the head - Mr. Weston was very angry.</p>

             JONES. I am a surgeon. On the 3d of April, I was called in to attend the prosecutor - he had a punctured wound in the arm, about two inches above the elbow, passing through the fleshy part of the arm, it passed obliquely upward, quite through the fleshy part - it was a punctured wound or stab.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I am placed before you charged with a crime of a very serious nature; I will state nothing but the truth. I do most solemnly declare the act was not premeditated, neither did I buy the instrument for any purpose, only to play with. I never owed Mr. Weston any malice in my life, though he has struck me before. There is no person can say that I ever threatened Mr. Weston or any one else to do them any injury. The other boys were in the habit of carrying weapons of a similar nature, and I got one likewise, as we were in the habit of playing at robbers and banditti. Those papers that I gave to John Joel were in case I got discharged, for I fully expected it. I did not expect Mr. Weston would strike me; when he struck me, I tried to get out of the way, but he followed me, and kept striking me, which so irritated me, that I struck the blow for which I am arraigned at the bar, and which I have since most sincerely repented of.</p>

On Saturday, the 26th of April, about half-past two o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed by the policeman - I got up, and let him into the house - my family consist of my son and my sister - I and my son had fastened the house up at night, and went to bed about twelve o'clock - we fastened and locked up all the doors, but there is a cellar flap which lets the light into the cellar, that was let down, but the bolt did not catch - it was close down - it is a flap which goes up to the wall and shuts down - it was closed, but not bolted - it is a flap in a larger one.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you get to the cellar? A. You go into the bar, and a door opens from the bar into the cellar - that door was locked when I went to bed - when I got up I found the bar door locked, and the cellar door also - we went down into the cellar - I found the brandy jar removed into another cellar where rum is kept - that is the cellar the flap opens into - I am quite sure that jar was in the other cellar when I went to bed - I had seen it there that night the last thing before I went to bed - we found every thing correct - nothing was broken - whoever got into the cellar must have had a light, or they could not have passed along without some accident happening - nothing was taken away from the cellar - there is a staircase from the bar into the cellar, and there were marks where they had been cutting to force open the lock to get into the bar - that is the door I mentioned before - the door was cut by the side of the lock, but not sufficiently to let the bolt of the lock at liberty - the policeman and I went down - we found two gallons and a half of brandy and rum in the jar the brandy had been in - they had removed the jar out of the cellar with the brandy in it, and drawn some rum into it - there was about a gallon and a half of rum taken from a cask and mixed with the brandy - nothing was taken away - we looked about, but found no house-breaking implements, nor any thing deficient- I have known the prisoner some years - he is a labouring man, and was in my house the evening before, with three more companions, and left about half-past eleven o'clock, when all my company went out together - I fastened the front door after them - he had come into my house about half-past nine o'clock that evening with his companions - the house is in the township of New Brentford - the cellar is part of the house, and under it.</p>

I walked before the horses and stopped the prisoner - I said, "What have you been at?" - he said, "Nothing" - White said, "You have just come out of the cellar" - I said, "I shall take you - you shall not go further till there is a policeman," and it was agreed he should go with White to the police - White took him along, and they had a scuffle in the road - I went to assist White, and kept him till the policeman came - I am sure he is the man - I saw him cross the road from the cellar - I did not see him come out of the cellar - this was between the market-place and the bridge at Brentford - it was a moonlight night - it was very light - the moon was not full.(The prisoner made no defence.)</p>

            . In April last, I was employed by Mr. Page, my uncle, at Messrs. Broadwood's. On Friday, the 4th of April, the prisoner came into the shop where I was at work, and said he wanted to speak to me - I went down out of the shop - he said he had by him a piece of silk, which was made a present to him as a Christmas-box, by Mr. Chester - I do not know who Chester is - he asked if I was acquainted with any body in our line who would purchase it of him - I made inquiry at night as I went home - I saw him again on Saturday, and he asked if I had spoken to any body about the silk - I told him I had, and they could give me no satisfactory answer unless they saw it - that was about one o'clock - I saw him again between six and seven o'clock that night, at Mr. Swan's public-house, at the corner of Windmill-street - he had a parcel with him like silk - I did not know what it contained - it was rolled in paper - I came out of the public-house without my hat, and went to the Lemon public-house - I stood outside the bar, and the prisoner then had the same paper parcel with him - he asked me if I knew where he lived - I said no - he then asked for a pen and ink, and gave me his direction on paper - I told him I was going back to Mr. Swan's - he gave the parcel to the bar-maid, to be left there till I called for it - it was put behind the counter - I left the house in company with the prisoner, and in Windmill-street he told me the silk was all right - I was to leave it at a Jew's at the corner of Marylebone-lane, where I had called about it on the Friday, and if it was approved of, I was to go back and let the prisoner know - I was to go to his written direction - while I was going to the Jew's, Preston joined me, and while I was with him I was taken into custody by Thompson, and gave him the direction the prisoner wrote me, and the parcel which I had received from the bar-maid - I cannot say whether that was the parcel that the prisoner left with her - I told the policeman how I procured the silk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You were accused of stealing it yourself? A. Yes - I said I got it from the prisoner, and was let go - I have known the prisoner for the last four or five years by seeing him about the premises, - the different workshops at the prosecutors' - I frequent the different workshops myself some times - I am not employed by Messrs. Broadwood's - I was on the premises five years as polisher there - Mr. Page contracts for the polishing for Messrs. Broadwoods - I work in their shop, which is in Bridle-lane, Horseferry-road - I never saw any silk there except bits lying about - I have seen it out he instruments- I never saw silk in the workmen's hands - I will swear that I have not seen yards - I am not aware that it is in Bridle-lane that the silk is put into the pianofortes - I have never seen more than will go into an instrument - I do not know whether silk was kept there - I never saw any silk put on the instruments - I believe a man contracts for doing it - whether he does it at home or not I cannot say- no rolls of silks are kept in Bridle-lane or Horseferry-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150009"/>road that I am aware of - I was tried last Sessions for this - I was charged with stealing the silk - those are the only two workshops Messrs. Broadwoods have that I know of - nobody threatened to indict me as a receiver.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you expect if this man is convicted you will not be tried as a receiver? A. No; I do not - I am not a receiver knowing it to be stolen - I know nothing at all about it - I do not expect to be tried again - I was never taken up before - I have been in a watch-house once - I have not been twice - I will swear I was not twice in a watch-house - it was for standing by when there was a row- a piece of work - there was nothing stolen - the watch-house is in High-street, Marylebone - I went before Mr. Rawlinson, the Magistrate, next day, and was examined - I was only there five minutes - I was taken up as tipsy, as they said, and was fined - that was the only time I was ever before a magistrate, that is two or three years ago - I told Thompson how I got the silk, but not all I have stated to-day - I went home after I got from prison - I was sent for by the solicitor about being a witness - I never opened the silk at all.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. When taken into custody, you gave an account to Thompson? A. Yes - I was afterwards tried and acquitted, and afterwards I was sent for by the solicitor.</p>

            . I am a sergeant of the D division of the police. On the 5th of April I was in Marylebone-lane - I saw Page and Preston between eight and nine o'clock at night at the shop door of Mr. Moss, a Jew - Page had this parcel of silk with him, which I afterwards took from him - it has been under my care ever since - after I got to the station-house, Page gave me a piece of paper, which I produce - in consequence of that, I went to No. 2, Titchfield-street, Dean-street, Soho, and found the prisoner there, in bed -(there is on the paper containing the parcel, "Harding and Co., 2625;" and under that, "80") - I awoke the prisoner out of his sleep - it was on the same night, between ten and eleven o'clock - I asked if he knew a man named Page - he said he did - I asked if he had sent Page to sell any silk for him - he said no - I told him he must get up - he did so - Jacques was with me - I sent him down for another officer, who was down stairs; and while he was gone the prisoner was by the side of the bed, and he said, "You can make this all right"- I said, "No; I can make nothing right" - I did not want him to say any thing to me, but to reserve what he had got to say before the magistrate - on our way to the station-house he said, that I could do all for him, and he would give me a sovereign to let him go home to sleep - at the station-house I asked him to write his address, which he did - I then produced this paper, and asked if he knew that handwriting - he said yes; that it was his direction - I said, "Yes, and your writing" - he said, yes it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He wrote his true address without any hesitation? A. Yes - he said he had not sent Page with any silk - I only asked him that question once.</p>

            . I am shopman to Harding and Smith, who are silk-mercers, living in Pall-mall - they supply Messrs. Broadwoods with silk of a particular description - this roll of silk was supplied by our house to them on the 25th of March - the figures on the paper are the marks of the manufacturer - I produce the invoice of the manufacturers, which corresponds with the number on the paper, and also on the block - it is worth 3s. a yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It is by the mark on the block you know it? A. Yes - the silk is considerably wider than silk is usually made - it is made expressly for Broadwood's - we do not supply any other house with it - other houses may use the same width.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. The silk is unusually wide? A. Yes - it is made by particular direction for Broadwood's.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. That is, provided the manufacturer had none ready made by him? A.

            . I am a French-polisher, and live in Princes-street, Soho - I recollect the Monday the prisoner was taken into custody - on the Saturday night previous, I was at the corner of Windmill-street - my men are paid at Swan's, but I never go there myself - I was near the house, and recollect seeing the prisoner opposite the house, about a quarter to seven o'clock - he asked me to go and drink with him - I refused - he had a parcel with him, eighteen or twenty inches long - it might be six times as large as this - I cannot say, for I did not take particular notice - I cannot say whether it was larger or smaller - that was a little before seven o'clock, as near as I can tell - the parcel was wrapped up in a different way to this - the paper is different altogether - it was wrapped up in whity-brown paper - he went from me into the public-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The paper parcel you saw was quite different from that altogether? A. Yes, it was - Page is my nephew - it is five years, on the 1st of April, since he was first in Broadwood's employ - I was on the premises in Bridle-lane - I do not know that they silked the piano-fortes there, but I believe they do - I believe they take the size of the front of the piano-forte and mark it out, and cut the silk out to the size - I have seen men at work there on the silk - one man, I believe, in particular was employed to put the silk into the fronts - I am still in the employ of Messrs. Broadwood - they have a great number of piano-fortes, and require a vast deal of silk - I may have seen forty of fifty piece of silk there during the time my nephew worked there; they were different colours - I have seen several pieces in the counting-house, containing a good many yards - the counting-house is in Bridle-lane - it is not my nephew's place to go there - it is my place - I do not believe he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150010"/>ever was in the counting-house - he was taken up for this - he is now a polisher in the cabinet line - I came here last sessions to give him a five years' character - I have known him twenty-six years.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. During the five years he worked at Messrs. Broadwood's, who paid his wages? A. I did - I hired him, not they - part of the work is done in Bridle-lane and part on the premises - my nephew worked on the opposite side of the way from the counting-house, in the square yard - he had no business in the counting house, or any where but in the polishing room, unless I sent him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In what respect was the parcel different to this? A. Instead of being rolled in this manner, the paper was twisted at both ends.</p>

On the 5th of April I was at the Swan in Windmill-street about seven o'clock, a little before or after; and after I was there a short time, I saw Page - while in conversation with him the prisoner came up and spoke to Page - he had something under his arm - I cannot tell whether it was round or square, nor what size it was - I heard him say he had been looking for Page - I wished them good night, and then left - I cannot say whether they left together - I cannot tell whether the parcel was in paper or cloth.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Round or square, short or long, you could not tell? A. I could not - he had something under his arm.</p>
               <p>THOMAS AYLING re-examined. I recollect this piece of silk being in Broadwood's possession. I saw it as late as the 25th of March.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it wrapped up? A. It was- I did not open it - this is the paper which was round it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How can you say that is the same piece of silk? A. First, from the number on the paper, and the handwriting, and the number on the roller - the quality is the same as we use; but I cannot swear it is the same silk - I think it was delivered to us on the 24th or 25th of March - I saw it there on the 25th of March - it was received by the prisoner then - I was not present - I saw two other pieces lying with it; one blue, and the other the same colour as this - there was no silk missed.</p>

The prisoner was given into my custody last Saturday, about half-past four o'clock, in Oxford-street - as we went to the station-house I asked his name - he said it was nothing to me - I asked where he lived, he made no answer - I neither threatened nor promised him - when we were at the station-house I asked what induced him to do this - he said he had no work - he had heard the charge made, it was for stealing a lady's reticule from her arm - he said then, "I suppose it will be all up with me this time" - when I got to the station-house I had searched him for the pocket-book, but not finding it, I said, "What has become of the pocket-book?"- he said if we had looked out sharp we might have seen that as well as the purse; and then he said he hoped somebody had got it that would do good with it, it was a good prize - I received the bag from the witness - it had a red purse and three sovereigns and a half, five half-sovereigns, two shillings, and two sixpences in it.</p>
               <p>MISS HUTTON. This is my bag and money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was passing through Castle-street promiscuously - I picked it up - several persons saw me pick it up, and called after me - they ran after me, and being so closely pursued I threw it away.</p>

            . I am a police-serjeant. On Saturday, the 26th of April, I was on duty, and met the prisoner at half-past four o'clock in the morning, in the Kingsland-road - he had a mare, and was leading her, coming towards town - I asked him where he was going with the mare - he said he was going to the knackers with her - I told him I thought she was too good for the knackers - he said, no she was not, she was quite worn out, she was of no use but for the knackers - I asked him who it belonged to - he said it belonged to his brother at Hertford-heath - I then took him to the station-house, and from there to Worship-street, with the mare - I asked him who it belonged to at the station-house, and he gave me the same answer, that it belonged to his brother at Hertford - he was taken to Worship-street on Saturday morning, the 26th - what he said there was taken down in writing - he was remanded until the Monday - I put the mare up at a livery stable, at the Elephant, in the Kingsland-road - it is a very dark brown mare- I did not see Pavitt till Monday morning, at Worship-street, where I had brought the mare to - Pavitt saw it there in my presence - he claimed it and took it home.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PAVITT re-examined. I saw the mare on Sunday at the Elephant, in the Kingsland-road, and also on the Monday following at Worship-street - I saw Clark in Kingsland-road on the Sunday, and on the Monday we went to Worship-street together - I followed behind him - I saw the mare at Worship-street, in his presence - it was mine.</p>

I went after a job of work, and I had 5l. 10s. in my pocket - on Cheshunt-common I lit on a man named Pitts, as he told me - he asked if I wanted to buy a mare - I told him "No" - he said, "If you are out of work you may get 1l. or 2l. by it" - I said, "What do you want for it?" - he said "5l. 10s." - I bid him 3l. 10s. - he said I should have it - I gave him the money - he said,"There is no doubt, if you go to London, you may clear 2l. on it" - I said I would, as I had nothing to do - this was last Friday fortnight evening, about five o'clock.</p>

Yes; I think I did; I am not sure of it - I think I did state it - I am sure of it - my eldest child is seventeen, the next is thirteen years of age; but the eldest was not at home - the youngest was at home - she knows nothing about it - my door opens by a latch, and so does the other door - my husband locked the door - he did not go out with me - I locked the door the night before, when I went out, between ten and eleven o'clock, and next morning I found it only on the latch - I pulled it after me when I went out - my husband bolted it after me - it locks without the key - it is a spring lock, which any body inside could open - I pulled the door to - the prisoner and I have never had any quarrel; not the slightest - I do not remember a word of quarrelling about a counterfeit shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she throw away a counterfeit shilling which you gave her? A. I did not give her the shilling - she asked me for money - I told her I had none, and she snatched a shilling out of my hand - that was on the 18th of April, before I charged her with this business - it was not a very bad one - I did not offer it to any body - she had no business to take it - I did not want her to take it - I was not angry with her for taking it - she snatched it out of my hand, and ran out with it - I never asked her to pass it - I did not go to her house for that - she never told me she would not try to pass it for me; but I never wanted her to pass it - my husband's master would take the shilling back, for he had worked for it - I had not quarrelled with her about the shilling - I said nothing to her about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Has she ever bought any thing of you - some of these very things you charge her with? A. She took several of my things before she left, and that is the reason I gave her notice to quit - she bought some of my property and thieved them too - my husband never takes notice of what I have got - I told him she had bought things of me - I never sent out for brandy with the money she gave me for the things - I cannot say I do not like a glass very well.</p>

             - I remember her going out between ten and eleven o'clock, she pulled the door after her; and I went and bolted it, and went to bed - and about two o'clock in the morning, I heard the prisoner knocking at my door - she was very much intoxicated - I could tell that from her voice, as I knew her from lodging with us - she asked me to let her in, for she was almost perishing with cold; but I did not answer her - and about three o'clock, I heard her again knocking at the door - she said, "Pray, Jones, let me in; I am almost perishing with cold" - but I did not let her in - I heard no more of her - I am quite certain it was her voice - I got up that morning about half-past five o'clock, and went down stairs, and undid the door, which was fast as I had left it, bolted inside - I left the house about a quarter before six o'clock, and put the door on the latch - I pulled the spring lock back - I am quite sure the door was latched, for I tried it - I returned about half-past eight o'clock to breakfast, and found my wife at home - about three weeks afterwards, when my wife returned from nursing, she brought me a piece of stocking, which had come off my waistcoat - it had been part of my waistcoat-sleeve - I went to Worship-street that day, the 18th of April, and went to the prisoner's house with two policemen, and found two caps, and many other things, which my wife owned - as soon as we found one article, Allen fell on her knees and begged me to go no further with it, and she would give me 1l. - I said I never took a bribe from any body, but if the magistrate thought proper, I was agreeable.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons had you left behind in the house when you went out in the morning? A. My two children, who are thirteen and ten years old - they were able to go down stairs - they go to school, and let themselves and out - the prisoner offered 1l. to me - my wife was present - she told me she had sold the prisoner some things when she lived with us - I did not see my wife sell her any thing - I do not remember the quarrel about the bad shilling - I was not present - I had received the shilling from my master - I left it on the table, and my wife took it up; but I know nothing of what passed between the prisoner and her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know she and your wife were in the habit of swapping, and getting brandy and gin? A. No; she is not in the habit of drinking like other people - I do not know that there were bargains between them about their different apparel - I heard of the prisoner buying caps of her.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I have two caps - I found one in a band-box, and another in a bag in the prisoner's room, in Thomas-street, Hackney-road, on the 18th of April - the prosecutor lives in York-row, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch - the prisoner and her husband were both at home - the prosecutor and his wife went with me - the prisoner denied strongly knowing any thing of the robbery, and did not say how she came by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150011"/>them - as I was taking her from her home to the station-house, she offered me 2l. to let her go - she said, "Do not take me to the station-house" - I said, "If you give me 5,000l. I dare not do it" - as I took her from the station-house to Worship-street she said, "I did take the property"- I had not said a word whatever to her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was after you had refused 2l. to let her go home? A. Yes - I had asked her no question whatever about it - I did not make her any answer - she voluntarily said she did take it - she did not say, "I am sorry for it" - that was all that passed between us - we walked rather better than half or three quarters of a mile - during all that walk not a word passed besides - I cannot say that I have described all that took place in the room, for I was busy searching the room - nothing more took place, more than the prisoner stating she would make any recompense to the prosecutor not to bring it any further - that was what I heard - no sum was mentioned that I heard - the prisoner was sometimes standing up and sometimes sitting down - it was a good-sized room - there was a bed in it - I cannot say that she fell on her knees to either of them - she might have done it while I was searching on one side of the bed - she could not have spoken loud enough for them to hear and I not hear her in that room - I did not hear any sum mentioned.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many caps did you sell her? A. None; I gave her one when she came home drunk, without cap or bonnet - she had two or three men with her at my house - I sold her one cap and gave her another - two policemen were in the room when she offered me 1l. - she mentioned the word "pound" to me, and after that she went on her knees - whether they saw her I cannot tell - they were searching for my things - it is a very large room - I know she fell on her knees - she did not mention the pound very loud - she mentioned it to me - any body in the room must have heard it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was your brother policeman there? A. He was - it is a middling-sized room - her falling on her knees escaped his observation - I was down on the left hand side of the bed, and he was on the other side against the door against the fire-place, and the foot of the bedstead comes to the fire-place - he could not see it as his back was to the fire-place - he might not have heard it - I did not hear the word "recompense" mentioned.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old. I live in Great Peter-street, Westminster. I was in Fleet-street on the 25th of April, about four o'clock, and saw the prisoner pull his hand out of the prosecutor's pocket, as I turned round to go into a shop - the prosecutor turned round, collared him, and then he dropped the pocket-book - the prosecutor put him into the shop that I was going into.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far were you from the prisoner? A. Close to him - I was on the curb-stone - I was going into a shop - I think he put the hand into the nearest pocket to me - when he was taken, he said it was not him, and at the watch-house he said he had shown the gentleman a man who was running, but he would not go after him - I did not see him till he was pulling his hand out of the gentleman's pocket - he was shuffling past.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received the prisoner in charge, at 94, Fleet-street, from General Mawby, with the pocket-book.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I left the Borough on my way to Smithfield. I had to go to my uncle's with a parcel, and from there to Drury-lane Theatre; and in Fleet-street, about half-past five o'clock, I was walking very fast on the curb, when the prosecutor came up and accused me of it - I went with him into a shop - they sent for a policeman, who came in about ten minutes, and the lad came in at the same time - he heard the prosecutor's evidence, and instantly said he had seen my hand in the gentleman's pocket; he knew nothing about it till he heard the prosecutor's statement - I had my hand in my coat pocket when the gentleman caught hold of me - when he took up the book he was ten or twelve yards from me.</p>
               <p>RICHARD JAMES COX re-examined. The prosecutor called me, and asked me what I had seen - I told him - he did not tell me that the prisoner was the man - he said,"Did you see the prisoner do it?" - I said, "Yes" - that was all - I am sure I saw what I have stated.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. I suppose you were rather agitated at the attack? A. I cannot say I was, or I should not have been able to clear these fellows out of the way for me to run after him - I certainly was not very collected - I lost sight of the prisoner when he turned into the market - there was the angle of the passage between him and me for about half a minute - he must have changed the watch from his right hand to his left before he got to the corner, because I saw it in his left hand before that - I was not observing him at the moment he changed it - he must have done it under his coat - he took it with his right hand, and I saw it afterwards in his left - I will not venture to swear he changed it under his coat, because I could not see it - I recognised two other men at the police-office, but not sufficiently to swear to them - there are one or two others I could swear to, whom I have been looking for ever since - there was a man with a wooden leg in the office who I said was exceedingly like one of them, but I said I would not swear to him - I am not persuaded that he was not one of them now.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Whether he changed the watch before his breast or under his coat, are you sure he was the man who had your watch? A. Most undoubtedly - I never doubted his being the man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Although your attention was not called to the features of the man who took the watch, because he was so near you, are you quite clear the prisoner was the person who held your watch in the manner you have described? A. My attention was particularly directed to his features; I saw his face at the time the watch was taken - his face was close to mine; but I could not see the watch then, as he was so close to me - I saw his features distinctly when it was being taken from my person.</p>

I pursued the prisoner, hearing the cry of "Stop thief" - I saw nothing in his hand - I kept my eye on him, and when he went round the market I lost sight of him for a short time; and at the end of the market a number of others surrounded him, and he said, "I am not the man; let me go" - I said, "That is the man; do not let him go" - I saw no property about him; but I pursued him, on Mr. Webster's calling "Stop thief," up Lime-street, into the market.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you keep your eyes on him all the way? A. Certainly not - I saw nothing at all in his hand - from his appearance at first I could not believe he was the thief; but when I saw him endeavouring to get away, and saying it was not him, I said, "That is the man" - I knew it was the prisoner from the first sight I had of him- he ran about fifty yards - I had a full view of his face when he turned the corner.</p>

I am an officer of St. Bride's - on the 25th of April I was coming down Fleet-street, and saw the two prisoners behind the prosecutor - Lloyd ran up and took the handkerchief out, and handed it to the other prisoner, who saw me and threw it down - I seized him, and told the prosecutor his pocket was picked - he felt and missed it - I said, "There it lies, on the ground" - he took it up, and I told him to come to the watch-house - he seemed not inclined to come, and I said, "This is the way so many pickpockets are about," and he came down with it- I afterwards went into the watch-house, and said as I came along, two young gentlemen had very nearly picked a pocket.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

That I can say nothing about - I have been in the trade about eight years - I have not been shopman in a retail house - I will not undertake to swear it is not the custom, but I should consider it is not - a note fell from his pocket with the other things, containing an order from a friend of his for these very articles - I believe the policeman has it.(This note was signed " J. Fraser," and requested the prisoner to send him the articles in question.)</p>

            . I am a shopman to Brown, Sharp, and Co., Linen-drapers, in Bread-street. I have been in the retail trade upwards of ten years as a servant - I have been eighteen months in Brown, Sharp and Co.'s service - I have been in four places of the same kind in London, and one in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the understood term of contract between a master and servant in your business with reference to goods? A. That they are not entered during the time of day when they are busy.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What are entered? A. Goods that young men require for their own purpose - they are not taken secretly, but the young men get the goods cut, and they are laid aside till they are entered, either in the morning or evening - the man who wants them often cuts them off himself - he gives notice to his employer of it - they are laid aside publicly.</p>
               <p>MR. STAMMERS. Q. Is it always the case that goods are openly exposed to the master's eye? A. I cannot say that it is - I have been in the employ of people whom I might not see for three or four days - the goods are generally entered in the morning, being the most disengaged.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are we to understand that you being in the employ of a person, in his absence for four days together, you have taken his goods, and set them aside without his knowledge or any communication to him? A. No; I get the goods entered for me during his absence, by another servant - but I could not do that while they were busy - there was no secrecy in the transaction - they were laid aside.</p>
               <p>MR. STAMMERS. Q. How long have you known the prisoner? A. Upwards of seven years - his character has been the best for honesty and respectability.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Are you the writer of this note? A. Yes- I wrote it to the prisoner with the intention of getting the goods - I thought I should have them cheaper from him than at other shops - I thought I should have them at cost price.</p>
               <p>MR. SIMPSON re-examined. The price is marked on one of the articles - a young man, Adams, was in the depart<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150017"/>ment to sell these goods - the prisoner could know the price from the mark - the mark does not signify the cost price at all - the wholesale and retail price is marked on them - the handkerchiefs are 47s. 6d. a dozen, or 4s. 6d. a single handkerchief - we allow our servants to take articles from the stock at cost price - they employ another to cut or count them, and that person takes them up to the entering clerk to be entered at that very time.</p>

            . The prisoner was in my employ, and was intrusted to receive money - when Wilkinson was in my shop I observed her looking at some flannel and stockings - shortly after the prisoner brought me 5s. with a bill, which I produce - the regular way a bill should be made out by a shopman is describing the articles, and having the articles examined by another young man, who signs the bill: and the custom is to take the bill up with the money, in order that it may be seen to be correct - the cashier was at tea, and I went to the desk to receive the money myself - he paid me 5s. with this bill - I asked him what goods he had sold her - he said, "Four yards of flannel at 1s. 21/2d., and a piece of tape at 2d." - he had made a false bill, and merely said on it, "Flannel 5s.," and it was not signed - I spoke to Wilkinson, and observed two pair of stockings lying on the flannel he had sold her - he hesitated at doing the parcel up - he then called me aside, and said there was a mistake, that the goods he sold her came to 6s. - I said, "You have only brought me 5s." - he said, "Here another shilling" - this bill is in his writing; that which is in pencil; what is in ink is mine - it was not till I had spoken to Wilkinson, and looked at the parcel, I learnt from him that he had sold to the extent of 6s. - he said he had sold her tape, but she had not bought any - the bill merely was "Flannel, 5s." - when I had examined the parcel he said it was a mistake, and it was 6s. - the flannel mentioned at 4s. 10d., and he said there were two pieces of tape, making it 5s. - I found there was no tape, but two pair of stockings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been in business? A. On my own account about twelve months - I never had a mistake made by a shopman in that way before with the money retained in his hand - I was six years in business before I began myself - I never heard of a shopman making a false bill out - it was his duty to get the bill marked - I was within five yards of him, and generally, when I can, I mark the bills - he never made an excuse for not getting it marked.</p>
               <p>COURT. A. When you asked him what articles had been sold, he said flannel and tape, 2d.? A. Yes; when I ascertained what he had sold, and that it was 6s., he said it was a mistake, and offered me 1s.</p>

               <p>MR. STAMMERS. Q. Did not he say, as if recollecting himself, "Oh, there are two pair of hose?" A. He simply said, "There is a mistake; the goods I sold amount to 6s. - I have another shilling," and gave it to me - I suppose he stood hesitating three quarters of a minute.</p>
               <p>MARY WILKINSON examined. I paid him two half-crowns, and one shilling - I did not receive any change from him.</p>

I was going down Petticoat-lane to make an exchange for my coat; I saw these books selling by a boy about eighteen years of age; he was showing them to a parcel of Jews. I asked what he wanted for them: he said a shilling. I said I would give him ten-pence for them, and I bought them. The next morning I was going along with them, and was stopped. I had borrowed the flannel jacket to wear for a day or two, while I had this coat repaired under the arm.</p>

On the 20th of April I was on duty in St. Martin's-lane - I saw the prisoner in the act of getting into a cab; and this glass was handed to him in the cab by another person - it was then about half-past three o'clock - I ran and told the driver to go to Bow-street, as he was a reputed thief - the cabman made use of very abusive language, and said he would not - he whipped his horse and drove off - I ran and took the number of the cab, and reported the circumstance, and in half an hour I heard the glass had been stolen - I traced the prisoner to the Hampstead-road, and there found the glass - I went to his lodging and found him on a sofa - he made great resistance, and struck, and kicked, and bit us - it took four or five of us to take him - I found in his room this stock, two bits, a jemmy, some pick-lock keys, and a dark lanthorn on a new construction - I found a metal box soldered together - I opened it, and found in it this model of a key taken in soap - this glass was at the public-house; but this piece of the frame was at his room.</p>

               <p>- WICKINS (examined by the Prisoner.) I am a cab-driver. On the day you called my cab, and got in, another man gave you the glass - the policeman came and asked you if you were not a brass-founder - you told him you was - I do not know that you told him where you was going - the policeman said he knew you, and told me to drive to Bow-street - I said the gentleman had hired me to go to Somers-town, and you told me to go on - I touched the horse, and went on - there were several round the cab - you said to the man who gave you the glass,"You are satisfied?" - he said, "I am," and he went away.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the prisoner intoxicated? A. He was a little in liquor - he told me to drive to Somers-town; but when we got to Camden-town, he said, "Draw up here" - he got out - a lady and gentleman came out on a balcony, and they said he would break the glass - I told him he had better leave it; but he said "No, it is my property; I will take it."</p>

On the 12th of April I went to my cash-drawer and took out two £5 notes and four sovereigns to pay my bookbinder - I left fifteen sovereigns in my drawer - I came into the parlour with the two £5 notes, and four sovereigns in my hand, and placed them on the table - I observed the prisoner in the shop - the parlour door was partly open - he saw me, and said, "Oh, Mr. Denham" - he then came into the parlour, and said, "I beg pardon, but have you a sovereign of this coinage, as we have a fellow who is passing gilt sixpences for half-sovereigns, and we suspect he is passing gilt shillings for sovereigns" - I said, "There are four sovereigns on the table, are any of them the coinage you want?" - he turned them over, and said, "No, there is not one, will you look in your cash-box?" - I said, "There is none is the cash-box, but there are some in my drawer" - I then opened the drawer - he clapped his finger down on the money, and said, "Here is one," and went out - I pursued and overtook him, and brought him back - I gave him in charge of the policeman, who took him into the parlour to search him - I went to my drawer to see how many sovereigns I had lost, and I found but twelve - I am certain there had been fifteen before - I then returned to the parlour, and the officer had got his coat and waistcoat off - the prisoner said, "Do you mean to say I have robbed you?" I said, "Most unquestionably you have, and well you know it" - he then said, "I am a lost man," and taking up a pair of scissors he made an incision in his neck - he said, "I forgive you," and down he fell - he was taken to the office, and he then said, "I have robbed many a man in my time, but I did not rob Mr. Denham."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You came after me about one hundred yards? A. You were two hundred yards from the door when I took you - I said in the first instance, that you had robbed me of seven sovereigns, as I thought you had taken the four from the table - I did not say you had taken two - you did not give me a sovereign for what you took from the drawer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you certain you left fifteen sovereigns in the drawer? A. Yes; I am confident I did - I had not seen the prisoner before, but he addressed me as if he had known me for years.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's daughter. I remember the prisoner coming in and asking for a sovereign of that coinage - my father showed him the four on the table - he turned them over and said, there was not one of the kind he wanted - he then asked my father to look into his drawer, and he followed him into the room - he then came out again, went to the table and said, "Here is one" - he took up a sovereign and threw down another, and went out - I thought the one he threw down was bad, but it was not.</p>

             (police-constable C 14.) I was on duty that evening in Regent-street - the prisoner was given into my charge at Mr. Denham's house - I found three sovereigns in one of his waistcoat pockets, and three sovereigns and a half and some silver in his other pockets - these are the three sovereigns.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This policeman would come and sit between me and my solicitor, because he wanted to make up a tale, and when he took me he said he would tear my trousers off my back. Witness. It was by the magistrate's order that I went and sat by him, because he would not give his name - when I took him he resisted very much, and he took up this pair of scissors and made an incision in his neck.</p>

             (police constable N 154.) On the 11th of April, I went to a cottage in plain clothes to watch Mr. Wilks' house, and about eight o'clock in the evening I saw Hutchins and two others - two of them crossed over into the field, but Sawyer remained by the pales - I then removed to another place - Sawyer then whistled three times - I then saw the other two persons who had been with Sawyer come by, but I could not see whether they had any thing - I went into the field, and saw nine sashes on the grass, which had not been there at seven o'clock - I was returning, and met the two prisoners and another person going past - I believe they did not see me - I remained at the corner, and in about ten minutes one person came into the field, and took some of the sashes on his back - I went to meet him, but he turned to a shed in the field - I then saw Hutchins coming from the shed - I went to him, and said he was the man I wanted - he said, "Very well, I am willing to go" - when we got over the gate he said, he supposed I took him for trespassing on the field - I said, "No, you know very well what it is for" - he then refused to go any further - I told him it was for stealing those sashes in the field - I went to the shed and found eleven sashes, which have been fitted to the openings in Mr. Wilks' house, and they correspond exactly - I apprehended Sawyer at his lodgings, in a court in Hoxton, the next morning, at half-past six o'clock - he was in bed, and covered himself with the clothes that I should not see him, but I saw his jacket which he has worn for eleven months - I told him I wanted him; and he said it would be a good thing for him if he was to be transported.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. You saw Hutchins coming away from the shed, but you had not seen him go there? A. I saw one man go there, but cannot say who it was - he said he had been to his mother at Ball's-pond.</p>

On the 7th of April, about noon, the prisoner called at my shop with a person named Williams - he asked for a sextant, but he was in a great hurry to look at it, as he said he was going to the Duchess of Athol, and said he would call in the afternoon - he said he was a nautical man - he called again about three o'clock - he was shown a sextant and a telescope - he then asked to see some eye glasses, and some gold folded spectacles - he said the spectacles were too expensive, as he only wanted them for show - he chose an eye glass, and that, and the sextant, and telescope to be sent to No. 10, Mount-street, Mile-end, and to be sent soon, as he wanted to go to the Jerusalem coffee-house - my sister was in the parlour - when the prisoner was gone my sister spoke to me, and then went out - I afterwards went with the articles to No. 10, Mount-street, and on my road I saw my sister - I went to the house - I saw the prisoner and Williams there drinking wine, they asked me to partake of it, which I declined - I put down my instruments, and the prisoner asked if I had brought the drawing instruments - he had mentioned some drawing instruments when he had looked at the other articles at my shop, but he said he had laid out as much money as he could well afford, and that was the reason I did not take the drawing instruments to his house; and I told him I had not brought them, as they were not ordered - he then asked me to go back for them, but he said, "Stop, perhaps I had better pay you" - I said "Yes; you and I are strangers, and I should not like to leave the articles without being paid" - he then said to Williams, "Ring the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150023"/>bell for the servant to get change for a 50l. note;" but Williams suggested that it would not be right to let the servant have the note, as they were not always to be trusted - Williams then offered to get change, and the prisoner produced something, but what it was I do not know - Williams went out with it, and remained out about five or ten minutes - during his absence I told the prisoner he must not feel offended at my scruples in not trusting him, as I was a young tradesman - he said, "No man of honour would feel offended at such a thing" - when Williams took the note, the prisoner said, "At the top of the street they will give you change" - when Williams returned, he said they could not let him have change there, as the person was out; but his wife said they would let him have it in half an hour or three quarters - the prisoner wished me in the interim to get the drawing instruments - I knew my sister was at the outside, I went out and took a cab, to go and get the drawing instruments - the prisoner's conduct had the effect of lulling my suspicion - I do not know any thing more of the transaction till I saw him in custody - we went before Mr. Broughton, the magistrate - he thought there was no felony, and he discharged the prisoner - this is the bill of parcels which I gave the prisoner when the goods were delivered.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe there was some difficulty about your giving up this bill? A. No, not the least - I gave this bill to the prisoner after I delivered the goods - it is 15l. 15s. - my shop is about two miles from Mount-street - I went there in a cab as fast as I could, and came back, but found him in custody at the station-house when I saw him again - I was absent twenty minutes, or half an hour, when I went for the drawing instruments - three quarters of an hour had not elapsed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When the change was gone for you considered the goods were sold? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. And, I believe, you told Mr. Broughton so? A. I believe I did, and I believe he said,"Then it is a debt, and I can take no cognizance of it" - after the prisoner was discharged at Worship-street, I had him taken again about the 20th, and he was taken to Lambeth-street, when the bill was found by the Grand Jury - he did not tell Williams the name of the person he was to go to, nor did Williams mention any name when he came back - I did not ask to see the note.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did the prisoner ever restore you your goods between the 7th and the 20th of April? A. No- when I parted with my goods, delivering this bill of parcels, I did not deliver them on credit - I certainly expected to be paid for them before I left the place - when I sell goods for cash, it is my custom to give bills of parcels, as well as when they are sold on credit.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it the same evening that they were discharged? A.

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you told him in the shop that the goods were to be 15l.? A. No; I told him the sextant would be 12l. - the telescope 2l. 10s., and the eye-glass 1l. 5s. - he said, "Put them down at the lowest price" - which I did, but when I got to the house I said I would take 15l. for them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you made out the bill before or after you told him the price? A. After I told him the price, but I afterwards told him 15l. - 5 per cent. is the discount for ready money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If that were the case, why did you make the bill out for 15l. 15s.? A. Because in leaving the shop he told me to put them down as low as I could, and when I got to the house I said 15l.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you went to the second magistrate, did you tell him the case had been heard by another? A. He was aware of it - I will not swear that I told him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were there any papers found on him? A. Yes; and they were given up to him by the direction of Mr. Broughton, who advised me to give the goods to him - I asked the prisoner in the street to give up the property, as I understood by this lady that he had taken the property out of the shop - she asked him to give the property back, but he refused, saying he had bought them - I did not go to Mount-street - a rod is six feet, and it was about one hundred rods from Mount-street to the place where I took the prisoner.</p>

             (police-constable S 28). On the 23rd of April, the prosecutrix told me she had lost this property, and wished to have the prisoners taken, but they were not there then - the male prisoner came there that evening, and I took him in the room - I told him it was for robbing his furnished lodgings - I found these duplicates in the table drawer - as I was taking him to the station-house he ran away.</p>

               <p>Charles Beaumont's Defence. What was done by my wife was done at my request, so that I conceive she is innocent - with respect to myself, I was in difficulties, and was obliged to make use of the furniture to meet existing emergencies, not for a moment having an idea of robbing her - had she given me but one hour, I would have got money, redeemed the articles, and paid her great part of her rent - I went out that evening with a few shillings to get tools, and when I got home at half-past nine o'clock, she had missed the property, and gave me in charge - in going along I ran away to go to my wife, who was then on a visit.</p>

In January last, the Marquis of Bristol kept a banking account at our house - I knew the prisoner prior to the 30th of January - he was in the habit of coming to our house sometimes - I recollect his coming on the 30th of January, in the morning, and presenting this note (looking at it) - it was endorsed as it is now when presented -"R. Aickman" was on it; and the endorsement not exactly corresponding with the payee's name, I had some conversation with the prisoner - he stated that it was quite right, that he received it for Mr. Aikman, and that we had orders to pay it, which was true - after that, he stated that some money had been paid to the porter a few days before, and stated the amount - that confirmed my confindence that all was correct - I handed the bill to him, and he wrote on it, "received for," over the endorsement, and "J. Arscott" under it - and, at his representation, I paid him 150l., in Bank notes, and the remaining 34l. 9s. in sovereigns, half-sovereigns, and silver - the Marquis of Bristol had an account at our house at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you orders to pay that bill of exchange by advice from the Marquis? A. Yes; it was the Marquis's intention to have the money paid to Aikman; but the prisoner said he came from Aikman.</p>
               <p>Q. You paid him no money till he gave you that paper with "received for Aickman," &amp;c., on it? A. That was done first - that was a receipt for the money paid him - on the faith of that I paid him.</p>
               <p>Q. Not as a Bill of Exchange on the endorsement, as then a man would have written "received" in his own name? A. Yes, that is a discharge for the money he received - the bill is a discharge for the money paid.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. I think you said, when it was first tendered to you for payment, it had the endorsement of"R. Aickman" on it, and nothing else? A. Nothing else- Aikman is the name of the payee - I certainly should not have paid it unless it had his name on it - I paid the money on the faith of the endorsement of the payee.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If the name of Aikman had not been on it, should you have paid it? A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. If Aikman had come himself, and his receipt had been on it, you would have paid it? A. Yes, but if it came from a person whom I did not understand came from him, I should not have paid it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If it had been brought to you with the writing on the back, exactly as it is now - if the prisoner had presented it to you with what is written on it now, should you have paid it then? A. Not to a stranger.</p>
               <p>Q. As you knew the prisoner, if he had brought it to you already receipted, as it is now, should you have paid it? A. Knowing the prisoner, and having his name on it, probably I should - I should have asked him some questions on it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Being reminded by the prisoner that you had advice of it from Lord Bristol, should you have hesitated then? A. And knowing the prisoner, I considered I was quite safe.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You would probably have paid the money, but should have asked him some questions? A. Knowing the prisoner, I should have had no hesitation - I had ad<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150028"/>vice from Lord Bristol - I should not have paid it without an endorsement on it.</p>
               <p>Q. If it was presented to you in the form it was presented? A. That depends on whether the payee's name was correct.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, but now it has not an endorsement, it says"received for"? A. That is the usual practice when a second party comes for money.</p>
               <p>Q. If a stranger receives money on a bill, and brought it in that form, should you not require something more? A. If the payee's name is on the back, and a person receiving it for him - it is the every day practice - if he had received it for himself, he would write his name only - he would then be acting as a principal - the words "received for" were written after it was brought to me.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Was the bill in your possession, had you received it and taken it into possession from the prisoner when it had merely the name of "R. Aickman" on the back? A. Yes - he had parted with it, and I examined it with merely that name on it - it was at my desire that he wrote the rest afterwards - I gave it him for that purpose.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. This man you knew, and he came to the banking-house with the bill, with the name of "R. Aickman" on it? A. Nothing else - he showed it to me in that state - I took it in my hand, and looked at it - I had some difficulty about the "
               <persName id="t18340515-46-person501">R. </persName>
            Aickman" on the back, not corresponding with the payee's name, and stated it to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that, did he take it from you and write the words constituting the receipt? A. He did - he said, "It is all right, I receive it for Aikman, and you have orders to pay it."</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had the bill been presented by a stranger, would you have paid it? A. I most likely should have submitted it to the partners, in consequence of the variation in the endorser's name.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You received and treated it as an endorsement? A. I did, as Aikman's endorsement.</p>

I worked for the Marquis of Bristol last year - in January last, I had a demand on his lordship for 184l. 9s. - I had delivered my account to the prisoner - (looking at the draft) the endorsement on that order is not my handwriting - there is a "c" in the name Aickman - I do not spell my name so - I never authorized the prisoner nor any other person to endorse the order for me, nor to receive the amount of that draft - the prisoner told me on Saturday, the 1st of February, that the order for the payment of my bill would be up the beginning of next week with the town bills - I called at his lordship's house at Roehampton that morning, 1st of February, and saw the prisoner there - I called on the prisoner on the 5th, as he said it would be up at the beginning of the week, and saw him - (I had not then communicated with Lord Bristol - I did that on the 6th, and was referred to Gosling's) - the prisoner was at first denied to me, but I saw him, and he told me to call next day at twelve o'clock, and I should have my money - I made a communication next day to his lordship at Roehampton - I did not see the prisoner after the 5th of February, till he was taken into custody - I have tried to find him in town, but could not - I went to his lordship's house at Roehampton to find him, three or four times, and called at his lordship's house in St. James's-square, but could get no intelligence of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he in the habit of paying you money on account of Lord Bristol before? A. He paid me the Christmas before - he paid me Lord Bristol's cheque then - he knew how I spelt my name - he had a £10 bill of my acceptance, it was due on the 6th of February - I had given it to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On the 6th of February did he hold a bill of yours? A. He had drawn the bill himself, and I accepted it to accommodate him - I did not owe him the money.</p>

            . I am house-porter to the Marquis of Bristol. In February last, I recollect receiving a direction from the Marquis to see the prisoner at Roehampton - it was on the 8th - I went down to Roehampton in consesequence, but could not find him - I made inquiry also at his lordship's town residence - I was in a public-house that night (the 8th) - I went in, and had been there about five minutes, and the prisoner came in - the moment he saw my face he turned round and went out immediately - I tried to speak to him - I followed him, but could not overtake him - it was very foggy, and I lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Perhaps you went in the way he did not go? A. I could not see which way he went.</p>
               <p>The Most Noble the MARQUIS of BRISTOL. The prisoner was in my employ last year - he ceased to be in my service about November last year; but still continued to live at my house at Roehampton, and was occasionally employed - in January last I was staying in Suffolk; and while there, I received from the prisoner a list of my annual bills in Roehampton and London - I believe this is it - the prisoner was a very short time in my service; but I believe this list to be his handwriting, and am certain I received a list from him (looking at the draft) - this draft is in my own handwriting - after receiving the list, I transmitted that draft to the prisoner with other drafts for different tradesmen - I afterwards received from the prisoner receipts from the different tradesmen to be paid - I was in the habit of sending him a draft for all the bills under £30 in one amount; but for bills above £30 I sent separate drafts for each tradesman to be paid to the parties themselves; and gave my bankers advice of those which were to be paid to the bearer, and of those which were to be paid to particular parties - I have a receipt for this particular amount, which I received from the prisoner - this is it.</p>

               <p>MR. AIKMAN re-examined. This receipt is not my handwriting, nor have I any knowledge of it - it is spelt"Aickman" - the endorsement on the bill appears to resemble my handwriting a little - I think the "A" is in the way I generally sign - the prisoner has had an opportunity of seeing me write.</p>

               <p>Q. It had not the effect of causing you to miscarry, I think? A. Yes; I am certain I did, though I did not think so at the time; but having since been delivered of a child, I am sure I did miscarry - consequences happened to me similar to when I was afterwards delivered - it brought on a discharge more than usual - I was very bad indeed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do not answer without recollecting yourself - is it true, as you told my friend, that on the day in question you had taken nothing except what the prisoner gave you? A. No, except my breakfast - I had not taken any pills, or any thing of the kind - I recollect this was on the 26th of June, because it was two days after quarter-day - I know it was so - I took particular notice what day it was - it made me so very ill, I could not help taking particular notice of it - that is the reason - the gentleman who sits there is not my mother's attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he been acting as attorney for you in the course of this inquiry - for you and your parents? has he not attended before the magistrate, and examined you and your witnesses on half-a-dozen different charges, first at Great Bookham and Hanworth? A. No, not at Bookham- he was at Hanworth - I believe his name is Thomas Alley Jones - he came and represented himself as the nephew of Mr. Counsellor Alley - he was not always at my mother's public-house - he was there sometimes - he has been lodging there - I am not particularly intimate with him - I do not understand you.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You were asked about your intimacy with the prisoner - you are asked have you had any intimacy of this sort with that attorney? A. Never in my life with no one but the prisoner - never in my life.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Consider - do not answer rashly - do you mean to swear deliberately the prisoner is the only person with whom you have had any sexual intimacy? A. Yes - I have seen a person named Rawlins - I know him by seeing him with Childs - the prisoner told me I was pregnant before I thought I was - I was not aware that I was with child till he told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear at another place that you had no notion there was any thing the matter with you till the prisoner told you you were with child? A. I was not sure I was until he told me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you not sworn you had no suspicion of being with child before he told you you were; that you knew nothing about it? A. I was not sure that I was - I thought I was.</p>

               <p>Q. Did your mother state in your presence, before you got before the magistrate, to Mr. Mackerel, that you had been intimate and had connexion with all the men and servants in your father's house? A. Never; I never heard of such a thing before - I am sure no one can say that - I cannot tell how many magistrates I have been before on the subject of different charges against the prisoner- the prisoner came to live at my father's as under ostler - I think the latter part of January, 1833 - our intimacy first occurred either the latter part of March or the beginning of April - my father's is a night house; it is open all day and all night - we let out beds, but never at 5s. a night - my mother sometimes sits up till six o'clock in the morning - it depends on whether they are busy or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take in travellers at two and three o'clock in the morning? A. We take in respectable people; but I am never up at that time, I always go to bed at ten o'clock- we never take women in unless it is a man and his wife sometimes - our beds are generally all full about ten o'clock - my father was proprietor of the house up to the last licensing day, and the name of "Wolfe" was over the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150030"/>door - "Wolfe" is not on the door now, another person has taken the house - the licence was not stopped by the magistrate; my father gave the house up; I never heard any thing of the license being stopped - Mr. Keen took the house - he was not an acquaintance of Mr. Alley Jones's - Mr. Jones used to come to our house the same as other customers - I left home on the 8th of September, but did not run away - I went with the prisoner - that I swear - I went away with him - I was going to church - I met a girl named Haines, and went with her - I met her - she came to our house - I saw her outside the door - I told my father and mother I was going to church - I went as far as the corner of the Broadway, near where the church is - I told Haines there was a person who wanted to see me - I did not tell her I would come back to her after church - the prisoner told me he would meet me, and I met him by appointment - it was more than a week after he had left my father's house - I do not know how long.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in the course of sexual connexion with him from the time you took the stuff till he left? A. Yes- when I took the powder I thought I was still in the family way, but since I have been confined I am convinced I was not - I did not go to a doctor in October, to ascertain whether I was with child or not - that I swear - I did not ask any body to go with me in October - after we had met by agreement, I went with

             to Mitcham- that was on the 8th of September - I thought I was with child at that time - I did not think then that I had miscarried.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you went away with him on the 8th of September, could any body see that you were with child? A. I do not think they could have seen it - Childs told me he thought they could see it; but I thought not - he said he was afraid my father and mother would find it out, and I had better go with him, and live with him until I was confined - that he had taken a house, and after that I could get a place as bar-maid, and then write home to my parents and tell them I had been in place all the while.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When you were before the magistrate at any time, on your solemn oath did you tell a word of that, or have you got it from Thomas Alley Jones? A. No; I have not got it from him - I believe I told the justice this - I believe I told them every thing - I swear I did to the best of my belief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever charge him before the magistrate with stealing your clothes? A. He told me to throw my clothes out of the window, which I did, and he caught them - I was at Leatherhead, but did not see any body there except the person who took charge of Childs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on another occasion charge him with receiving your clothes, knowing them to be stolen, before the justice? A. He did receive my clothes - I did not go before a magistrate and charge him with committing a rape on me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you charge him with having connexion with you against your will? A. It was against my will - he took me by force, and threw me down.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you, after you had been twice before the justice, go a third time, with your father, mother, and Jones, and on that occasion charge him with committing a rape on you? A. No, Sir, I did not - he was not charged with a rape.</p>
               <p>Q. With having connexion with you against your will? A. Yes, he took me and threw me down, and by force effected his purpose - that was in April - the very first time - it was not twelve months after I was forced that I went before Mr. Scott, and charged the prisoner with having connexion with me against my will - it was after I had gone away to live with him - I was only at the Bell and Anchor twice - the grand jury threw out the bill for administering drugs the first time it was preferred, but that was through a witness we had.</p>
               <p>Q. After you went away on the 8th of September, how long did you remain at Mitcham? A. I was there one night - I slept at a public-house - I wanted to return home- I did not mention to the publican that I wanted to return home - I could not get to speak to any body - he would not allow me to speak to any body to tell them I wanted to go home - I slept with him at the public-house - I was to sleep there that night, and next day I was to go to the house - when I left that public-house, I think the first place I went to was Merstham - I had a ring on my finger the day before I came home, but never before - I will swear I had not this ring on until the last day before I came home, and then I had it on for about an hour that day - that was the day before my father found me.</p>
               <p>Q. As the prisoner confined you, and you could not speak to any body, did you go to the parish church at Merstham, and be married to him? A. He insisted on my having the banns put up - I told him I never would be married to him - he cursed and swore, and gave me a slap on the head, and said I should go - I went with his sister-in-law(I believe she was) - the banns were put up - I never did intend to be married to him - I intended to go to the clergyman, and claim his protection - I did not see the clergyman then - I went with the sister, and put up the banns, and another woman was there - we went to the clerk about the banns - this was in September - I remember going to buy the ring - I went with his sister the day I was to have gone to the church - I knew if I had not got the ring, I could not have got to the church to tell the clergyman - after I had got the ring, I went with the prisoner to be married - I never did intend to be married to him - I told him so, but never intended it - when we got to the church, the clergyman was going out, and refused to stay to marry us - I saw the clergyman on his horse - Childs called out to him - I could not get to speak to him - the marriage was postponed till the following Friday - I intended to have gone on the following Friday, but in the interim my father found me out - I lived with the prisoner after the 8th of September till, I believe, the 1st of October.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you sleep with him under tents and hedges, and on the road and road-side, except when you slept in public-houses all that time? A. Yes - I believe he used to sleep at night, but I could not get away - he always went into some very dull place.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to swear you were living all this time with him against your will and consent? A. Yes- I wanted to get away but could not.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You wanted to get away from him all this time and could not, and that is the reason you did not? A. Yes - my father came for me at last - I believe he took the prisoner and his brother into custody - the prisoner was let out of custody again next morning - he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150031"/>went before a magistrate and said he would tell where I was, which he did, and sent his brother to tell where I was, and he was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that did he come to the Chaise and Horses? A. He never came into my father's house afterwards - he wanted to come into the house one night, and mother pushed him out - she did not take him before the magistrate that night - she could not, for there was nobody there but herself - he was not living at Hammersmith after that - if so, it was unknown to us - I never saw him - I was not more acquainted with Alley Jones than other people.</p>
               <p>Q. After that did Jones accompany you with your father and mother to a magistrate in Buckinghamshire? A. I was never there in my life - I do not know whether my father and mother went before Sir John Gibbon - I was never there - my mother does not tell me where she goes always - Alley Jones did not say he would settle the matter very soon - he never told me he thought about 55l. might be got for this job.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you first mention to your father and mother about his giving you the drug to make you miscarry? A. A few days after I came home, in the beginning of October.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Has any action been brought against your father for false imprisonment of this man? A. Yes - I have been attending the courts at Westminster as a witness in an action for seduction - I cannot say whether my father has brought an action for seduction against this man- I was nearly seventeen years of age when my connexion with the prisoner began - I was seventeen last August - I lived at home with my mother all the time before this - I did not go with Mr. Jones fifteen miles from Hammersmith to get a warrant against the prisoner - I do not know that my mother did - I never knew them go out together - I believe Rawlins has slept at our house before now with 
               <persName id="t18340515-47-person511">Wm. Childs</persName>
            - he has not slept there without him - I never in my life went to his beside when he was in bed - Jones never came to my bedside while I was in bed - that I solemnly swear - I was delivered of a child on the 20th of March - I have reason to know from the doctor who attended me, that it was prematurely born - I did not state any thing about my miscarriage till after I was confined, because I did not know the pains, nor any thing else till after I was confined; but I thought then I had miscarried, because the pains were so much like it - I learnt nothing about this from Alley Jones.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Are you the only child of your parents? A. Yes - I left school before I was fourteen years of age - when the prisoner came into my father's employ I was about sixteen - I had never left my father's house to be thrown on the world in any way before this - I was quite a stranger to the part of the country the prisoner took me to- it was in September when my father discovered where I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you prefer any charge against the prisoner, or was what was done done by your father and friends? Q. It was my wish - I expressed that wish as soon as I came home.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The charge of rape, and stealing the clothes, and receiving them, and seduction, was it your wish all these charges should be brought? A. I wished him to be punished for what he had done - I have heard the prisoner is twenty-five years old.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you admit to Miller that Jones said, "We will charge him with rape, and if that won't do, charge him with giving savin, for the girl will swear any thing what I tell her to say?" A. It is false - I do know

A. It is a falsity - I have seen that man (Miller) - I never told him that Jones told me they would charge the prisoner with a rape - if that would not do, they would charge him with giving savine to produce abortion? A. I never spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Q. And that Miller asked Jones what proof he had, and Jones replied, "The girl will swear any thing I tell her, and her mother will do the same?" A. No; that is false - I was not with the prisoner when my father discovered him.</p>

In June, last year, my husband kept the Chaise and Horses at Hammersmith - it is a day and night house, but a very respectable one - it is a house open day and night for market gardeners, wagoners, and people from all parts of the kingdom, who, we think, proper to take into the house, but no other persons - I am not ashamed of the house - I have from noblemen who keep their carriage down to persons who pay 4d. a night for their bed - I take them in if I like- the prisoner was in our service in June last - I remember on the 26th of June my daughter was taken very ill - I have a particular reason for recollecting the day - I believe on the 24th we say was six month's day (instead of quarter day), when I pay my rent - about twelve o'clock she was very poorly, and at one o'clock I wished her to have dinner- she said she could not eat any - she went to bed and laid there for three days - never got off her bed from Wednesday between one and two o'clock till the Sunday near four - she vomited - she was very sick and ill otherwise, she had a violent discharge - I took the basin in which she vomited, and rinced it, but by rincing it and rincing it again it did not come clean - there was something round the basin which stuck to the bottom of it - it appeared thick - something stuck to the bottom of the basin - it was like wet flour - she kept her bed till the Sunday about four o'clock- she left our house on the eighth of September, and on the Monday morning we took every step to find her, but could not - we heard of her at the latter end of September from a respectable gentleman who keeps a public-house at Leatherhead - she was brought back, and after her father had fetched her home she described that the prisoner had given her some medicine - not before; she told me the occasion of that illness.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not accompany your husband to Leatherhead? A. No; I have every reason to believe the publican's name is Wildey who gave us an account of my daughter - I knew him when I lived there, and was quite a girl, many years ago - he told me in the letter which I had, which I have burnt, that my daughter was at Leatherhead; and, as a friend, he wrote to me if I wished for my child, to fetch her - he had had an opportunity of seeing her there - it was overheard by what the prisoner had communicated to the man who kept the public-house, saying he had got the girl, he had deluded her from her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150032"/>home, and how pleased he was that he had got her away from home - this was the secret which the prisoner himself divulged to Mr. Wildey, at Leatherhead - Mr. Wildey told me that afterwards, when I saw him - he did not write that to me - Mr. Wildey is at Leatherhead now - I saw him four or five days since; indeed, I do not think it is so much - it was one day this week - I have not brought him here as a witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you brought any body besides yourself and daughter? A. There is a gentleman here who took steps to trace her - that is Mr. Jones - I first became acquainted with him about twelve months ago, or more - he did not say he was Mr. Counsellor Alley's nephew - that was nothing to me - if a gentleman calls for a glass of grog or ale, or dinner, I consider it my business to make it for him - I do not recollect that Mr. Jones introduced himself to me as the nephew of Counsellor Alley - he had a little business at Hammersmith, and he has some cottages there, and those kind of things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he represent himself as the nephew of Counsellor Alley, and that he had come from Counsellor Alley's on this occasion? A. No; I will not swear that, one way or other - I was before the justice at Hammersmith - on my oath, I could not tell you whether he told the magistrate he came from the office of Counsellor Alley on that occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear that person represent himself as the nephew of Counsellor Alley, until I put the question to you to-day? A. We have heard it mentioned by different people; but I do not know it - I do not recollect that I ever heard it from his own lips - I do not recollect that he represented himself as coming from that gentleman for the purpose of prosecuting this case for me - I will not swear one way or the other, because I should not like to be wrong on oath - it is a serious thing - I was almost as much acquainted with Jones at first as I am now; just the same - he has lived in my house, on and off, at different times, for more than twelve months, when he has wanted a bed - he slept there last night - he has certainly slept there some time lately, because he pays me for his lodging - he sleeps there when business calls him down - he has slept there more than twelve months; for the first night I came to the house, if he had come there, I would let him have a bed, or you either - he pays me 8s. a week for his room now, whether he sleeps there or not - sometimes he is there one night in a week, sometimes two, and sometimes not for a whole week - I never took a journey with him in my life, or any gentleman but my husband - my husband (and I think Mr. Jones) went before Sir

               <p>Q. Who is the attorney for this prosecution? A. I do not know whether it is Jones or Eden - it is one of them; either Eden of Buckingham-street, or Jones - I cannot see Eden here now - he is clerk to Mr. Withy - I know the gentleman, because I have lived with him - I should imagine Eden is the attorney - Mr. Jones went with me before the Grand Jury on the first occasion, and on the second - but then Mr. Withy was acquainting with the case- I never did any thing without acquainting him - the first bill was thrown out - I do not recollect saying that I would prefer another if it would cost 100l. - I think I can swear I did not - I do not think I did; but it is so long, I almost forget - I know a man named Rawlins - he has never slept at my house - when his parents turned him from home, being a friend of the prisoner's, I agreed to it more than once - he never slept there to my knowledge before the prisoner came there - he has not slept there before April twelve months that I recollect - I do not think that ever he did - I have fourteen beds in my house - it is a two-windowed house, two storey high; but one is a very large room, a club-room, and in that I can put twelve beds if I choose for poor people coming up the road, hay-makers and garden people, and working people - it is not now used as a club-room - there are seven beds in it for poor people - it is over the cellar in the back parlour - no women sleep there except men and their wives - I cannot answer that people do not sleep in my house, whose marriage I am not acquainted with - people might come from Bath and Bristol very respectable - I sit up, and let them sleep in the parlour - perhaps one or two sleep in the parlour - I will not swear there have not been fourteen or fifteen sleeping in the parlour when we have had soldiers billeted- I swear that I have not had twelve men and women sleeping in the parlour when soldiers have been billeted - I believe never more than four slept, and then they sit and sleep with their heads on the table, because there is no bedstead - Jones slept at the top of the house in a room by himself - there are two rooms on a floor - my father, and a little boy I have just taken as a nurse child, sleep in the other room - one room below I keep very nicely, to let to any body respectable - it is a single-bedded room - I have another bed-room over the bar which I let to people who I think genteel; but I am very particular who goes there - there is this large room that holds seven beds; but I can make up eight or nine occasionally - my husband and I never sleep together, it being a day and night house - we are in our business - when my husband does sleep, it is over the bar - he is never above three hours in bed - my daughter has often sat up all night with me - it is seldom she is in bed - if the house is full, and there is no room, she goes and sleeps with her grandfather - that is where she generally sleeps, with him and the little nurse child, if she goes to bed at all; but very often she does not go to bed till people get up and are gone off in the morning - she is not confined to one place - she never slept in the club-room - I was not before the magistrate last licensing day - my father Mr. Keel became the keeper of the house after licensing day - the magistrates did not refuse to grant my husband a license - what my husband asked was granted - the house is still in my care for me to conduct; but my husband has a very bad leg - he was before the Justices last licensing day - I have been in the house twelve months, and there is not one indictment against it - there was no complaint made against it - the license was not transferred in consequence of any complaint - I cannot say that I know

               <p>Q. Did you state in the presence of Mackerel that your daughter was intimate with, and had had connexion with all the men-servants about the house? A. Never in my life - I never said a thing of the sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you, since the indictment for administering drugs was thrown out, had any conversation with Jones, and Mackerel? A. Never - I believe Mackerel did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150033"/>some writing over at Clerkenwell once - he might be my attorney in this business - I have had no conversation with him and Jones, or with him alone, that I recollect particularly - I have seen Miller (looking at him) - I thought he was Mackerel - he is the only man I knew as Mackerel - I never asked their opinion as to the best means of getting rid of the prisoner - neither I nor Jones ever stated that the prisoner must be transported somewhere - Jones never said so in my presence - I never in my life told my daughter, in the presence of either of them, not to hesitate in swearing - I don't recollect any discussion amongst us as to what colour savin was, for these men are strangers to me, indeed they are not people I should consult with - I never agreed with Jones that white should be the colour - it is as false as God is true - I was before a magistrate on the 18th of November at the Bell and Anchor - I had no conversation with my daughter, in the presence of Jones, or between myself and Jones, as to what she was to say - I never told her what to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see that man (Mackerel) before? A. Yes, but he is a stranger - that is the man I employed to write for me - I don't know him more than that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at your house before you went before the magistrate? A. He was down about Hammersmith a day or two before, I believe, but they are all strangers to me - he is one of the men who was writing at Clerkenwell - he was employed by me - he is what I call a petty lawyer - a poor fellow glad to get sixpence anywhere, I suppose - I know a person named Henman - he lived in my service at the time the prisoner did - I never told him it should be the worst day's work for him that ever happened if the bill was thrown out, and I would discharge him - he discharged himself, and so did the prisoner - I never told either of them that I would discharge them - the prisoner was charged before the magistrate with stealing my daughter's clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of his afterwards being charged with receiving them? A. He received them when he took them away - I cannot tell whether he was charged with receiving them - he was charged with committing a rape on my daughter - the charge was made at the Bell and Anchor - my husband has brought an action against him for seduction at Westminster - I do not say he stole the clothes, but he received them afterwards, and they were found in possession of his brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was a charge of stealing, receiving, rape, seduction, administering the savin, when the bill was thrown out, and this administering? A. Yes; it was all done by the direction of Mr. Withy, that part of it, or Mr. Eden, I should say - I have left it to Jones to do the business, and get who he liked, and I have paid him.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q. Was your husband coachman to Mr. Withy before he kept this house? A. Yes; he had been coachman with the late Lord Ellenborough five years and a half, and with Withy three years and nine months - he took this house in October twelve months.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you attend before the magistrate on the 18th of November? A. I did - I was born at Hammersmith, and that took me to the Chaise and Horses, which was once my father's property, and six or seven cottages there now are my property, and that is how I became acquainted with Miss Wolfe - Mrs. Wolfe asked me what she could do with the prisoner for taking away her daughter - she did not tell me about administering the poison - I said I did not know, but thought he might be punished for taking the things from the window, and her mother's gold ring - I attended before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend as attorney? A. I attended there - my uncle being out of town, or he would have been engaged in it - he was aware of the case - I know Pound - he is Mr. Bigg's clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell him that you were a nephew of Mr. Peter Alley's, and that you came from his chambers to prosecute this case? A. I swear before my Lord and all the gentlemen of the black robe - I never represented myself to Mr. Pound or the magistrate, as Mr. Peter Alley's nephew - the magistrate knew the difference - Mr. Scott knows me - I have not been turned out of the public office at Bow-street for representing myself as the nephew of Mr. Peter Alley - they sent to my uncle's chambers for him to go and prosecute a person for administering poison to a horse - Mr. Roe said, "I may be mistaken, I took you for the nephew of Mr. Peter Alley, instead of John Alley," and he said he did not know any Alley but Peter Alley - I was not told to leave the room - Mr. Roe said, "I cannot hear what you have to say," and I stayed in the room till the case was all over, and went out with Mr. Humphries - I was never paid one farthing by Mr. or Mrs. Wolfe for these proceedings - I received money from them to fee counsel.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Mr. Humphries, the solicitor, sent for to see if he could identify you, and did not he state, on oath, that you had represented yourself as Peter Alley's nephew, and was not you on that turned out of the office? A. No; Humphries was not put on his oath at all - he said something in consequence of what he heard from Mr. Roe - I know

Never - I solemnly swear I never said any thing of the kind - I never stated that the prosecutrix's father had plenty of money, and would give it - I might have said Mr. Wolfe was a man of property - I never said I thought I could get up a case by giving him in charge for stealing the girl's clothes - I never said, "D-n him, we must give him some imprisonment" - Miller did not say he could not attend to it- I believe Miller is a character who frequents Sergeant's-inn coffee-house - I saw him several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state to him that they had taken up the prisoner, and you could not support the charge, and must get up something else against him? A. Never, I solemnly swear; he did not ask me what I could get up - I did not say I would charge him with a rape - the rape was named before the magistrate - he was not held to bail for the rape, that I know of - I know I attended before the magistrate, who asked me in what way he became acquainted with Miss Wolfe - I said I believed it was by force in the first instance - he was not held to bail for the rape, that I know of - I cannot say what mistake the magistrate might have made - I said, I understood he had become acquainted with her at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150034"/>first by force - the magistrate said, "Then the prisoner must have committed a rape; why was not that charge made?" - whether the magistrate took it down as a rape, I cannot say - the magistrate held him to bail - the charge preferred by me was for administering the poison - I never preferred a charge of rape against him - the magistrate asked how the first intimacy began - I said it was by committing a rape - I never told Miller that if a rape would not do, I would charge him with giving her savin to procure abortion; nor did he ask me what proof I had - no conversation of the sort took place - I never said, "The girl will swear any thing I tell her, and the mother will do the same," nor any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards call on Miller, at the Castle, in Portugal-street? A. No; I went there, but not to see Miller - about twelve months ago, I had to go to the Insolvent Court for a man who took the benefit of the Insolvent Act - I went in no character at all, as any private gentleman might go - I knew the man - I often saw Miller at the Castle, in Portugal-street - I might have said, in his hearing, that I was going to prefer another indictment - I believe I did - I did not say it should be found in a different manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Miller say, "You are an infamous villain; and ought to be transported?" A. I never heard him say any thing of the kind - he never said if the prisoner was put on his trial he would come forward and state my infamous conduct - instead of that, Miller, in company with a person named Childs and Mackerel, said they would come here - I believe Childs was the one who spoke, and said, whenever he was tried, he would go and swear that which would get him off, if I did not give him money - Miller was in company with him - I know a man who calls himself Mr. Jackson - I saw him twice at Mr. Mackerel's, who represented himself to be his attorney, and who obtained money from me - and even Miller obtained money from me, being an attorney - I am not an attorney - I am a gentleman - I live by my property, which was left by my father - it is in houses and land - I have not practised as an attorney - I am not an attorney's clerk - after my father's death I went to a man named Fisher - I was to be articled to him, but I was not, and did not stop long.</p>
               <p>Q. When with Miller, did you ask the prosecutrix in his presence if she knew what she was to say? A. I never remember asking her any thing of the kind - to the best of my belief, I never did - I should not like to swear positively - I would almost swear positively I never did - I asked if she distinctly remembered the date the powder was given - I did not ask her if she knew on what day she was to state it was given - I said, "Do you know on what day it was the prisoner gave you the powder? because I dare say you will have to state it" - she did not say she did not; she always said she did know - no almanack was produced to assist her - an almanack was produced, because she said on what day it was, (the 26th of June,) and she got an almanack for the purpose of seeing on what day of the week it was - I cannot swear she got it - I did not - they went out of the room from me, and she brought the almanack in in her hand - there was no discussion as to fixing the day to correspond with her then pregnancy; nor any conversation about the colour of the powder - I believe Mrs. Wolfe was present - I cannot say that all this was in the presence of Jackson - I had Archbold's "Summary Proceedings" with me - I am in the habit of reading law books - it was not in my pocket; if it was any where, it was on the table - I have a book of that kind; but I do not know whether I had it that day - this was at the Chaise and Horses.</p>

               <p>Q. On the discussion about the colour of the powder, did you produce the book, refer to it, and then state afterwards that the colour of the powder did not signify? A. No; I never did - I do not know that I had the book there at the time - I have had conversation on this subject with

I was acting as clerk to Mr. Biggs, on the examination of the prisoner before the magistrate on a charge there, on the 18th of November - Thomas Alley Jones was there - I put some questions to him as to who he was - he said he came from Mr. Counsellor Alley - I asked, "What Alley?" and he said, "From Mr. Peter Alley;" and that he came from his chambers to conduct this case - a charge of rape had been preferred against the prisoner, on the previous Monday, which was immediately abandoned - I was not there - on the following Monday I was present, when the prisoner was held to bail for the rape - Mr. Alley Jones was present - it was in his presence and hearing.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you been clerk to Mr. Biggs? A. Nearly four years; I keep a house, and reside myself in Great James's-street.</p>

            . I live at 32, Euston-street, Spafields. In November last, Thomas Alley Jones applied to me, and asked me to assist him in getting up a prosecu<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150035"/>tion against the prisoner - he said if I could get the prisoner sent out of the country, I should make 50l. by it, and that Wolfe, the father of the prosecutrix, had plenty of money, and he would give it - I asked him the nature of the charge - he said he thought I could get up the case, by giving him in charge for stealing the girl's clothes - he added,"D - n him, we must give him some imprisonment" - I said, I could not attend to it - about a week afterwards I saw him again - he then told me that he had taken up the prisoner, but could not support the charge, and so we must get up something else against him - I asked him what he was going to get up - he said, "I can get up a case of savin against him," but he mentioned nothing about a rape - I asked him what proof he had - he then stated, "The girl will swear any thing I tell her, and the mother also" - I afterwards saw him at the Castle in Portugal-street, after the bill for the savin had been thrown out - the bill was thrown out on the 26th of November - it was about a week or ten days afterwards - he then told me he was going to prepare another indictment before another grand jury, and the indictment should be framed in a different way - I told him he was an infamous villain, and ought to be transported, and perhaps a little more - and I added, that if the prisoner was put on his trial, I would come forward and state the villanous conduct of him and his party - I have heard Mrs. Wolfe, in the presence of the prosecutrix, state that the prosecutrix had had connexion with other men besides the prisoner - I remember being at the Chaise and Horses on the 16th of August last - I saw Mr. Jones and the prosecutrix come out of a privy there, not the Chaise and Horses, but the back part of it, which Mr. Jones calls his own premises - it was about four o'clock in the afternoon - I have heard Jones say, that he has had frequent connexion with the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. What are you by trade? A. An appraiser and accountant - I work for any body who employs me as an accountant - I worked for Mr. Marner, a solicitor, in Clifford's-inn within the last three months - I have acted as his clerk sometimes, as an attorney's clerk, in making up accounts for insolvents, their schedules to pass the Insolvent Court - I have been so about two years - I was in the police in 1831 - I was discharged through giving my evidence in the Insolvent Court, and going to the opposite attorney for my expenses - the commissioners discharged me for that reason, and that only - I have before been asked questions in a court of justice, as to my discharge from the police by the gentleman on your left hand - I never stated that the cause was drinking with another police-officer - I remember the gentleman put the same question to me - I gave him the same answer as I have given you to-day - I have never been charged with any offence myself - I know Mr. Cope, the governor of the gaol - I was never charged with an offence of any sort - I was confined, during that very circumstance for which I was discharged, for going to ask for my expenses - I was confined in the Compter - Mr. Abrahams, the solicitor, sent me to the Compter - I was there one night.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sent there criminally or civilly? A. Why, perhaps I might have assaulted Mr. Abrahams - I was not committed on a charge of an assault, but on a charge of drunkenness, as Mr. Abrahams stated - that was the cause of my discharge from the police - that was the charge against me - I said I was discharged for going to ask for my expenses.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you discharged for going for your expenses or being drunk? A. For both; I told the commissioners of the Insolvent Court the right cause of my discharge from the police - I did not then state that one cause of my discharge was drunkenness - the charges were coupled together - although it was sworn I was drunk, I can swear I was as sober as I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray when did you first know any thing of Mr. Jones? A. Perhaps in June or July last; he found me in a public-house in the neighbourhood of the Insolvent Court - Mr. Mackerel was not there, nor Mr. Jackson - I cannot tell who was there, several were there - I am quite certain the two I have named were not there - Mr. Horncastle was there - I cannot say whether Mr. Jones asked for Horncastle at that time- he was talking to Horncastle at the time - I did not hear him ask for any body - neither I nor any of our party told him that we could do any thing in the law way cheaper than Horncastle, nor did any body in my hearing - the room was full when I told Jones he was a d - d villain, and ought to be transported - I think Mr. Ford, the landlord, was there - he can come forward to prove it - he is here - I believe Mr. Bruce, who is here, was by at the time - I believe Bruce gave Jones a rap in the mouth - this was before the second indictment was preferred - I think about December or January last - the observation Jones made to me about getting up the prosecution, made me believe he was the infamous villain and scoundrel I called him - those observations were addressed to me - he came to ask me to get up the fresh indictment - I assisted in copying the briefs in the former one at the time the first bill was thrown out - the charge was for administering savin.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps it was the briefs we hold that you copied? A. I see some of my handwriting here - Mackerel also assisted in copying the briefs - he never told me whether he was paid by Jones for it - Mackerel was not to pay me my share - I never expected it - I told Jones what I had done in that thing I did not require him to pay me - I have not been paid by any body for it - I received no money from the beginning to the present moment for any thing in this affair - I know Mackerel's handwriting - I believe this to be his writing - four persons were concerned in writing the briefs - I was sent for specially - the four persons were

            . I am an attorney, living in Rahere-street, King-square, Goswell-road. I was admitted in 1807 - I have not latterly taken out my certificate - I continued to practise till within the last five years - I gave up the profession, having no occasion for it at that period. On the 18th of November I was at the Chaise and Horses at Hammersmith - I there saw Thomas Alley Jones - I had never seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go there? A. Early in that morning Mr. Mackerel called on me - I went there to assist him, at his earnest request - the prosecutrix and her family<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150036"/>were there - Jones asked the prosecutrix, before she went before the magistrate, if she recollected what she had to say, or something to that effect - he asked her on what day she was the state the powder was administered - she said she did not recollect, and an almanack was fetched to refresh her memory - there was a discussion as to fixing the day when Childs was at the house, as he had been absent, from illness or some other cause - there was a conversation as to what was the colour of savin - Jones had Archbold's Criminal Pleadings with him - he opened it and referred to it, and then said it did not matter as to the powder being savin - I should suppose every legal person was aware of it- I presumed him to have been a professional man at the time - he represented that he came as the nephew of Mr. Counsellor Alley - I considered he was the nephew of Mr. Peter Alley - I cannot say that he represented himself as a professional man; but, before the magistrate, being asked who he was, and in what capacity he attended, he said he attended from the chambers of Mr. Counsellor Alley - I cannot recollect whether Mr. Pound asked him which Mr. Alley - I was not aware at that time that there were two Mr. Alleys.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Jones appear angry that the girl was not perfect in her story? A. He certainly seemed displeased - he made use of some coarse expression - I think he called her a fool or something - I called the prosecutrix's mother aside from what I saw.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q. You were present at the magistrate's, and heard what passed? A. Yes; to the best of my recollection his words were, "the nephew of Counsellor Alley" - I, only knowing Mr. Peter Alley, supposed it was him.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Can you say whether he was asked what Alley, and replied Mr. Peter Alley? A. I cannot say one way or the other.</p>

            . I am an attorney, and live in Kirby-street, Hatton-garden. I have not for the last two or three years taken out my certificate - I have had some conversations with Mr. Alley Jones, the prosecutrix, and her mother, on the subject of this prosecution, in November last and since.</p>
               <p>Q. At any of those conversations, did Mrs. Wolfe ask the best means of getting rid of the prisoner? A. Not to my recollection - I ought to say that any conversation which took place between us, was in some measure confidential.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Jones at any time, and the prosecutrix's mother, state, in your presence, that the prisoner should be transported some way or other? A. I certainly think I ought not to answer that question, being their attorney at the time.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. How can he swear I took two watches when he found one lying at the bottom of the window? Witness. At the time he took the watches one fell outside, and the other one he took away with him.</p>
               <p>ROBERT WILLIAMS, Jun. I am the prosecutor's son. I saw the prisoner break the window - I am certain he is the man - I and my two brothers were at the door, just going to school, and I saw him knock his elbow or hand through the window, and take two gold watches and one gold chain - one watch dropped outside on the pavement, and that I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150038"/>immediately picked up and took in doors - he got away with the gold watch and gold chain - I saw him put the watch towards his right side pocket - I saw persons pursuing him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Where were you when I put the watch into my right hand pocket? A. At the door - you were round the corner nearly - he put it in that direction - I did not swear at Guildhall that you took three watches.</p>

             (policeman N 154). I received information from the prosecutrix, and went to the prisoner's lodging in King's-arms-yard, Whitecross-street - I found her there - Mrs. Anderson's maid-servant was with me - I told the prisoner I had come to take her on suspicion of stealing things from Mrs. Anderson - I saw this candlestick on the mantel-shelf - I asked her if she knew any thing of it - she said she had bought an old box of Mrs. Anderson, and the candlestick was in it - I asked her if she had any other candlestick - she said, "No" - on searching her bed-room I found another on the table - they are odd ones - she then said that was in the box also - her husband was not present.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. She was flurried, I suppose, when you came to take her? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Might she have understood you to ask if she had the fellow one? A. No - I said, "Have you any other candlestick, or any other article of the prosecutrix's?" - she said, "No."</p>
               <p>MRS. ANDERSON re-examined. I sold her a box the night she went away - it stood on my landing-place - her husband asked if I would part with it - I said I did not mind, and he had it - I did not examine it - it was taken away as it stood - I cannot say what was in it at the time - the prisoner was present when her husband bought it, I believe - I cannot say whether the candlesticks had been in the box or not.</p>

She lives near Bexley, in Kent - on the 18th of April, I came to town, to see my sister, at Mr. Coventry's, in Grosvenor-place - I had worked hard the day before I came away; and early in the morning of the 19th I was going home with my brother - we went into a public-house in Whitechapel-road, to take some refreshment - the female prisoner was in the house, and she asked me to give her some gin - I gave her a glass - my brother then told me to come out, which I did - I had not at that time seen the male prisoner - we went out to another public-house, and the female prisoner came in there after us - she must have followed us - I had a glass of gin in my hand when she came in - she asked me to treat her again - I gave her the glass out of my hand, and said I did not like liquor - my brother and I then came out, with a good many more - I lost my brother, and as I was proceeding on, the female prisoner overtook me - I went up the road with her towards my brother's lodging, where I was then going - I then told her I would go back to the public-house, and see if I could find my brother - I got back nearly to the house, when she came back after me, and said my brother was at the place where she came from, and he was looking for me - I went back with her, to go to my brother's lodgings, but before we got there, she unlocked the street door of a house, and asked me to go in and sit down - I went in and sat down in a chair, on the ground floor directly I got in - I had the two half-crowns, and three shillings and sixpence in my waistcoat pocket, and two shillings and sixpence in my right hand trowsers pocket - I had not seen the male prisoner at that time, to know him - when I sat down, I dosed off to sleep - there was a light on the table - I was afterwards awoke by the male prisoner, who asked me how I came into his house - I told him I was asked in by a female to sit down - he said it was impossible, for no one could get into the house but himself - he then showed me a key, which he had in his hand, and which had been in my pocket when I went into the house - he said it would undo his door - I told him if it would undo his door it was not my key, though it was in my possession; it was the key of my mistress's garden; I slept in the garden - I then felt for my money, as I knew the key had been in the same pocket with my money when I entered the house - my key and money were gone - he then ordered me to go out of his house - I told him I would not, as I had been robbed in the house - he said if I did not go he would knock my b - y brains out with the poker - I said I would not go out, let him do what he would, till I had had redress, as I had been robbed in the house - he then called the policeman in to give me in charge, and the policeman took him, as I said I had been robbed - the officer asked me if I could recognise the female who had opened the door - I said I could, and we went up stairs, where I saw her in bed, undressed - I am sure she is the person - I swear positively to her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. The male prisoner called the policeman? A. Yes, and he took both the prisoners, and said I had better go to the station-house and settle it - I went there willingly - the man made great resistance in the house - my brother lives in Plough-court, and this happened in Hope-street, Montague-street - I had one glass of gin in the first public-house, but none in the second - I gave it to the female prisoner - I had had one glass of gin before I went to either of the public-houses - I was a little fresh but quite sober, and knew what I was about perfectly well - there were a great many different persons in the first public-house - I went to the bar - my money was in my trousers and my waistcoat pockets - my coat was unbuttoned - there were a great many people in the second public-house, and a great many were coming out when I did - I heard my brother say, one of the men was Shrimpey - my brother has been in town two or three years - I cannot say whether he knew Shrimpey well, but he pointed him out to me, and said, "There is a man of the name of Shrimpey" - I did not know any one in the house - I felt my money safe just as I was at the prisoner's door - I took that precaution, as I had seen in the newspapers many curious accounts of countrymen being taken in - I took my money out to count it while the female prisoner was striking a light - I do not know that she saw it - she was about two yards from me - I had a sovereign when I came to town, and when I got back to the last public-house I had a half-sovereign and two sixpences - I changed the half-sovereign then, and received two half-crowns and 5s. - I had the two sixpences before - I put two half-crowns and 3s. 6d. in my waistcoat pocket, and 2s. 6d. in my trousers pocket - I did not lose the 2s. 6d. - I was not five minutes in the prisoner's house before I went to sleep - the key that I had did open the prisoner's door - this is the key, it opens the hot-house, the green-house, and the garden doors.</p>

            . I live at No. 10, Plough-court. I was with my brother - I went with him into the first public-house - I saw the female prisoner there - I knew her before, and am sure of her person - after treating her with a glass of gin there, we went to another public-house - she followed us, and asked my brother to treat her again - he gave her the glass of gin out of his own hand - I then took my brother up the road, as I wanted to get him away from her, but she followed and got him away from me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been in London? A. Nearly three years - I think the first public-house we went into was Broadbelt's - I dare say I had been there twenty times - I cannot say what kind of people were round me - it was at the second public-house down by the Pavilion that I saw Shrimpey - I do not know the name of the public-house - I had been there two or three times - there was a large party there - I knew Shrimpey and the female prisoner and one or two other females - I did not see my brother after we got out.</p>

The prisoners were brought there, and confined in separate cells - I heard the male prisoner say, "Jemima" - as I knew the female prisoner's name was Jemima, I listened, and heard the man say, "Can you keep a secret?" - she said, "Yes" - he then said, "There is half-a-crown under the table cover in the kitchen - I want it to be brought here"- she said, "How are we to get it?" - he said, "Get your mother to come in, and I will give her the key" - the jailor then came down - the male prisoner gave the key out to him, and said, "Give this key to my mother" - the gaoler said, "I cannot" - he then said, "Throw it over to her;" but as I knew there was some of the money missing, I told the gaoler not to do it.</p>

On the 27th of April, about half-past five or a quarter before six o'clock in the morning, my husband was in the tap-room, lighting the fire - there were a great many men went into the tap-room - one of them came out, and asked me for a shovel of coals - I went to get them, and as I was rising up I saw a man behind me - I screamed out, and he took hold of my arms, and held me down - I looked up, and saw another man taking money out of the till - I screamed out, and said, "There is a man robbing the till" - I pushed the man away who had hold of me, and ran to the street, when I saw a man running down the street, and I think it was the same man who had been robbing the till in the bar - he was a short man - there had been about 1l. worth of silver in the till, and I lost a knife which had been on a shelf just going in at the parlour door - the policeman brought back the prisoner - I could not say whether he is the man who was at the till.</p>

             (police-constable H 150). I was opposite the public-house, and saw the prisoner run from the door - no other person ran till Mrs. Groom came out and pointed to the prisoner - my brother officer brought him back, and went into the house, and saw there eighteen or twenty reputed thieves - the prisoner was fumbling about his pocket, and my brother officer took out 18s. 11d. - the prisoner said, 3s. of it was his own - while my brother officer was counting the money, the prisoner put his hand to his coat pocket - I said, "Leave your pocket alone, or I will break your arm" - I put my hand into his pocket and found this knife.</p>
               <p>MRS. GROOM. This is our knife I believe - here is another brought from our house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Which is the one which was found on the prisoner? A. I do not know; but I believe they are both ours - there is no mark on them - I cannot say what description of money was in the till - there might be 1l. of silver and copper.</p>

No.(The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he had received the cheque from a person to get it changed - that he had left his lordship's service on the 22nd of March, and the cheque was not missed till the 2nd of April - as such he could not have stolen it - and that he had formerly restored a valuable diamond brooch which he had found.)</p>

            . I am a corporal in the first regiment of guards. I was in the King's Head, and saw the prisoner in the bar - I asked him for a pinch of snuff, which he gave me out of this box - I went out, and saw serjeant Barber - I saw the prisoner throw this bird out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The snuff-box was on the table, and the prisoner brought it to you? A. I did not see it on the table, but he brought it to me; he was close by the table.</p>

             (police-constable H 136). I was sent for, and took the prisoner. He denied having had the snuffbox or the bird - he was sitting on a chair - the box was found under the chair.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far was the snuff-box from the table? A. I saw no table there - it was two or three yards from the prisoner.</p>

On the 1st of May I was waiting at the door of the pit - I saw the prisoner, and five or six more with him - they spoke to each other, and I watched them - I saw the prisoner and his companions hustle Mr. Sleator - they lifted up his arms with their elbows, and rubbed him down - they tried his pockets; and at last the prisoner took the watch from him, and put it into his own coat pocket, behind - the prisoner then walked out, and his companions made way for him to pass - I followed him, and saw Wilson stand by the door - I said, "Stop that man, he has robbed a gentleman of his watch" - the prisoner then turned, and was going up the stairs of the two-shilling gallery - he saw me, and ran up till the people stopped him - I came up to him and seized him - he put his hand behind him; took the watch out of his pocket, and tried to put it down under the people - I saw that, and seized his hands - he struggled, and threw me down before the serjeant's face, and shoved the watch on the landing place - my hat came off, and the prisoner ran off towards Covent-garden - a piece of his coat was torn off in the policeman's hand - I took him under the horses' heads.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How often have you seen my Lord in this Court? A. I do not know - I have been in the Court once or twice before, and was always well praised by his lordship - the prisoner's friends came to me yesterday, and offered me any money to go to Gravesend.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to stick to that, that you have just volunteered on your oath, that you have been here once or twice, and been always well praised by his lordship? A. Yes, Sir, it is true certainly - I do not know how often I have been here as a witness - I will swear I have not been here twenty times - the last time I was here is a year and a half ago - I was never turned out for prevarication - I know the Lord Chief Justice Denman - he never desired me not to show my face again in this Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember being a witness here in the case of

             - I gave evidence against them - I swore to seeing them commit the robbery - I do not know what verdict the jury gave.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your solemn oath, did not they acquit the prisoner? A. I do not know - they might have been acquitted- I suppose you bullied me out of it - they might have been discharged - they were discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell me you did not know whether they were discharged? A. I shall not answer you any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you swear to me, you did not know whether they were acquitted or discharged? A. I told you I did not know - I then said I did know - it is true that I did know.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your solemn oath, did not you know, though you said I bullied you out of it, that Mr. Lee was counsel? A. He is one of your party - that was in February, 1832 - I do not know when I had been here before that - I did not swear to Mr. Lee on that occasion, that I had two cases here the session but one before that - I will swear I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I will put the question again out of pity to you. Did you not swear to Mr. Lee, that the session but one before that you had two cases in which you were a witness? A. No, Sir, I did not - I do not recollect when that was - it might be in February, 1832 - I had only that one case in that session.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never swear this on that trial, "I had two cases the session before last, and I have two more this session?" A. No; I did not - I did not swear I had two that session - I never said I did not think I had had twenty cases here in the last twelve months - I never said, "I have been the means of bringing a great many persons to justice" - I have not been fifteen times as a witness here - I do not know how many cases I have been here in - I will not answer any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever here as a witness when the Court refused you your expenses? A. No, Sir, never - I never was here when the Court ordered I should not have my expenses - I never applied for them, it is not the expenses I look at - I cannot tell any one case in which I did not apply for my expenses - how can I recollect years ago?</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you take this watch yourself? A. No; the policeman knows better than that- I called the policeman - I saw the prisoner take the watch from the prosecutor's pocket, and his companions<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150048"/>made way for him to get out - that was all I saw them do- I did not say I saw them rub him down.</p>

             (police-serjeant F 10). I was under the avenue of Covent-garden - Tool came running to me, and said there was a man had stolen a watch from a gentleman- Tool then went up stairs, and seized the prisoner - they both fell down - there was a watch in the prisoner's hand - I cannot say whether it was this or not - I then seized the prisoner by his coat - he got up and ran off, leaving this part of his coat in my hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you see this watch? A. When Tool and the prisoner came down, this watch was on the ground, and Tool picked it up.</p>

            . I am a coachman. On the 4th of May, about ten or eleven o'clock at night, I was on my coach box in <placeName id="t18340515-78-crimeloc437">Davis-street, Berkeley-square</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long had you been on the coach-box that night? A. About an hour and three quarters - I cannot tell how long I had been asleep - I had been up till three o'clock the morning before- I was a little drowsy - when the prisoner was taken, he denied knowing any thing about the coat - it was not dark - there were lights about - it is not a very great thoroughfare - if any one had walked heavily down the street I should have heard them when I was asleep - I am sure the prisoner is the man - it is the footman's coat - my master is in the country - I am sure he had not given this coat to the footman.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the footman out that night on duty? A. Yes. When he is out on duty, he wears his master's clothes.</p>

             (police-constable C 88). I was on duty, and heard the coachman call to the prisoner, and ask what he meant to do with the coat. I was on the opposite side - he called to the prisoner a second time, and asked whether he meant to bring the coat back - he then called"Police," and turned his coach, and pursued the prisoner - I ran across and pursued the prisoner into a mews, where I took him - the coachman pointed out the place where the coat was thrown - a man came to the place, got the coat, and gave it me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then there was another man in the street? A. There were seven or eight persons when I took the prisoner. When the coachman first called to the prisoner, I thought he might be a fellow-servant - but when he called "Police" I went over - I saw him with the coat, but I did not see him take it, nor throw it away, but the coach got between him and me - I saw him walking along - I had never seen the prisoner before - I saw no one there but him; but there were six or eight persons when I took him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Is it your custom to count your money in your bag of an afternoon? A. Yes; I did that in compliance with my usual custom - I trust to my memory as to the amount - I counted it between six and seven o'clock - it could not exceed thirty-five minutes between the times of the first and second counting - I have not a doubt of the quantity of money in my bag - I am quite positive that more than five whole sovereigns were taken - I cannot say how many half-sovereigns there were- I will undertake to swear that five whole sovereigns must have been taken - the impression on my mind is, that eight or nine whole sovereigns must have been taken, but there might possibly be five or six half-sovereigns.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember stating before the magistrate that the person who took the money was not more than half a minute in your shop? A. No; I said he was a very short time - I do not think I said half a minute - it was done instantly - I might have used the phrase without meaning so short a time - it was done in a very short time - he was examining<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150051"/>the coin for nearly five minutes - I think it was nearer five minutes than half a minute - I believe he was in the shop more than two minutes altogether - I could not say - I had seen the person before, I am sure - I could not say how long before, but I had seen his face before - he had either been a customer or on a similar errand, but I never lost money in a similar way - my attention was directed to the money more than to the person of the man - his left hand was close to the money - within a quarter of a yard, I should think - he touched the sovereigns with his right hand with a single finger - in the first instance I gave him two half-sovereigns for the sovereign, and he gave them me back, and I gave him his sovereign - he put it into his pocket immediately - five weeks elapsed before I saw him in custody - I saw him in the lock-up room, and recognised him among a number of other prisoners - I believe I had more than two minutes to look at his person and the money too - it might have been five minutes, but could not exceed five minutes- I know his person well.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent - there is a prisoner in prison who so corresponds with me, (and he acknowledged it) - if you will call him into court, my Lord, and see if the prosecutor can identify him - I had a tumour cut from under my tongue, by Mr. McMurdo, the surgeon, and he called this other prisoner the next morning and asked him how his mouth was, taking him for me.</p>

             (governor of Newgate). There is a man named Lindsay in custody, charged with stealing three sovereigns - he appears to me to resemble the prisoner a good deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose you had seen one of the men only once in your life, is there such a resemblance that you might instantly have mistaken one for the other? A. There is - I have made that mistake in the gaol, and even took one man for the other - I had seen them, I think, only twice - the charge against him is for a theft committed in a similar way - he has been tried and convicted.</p>
               <p>MR. TELFER re-examined. He had a hat on all the while he was in the shop.</p>
               <p>(Lindsay was here brought into Court, and both prisoners put on their hats.)</p>
               <p>MR. TELFER (looking at Lindsay). The difference is so great, I should recognise them instantly - I am positive the prisoner is the person.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. After seeing the two men together, do you believe the prisoner to be the man - are you fully satisfied he is the man? A. I am quite positive of it - I knew him by sight before - I am positive he is the man - I knew him when I first saw him at Bow-street, and I had seen him in my shop before.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is there not a similarity between the men? A. I do not perceive much; there certainly is some likeness - I have not the slightest doubt of him; and when I saw him at Bow-street, he had the same dress on as when he came into my shop, which he has now changed.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). On the evening previous to the day named in my indictment, the man who laid the information against me, whom I have known about twelve months, came to me while I was on Shoreditch coach-stand with my cab, and asked me if I should be at home next morning - I replied, "Yes," and told him to call in the morning - he knew where I resided, in consequence of his residing at No. 5 in the same street, and under the same landlady as myself - he came according to appointment, and asked me if I would allow him to do a little job at my house - I asked him what it was - he said not of much consequence, but he could not very well do it at home, and he would not be more than half an hour - I agreed accordingly, and then went to my father's on Cambridge-heath on a little business, and left him at my home - when I returned, I asked him what he was doing - I saw six shillings on the table, which proved to be base - he said to me, "Hold this" (meaning the mould) which he had in his hand, and said he wanted to step home, and that he would return in five minutes - he then instructed me what to do during his absence - he had not been absent five minutes before the door was burst open- this was his plan to insuare me so that he could insure his object. I have since been informed that he is a most notorious coiner and utterer about the neighbourhood of Field-lane and Smithfield - also, the woman he cohabits with, she being once transported from this court for seven years in the name of Elizabeth Cooper, and has also suffered four months imprisonment at Ilford Jail for the like offence, that they are now at Brighton imposing on the public by coining and uttering. His object was to dupe me, to enable him to gain a reward which is given by the Mint, on conviction of an information.</p>

            . I live in Maidstone-street, about one hundred and fifty yards from Bell's house - I have a side view of his house - on Thursday, I was at work in my shop with the window open, and saw three men loitering about the street, appearing suspicions characters - I am positive the prisoner was one of them - he had a brown paper parcel in his hand, tied with white tape - I observed them walking up and down the street - presently one of them popped round the corner, and presently afterwards I saw them all three go up to Mrs. Bell's door - they stood at the door for a few seconds - one of them peeped through the window, and the prisoner looked through the key-hole - I saw one of them take something out of his pocket, and they opened the door- two of them went in, but the prisoner did not - they shut the door after them - the prisoner walked fifteen or twenty yards, then stood by the pond to watch - I ran down stairs and ran out towards Bell's, and just before I got to the door I saw the two men come out of the house with a bag - I could not pursue them - the prisoner was walking from where he stood - I collared him - the two men ran away; one of them had an umbrella - I had not seen him with an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150054"/>umbrella before he went into the house - I afterwards saw the bag which the man brought out of the house - when I collared the prisoner, I told him he belonged to them, and said he went up to the door with them - he said he did not- he had a paper parcel in his hand, and he began to read the direction; while I held him he tore off the direction from the parcel, and eat it; it was as large a piece of paper as my hand - he seemed very uncomfortable, and asked Mrs. Bell for some water, which she gave him, to wash it down- a policeman was got, and I gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your hearing is not very good? A. Not very. I could see the man distinctly, and the parcel he had in his hand - I never saw the prisoner before - I never said he was not one of the men who went up to the door - I am positive he is one of them - I told the magistrate that he was one who went up to the door, and peeped through the key-hole, and the others through the window- neither of the other men were so near me as the prisoner- I walked up and took him, because he was nearest to me, and the others were young men, and running quick - I asked him what the parcel was, and what it contained - he said, "What is that to anybody?" - my shop is on the first floor - between my house and Mrs. Bell's there is a garden, with a great many high trees, but none of them were in the way - there is a piece of road between my house and Mrs. Bell's - the trees in the garden are newly planted, and some of them have not got a leaf - they do not interrupt my view of Bell's house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the trees prevent your seeing this? A. Not in the least.</p>
               <p>THOMAS KEY. I am the son of John Key. I was working with my father in the room which commands a view of Bell's house - I saw the prisoner leaning over the palings - he had a paper parcel with him - there was a stout gentleman came from Baker's house, and went up the New Road- as soon as the stout gentleman got out of sight, the prisoner went down to Bell's house, and peeped through the key-hole and the window - nobody but him was at the house at that time - he went down to Mr. Bacon's public-house, and fetched two men out - it is fifteen yards from Bell's - they all three then went up to Mr. Bell's door - one of them put a key in the door, opened it, and two of them went in - they shut the door - (the prisoner remained outside, and walked about by the gas works) - I saw them up at the top window of the house - my father ran down stairs, and I ran out with him - he took the prisoner, who had a brown paper parcel with him - I saw him eating a piece of paper, but did not see him tear it off - my mother gave me a black bag, containing the property, and I took it into Bell's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How soon after the two men went into the house did you go out? A. We saw them up at the window of the house, and ran out in about three minutes - we stopped to see if it was any body belonging to the house first - I saw them moving about.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Dove-row, ten or twelve houses from Bell's, on the same side. Soon after nine o'clock I went out, and in New Boston-street saw three men in company - the prisoner was one of them - the street is opposite Bell's house - I went on my business, and returned in about half an hour - I observed the prisoner looking over the pales into the pond - the other two men turned into Bacon's public-house - I went out shortly after, and the prisoner was leaning over the pails - the other two were in the tap-room, looking over towards Bell's - I came back, and in a few minutes saw the prisoner look through the key-hole of the gas gates - I said, "You cannot get in there, they have been fastened up some months- you had better go round if you want any body" - he said, he wanted the gas man - I told him his conduct was very suspicious - I went home, and about twenty minutes afterwards I heard a cry of "Stop thief" - I went out, looked towards Bell's house, and saw Key take the prisoner - a crowd got round him, and Mrs. Bell came home - I went into the house with her - the street door and parlour door were wide open - I went up stairs with her - the bed was doubled up, and the things all in confusion - the drawers all open.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then you saw the prisoners four or five times that morning? A. I did; I suspected them - I was going about to my work people - I have lived in Doverow three years - I never saw the prisoner before that morning - I was in this court ten years ago, on a trial about a 5l. note which I took - I have never been here since to my knowledge - in the other court I had two cases while I was a private watchman - I was never tried in my life in any court.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not charged four or five years ago by one Leggatt, with a criminal offence? A. Never; I know John and Thomas Reeves - they were both tried some time ago- I was not a witness on that trial - it was a brother of mine - I was never in my life charged with robbing any lady or gentleman.</p>

            . I am a knacker, and live at Hanworth, in Middlesex. The prisoner came to my house on the morning of the 29th of April - I did not know him before- he called me up in the morning, and asked if I would buy a blind pony of him - I said, "Yes" - I asked where he lived - he said at Harlington - I asked where the pony was - he said it was over there - I asked why he did not bring it with him - he said he could not that morning, as he was going to Kingston - I offered to put my horse in the cart, and go with him to see it - he said he could not go then, for he was going to Kingston - he asked if I would see it in the morning - I said, Yes, I would see it any time in the morning, if he would bring it over - he asked at what time - I said, "Between eight and nine o'clock" - he said he must bring it over before that, for he had appointed to be somewhere else before that, and he would bring it over about five o'clock in the morning - he came a little after five o'clock in the morning with the pony - he called me up - I looked at it, and asked what he wanted for it- he said, 2l. - I said that was too much money - I thought it worth more, but thought he did not come honestly by it - he said he would take 35s. - I bid him 30s. - he would not sell it for that - I said I would give him a guinea and a half for it - he said I should have it - it was a brown pony - he put it into my stable - I said I would go down and pay him for it - I sent a young man to look to the horse, while the prisoner and I went and had a pot of beer - my partner and I then told him we did not think he came honestly by the horse, and asked where he lived - he said at Harlington, and his name was James Smith - my partner agreed to take the prisoner in the cart over to Harlington to see if it was right - he refused going, and wanted the money for the horse - after a little while he agreed to go - when the mare was put in the cart he would not go unless the horse went - he still wanted the money for it - my partner sent for a constable, and gave him in charge - this was about half-past six o'clock in the morning - Rolfe came over about eight o'clock, and claimed it as his own - George came with him, and he knew it again - it was a gelding.</p>

               <p>MR. ROLFE re-examined. The horse I saw at Fowell's was the horse I lost - it is a gelding - I am sure it is mine.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the horse for thirty shillings, of David Lee - I went over to the man to sell it about half-past five o'clock in the morning, and called him up - he asked what I wanted for it - I said 2l. - he humm'd and ha'd a good bit - he offered a guinea and a half, which I refused - he waited a quarter of an hour, and then put it in his stables.</p>

             (police-constable T 104). I got the articles which I have produced when I took the prisoner to the station-house - I found the waistcoat, three caps, a small handkerchief, and two pieces of lace in his hat - he owned himself guilty to me - I said nothing to induce him to confess - I found 103/4d. on him - he did not seem at all in liquor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I do not consider myself guilty of the crime laid to my charge - two persons, particularly one, has sworn false, for I never had the articles in my possession - I can safely say as a man, in the face of the Almighty, I never committed an offence before in my life - I have been in His Majesty's service some years, and in the young Queen of Portugal's - I wrote a publication in my name, "Thomas Knight, lately a corporal in the British battalion."</p>

I received information, in consequence of which I apprehended Dolly - he was given into my custody on the Sunday - I took him to the station-house - I found two duplicates on him - one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150057"/>of them led me to a pawnbroker's where I found a shawl - I went to Mr. Bell - he claimed the shawl.</p>

            . I am shopman to Peter Pige, of Swan-street, Bethnal-green. I produce a shawl pawned at our shop by the prisoner, Sarah Baker - I have the counterpart of the duplicate - one of the duplicates produced corresponds with it - it was pawned for 6s. on Saturday night, the 3rd of May, after the gas was lighted, in the name of Ann Baker - she said it was her mother's, and she lived at No. 2, Church-street - I attended, when there was a charge against Dolly, at the office - at the door of the office I saw Sarah Baker - I told an officer, and she was taken into custody - it was between nine and eleven o'clock- our shop is nearly half a mile from the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>Baker. The pawnbroker did not ask me who sent me to pawn the shawl. Witness. I said, "Whose is this?" - she said, "Whose do you think? - it is my mother's" - I have known her three years.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is her mother likely to be possessed of such a shawl? A. They are working people, but respectable.</p>
               <p>MR. BELL re-examined. This is my shawl - it is worth 30s., and is one of the two I lost that night (looking at the one produced by McKee) - this is my property - I have a private mark on each of them - I invariably attach a small ticket like this for the young men to know, and I attach another private mark which I can swear to - both have my private mark on them, by which I can swear to them - the robbery was between nine and ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the same private mark used by more than one linen-draper? for instance, I suppose you have been a shopman yourself before you were a master - have you taken for your own private mark any private mark used in that shop? A. No; my private mark was my father's, who has been out of business eighteen years - I never saw the same mark in the trade - it is, "God is my help," and there is a piece of thread besides drawn into the shawl, which I always take off when I sell an article, but my shopmen, I believe, do not - I do not always put the thread on - it is a private mark to prevent my shopmen robbing me.</p>

            , who is a cabinet-maker, and lived in Ingram's-buildings, Willowwalk, but he has removed from there now - I have been the associate of thieves until recently, and concerned in several depredations - I was examined last sessions, and stated several robberies in which I was engaged - I was in custody as a witness, and am now in custody on a charge - on this night three weeks, as near as I can recollect, the three prisoners and another one were in Norton-falgate between seven and eight o'clock - I was on the opposite side, and saw a piece of glass shoved in - I saw the three prisoners and another lurking about - I watched them, and saw Westbrook go and shove the glass - they all three left it for about an hour, or rather better, and afterwards they came and stood under the gateway where I was standing, and looked at me - they went away for about an hour or rather better - I followed them to Sun-street - they came back - then Westbrook went and shoved the glass in more- that was between nine and ten o'clock, or half-past nine- the other prisoner who is not here took the glass out, and went round the corner with it leading to Spital-square - they all came and stood under the gateway - I heard the prisoner, not in custody, say, "We will strip the b - y shop before we leave it," and directly after Dolly and Sully, the one not in custody, crossed over, Sully took out a shawl, and gave it to Dolly, who went round the corner with it to Spital-square - afterwards Westbrook and Gawthorn went up to the window - Gawthorn took out another shawl, and gave it to Westbrook - I gave information immediately to Mr. Bell, and he ran after them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you received any assistance since you were here, or before, from the police to enable them to find out offences and prosecute parties? A. No; I have had no money from any policeman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How old are you? A. Thirteen; I am not the associate of thieves now - I have reformed since last sessions - I was not committed for stealing a handkerchief, but for giving it to another boy - I was walking about on the evening in question on no business at all - I was living with my father at the time, he was supporting me - I never slept out a night hardly - I always slept at home - most always - I cannot say how many nights I have slept in Newgate - I have only been in Newgate as a prisoner once - that was two or three sessions ago, on suspicion of stealing a gold watch - I cannot say how long I was in Newgate for it - I think it was more than a week, not so long as a month, before I was tried and acquitted - I was regularly tried and acquitted - I was remanded to Clerkenwell about the watch - I have been kept in the House of Correction for evidence - I was never in the House of Correction on any charge, but for stealing the gold watch - I have been charged with felony twice, I believe - once besides this.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you the associate of thieves before you began to reform? A. Two years; I have got my living by working for my father - I did not leave home when I began thieving - I was thieving when I was living with my father - I worked for my father about two months, and then left him - I never left my father till I was in confinement - I was not employed by any one to watch the prisoners, or any other person - I have never been employed on similar errands - I have not been paid any thing by any body for the information I gave about the prisoners - I have lived with my father until the day before yesterday - I remember being a witness here against the Pickards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, after that, saying, "Did I not do well to transport them all?" A. No; I said nothing of the kind - I have known Westbrook to sell baked potatoes - I do not know that he is a weaver - I was standing in a passage when I saw this business transacted - I was eight or nine yards from them, I should think - I saw distinctly which gave the shawl to the other - I should have gone over to give information, before they took the second shawl; but somebody belonging to them was standing in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said, in your deposition, "When the shawl was given to Westbrook he put it into his apron?" A. I saw his apron up, and the shawl was half way out of the window, and I could not see exactly whether he put it under his apron - I swear he had a black apron on that night.</p>

I received the prisoner and blankets in charge - I said, "What is this bundle?" - he said, "They are the blankets I took out of the house - I did it for want, having had no victuals for some time, and I went into the house for victuals; not finding any, I took these, and wish to be transported."(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

             (police-serjeant E 14). I was sent for, and asked the prisoner where she had sent the box which I understood had gone away - she said she did not know exactly, but it was gone to a house in Smart's-buildings, Drury-lane - that the people were quite strangers to her, but she took the things to the top of the stairs, and left them there, as she saw no one - I asked her if she would go with me - she hesitated, and then said she would - I went to the house, and a woman came out and said to her, "Ah, Kitty, is that you?" - I turned to the prisoner and said, "I understood the people were total strangers to you" - the woman said, "Oh, no, she has lodged here, and she has been here several times lately" - the prosecutrix saw these articles there, and said they were hers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. These were loose about the room? A. Some were in a closet, and some on the mantel-piece.</p>
               <p>MRS. JOY. These are my property.</p>
               <p>MRS. BURT. I live in the house where these things were found. My husband is a porter - this butter-pot lid is mine, I told the prosecutrix so when she came and took it.</p>
               <p>MRS. M'GARTHY. The wine glass and tumbler are mine - they were taken from my house by the prosecutrix, and she wanted to take some soup plates which I brought from America, and a fruit basket of mine - this glass was my mother's, and I set store by it.(Elizabeth Salter, Charles Salter,

            . I am a shoemaker. I have known the prisoner three or four months - there was great animosity between her and the waiter - I have written down on this paper some expressions he made use of (reads): - "My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I, Richard Hall, have come forward in behalf of the prisoner at the bar, Sarah Barker, to state to your Lordship the following words I have heard spoken by the young man-servant to Mr. Worrall, that he thought he was going to leave his situation. I asked him what for? - he said, 'Through that b-y b-h Sall, but he would do for her.' About a fortnight afterwards I went to Mr. Worrall's, and the waiter told me he had good news, yet very bad. I asked him what it was - he told me, that b-y b-h had been robbing her master, and he was very sorry it had happened."</p>

             (police-serjeant C 14). On Friday, the 18th of April, I was on duty in Burlington-gardens, between three and four o'clock, and saw the prisoner coming towards me - he was very much in liquor - I saw this pocket-book nearly out of his pocket - I took him to the station-house, and said, "Perhaps you may have money about you" - he said he had not; but he afterwards said he had, but it was his own - the pocket-book was then empty, but in his breeches pocket I found three £10 and one £5 notes, three sovereigns, three half-sovereigns, and some silver, amounting in the whole to 40l. 19s. 01/4d. - he was drunk, but could answer any questions which were put to him - I took him to the magistrate the next morning, and on the way, I asked him what money it was I found on him - he said it was his own; and was left him by a deceased relation, and had been paid him the day before by an uncle from Buckinghamshire - he told the magistrate the same, and said it was his grandfather who was dead - I then charged him with stealing it, and found the prosecutor - he told me the numbers of the notes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He states that he found the prosecutor; but I told the gaoler who the prosecutor was, where he lived, and how he became possessed of the property; and accordingly the officer was sent down to No. 64, Silver-street, Stepney.</p>

            . I drive a cab. I was called on that Friday, from Holborn-hill, to take up at Thompson and Fearon's - I found the prosecutor and the prisoner there - the prisoner ordered me to drive to Maddox-street; but in going along Oxford-street, he said, "Pull up here, and we will have something to drink" - I pulled up and he ordered a pint of ale - the prisoner put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and gave the boy a sovereign to pay for the ale - the boy brought it back, and said his master could not give change - the prisoner put it into his own pocket, and we went on to the place of destination - the prisoner then gave me half-a-crown to pay for the cab, and I gave him 6d. out - I then said, "Before I leave you, give the man his sovereign" - he said, "No; I shall not: he is my brother" - I called a policeman, but he would not take him - I then called a young man, and told him to take notice of my number, and, in a few days, I had a summons - the prosecutor was drunk, but the prisoner was little the worse for liquor.</p>
               <p>JOHN SYKES. This has the appearance of my pocketbook, but it has no mark in it - this is a memorandum of the numbers of the notes - I had No. 18,934, dated the 9th of May, 1833; 6427, dated the 23rd of March, 1833; 4490, dated the 8th of May, 1833 - these are the notes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was with him the greater part of the Thursday - we got drinking with one another, and got tipsy - I left him at a quarter before twelve o'clock that night - the next day, I met him in the road - he asked me to give him something to drink; and we went and had two quarterns of rum - we then went on to Aldgate, and got into an omnibus - he gave the conductor a sovereign - he said he could not give change - I gave the shilling - the prosecutor then said, "We will have something to drink, and get change;" and we went to a house, but could not get change - we then went to Thompson and Fearon's, and he proposed having a cab - we went and had some ale at the corner of Poland-street, and he gave me a sovereign to get change - I did not take it out of his pocket - when the cab was discharged there was a bit of a stir about the sovereign, but the policeman would not take me - we went to another public-house, and both fell asleep - when we awoke, he sent me out for a cab; and as I was going past him, I picked up this pocket-book - I said, "You see what you have dropped; and as we have both been together, I think it would be best for me to take care of it till the morning" - I then went to get a cab, and met a friend who gave me something to drink - I lost my senses altogether, and was taken - the officer told me the best way would be to say the money was my own, which I did; but I afterwards told the gaoler who it belonged to.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Was it suet? A. No; it is called fat in sheep, but suet in cattle - I never desired the prisoner to take fat to that place - Mr. Marshall in Holborn has my fat - there were two more at work with the prisoner, but they did not go to Treacher's - he went alone.(Mr. Pether, and Mr. Smith, carcase butchers, gave the prisoner a good character.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In consequence of having no friends in town, as my father died the night before last, I can only produce documents to my character since I was in his Majesty's service in 1810. I was then in the Mediterranean with Lord Exmouth. I was in three or four actions during the war; and in 1823 I received a medallion from the king of Portugal. I then entered the Greek service, and came home in 1829. I then married Miss Biggs, and understood her father was to give me some property; but I found he was a bankrupt. I made great exertion to get into a situation, but without effect. I did not intend to rob the prosecutor, and I wrote that letter to say that directly it was in my power, I would pay her that, and every thing belonging to her.</p>

I saw the prisoner pass me with something under her arms - I asked what she had got - she said, "Some meat" - she was quite tipsy - she threw it down, and I took it up, and took her to the shop.(The Prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that she had purchased the meat of a woman in the street.)</p>

             (police-officer). I was on duty in Silver-street, on the 27th of April, between three and four in the morning - I saw the prosecutor, who said the prisoner had robbed him of a box and some money - I took him to the station-house - on the way, he said he had no box, nor yet money of the prosecutor's - at the station-house he took out two boxes, and said, "Is either of these it?" - the prosecutor said, "No" - I then searched him, and found two more boxes, one of which is the prosecutor's - I found three half-crowns and four shillings and sixpence in his trousers pocket - he admitted, next morning, that it was the prosecutor's money, and he had taken it out of a lark, and should have returned it to him next morning.</p>

            . I lodge at the Robin Hood public-house: the prisoner slept in the same bed with me. On the morning of the 7th of May, I saw him out of bed between three and four o'clock - I remarked that it was rather early - he said, yes; but he was going to Newgate-market - I sat up and looked for my clothes, which I had left on the bed, and which were not there then - I found them by the bed side - I took up my trousers, and felt in them for a crown-piece, two shillings, and some half-pence, which I knew I had left in the pocket - they were all safe - I put them down again, and the prisoner went out of the room - I laid down, and in a few minutes he came into the room again - I suppose he thought I was asleep - I saw him take my trousers, and he was pushing up the pocket to get the money out - he went down - I jumped up and ran after him - I said, "Halloo" - he said, "Halloo," and came up into the bed-room again - I came up with him - I shut the door, and challenged him with having my crown-piece - he said he had not - I said he had - I got my clothes on, and locked the door of the room while I went out for a policeman - I saw a bricklayer's labourer, and sent him for a policeman - in about two minutes the policeman came; and, as we went up stairs, I heard the prisoner jump out of the window, which is on the first-floor - I opened the door, and he was not in the room - the window looked into some stable yards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you left the room, where did you go? A. To the front door. I did not go into the club-room - I put my foot into the room to let you pass me on the stairs.</p>

             (police-constable C 60). I was called by the prosecutor, and saw him and another policeman opposite the public-house. I searched for nearly two hours, and found the prisoner concealed behind two coaches, on the foot-board - it was then about five minutes before six - I said, "I have got you at last," and was going to take hold of him - he said,"I will come; I was a d-d fool to run away - I should not, if he had not threatened to murder me with the poker" I found two shillings and some half-pence in his pocket, and forty-two duplicates.</p>

The prisoner lodged with me from the latter end of September till the 8th or 9th of April - she had my front parlour - I gave her notice to quit, but I could not get rid of her for some weeks - I missed a coal-scuttle, a gilt watch, a table-spoon, a metal tea-pot, a pair of sheets, and four table-cloths - Mrs. Carter came and told me something, and I had the prisoner taken up - I had had her taken up about six weeks before, but she was released - I received six duplicates from Mrs. Carter - I went with them to Mr. Williams, the pawnbroker, and was foolish enough to take two table-cloths out of pawn - they were mine - the officer has them - at Mr. Walker's I saw a pair of sheets, a coal-scuttle, a metal tea-pot, and two more table-cloths, which were mine, I have no doubt - the prisoner had the use of the scuttle, and I had seen it about two months before - I took the duplicates to the pawnbroker's, but my son, I believe, had the duplicates of what was mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you married? A. No; I have been. I have three daughters grown up - there was a gentleman lodged in my house - I am not aware that he became attached to the prisoner - I do not know that I hoped he would become attached to one of my daughters - I never was asked any thing about it - I have some money in the Bank, but very little, and two of my daughters have some - I never mentioned that to the lodgers, nor to the prisoner - I do not know how she found it out - the lodger is gone to America now - he did not tell me he was going there.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know that he was going there? A. He said so to the whole firm of the house - I am mistress of the house - I meant myself as one of the firm.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if he told the whole firm, and among the whole firm yourself, he told you that he was going to America? A. Yes. I can give no reason why I said he did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What do you mean by the whole firm? A. My daughters and myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150066"/>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you remember Mr. Marshall leaving your house a fortnight before the prisoner? A. Yes; he was going weeks before - he gave no reason for leaving - I did not hear of any reason given in the house - the prisoner never complained of losing any thing in the house - she might complain of losing a comb - she did not complain of losing a petticoat, till she was at Lambeth-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she complain of losing before Mr. Marshall left? A. I do not know of any thing beside the comb before Mr. Marshall left - I do not wish to swear it - she said the comb she lost was a tortoise-shell comb - I think it was a comb to keep the hair up - I have my doubts whether she lost it - my daughters are not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever challenge any one with wearing the comb that she said she had lost? A. Yes; my daughter Maria. I forgot that - it is not a common thing to happen to my daughter, but I forgot that she charged my daughter with stealing it; and I forgot that she said she had lost it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she complain of losing any thing else before Mr. Marshall left? A. She might, but I do not know that she did - I cannot swear she did not - I believe she complained of something, but I forgot what - I do not know that she charged any one with stealing it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not complain of losing a card-case? A. Yes; she charged that it was stolen in the house - she did not insist that the carpet should be taken up - I forgot that she had complained of losing a card-case when you asked me - it was to me that she complained of losing it - I do not know that I asked her any question as to who was in the room - I do not recollect that I asked who was the last person in the room, nor that she told me my daughter Maria was the last person - I do not know that I said there something very mysterious in all this - it was after she had accused my daughter Maria of stealing the comb that she said Maria was the last person in the room - I think she did say that Maria had been in the room last, but I cannot be certain - I do not know whether it was after or before she accused her of stealing the comb.</p>

               <p>Q. Who did you take the prisoner before in the first instance? A. I do not know - it was at Lambeth-street - I believe I charged her there with stealing a gilt watch - I am sure it was a gilt watch, a table-spoon, a pair of sheets, three table-cloths, a coal-scuttle, and tea-pot, all of which I swore she stole - the watch was left me by my father - I never told the prisoner that my daughter, Maria, stole that watch, and that she need not worry herself about it - I stated to the magistrate that the prisoner stole all these things, but he discharged her once - I do not think she was up but twice - I have known Mrs. Carter since last Sunday week (I think it was) when she came and brought me the duplicates - the prisoner had a few things - she had a comb.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the carpet taken up to look for the cardcase? A. No - I did not believe her when she said my daughter Maria had been the last person in the room - there were so many people in and out - I do not know whether she did say that my daughter had been in the room - it is a long while ago - there was a bed in the prisoner's room - I have been in the room, but I never saw the bed down - she had no linen of me - she said she had sheets of her own - I never saw any of her sheets - she complained of losing sheets when she went away - I forgot that - my memory is rather bad - I forgot the comb, the card-case, and the sheets - my sheets were marked G. A. P., but it is picked out - there is no mark on them now, nor was there at the police-office - I know they are mine, because I have others like them - I missed the watch about Christmas - I searched for it - I did not apply to any office, nor call in any officer - I suspected it was stolen, but I did not suspect any one in the house - I then missed the sheets - I searched for them, but did not call in any officer, though I thought they were stolen - I next missed the table-spoon - there was nothing remarkable happened in my family the week I lost my watch - my daughters lived with me - some of them slept out - Maria did not sleep out - she did not leave my house and go away; I did not say, I wondered where she got the money - she slept in my house every night after I missed the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not remember letting her in one night? A. No, Sir; I never kept her out - I do not think she is at home now - she went out with a friend this morning - I do not know that my other daughters may be at home - Maria never slept out at night - I remember the prisoner being out late one night - I did not tell her if Maria knocked not to let her in - my daughter never stayed out a night in her life - I do not remember what the prisoner was out late one night for.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not tell you it was to go on board a ship to see Marshall? A. Oh, yes, Sir; I had no notion that there was a sneaking affection between them - on his side I am sure there was not - the prisoner did go to see him on board the ship - she returned at night - I do not know who let her in - Maria was at home - she never sleeps out - it might be ten or eleven o'clock when the prisoner came in - I do not think it was so late as twelve o'clock - I asked her where she had been staying so long - she said she had been on board ship to take leave of Marshall.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who brought the message to her from the ship? A. No; I have only one son - he is now here - I do not know that my son brought the message to her to go on board the ship, to see Marshall before he sailed - I will not swear positively whether my son told me he brought a message from Marshall for her to go on board to see him - I will not swear he did not - I do not recollect it - he might have told me and I forget it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your solemn oath is not this whole business the result of a base conspiracy - now, before God and man, answer it? A. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where is Maria? A. She is gone out into the City with a friend.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who is the friend? A. I do not know - I do not know where the house is - I have not kept her back on purpose - I think I heard her say the place was in the City - I never heard the name of the friend, nor the house she was going to, nor how long she was to stay - I do not know whether it is a male or a female friend - I do not know whether she dined at home, because I was here - she told me she was going out for the day - she is seven and twenty years old - I left home at eight o'clock this morning - I do not think my son knows that she is out for the day - I have not seen my daughter Maria about this Court to-day<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150067"/>- I do not think my son has seen her - she is dressed in mourning, and is tall and thin - she knew I was coming here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When the prisoner went away she said she had lost some sheets? A. Yes; and before that complained of having lost a comb and card-case - I had made a charge against her about a month before she left.</p>

            . I am son of the prosecutrix. I produce five duplicates which my mother gave me - I know that she took the prisoner in as a lodger in September last.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you present? A. No; I am in the habit of visiting at my mother's frequently, every evening - I was not there last evening - I have not been there to-day - I have not seen my sister Maria for this week, as I have been detained here on business - I do not know where my sister Maria is to-night - I cannot say whether she is in the habit of going out.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she in the habit of going out with a nameless friend, to a nameless house, in a nameless street? A. I cannot say - I have been in the habit of visiting at my mother's when the prisoner lodged there - I advised my mother to get rid of her - I began to give that advice a few days after she got there - I never heard of the prisoner making any charge upon the firm.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you not think it very strange if this young woman should charge your own sister Maria with a robbery, and you not hear it? A. I might have heard it - there might have been two charges against her and I not hear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of her charging your sister Maria with stealing a tortoise-shell comb? A. There might have been a hint of the kind - it is so long ago, I cannot say I have any strong recollection of it - I never heard of it from my mother - when I said "a hint," I thought you alluded to these things that we charge against her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing about any sheets? A. There was something about it; it must have been after she left the house - I know that she wrote on a piece of paper to my mother, that was the way I heard of it - I think I was at my mother's house when it was brought by some one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of her charging "the firm" with stealing any thing? A. I really cannot tell; I might have heard of it, but such girls as these I do not take notice of- I remember Mr. Marshall living with my mother - I went on board the Moffat, but not with Mr. Marshall - I do not know who I went on board with - I went to see the captain - I saw Marshall on board.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any message from him to any body in your house? A. I cannot say whether I did or not - I am sure I cannot say whether I told my mother that I did - I do not know that he gave me any message to any of my sisters, or to any female in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Must you not know if he sent any message by you to any one, to come and see him? A. I cannot say - I do not know that he sent a message to the prisoner by me - the time is so far elapsed that I cannot recollect it, it is about five months ago - I had a bad opinion of her - I cannot tell whether Marshall sent any message by me to her, to go and see him - I have no recollection of it - I cannot swear I did not deliver the message to her from Marshall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not send that message by you, and in addition, that she was to take down with her the knives that he bought at Mr. Carr's, in Whitechapel? A. I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take a letter to her? A. I really cannot tell - I cannot answer it - I had not been intimate with Marshall - I paid him that courtesy which he paid me - I never was in private company with him - I forget whether I brought a letter from him to the girl - I did not dislike her - I had my suspicions of her - I thought she was not respectable - I did not think her unchaste: I thought her rather too intimate with Marshall - he had been in her room - I did not tell my mother that - I cannot tell whether Marshall was living there when she came - I do not know that Marshall ever paid any attention to any of my sisters - I do not know that he did to Maria - I do not know whether Maria has any property in the Bank - I do not remember my mother complaining of her stopping out one night.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you again, whether Marshall did not give you a letter to this girl? A. I really cannot say - I cannot say whether he might desire that she should bring the knives - I have forgotten it - I cannot say whether I heard of her charging my sister with stealing a card-case.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not the girl, in your own presence, tell your mother she had lost her comb, and that it was in your sister Maria's head? A. Never in my presence - I heard there was something missed - I do not recollect hearing from my mother or sister that such a charge was made - I remember a watch being lost about January, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever mention any thing to the young woman at the bar about it? A. I do not know whether I did or not- I do not know whether I said any thing to her with reference to my sister Maria and the watch, to the best of my knowledge I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, is not that phrase put into every answer, to save yourself from an indictment in future? A. No; it is not - I heard no conversation with the prisoner about my sister Maria and the missing watch to my knowledge - I think I could not have forgotten it - I do not recollect that I ever said to her, "Make your mind easy, my sister Maria has the watch" - I cannot swear that I did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you mean by saying you were never in private company with Marshall? A. Never; but with my mother.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you not played at cards with Marshall and your mother? A. I might have done it - I cannot say whether I have played with the prisoner, my mother, and Marshall, over and over again - I will not swear it - I cannot say whether we have played over and over again at speculation - I have played at whist with my mother.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the other two persons? A. I really cannot say - I never played at cards in the prisoner's room to my recollection - I never played at cards with her and Marshall, in her room to my knowledge.</p>

Yes; the day they were found, I went to her house in White Horse-street - I do not know the number - I lost a timepiece, and was told something at the office - I am married - my husband is not here - I remember the prisoner coming into my room before these duplicates were found, when I was on the floor - I was robbed in the middle of the afternoon, and was so shocked that I fainted away; and when I came to, the prisoner was by my side with water - but I came here for my own property, and I am not going to be brow-beat by you or any one - I want my own - I want my own.</p>
               <p>Q. You fainted? A. Yes; I do not think there was any one by my side when I fainted - I went into the prisoner's room when I recovered - I asked her what had become of her work-box; and she said the door was on the jar; but I did not see it - I believe there was a noise heard by one of my lodgers - I took the prisoner to Mr. Hardwick, the magistrate - I charged her on suspicion of stealing my timepiece - it was found at her lodging - she was discharged - I did not take her up again - I do not know that Mrs. Hart did - I have since been to Mrs. Hart's with the duplicates - I have not been on visiting terms there - I have not been to tea there - she has some daughters - I have not seen her daughter Maria here to-day - I believe the prisoner's work-box has not been found - she said she had been robbed of it - that she found the street door open, and her own door unlocked - that was after I missed my timepiece - I had been in my back room first - I screamed out that the timepiece was gone - I then fainted, and found the prisoner by my side washing my face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to the prisoner about the duplicates you found? A. I do not think her worth speaking to - she left my house bag and baggage, but she forgot the duplicates, and she left this pack of cards - they are cards of her business as a dress-maker - my husband did these cards, and never was paid for them - the address is No. 4, Spring-garden-place - that is where I lived then.</p>

Yes, she did not abscond - I had not seen her for the entire day on which the timepiece was missed - the outer door had been opened and shut several times, because there are lodgers in the house - when I missed the time-piece, I fainted, and found the prisoner assisting me - I then went into the parlour, and missed her work-box - I did not go to see how the outer door was, whether it was open or shut - I had seen the timepiece<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150069"/>safe about an hour before I fainted - what time of that hour it had been taken, I cannot tell - the prisoner was coming in when I missed it - she could not have been in during that hour without my knowing it, but I heard a footstep about four o'clock in the afternoon go along the passage - I missed the timepiece almost at the same minute, and the prisoner came in just at the time - a person asked her how she came in - she said she found the door ajar.</p>

             (police-constable K 143.) I received information, and went to Limehouse-fields, to a person named Toswell, a green-grocer. I took the prisoner there - Mrs. Toswell directed me to Mrs. Small - I went to the front room up stairs - it was locked - I examined the room, and found this timepiece wrapped in a handkerchief - I spoke to the prisoner about it - she said the handkerchief was hers, but she knew nothing about the timepiece.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who went with you? A. Mr. Hart. The timepiece was wrapped in the handkerchief, which was clean - it was not tied.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was just about being discharged, when Mr. Hart said if any one went to my lodging the timepiece would be found. One handkerchief was clean in my box when I went out, and the other was on the table. I locked up my room, and have the key now. The timepiece was not in the room when I left; it must have been taken there; it was a planned thing. The magistrate saw it was spite, and he was going to acquit me, till Mr. Hart made that reply.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to ELIZABETH SMALL. Q. When did the prisoner's boxes come in? A. One on Saturday night, the other on Monday. If she had intended to part with the timepiece, she might have done it - I had been in her room while she was there.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you see the policeman and Hart come? A. Yes, I did. I saw no parcel with them - they desired me to go with them into the room, and the timepiece was on the table - I did not notice any timepiece on the table till they found it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see the policeman or Hart put any thing on the table? A. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you been out of your house on the Sunday or Monday? A. Yes; but I am confident my children would not let any one in.</p>

Yes - I cannot say whether it was the policeman or myself that suggested to the magistrate to send to her lodging - it might have been me - I cannot say that I did not - when I saw the timepiece, it was wrapped in the handkerchief - it was tied.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You have been accustomed to horses? A. I have - the pony appeared jaded and trembling, as if he had been rode about - I had been looking for him the whole of Sunday, though he was found so near.</p>

I am a horse clipper and trimmer - I was assisting the prosecutor to sell the pony - I was riding him on Saturday, the 3rd of May, to get a customer - I was at the Constitution public-house, Lisson Grove, at half-past four o'clock, and was riding the horse - the prisoner came up while I was there - I have known him for years - he is a charcoal burner - he came up, and asked me if the pony was for sale - it had red ribbons on, and a halter round its neck - I said it was for sale - he asked the price - I said fifteen guineas - he said he would give me five - Sigston was either inside the door or close to the door - I said I could not take any such money - he said, "Let me look at it, get up, and ride him" - I got up on it, and rode him, and then gave him to William Smith, to run him up and down, for the prisoner to see that it was not lame, and after that he followed Smith and me down, and said he would get up, and ride it himself, and if he liked it, he would buy it- he jumped on, and I told him not to go out of the street - I said I would sell the pony if he would give the money for it, but the least I could take should be twelve guineas - I am sure I told him not to ride him out of the street - he got up, turned to the right, and went away - I never saw him again that day - I went to the Constitution with Sigston, and never left till half-past eleven o'clock - he never came there - I found the prisoner at eight o'clock on Sunday morning in bed at his friend's house - I cannot tell the name of the street - it is almost close to where the pony was taken from - I asked where the pony was - he said he did not know - I said if he did not tell me where it was, I must go and tell the owner, as it was intrusted to my care to sell - he got out of bed, and went to a barber's shop - I said, "Taylor, do tell me where the pony is" - he was rather in liquor then, I think - I cannot tell whether he was in liquor when he went off with the pony - he said he would go and have his beard off - I went and saw the prosecutor - I told him I had seen the prisoner, but he did not know where it was - the prisoner told me he thought it was gone down into the country - we got a policeman to look about, and at last it was found - I saw it at the Red Lion about half-past five o'clock - it was the same pony.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you known the prisoner? A. About five years - I have been intimate with him, and found him always honest - the real value of the pony is about twelve guineas - that was the lowest price I was permitted to take for it - the prosecutor authorized me to sell it, by taking it round the park - I did not help the prisoner to get on the pony - at the latter end of the conversation I told him not to go out of the street - he rode away with it directly after I told him that - he told me if he liked it he would have it at fifteen guineas, which I asked him - if he had bid me twelve guineas, I should have taken it.</p>

            . I was at the Constitution - the pony stood at the door - Huet told me to give it some water, which I did - they were talking about the price of it - Huet said, "Will you run this pony down the street?" and I ran it down the street twice - I came back, and the prisoner said, "Let me get on it, see how I can make it go" - he jumped on - Huet said, "Do not go out of the street" - he said, "I shall be back in a few minutes;" and that was all I saw of him - Huet told me to stand at the corner to see if he came back - I stood there about an hour - he did not come in that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear the whole conversation? A.

            . I am ostler at the Red Lion, Westburn-green. I first saw the pony about ten o'clock on Saturday evening - the prisoner called there on it, and had half a pint of beer - there was no red ribbon in the bridle then, nor any halter on - he went away, and on Sunday morning, about five o'clock, he brought the pony there again, and gave him into my care - and about five o'clock in the evening the prosecutor came and owned it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you known him? A. About two months - he is a charcoal burner - he uses a horse and cart.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did any conversation take place between you and the prisoner? A. Not a word - he told me to take it to the stable and give it hay and water - he was in the habit of coming to our premises.</p>

I beg to trespass on the Court while I relate the cause which excited me to the act which placed me in the disgraceful situation in which I now stand; an act which is as opposed from my natural principle, as night is from day - at the time it occurred I was under extreme embarrassment, and most afflicting oppression - my wife was on the point of her accouchement, and I was without the means of providing her with the common necessaries - I had, my Lord, endeavoured to exert myself to the utmost of my power, to alleviate her painful situation, without effect - I have sought assistance from those who I have received great kindness from, but which has been withheld from me, on account of it being considered we had a right of claim on an individual, who would not assist us; on the day named in the indictment I had undergone extremely fatiguing exertions, and met with aggravating disappointments - in the extreme distress on my mind, I accidentally met a person who kindly prevailed on me to take a glass of a rum with him, which he thought would cheer my spirits - not having broken my fast during the day, and being never accustomed to spirits, it overcame me in a manner; I scarcely knew what I was doing, and while on my way home I was passing the prosecutor's house, and having the thoughts of home across my mind, I, without the least thought or premeditation, committed the act which places me before your Lordship an unfortunate being - I have entirely provided for myself from the age of thirteen, under the greatest disadvantages, from family troubles and afflictions - I leave my friends to say the rest.</p>

The prisoner lived in my service for about fifteen months, and left about a fortnight or three weeks before the 26th of March - I had a middling-sized clothes box in which I kept my clothes - he had seen me go to that box for money - I kept it in my back parlour - there is a door from the back parlour into the yard - on the night of the 25th of March, I latched that door, but did not fasten it in any other way - I can be certain there were ninety sovereigns and more in sovereigns and half-sovereigns in that box that night - I had seen the money three or four days before - I got up next morning about half-past five o'clock, and found the back door latched as before - I found the box out in the yard broken open, and all my money gone - I am sure the night before I had latched the back door, and the box was then safe in the parlour - I saw the prisoner that night about half-past nine o'clock in front of my premises, and I saw him at the back as well - he lives about three hundred yards from me - I missed a bowl which the policeman brought to me next morning - the prisoner lives in Angel-square - I observed traces on the dung which led to a search.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who did you leave up in your house when you went to bed? A. Nobody - I have no servant - I latched the door myself - I tried it before I went to bed - I forgot to bolt it - I generally bolt it the last thing before I go to bed - I am quite certain I tried it, and that it was latched - my back premises are very much exposed.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I was present at the prisoner's examination - he said he lived in Angel-square, Bishopsgate - I went there, and found this jacket - one of the pockets appears to have been torn out, and the other worn out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. That man says I owned I had done the robbery; when all of them seemed to say I did it, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150073"/>said, "If you say I did it, I shall be found guilty that I did do it." I used to sleep at Williams', he had two cows, and I had been looking at the cows: my boots were all over dung.</p>
               <p>MR. HERITAGE. After taking the deposition, I asked the prisoner if he wished to say any thing in his defence - he said, No - but, previously, when he said what I have stated, I told him he had better hold his tongue - I am sure he used the words I have stated - he interrupted the witness, and said so - and a minute or so afterwards, he said"I was in a passion" - he certainly said what he did in anger.</p>

               <p>MR. WILLIAMS re-examined. There is a parcel of cowdung at the back of my premises - I considered him a tolerable character when he first lived with me, but not at the latter part, for that was the reason I discharged him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DAWSON. Q. What o'clock was this? A. As near as I can recollect, twenty minutes or a quarter to eleven o'clock at night - I had been to Mr. Pullen, an attorney, in Gloucester-street, Hoxton - I had been having a pint of half-and-half with a person named Rice, who lives in Dove-row - nothing but malt and hops was in the half-and-half, I presume - I passed Keith as I was on the curb, and he stood near the houses - I did not observe whether he was drunk, but he struck me first - I turned back, and laid hold of him instantly - it was not till I laid hold of Keith that Steel interfered - I had not struck Keith - I seized hold of him - I was surrounded by them in all quarters the moment I laid hold of Keith - I had an umbrella with me - I did not lose it - I kept hold of it - I became insensible when on the ground - my umbrella was lying by my side when I came to myself - I might have used the umbrella in the irritation - I swear I did not strike Steel with it - if I struck any body, it was Keith - I certainly struck him with it - I cannot swear whether I struck him once or twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure when you imagined you struck at Keith, you might not have struck at Steel? A. I am, because the others were behind me, and I could not strike them - when Keith struck me I collared him immediately - whether the others came to his rescue or not, I cannot tell - when I was down, I felt my breeches tugged at - I had hold of Keith with one hand - there was a great scuffle - I felt their hands right inside my clothes - I swear I distinctly felt their hands at my fob and right hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say to Duff's father that, at the trial, if he would give you 10s., you would endeavour to get her off? A. Never; they have offered it to me, and a friend of Steel's has offered me a sovereign while I have been here this morning - I have seen Daniel Ryan and Peter Duff - I never said I would undo at the trial what I had done respecting the female prisoner - I struck Keith once with my umbrella, and may have struck him twice; but I was on my back in an instant - there was an attempt to get Keith from me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the beginning of this? A. No; I went to his assistance when he called out - there was no confusion when I went up, except the three people who were attacking him - there were other people on the footway - his umbrella was found near the cap - I had enough to do to hold Keith - I cannot say who took the hat; for, in assisting the prosecutor, I lost sight of the prisoners when they left him.</p>

             GOODE. I am a carrier, and live in Holywell-lane. On Tuesday night, about half-past ten o'clock, I was going to Shoreditch, and nearly at the top of the lane, a person passed from towards Shoreditch church to the opposite side - he had something in his hand, which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150074"/>he placed on the step of a door - it was a hat - I could not see the man's face - this is the hat.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FELL LEWIN. I live in Church-street, Shoreditch: I am foreman to a bootmaker. I went to the corner of our street to take a little fresh air, and observed, across the street, two or three individuals having an altercation, as I thought - they were standing up - I did not observe any thing more, but looked another way - I then heard the cry of "Police, police" - I looked round, and saw the prosecutor on the ground, and Steel striking him with his fist - I thought it was a mere lark, or I would have run over - one of the prisoners ran away - he had no hat on - Steel immediately followed, but not so quick as the first - I crossed the road to stop him, when the policeman came up; and we both caught him at the same time - there was a general attempt to rescue him, by four or five individuals - more assistance came, and he was conveyed to the watch-house - and, on the way there, Duff endeavoured to excite others to rescue him, and called the prosecutor names - I gave her in charge - I ran back to our shop - a young man followed me, and begged me not to go against the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw a dispute as it turned out afterwards to be? A. Yes - it had hardly commenced when I got there - some of them seemed to have an altercation - I did not hear any voices - they seemed talking - I turned round, and heard a call of "Police" - I looked round again, and saw the prosecutor on the ground, and Steel striking him - he was secured without being out of my sight.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Describe what you call a lark, or altercation? A. I saw the prosecutor knocked down, and struck when on the ground; but still I thought it was a lark - it was all done in an instant.</p>
               <p>MR. DAWSON. Q. Did you see the prosecutor striking with his umbrella? A. No; but he might have done so - it was done in such a hurry - I went to his assistance when I saw Steel strike him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you in the habit of calling a man being knocked down and beat a lark? A. In that neighbourhood, there are many sprees of young men getting drunk and larking and scuffling, but not done in that way - the prosecutor was bleeding profusely from the face.</p>

             (police-constable H 43). On the night of the 13th of May, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was in Shoreditch, and saw a scuffle between three or four men - they fell in the road - I ran across the road, hearing a cry of "Police," and saw the prisoner Steele get up and run away - he was on the ground - I pursued and took him - the prosecutor and two other witnesses came up - I asked what was the matter - he was covered with blood, and said he had been knocked down and attempted to be robbed - this was in Steel's presence - Steel said nothing to it - I was going on the road to the station-house, and got a few yards when Keith came out of Holywell-lane, and was immediately recognised by two witnesses - I took him into custody also - an attempt to rescue was immediately made, by five or six; and the female prisoner was one - she hung round my neck, and round Keith's neck - she was afterwards taken into custody - the prosecutor gave me this cap at the station-house, and Keith claimed it - and again at the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far were you from the place? A. The road is fifteen or sixteen yards across - I did not see the beginning of it, till I saw them all fall in the road.</p>

I know the prisoner Seall - on the 15th of April, he came to the house and asked me to go up stairs, and ask the nurse whether she would go to Astley's play-house - I said I would go up and ask her - he came into the passage, and I shut the door - I went up three pairs of stairs - I came down again, and when within three yards of the bottom, I thought I saw the door shut as quick as lightning - the prisoner was still there - he seemed very much agitated - I told him the nurse said she could not come, and he went away - that was about half-past seven o'clock in the morning - the nurse came down stairs about eight o'clock, and went into the parlour - I went in with her - and we then discovered that a cruet-stand, knife-rests, salt-spoons, and a coat were gone - the plate was standing on the sideboard, and the coat in the parlour closet - I had seen them just before Seall came - nobody but Seall had been at the street door, before I went up stairs that morning.</p>

I neither threatened nor promised him - I cautioned him - on our way to the station-house he stated something, but in the absence of the other prisoners - he seemed very agitated, and at last said, "I had nothing to do with the robbery - I certainly did open the door, and let the parties in, and while they were removing the property I stood behind the door"- I said, "As you have stated so much, the least you can do is to offer all the reparation in your power; and if you know where the property is, tell me" - he said, "I do not know" - I apprehended Simpson at the Mischief public-house, in Oxford-street.</p>

               <p>SMITH. I have known Simpson two years I am a saddler, and live in Newton-street, Holborn - Simpson has got his living by butchering - he has had a situation - I was in his company on the 15th, from seven o'clock in the morning until five in the evening, looking after employment- I was out of employ - I was not with him in Caroline-street - I do not know it.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESSWELL. Q. Did you appear before the magistrate? A. I did; they asked me if it was the day he was taken that I was with him - I said, "Yes," thinking that was the day of the robbery - I was with him on the 13th and 14th both days - I mean the 15th and 16th, looking after work every morning - he used to call for me - I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150076"/>not see any thing of Butcher that morning - I was not with him at the Mischief - he came to meet me in Newton-street.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What time did you meet him in the morning? A. About seven, or a little after - I believe we went into the Mischief about five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. If it has been said, he was at the Mischief at seven in the morning, that must be wrong? A. I cannot be certain of the time - it might be a little after seven that he came to me - the Mischief is about three minutes' walk from Holborn.</p>

             (police-constable K 211).

Ray, Esq., lived there - there was no such person lived there - I asked if they knew the name in the street, and was told no - I inquired of two or three shopkeepers if they knew the name, nobody knew it- I afterwards was taking the prisoner from the office to the station-house, and he asked me what I thought he would be done to - I said I did not know - he then said the note was given to him yesterday, on 'Change, by a man whom he had not seen before.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the office of the Registry of shipping in the Customs - I cannot say whether there was any vessel called the Mary Ann, bound for Quebec, lying at the Union-stairs on the 1st May - I have searched the Registry for the "

             of London" - I was told to look for that - if the owner resided in London, she should be registered there - there are several Mary Ann's registered, but not with that Captain's name nor the owners - the note purports to be signed by G. Martin, master, and there is no Mary Ann registered with that name as master, nor any R. Ray as the owner - I have not seen the order before.</p>
               <p>Q. What description of vessel should you expect to find if that note was genuine? A. We should look in the London registry - it being only " R. Ray Esq., Fore-street," we infer means that he is the owner - he is not called the owner - he might be an agent - but I believe that is not usual.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the register enable you to say that the vessel does not exist? A. Presuming the vessel to belong to London - I could find no such vessel with Martin the master: but I find about two years ago there was one which was sold to the Revenue - I have made no extract from the book - I could find nothing to extract - I have searched it very carefully and could find no such vessel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did you go to look for? A. I was instructed to look for the Mary Ann; Martin, master, of the port of London, bound for Quebec - we have a general Register - I looked for her as a London vessel.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose Ray was a banker? A. I have not sufficient means of ascertaining the question - I cannot say whether these notes are ever directed to a banker - I supposed it was a London vessel from the supposition that Ray was the owner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If it was not a London vessel, have you made sufficient search to say there is no such vessel? A. No - I have searched the entrances and clearances, and could find no such vessel having entered from Petersburg, and cleared out for Quebec - I find neither an entrance nor clearance of such a vessel within the last three months.</p>

               <p>(Note read.)</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HENRY NOSS re-examined. I searched to see if the ship had cleared out on the 1st of May, and up to the 4th of May, as they do not always, sail to a day - they frequently clear and sail out the same day, or they may be a week longer than was intended - if a vessel from Petersburg discharged her cargo at Scarborough, and came in for ballast, she would not be entered in our register.</p>

               <p>2nd COUNT. For feloniously uttering a like forged order for payment of money, well knowing it to be forged with the like intent.</p>
               <p>MARY DOWSON. I live in New-street, Shadwell. On the 14th of September, the prisoner came to me and asked me to be kind enough to let her have cash for this note-she told me the ship was in the London docks, and going to sail for Demerara on the Monday morning - she said, she got it from a particular friend of hers, and I might be sure of the payment - I gave her the money - the ship was not gone, it was in the London docks - she said, the young man was going away in the ship the next day, or it might be the day after - I gave her two sovereign - I went to the docks the same night, and there was no such ship there - that was on the 14th, the day I received it - there was no such person as Large in Birchin-lane - it was said no such person lived there - I could find no such person as Large - when it was not honoured, I went to her, and she said it was all right, and I should get my money - Large is the person to whom it is addressed - I could not find him at No. 6, Birchin-lane - it is a baker's shop, instead of being a broker's - nobody had told me it was a broker's, but all these notes are on brokers - I thought the note was good when I gave her the two sovereigns for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. She came by herself, did she not? A. Yes; I did not see another woman with her - she has kept a lodging-house for sailors, but not lately - I never had notes from her before, nor had any communication with her - I know she lives in my neighbourhood - I have known her a good many years by sight, but not to have dealings with her - she did not tell me she received the note from a woman - she mentioned no woman to me - she gave me the note on the 14th of September, and said the ship was to sail next morning - when the pilots came back from the ship they brought the account from the Downs - they always bring a note for the broker to pay the money - I went and found there was no such ship or broker- I found out there was no such ship that very day, by going to the docks the night I received it from her - I could not take any steps to have her apprehended till the latter end of the week following, when the pilots came from the Downs; I then went to find the broker.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150078"/>Q. When you found it was all wrong, why not have her instantly taken up? A. She had a large family, and it was not till somebody else made a complaint, and her insolent tongue to me, I got a policeman and had her taken - I did not go about with her to find a woman named Hall - I gave her 2l. - the amount of the note was 2l. 5s., but these notes are never paid for a week or fortnight, or perhaps a month- I do not deal in them - if the sailors go in the ships, they are paid the same as bankers pay their notes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is a note of this sort ever paid before the person sails? A. They are given for the seamen to get their sea stock before they go - if it had been a genuine note, and I had taken it to the broker's, he would not have paid it till the ship had sailed, and the pilot came from the Downs - I did not go for a week after to find the broker - they do not pay them till they have an order from the captain from the Downs, and a certificate that the men are on board.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. How many of these notes have you cashed? A. Very few - I believe she said the young man had lived with her, but she did not have a lodger then, because she had only one room - nothing was said about Mrs. Hall - I called on her at different times to pay the note, because she promised she would pay me; but she never would - she did not go out of the way - she was taken into custody on another charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told her he was a lodger of mine - she asked where the man was - I said at the King's Arms - she went there and partook of some beer and gin with the man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did she produce to you any young man who she said belonged to it? A. There was a young man in the public-house - she did not take me there, but I went there - she pointed out to the man from whom she said she had it; but when I told her of that months ago, she said that was not the man - he was not a seaman in appearance - she called him Henry Brown, but his name is Plumkett - he never spoke - the two sovereigns were paid in the public-house - the prisoner took it up - the man was present - she did not hand it to him; and he was not the man, for I knew him - he was a neighbour of mine - it was

            ; but I did not then know he was not the man - I knew his name - she was sitting in the public-house - I went in while she was there - a man was sitting by her - I gave her the money - she said that was her friend; but that was Henry Plunkett - I knew that at the time - I did not think she was going to deceive me - I went to the public-house, because I wanted change for a £5 note - she had told me the man of whom she had it, was in the public-house.</p>

On the 26th of December, I let the prisoner part of the house No. 2, (the shop, bakehouse, and first floor,) according to an agreement - she was to be responsible for any damage done to the fixtures, or the loss of them - and either party were at liberty to put an end to the agreement, by giving three months' notice in writing - I gave her notice to quit on the 24th of March - the rent was 30l. a-year, and 6l. for the use of the chattels and fixtures, to be used on the premises - that was settled verbally, by one or two witnesses - the business of baking was to be carried on, but there was not a loaf baked on the premises since she has been there - she is still in possession - about the 15th of April, I found some of the property I let to her was missing, and I gave her into custody - when I took the officer in, she asked what it was for - I told her she would know that before the magistrate - she said at the office that she had lent the things to Mr. Thorn.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Then she herself mentioned Mr. Thorn's name to you? A. She did, at Worship-street - I have taken the benefit of the Insolvent Act - I was in prison for liabilities not my own - I received 9l. in advance from the prisoner up to the 25th of March last, she is to pay a quarter's rent in advance - I do not mean to say it is stated so in the agreement, but I understood so - I read the agreement hastily - her time would be out next quarter-day - she was to take the tenant's fixtures at a fair valuation, if she thought proper.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did she ever intimate to you any desire to take them? A. No.</p>

            . On the 23rd of January, I purchased of the prisoner two peels, six tins, a scale beam, two scales and weights, and a sieve, which she told me belonged to her husband - she said she had plenty of things to dispose<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150076"/>of, but they were put away with a friend of hers, as she was afraid the landlord where she lived before, would take them for rent - she said she was not going to carry on the trade, if I would serve her with bread - I went to the place, and did serve her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you brought any action against her? A. Yes, for a debt for bread and flour - I bear her no ill-will - I did not pay her for these things - they were to be set off - her son came to me for an iron peel, but that is not connected with these things.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were you? A. At the door, cleaning the window - there was no one in the shop - he did not conceal this - there was a pile of boxes before him - he did not cut off a random piece - he measured it with the stick - I do not think there was a carpenter at work.</p>

            . I was sent for to take the prisoner- the silk was found in my presence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I deny any felonious intention of appropriating it to my own use - it is the custom of our trade for a shopman to have any goods he may want - it is immaterial whether it is measured by yourself or any one else - I can bring two witnesses who will swear that I showed them a piece of silk on the Thursday before, and on the Monday I ascertained what quantity I wanted - the value of a young man depends on his knowing his business, with regard to leaving such a length of silk as may be of benefit to his employer - I said to one of my witnesses that if I cut three yards off one of the pieces, it would be an injury, as it would leave but eleven yards, which would be an unsaleable length - it is not likely if I had wished to appropriate this to my own use that I should take the measure and cut it off - the carpenter stood close to me when I cut it off, but I have not been able to procure him - he said to me, "Shall I remove, Sir, am I in your way?" - I said"No, not at all" - there were boards on the counter, but they did not conceal me at all - this boy has had an animosity against me for a fortnight before - he cannot deny that on the Wednesday or Thursday before, he was very saucy, and I told him I would box his ears - he continued his impertinence, and I took hold of his ears, but did not hurt him - his father came there that day - I told him, and he desired me to correct him at any time - on the morning this happened, he was very sancy, while he was on the steps - I was obliged to tell him to do the windows over again - he said Mr. Withers, who was my predecessor, never told him to do it, and he would not - I said he was very saucy, and if it were not that I should have to pay for the glass, I would knock him off the steps; and when I went to breakfast he said I had been cutting off silk, and not entered it- it is only spite and malice that has induced this charge by him - all that I have had has been entered, both cash and goods.</p>

On the 8th of April the prisoner had some stockings and some ribbon for his own use, at a low price, and Mrs. Gardner entered them in the book - I think it was about the same time the prisoner told me he wanted a piece of silk for some bonnets - I told him it would take three yards to make two bonnets, which I understood he wanted - he brought two pieces to me, and said one was fourteen yards long, and he asked if I thought two yards would do for the bonnets, as it would leave twelve yards, which would make a dress - I told him I thought it would require three yards - he said he thought he should have it, but he did not say what quantity - I never entered things- I never knew any one to have things when Mrs. Gardner was not there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he tell you he had cut off three yards? A. No. He never desired me to enter it to him.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you say to her? A. I asked if she knew any thing of a sheet - she said she and the housemaid had had it made into under garments - the ring she stated the housemaid had taken and given it to my groom to pawn, and when he brought the money they had divided it - the policeman took her to the station, and I locked her bed-room door - in the evening, I had her box brought down to the room where my wife was ill in bed - I found in the box some towels and this handkerchief, which are my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What was it she said about the sheet? A. That she and the housemaid had had it made into chemises; and one was marked in her name and one in the housemaid's - the policeman was there at the time - I did not desire her to tell the truth, to my recollection - self, the housemaid, slept in the room where the prisoner's box was - self was a witness at the police-office, and then returned to my house for a short time - I did not go to the house with her - I do not know whether self had a key to the room where the box was; she might, but it is not probable - Self has run away because she was frightened, as the magistrate said that at the next examination he should place her in the same situation - she gave me no notice of going - I have included her in the indictment, at the suggestion of the magistrate - I have no doubt of her dishonesty - I think she left the day the prisoner was charged with the robbery, or early the next morning- I had not searched her boxes - she took her boxes away with her - the officer has searched for her - the prisoner's box had been left in the room - the box was not locked, but the room door was - Self had made a communication to Mrs. Broackes, which induced me to go for the policeman- the prisoner did not know that there was an investigation going on - Self had access to the room where the prisoner's box was, after she made the communication to her mistress - the officer searched the prisoner's boxes in my presence - I do not recollect whether any thing was found in it then - I really do not recollect - on the second search, these towels and handkerchief were found - the prisoner was then in custody - I cannot tell whether any thing was found on the first search, but my impression is there was not.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. When did you first charge her with it? A. About ten o'clock in the morning in the presence of the officer: her box was then searched - I cannot tell whether any thing was found, but it was impossible for me to examine it to know what belonged to my family - I then locked the room door - the box was searched again in the presence of Mrs. Broackes - I locked the door till she was in a state to see the box - the key was not out of my possession - I do not think Self had access to the room at that time.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ever say to any body that, in consequence of Mr. Humphries and myself not accommodating you to take this case out of its turn, you would say more against the prisoner than you should have done? A. I did not, Sir; nor any thing to that effect - I said, I did not come here with any vindictive feeling; that I had been repeatedly robbed by servants; and that I only wanted to make an example of one of them, to prevent a recurrence of these things - I told her father that I had intended to recommend her to mercy, but after the treatment I had received, I should not do so.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the person you sold them to here? A.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Self tell you of her intending to run away? A. No - I thought the ring was the prisoner's - I gave all the money to Self - she gave me 6d. for myself - she said, "Jane says you are to have this 6d., and you may keep the duplicate, as the ring is too small for her finger" - I did not tell the magistrate that I got the 6d., but he was told - I told my master about this after Self was gone - I had been at the police-office once before, to take a man there for breaking my nose: and I was taken there once, but I was discharged; it was because I was walking by a gate when a robbery was committed - the boy's name was Clewes - I was in custody two days - the boy had two months for it - it was for stealing pigeons.</p>

On the 8th of May, I had nine napkins, some stockings, and an apron in my boiler - they are my husband's property - I saw them safe at eleven o'clock that night, and I missed them in the morning as soon as I got up - I went to the prisoner Scholey's shop on the 9th of May - I asked if she had any napkins - she said she had none, and had not bought any - she denied it to me and the officer for a long time, and at last she said, "If I give up the property, would you wish to make a confusion?" - I said, "No" - the officer then said, "I think you have got this person's property, give it up" - and then she found these napkins - they had been marked, but the marks have been taken out - she said she bought them of a boy whom she did not know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where they had any marks when they were brought to her you do not know? A. No; they were marked when I had them in my copper; but I know them - I have washed them many times.</p>

             (police-constable C 120). I was on duty on the 9th of May, and the prisoner Stockman came, and said he wished to give himself up to me, as the officers were after him - I asked what for? - he said, he had found a bundle, and some people said he had stolen it - I took him to the station, and, from information, I went to Scholey's house to look for some stockings - while I was looking for them, the prosecutor came in to inquire for some napkins - Scholey said she had none - I said I thought she had- she went into the back-room, took some things off a chest, and pulled out one napkin, she then pulled out the others.</p>

            . I was at the public-house that morning - I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor drinking together, seemingly in a very friendly way - the prisoner sat between me and the prosecutor - I saw her putting something into her breast, and two young men who were there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150084"/>said he had lost his watch - I put my hand in her bosom, and took out the watch, and gave it to the landlord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you come to me, and say that the prosecutor was very sorry, and he thought he might have given me the watch? A. No; I said, if I could do you any service I should be glad.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Was the prosecutor aware that you went to the prison? A. Yes, he went with me to tell her he would do all the justice to her he could - two or three of her friends in the neighbourhood have met me, and threatened to do me some injury - some women have told me if I went much further, the consequences would be very bad with me - I came to the gaol on Friday morning, and told the prisoner not to make any thing to do about me, nor to raise any false reports about me - the prisoner's associates knew me by seeing her going to the watch-house that morning and seeing me there - I did not hear the prosecutor say any thing about the prisoner keeping his watch for him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What friends of mine are they that have annoyed you? A. I do not know who they are - two or three have come to the court-door, and said, "I know you very well" - I said, "I have not come to do any harm, but public justice."</p>
