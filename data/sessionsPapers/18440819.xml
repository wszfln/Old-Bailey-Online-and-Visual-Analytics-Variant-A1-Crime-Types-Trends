                  </hi>. I have been an officer fifty-one years—I was a cadet in June, 1790. On the 20th of June I lodged at No. 19, Bury-street, St. James's, my family being in Hampshire—I had been at Offley's, in Henrietta-street, and was returning home about half-past ten o'clock at night—I was passing down Hemming's-row, on the north side, and the prisoner came up to me—until then I had not seen him at all—I never had any communication with him either that evening or at any other period in my life—he was dressed in uniform—he endeavoured to whisper to me, and stooped—I rather drew back, and did not hear distinctly what he said—I think he uttered some words—he then asked me what hour it was—I replied I did not know exactly, but it was past ten o'clock—he two or three times attempted to whisper again, but I always drew back, and continued on my way home—I went through Green-street, Leicester-square, Panton-street, into Jermyn-street—I found he was following me and did not choose he should know where I lived—I turned round and said, "Which way are you going, for I am going in the opposite direction"—I turned back from going towards my lodgings, and came into the Haymarket, and began to inquire for a policeman—I turned into Piccadilly, and seeing a cigar shop, I went and asked where I could find a policeman—he was then looking in at the window—they told me where to find a policeman, and as I left the shop door a young man who I had never seen before took me by the arm, and said, "Sir, I will protect you"—I proceeded down the Haymarket towards my lodging—I observed to the young man, "This is the way to my lodg<lb/>ing; I don't wish the man to know where I live"—he turned round and said to the prisoner, "What do you mean by annoying this <hi rend="italic">gentleman</hi>?"—he said, "I know what I mean "—I returned to the Haymarket, and there were two or three empty <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> near the curb-stone—the young man said, "Get into one of the <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>, and you will get away from him"—I said, "Not for a thousand pounds, if he had met with a young man he might frighten him, he will not frighten me, I will go through it and have him punished"—when we came to Regent-circus I saw a policeman, and said, "This young man has been annoying me"—the prisoner ran up and said, "I charge this person with making an indecent assault on my person"—he said that it was in Orange-street, at an accommodation place for making water—he used those words either in Regent-street or at the police office—I had not been in an accommodation place that evening with the prisoner or any person—he said, he was making water in one place and I in the other, that I bent round and put my hand on his private parts—so help me God there is not a syllable of truth in that—I was then taken into custody—Ioffered bail, and he was sent away with a letter to his commanding officer—I was brought next day before</p>

               <p>but I could not distinguish what she said, and Mr. Belaney's also—at about a quarter or twenty minutes to eight I was called to the room by the prisoner—he said, "Mistress, mistress, come up here, my wife is very ill"—I went up immediately—the prisoner was then at the bed-room door, which was open—my servant and I both entered at once—the foot of the bed comes to the right hand as you go in, a chest of drawers stands on the left hand, and behind the drawers are folding doors, that open into the sitting-room—when you pass the foot of the bed and turn to the right to go up to the side of it, there is a washhand-stand in a recess facing you, the recess is between the chimney and the window—there is a small table and chair near the head of bed on that side—when I and the servant went in I saw Mrs. Belaney lying on the bed—the bed-clothes were all thrown up against the wall—she had no cap on, nothing but her sleeping gown—I said when I entered the room, "She is very bad indeed, sir," and I immediately went to the head of the bed—she was lying quite motionless—she only breathed from her chest—her eyes were shut, and her teeth appeared closed—she was foam<lb/>ing a good deal from the mouth, and with it some fine biscuit, chewed biscuit—I went up to the head of the bed, raised her up, placed her head on my shoulder, and supported her with my arm—the prisoner was standing close beside me, between me and the fire-place—I said, "She is bad indeed, I have seen many fits—I have seen my dear girls in fits before this, but I never saw fits like this"—the prisoner answered that she had had fits—I asked if she had been subject to fits—he said she had had fits before, but not like them, she would not come out of it—I said, "What do you mean, will she not come to?"—I said, "Do something, sir, do some<lb/>thing"—he did not answer, and I said, "Do something, pray do something, send for a doctor, pray send for a doctor"—he said, "I am a doctor myself, I should have let blood before, but she has no pulse"—he had a lancet in his hand, but before that I had sent my servant down for the foot-pail with hot water, and she then came into the room with it—I said, "I do not care, sir, if you are a doctor; two heads are better than one; send for a doctor, send for your friends, send for Captain Clark and Mrs. M'Eachern, send for somebody"—he said, "Send for them"—I sent the girl immediately—before the girl was sent, he said, "She will not come to, this is an affection of the heart; her mother died like this nine months ago"—I put my hand on her heart to feel—I could not feel it beat at all—the only sign of life she exhi<lb/>bited was a convulsion from here (the chest)—the throat was drawn towards the mouth—(<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—her mouth was closed—the phlegm appeared to have a trouble to come—it came all over my face two or three times—in the force of coming it splashed all over my face by this convulsion—Captain Clark lives seventeen doors off—the girl returned alone—Mrs. M'Eachern was not up—the girl was followed soon after by Mrs. M'Eachern—while the girl was gone, I was still holding the deceased, and kept urging the prisoner to do something—I put my hand on her stomach, and told him I thought it very much swollen, and he then told me she was pregnant—the girl and the prisoner put her feet in warm water—he assisted in doing that—after the girl returned, I desired some vinegar and water to be fetched—she brought it up directly—the prisoner took the pail of water from her feet, placed it on the middle of the bed, and put both her hands into it—I complained that the heat of her head was very great, took some of the vinegar and put it on her head—I said, "Send for somebody again; why does not Captain Clark come?"—the girl said, "I did not ask for Captain Clark, only for Mrs. M'Eachern"—I then said, "Run for Captain Clark then"—he was sent for—when he came, he called for a clothes-brush immediately, and began to rub her legs—I sent the girl down</p>

               <p>for a mustard poultice—it was brought, and placed across her chest—I think Captain Clark did it—she died, as near as I can tell, about twenty minutes after I came into the room—I did not look at the clock—she gasped twice before Captain Clark came—the prisoner was in the room from the time I went in till she died—when Mrs. M'Eachern came into the room, Mr. Garrett, the medical man, was lent for—Mrs. M'Eachern came in before she died—directly she came in, I begged of her to fetch a doctor, and motioned my head to her to be quick—she said, "Who shall I fetch?"—she fetched Mr. Garrett—he lived some distance off—he did not arrive till some time after her death—I asked the prisoner what she had taken that morning—he said, "Only a little salts"—I saw a small tumbler close to the head of the bed, on the table—it was one-third full—it was clear, but whiter than water—there was an empty tumbler at the other side of the table—there was a paper of Epsom salts and a tea-spoon—there was no bottle, tumbler, or anything of the sort, on the drawers—I did not notice the appearance of any broken glass about the room—I did not perceive any smell of any particular kind in the room at any time—after she was dead, the prisoner gave Mrs. M'Eachern a phial full of laven<lb/>der water, and she sprinkled the room—I went into the front parlour that morning, soon after she died—I noticed on the table a letter folded, ready for the post, and another letter partly written—there was no bottle or phial in the room—the phial in which the black draught bad been contained had been brought down on Thursday by my servant—I saw it on the kitchen dresser, and desired it to remain there—the rooms are rather small—there is a table and chair in the bed-room, which filled up from the bedstead to the recess, and answered for the washhand-stand—the drawers are the height of a table—when you are in one of the rooms, you can hear what takes place in the other.</p>

                  </hi>. I was servant to Mrs. Heppingstall, when Mr. and Mrs. Belaney came to lodge there—I waited on them on the Thursday evening when Captain Clark and Mrs. M'Eachern supped there, I attended during supper—they had salmon for supper—Mrs. Belaney partook of it—there was a piano in the room—Mrs. Belaney played on it in the course of the evening—she appeared in good spirits, and in very good health indeed—I waited on them on the Friday in the usual way—they went to the Tunnel in the afternoon—they came home about half-past two, stopped at home about half an hour, went out again, and came home about half-past nine in the evening—when they went out in the afternoon I did not hear them say where they were going—they had no supper when they returned—they retired to rest about ten o'clock—on Saturday morning, about five minutes before seven, the prisoner rang the bell, and asked for a jug of hot water, a tumbler, and a spoon—I gave it him—I went into the parlour, and be took them into the bed-room—he was dressed—he did not go out at all after that—about half-past seven I was dusting the parlour—he told me not to do so, for he was going to write—he came into the parlour from the bed-room—I went out—I saw him get the materials for writing—he got the paper and laid it down on the table to begin to write—I did not see him begin to write—he said he would not have the breakfast up, when he wanted it he would ring—I left the room—about twenty minutes to eight I heard him call out, "Mistress, mistress, my wife is very ill"—I was in the kitchen with my mistress—I had not heard the least noise before I heard him call—on hearing him call, I and my mistress went up stairs directly—we went into the bed-room immediately—the prisoner went in with us—Mrs. Belaney was lying on the bed—her cap was off, and her hair was hanging about her head—the bed clothes were right off of her—she was lying straight on her back—she did not appear to be sensible—she had not got her eyes open, or her mouth either—she was foaming very much at the mouth—she was not moving at all only about her neck and head—I and my mistress raised her up in the bed—the prisoner felt her pulse, and said he would use the lancet, only he was afraid her pulse was gone—I went down and fetched some hot water, and the prisoner helped to wash her feet with the hot water, with his hand—he wanted some more hot water, and was going to fetch it himself I got it—he then sluiced her hands, took the pail, and put her hands into it—I went down, got some vinegar, and put it over her face, and across her forehead—he sluiced her face with it—I cannot say who sent me for the vine<lb/>gar—I think it was my mistress—after that I went down for Mrs. M'Eachern—she came shortly after, and Captain Clark too—Mrs. M'Eachern went for Mr. Garrett—when I went into the room I noticed a tumbler on the table, it was a tooth glass, it was about half full of stuff, rather white and rather thick—I did not see any other tumbler—the water-bottle was on the washhand-stand, that was not very far from the bed—it could not be reached from the bed—I did not take notice where the jug of hot water was that I had taken up that morning—I did not take down the small tumbler that I saw—the con<lb/>tents were thrown away when the glass was washed—I did not take down any other tumbler—after Mrs. Belaney was dead, she was laid out,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in New-road, St. George's. On Saturday morning, the 8th of June, about half-past eight o'clock, I was called by Mrs. M'Eachern to attend on Mrs. Belaney—I live full a mile from the house, probably more than that—when I arrived at the house, Mrs. Belaney was dead—I made a general examination of the deceased, and remarked that the death was very sudden, and I could only account for it by supposing she had died of disease of the heart—the prisoner said he was of the same opinion; that her mother had died of disease of the heart some months before—I inquired whether she had taken any medicine that morning—he said she had merely taken some salts—I called Captain Clark into the front room—the prisoner came in shortly afterwards by my desire—I told him it would be necessary there should be an inquiry into the cause of death, it was so sudden—he said if I thought it necessary—he begged me to take the usual steps on such an occasion—an inquest was afterwards held—I at<lb/>tended it—it was on Monday in the forenoon—it was adjourned for the pur<lb/>pose of a post-mortem examination—I assisted in the examination, about four o'clock on the Monday afternoon, in company with Mr. Curling of the Lon<lb/>don Hospital—we found the whole of the organs generally healthy, and in the stomach we found about a pint of fluid, or nearly so, strongly impregnated with the odour of prussic acid—the fluid was put into a bottle, and sealed, in the presence of Mr. Curling and myself—it was taken to the London Hospital, and has since been examined by an analytical chemist—between eight and nine o'clock the prisoner called at my house with Captain Clark and Mr. Hobson—(the first time he called I was absent)—Captain Clark first inquired as to the state of his daughter, and then he inquired if we had ascertained the cause of Mrs. Belaney's death—I told him that we (meaning Mr. Curling and myself) had not finished our consultation—about ten o'clock that same evening the prisoner called on me again with Captain Clark and Mr. Hobson—the prisoner then made a statement to me—he said, "On the Saturday morning I was about to take some prussic acid, which I had been in the habit of taking for an affection of the stomach, and on endeavouring to remove the stopper from the bottle I had some difficulty; I used some force with the handle of a tooth-brush, and, in consequence of breaking the neck of the bottle by the force, some of the acid was spilt; the remainder I put into a tumbler, and placed it on the drawers at the end of the bed-room; I went into the front room for the purpose of obtaining a bottle wherein to place the acid; instead of doing so I began to write to my friends in the country; I had been there but a few minutes when I heard a scream from the bed-room; I immediately went in; my wife exclaimed, 'Oh dear, I have taken some of that hot drink, give me some cold water,' and she immediately became convulsed;" that was the chief of the conversation—I inquired what he had done with the bottle—he said he had destroyed it, made away with it in some vacant place in the immediate neighbourhood—I asked him why he had not mentioned it before—he said that he was so distressed in his mind, and so annoyed with himself, and so ashamed, that he had not, and he was very sorry he had not communicated it earlier to me—the cause of the deceased's death was decidedly the prussic acid—if prussic acid is spilt on the floor, and some of it poured into a tumbler, there will be a smell in a room for some time, a peculiar smell, as of bitter</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184408190021"/>
               <p>almonds—the sensation is immediately perceived in the throat, at least it is so with myself; I have a peculiar bitter taste in the throat, as it were—that would be the case if a large quantity was spilt and became diffused through the room—I did not observe any peculiar smell of that kind when I went into the house—if half an ounce were spilt it would have that effect, if the room was closed—the window was open—I do not think it was much open, but I am not clear on that point—by letting in the external air I think the smell of the acid would be considerably weakened, and I think it possible that a per<lb/>son might not perceive it—I am not acquainted with the symptoms or effects of a poisonous dose of prussic acid—I am acquainted with it as a medicinal agent, but not as a poison—I know what are the proper remedies or re<lb/>storatives to be applied where a person has taken prussic acid—they are required to be well known in the medical profession—stimulants are the proper remedies, brandy, or any stimulus indeed; if you have not brandy at hand, whisky, gin, or wine, dashing cold water in the face, the smell of ammonia, hartshorn applied to the nostrils, and artificial respiration; those are the principal—I should consider that putting the feet and hands in warm wa<lb/>ter, or a mustard poultice would be a loss of time—I do not think it can be considered an improper remedy; it would be of very little use—bleeding may be occasionally necessary; but, as I have just stated, I have had no experience of the acid as a poison.</p>

               <p>contents of the stomach were placed in a tumbler—the tumbler was covered with a bladder, and carried away by us to the hospital—I opened it the following morning, and delivered it to Dr. Leatheby—the contents were tested in my presence the following morning, at the hospital, by Dr. Leatheby, and was found to contain prussic acid—at that time no attempt was made to ascertain the quantity—whilst the analysis was proceeding I received a com<lb/>munication from Mr. Garrett of the prisoner's acknowledgment, therefore we took it for granted—the quantity was subsequently examined.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you judge from what you saw and smelt whether the quantity was sufficient to produce death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That would be very deceptive—the subsequent test would ascertain that—the quantity that would be fatal varies very much in different constitutions, and under different circumstances, but as small a quantity as twenty drops of Scheele's dilution has destroyed life—I do not say it would be fatal, but it has been—the remedies to be used on such an occasion as this would be cold affusion, ammonia, artificial respiration—spi<lb/>rits or any stimulant would be important if you have not ammonia—I should say this poison takes effect immediately on the brain—that would destroy sensation, and the respiration would be affected subsequently—it takes effect immediately—I should say immersing the feet and hands in warm water would be of no avail in such a case—a mustard poultice across the chest would not of itself be an inappropriate remedy, but in a case of such a nature as poisoning from prussic acid nothing but an energetic stimulant would be really of any avail—I never met with a case of poisoning by prussic acid either fatal or which recovered—I have not seen experiments performed on the lower animals with prussic acid of late years—formerly I have seen ani<lb/>mals destroyed by prussic acid—after the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination had taken place I saw the prisoner—he was in the adjoining room—he inquired of me what I believed to be the cause of death—I said that we had not concluded our inquiries, when we had done so I should be very happy to inform him.</p>

               <p>in lecturing in the chemical department, as well as that of <hi rend="italic">materia medica</hi>—I have made chemistry my particular study—I have frequently made experi<lb/>ments of the effect of prussic acid—the first effect, after taking a strong, or over-dose, is that of a peculiar giddiness in the lower animals, a disposition generally to run round, as if the head was affected; then the respiration be<lb/>comes rather uncertain and irregular; subsequently, there is a scream, or pro<lb/>bably before the scream, the animal drops; at that moment there are two or three violent expiratory efforts, which generally produce a cry, a noise, a shriek; convulsions occur; they foam at the mouth, and in a longer or shorter time, die: the time depends on the strength and quantity of the acid—I have never had an opportunity of seeing the effect on any person—after the shriek or scream there does not appear to be any volition—volition and sensibility have ceased—in my judgment, after the uttering of that shriek, a person cer<lb/>tainly could not be able to walk or converse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What are the proper remedies to be applied in a case where prussic acid has been taken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The first remedy being that which is most usually close at hand, is dashing cold water over the face; that is a remedy publicly taught in all the schools, and contained in every medical work, and I presume every medical man knows it—I should immediately apply ammonia, or harts-horn, to the nose, give brandy, or stimulants of any kind, of that sort—in my judgment, immersing the feet or hands in warm water would not be useful in the least—it would not operate as an active stimulant, or anything of the sort—the application of a mustard poultice to the chest would not be of any service till all the mischief was done, for its effects would not come on for many minutes; stimulants that are active enough to rouse the energy immediately would be essential—mustard poultice is too long acting to be of any avail, it should be a sudden and immediately active stimulant—I have been in Court to-day, and have heard the account of the state in which the lady was discovered—I should think remedies could have been applied, which would lead me to suppose she might have recovered—I should continue to use those remedies for at least half or three-quarters of an hour—supposing a person to remain breathing for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, there would be much better hopes of her recovery, and I should continue the remedies for a longer time—I was called upon to analyse the contents of the stomach—I did so, I think on Tuesday, the 11th of June—I discovered, at the first analysis, the presence of prussic acid—I made a second analysis, on receiving a summons from the Coroner on the Thursday following, I think—I then discovered the presence of Epsom salts—the means of analysis which enabled me to discover the presence of prussic acid would not enable me to discover the presence of Epsom salts—I should have to go through an entirely different analysis to detect the presenc.</p>

               <p>death and the examination, I procured some prussic acid from Mr. Donahoo—it is called Scheele's, but it is not Scheele's strength—there was rather more than two per cent, of pure prussic acid in it—I have analysed that, merely to ascertain the quantity of prussic acid in it—I have experimented with this very acid, and find there is an odour from it—I threw half a tea-spoonful about rather a large room, and the odour remained for nearly an hour—sup<lb/>posing acid to be poured into a glass, and taken immediately, there would be a slight odour, but a current in the room would drive it away in a few minutes, any means that would produce a little current in the room, it matters not how it is done—supposing half an ounce of prussic acid of this description to be poured into a glass, and left in the room, it would certainly emit an odour—I have since made experiments on animals with the prussic acid I got from Donahoo, and have tried to restore those animals by cold affusion, and the application of ammonia merely—one animal, a cat, was restored in the course of ten minutes—I had given it about sixteen or twenty minumums of the acid I got from Donahoo—I think I gave very nearly as much as twenty—it was dropped into the mouth—I merely guess at the quantity, it was not half a tea-spoon<lb/>ful—I restored the cat by the cold affusion and ammonia—I gave a horse about a table-spoonful of acid, twelve times the strength of this, which would be equal to twelve table-spoonfuls, or six ounces of this two per cent. acid—I restored the horse—it was on the ground in convulsions, in the incipient stage of death—all the symptoms I have stated had occurred to the horse before I applied the remedies—I continued the remedies, I think, about twenty minutes, before the animal was restored—I merely dashed cold water over the horse's head, and put a little ammonia to the nostrils—ammonia exists, I think, in every house, in the shape of smelling salts—I am referring to common smelling salts—I did not try any experiment on any animal that I brought to life merely by artificial respiration, in reference to this particular case—I have done it in former cases frequently—I presume the mode of pro<lb/>ducing artificial respiration is known among medical men—it should be known—it is publicly taught—it is one of the first things taught.</p>

                  </hi>. I am professor of medical jurisprudence, at the London University. My attention has been for some time directed to chemistry—among other things to the properties of hydrocyanic acid, and its effects on the system—I have been present during the examination of the witnesses, and have heard the account given of the state in which Mrs. Belaney was found—accord<lb/>ing to my judgment they are the symptoms hydrocyanic acid would produce, but they might also be the result of any powerful sedative poison—there is a peculiar smell in hydrocyanic acid—it is extremely difficult to give a name to the smell of acids—it is peculiar to itself—it has been described as the smell of the bloom of a peach, or bitter almonds, but in my judgment that is a mistake—the smell is very peculiar—if any was spilled on the ground, the odour would continue a considerable time, unless much movement is made in the air of the room, and the room has a free draft—if poured into a tumbler the smell will remain a considerable time in the. room—if the tumbler was taken up to the lips, the smell would be strong to the nostrils—if a quantity sufficient to produce death was taken, the first effect would be a sensation of giddiness, followed by faintness, a peculiar uneasiness about the chest, vertigo, giddi<lb/>ness, the falling down of the patient, sometimes a sound somewhat like a shriek, insensibility, loss of volition, convulsions resembling those of tetanus, (which is a disease accompanied frequently with locked jaw,) and death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the symptoms have advanced to what you describe, as a shriek, or scream, in what state are the powers of sensation, or volition? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Com<lb/>pletely gone—it would not be possible in my judgment after that scream, for a party to talk, or speak, or give any account of what had happened—the re<lb/>storatives ought to be well known to medical men—they are the subjects of lectures, and books—they are stimulants of various kinds, ammonia, brandy, or any stimulant—chlorine diluted with water, and applied in the form of vapour, and also given internally, ammonia in various forms, dashing cold water on the face, head, and chest, and artificial respiration—I have tried the effect of these remedies on animals—I have administered hydrocyanic acid—I have not tried merely the cold affusion alone—I have tried chlorine, ammonia, and artificial respiration—I have not known cases in which artificial respiration alone has been effectual—putting the feet and hands in warm water would be of no use—a mustard poultice to the chest might stimulate a little, but the effect would be too slow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose prussic acid had been taken, and the party continued to breathe for twenty minutes, in your judgment, if the proper restoratives had been applied would there be a chance of recovery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The probabilities would be in favour of recovery—bleeding has been applied in strong plethoric people, but I believe has no beneficial effects.</p>

               <p>(No. 1.) "Euston Hotel, London, June 5, 1844. Dear Sir,—We arrived here yesterday evening, safe and sound, although to-day, I am sorry to say, Mrs. Belaney is rather unwell. The fatigue of travelling such a distance, no doubt, to a constitution delicate like hers, was sure to tell a little upon her; and I think her spirit, to bear up and carry all before her, has been greater than her strength was equal to. However, I trust that in a day or two, after a good rest, she will be all right again, and we will be able to proceed to Arlington, to my brother's. She does not think very much of what, as yet, she has seen of London. That is easy to be accounted for, she being not over well on the one hand to enjoy anything, and, on the other, having seen almost nothing of interest but crowded streets. I hope all goes on well with you. As today I leave this hotel, and, as I will be moving about from place to place, you had better direct my letters to a bookseller's, who I have arranged with to receive and forward them to me wherever I may be. His address is, 'Mr. Hobson, bookseller, Commercial-road-east, London.' This, with my name, will find me, and I shall either call every day at the shop for my letters, or he will send them to me. If there be anything of importance requiring my consideration, you may mention it, and I shall make as little delay over it as possible. In haste, yours truly, J. C. Belaney. P. S.—The hotel ink is hardly to be surpassed by a Sunderland beer-shop."</p>
               <p>(No. 2.)—"London, June 8, 1844. Dear Mr. Bell,—I have little else to write to the north about at the present than to give you (who, I know, are all interested in it) a very unhappy account of Rachael's state. I have had her removed from the hotel to private lodgings, where, with two medical attend<lb/>ants, she remains dangerously ill. Symptoms of premature labour came on a few days ago; but what is still worse, one of the medical men pronounces the heart to be diseased. Of this I had some dread myself. This will alter my former plans greatly; but, if she be spared, that will be every thing. Hoping you are all well, I must in haste conclude, yours sincerely,—<hi rend="smallCaps">J. C.

As such could not be done at the quarry and lime works without great inconvenience to the partnership, I shall not desire the same there. I am hardly able to sit up; but hope to be able to write to-morrow more particulars. As her death has occurred chiefly among strangers and so suddenly, an inquest and post mortem exami<lb/>nation will be held. This has been mentioned to me. Of course I do not object to it.—Yours sincerely, <hi rend="smallCaps">J. C. BELANEY</hi>."</p>

               <p>Dear Mr. Bell,—I intended writing to you an account of what had happened to my dear Rachael, through my infatuity or inadvertency, and to myself; but at present am unable to do so. I have written Hall a sort of account of it, which I wish you to go immediately to peruse and consult with him what to do. Oh! what is this come upon me like a thunderbolt? I did not men<lb/>tion the cause of her death to you before, through a desire to bury the shame and avoid the public reproach for my fatal neglect. Yet I know well you can account for it under such circumstances; but, oh God! I can never forgive myself. I would like you to call upon Mr. Simpson, and give him the particulars of what I have given of the awful occurrence. Lose not a moment in getting for Mr. Darnel testimony of my marriage from Bamborough, and post it to Mr. Clark, 17, King-street, Stepney, London."</p>
               <p>(No. 5.)—"June, 1844. My dear Mr. Bell,—By the time this reaches you, you will have learned from Hall's letter, and my communication yester<lb/>day, the awful cause of my loss; and you, well I know, can and will feel for me. O God! what a visitation comes upon me, like a thunderbolt shot down upon me in the midst of my happiness. Alas! where are all my sum<lb/>mer arrangements gone with my dear Rachael? But I cannot write. You shall hear from me immediately. To meet the next payments go to Thew for the price of the wheat. I will arrange for your supplies. Let no one in<lb/>terrupt you in your usual course. I have legal advice to direct and go through the case for me. I wrote a few lines for Captain Clark to direct him to write you, giving instruction for you to go on with the business as usual, and where to apply to for money to meet the pay. I did not think of writing you at that time; but have now done so. Besides several other friends who are coming up, and who have known me for some time, I should like to see Mr. Hunt of Belford. Do go and tell him what has hap<lb/>pened, and that I should like him to come up immediately to say what he knows of me. Mr. Hancock and several others have arrived. Tell him, for God's sake, to come off immediately. I will pay all expenses. I must have a few respectable friends to come forward to establish my character and say what they know of me. Oh, God! I know not what I am doing or saying. Tell him I shall pay every expense. When he comes he must call at Hob<lb/>son's, bookseller, Commercial-road East, London, or at 17, King-street, Stepney, London, at Mr. Clark's. Yours ever, in haste, <hi rend="smallCaps">J. C.

               <p>(No. 6.)—Post marks, 14th and 15th June—"London, June, 1844. Dear Hall,—Oh! I am distracted. I cannot write, nor do anything. I have lost my dear Rachel; and, what makes the loss so much the worse, it was caused by my own neglect, from leaving some medicine, which I myself had been taking a portion of for my stomach, in a tumbler on the top of the drawers, at the opposite end of the room where she was. She had gone for the tumbler, and poured some water into it, without observing anything in it; the medicine being only a small portion of liquid in the bottom of the glass, and clear as the glass or water; then she had drunk it. Oh, my God! I know not what to do. My dear Rachel is gone, gone for ever from me. You, and all of you, knew how happy we were together. I had just gone, leaving her in bed, out of the room for a minute or so, into the other room, in search of another bottle to put the medicine in; for I had broken the one it was in, and had got a tumbler in the mean time to secure the contents in, and she had got out of bed to use the----, and take some salts, which were on the table by her bed<lb/>side, and, wishing to take some water after the salts, and supposing the glass an empty and clean one, she had gone to the other end of the room, unknow<lb/>ingly poured water into it, and, oh, God! have mercy upon us all! she drank</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184408190035"/>
               <p>a portion of it. I heard her cry for me in the other room. I flew to her; but, oh, God! it was all over in a few minutes, and I am now in a state of mind bordering on utter misery and madness. In the sudden shock I knew not what to do or say. I called for immediate assistance. It was brought, but it was of no use. The awful occurrence having taken place in a situation where I am entirely unknown, all are strangers around; and the people being much inclined to doubt my statement that she was my wife, and every thing else I said, I am in a terrible situation. The law has a right to suspect me, and as yet I have not a creature found to prove my marriage, or what I am or who I am. I have nothing to prove anything as yet. The solicitor who I have employed will either have to come down to establish my character, and prove how we lived, and that we were married, or else he will require a few of my friends who have known me and her also to come up and testify what they know of me. I know you will all do what is required for me. What I now regret the most next to the accident, in my confusion and half-stunned state, is, I did not say what had caused her death. I knew not what I was doing or saying, and of course, horror-struck and shocked at my infatuity in having left such medicine there, though it was only for a minute, and the poor dear Rachael was in bed, and knowing well that the world would blame me perhaps too severely for my carelessness in leaving such a dangerous medicine where it was in danger of doing such evil, I did not, until after I became a little more collected, say what had happened. This, though very natural at such an awful juncture, is considered as against me. Oh, God! I know not what to do or say. It came upon me like a thunderbolt. If I were able I would write to you all, I mean most of my friends; but at present I cannot. Go to Mr. Bell, and William Wilson, and Alexander Wilson, and who you think fit, and state the melancholy contents of this to them, because I cannot acquaint them all. As poor Mrs. Stobbs is now the only memorial of dear Rachael I know, go to her, and give her ray respects, and tell her that I have lost beloved Rachael; and although there was not much friendship existing between them for some time past, I hope better will now exist between us and that I shall always regard her for dear Rachael's sake. I must now step; for I am bewildered, as if in an unconscious dream. Yours ever, <hi rend="smallCaps">J. C. BELANEY</hi>. I wish William Wilson could give you Mr. Tewart'a address in London. He is one who knows me, and would say something for me. Go to Mrs. Stobbs immediately, for, as a relative, it is my duty to acquaint her. Tell Mrs. Patrick, and all others you think well of. Oh! I am gone. I hope the Lord will support me under such trouble. If I can write to Mr. Simpson, who is the minister of the parish, I will; but at present I cannot."</p>
               <p>(No. 7.) "To Mr. Dinning (<hi rend="italic">post marks</hi> 14<hi rend="italic">th and</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">th of June.</hi>) My dear Dinning,—I received yours to-day, but O what a change has taken place since I last saw you! O God have mercy on us all! My poor Rachael is gone—gone for ever! Instead of writing to you in that happy strain I had promised, when happy last both beside you, I must now in a state of half insensibility and frenzy communicate to you the awful account of my dear Rachael's death. I can hardly believe that this is not a dream, but it cannot be one. Too true it is that she is not beside me. O God, after she had al<lb/>most recovered from the fatigues of the journey, and after making purchases of some dresses in town for herself and myself, for going off to my brother's at Arlington, in Sussex, when we were about to fix on the day, and wrote to him, she mistook some powerful medicine, which I had been using for my stomach complaint, for water, or rather took the tumbler in which a portion of it remained, it being the colour of glass and in small bulk, and no doubt believing it to be empty, poured some water into it to take after her salts, which she swallowed, and O God, O God have mercy upon us all, I cannot</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184408190036"/>
               <p>tell you more of it! I had just gone into the other room, the parlour (our lodging consisted of two rooms, bed and sitting-room,) for only one minute to get a bottle to put some medicine in, the one I had having been broken in my hand, and Rachel during this time having risen to take her salts, which were placed on a different table by her bed-side, the other medicine which I had left in a tumbler was on the drawers at the opposite end of the room. But I don't know what I am saying or doing. She called. I was in the other room. I flew to her, and O God, O God, she expired in my arms, or nearly so! I called assistance when I was able from the stun to do so, and after what could be done in the time, she went off in my arms, or rather in the mistress's of the house. I was in the mean time, as far as strength would allow me, trying remedies and holding her. As I am entirely among strangers, and an inquest is going on, I must use means to establish my cha<lb/>racter, to prove that she was my wife, which they have strong suspicions of, having no one to prove this in the mean time, and the law being strict, I am placed in an awful position; but what among the strangers makes it appear worse is, that I did not, during the shock, at first, being half insensible of what was going on, and horror-struck and ashamed of having, through the awful neglect of having left the medicine in a place where any one could get at it; but O, I little thought she was going to rise so soon, and then it was at the other end of the room! But I cannot tell you more. O tell your father, who I am sure will feel for my loss and unhappy condition. I am shocked, and all I can do—nothing! I know not what to do or say. It is for me to establish my character, and prove my marriage. O, I know your father will do all he can. I cannot say what must be done until I see a soli<lb/>citor here; he, I dare say, will have to come down for proof of my marriage and the state we have lived in. They did not believe we were married, nor that if she were my wife I would talk of leaving her in town or at Arlington, and go myself up the Rhine, as I stated. In this way, and in the absence of all proof, and being entirely among strangers, I stand in a very unhappy position. O do use every means to assist me. Your father, I hope, will do all too to establish my character since we were married. He knows whether she was my wife or not, and whether we were happy—so do you. O God, I know not what is to befal me; and poor dear Rachael is lost! Most of the people in the neighbourhood know something of me, and I dare say will do any<lb/>thing if required. I think if I required most of the Magistrates in the neighbourhood could speak to my character. Mr. Hancock, Sullidan, and others, whom I have written to for aid, will I know do all they can in this awful crisis. O God, What a change of things! The solicitor will perhaps either tell me what to do, or will see you besides others. I have written Dr. Embleton also; I know he will spare nothing to serve me in such an hour. I wrote to inform some of them in the neighbourhood of her death a day or two eince, but having inadvertently been the awful cause of my own wife's des<lb/>truction, I thought in the madness and agony of the time, I should save my<lb/>self from the censure and blame of the world by burying it in my own bosom. This was madness; but who can think rightly in such a condition? Thus it makes me stand on very suspicious ground, where I am not known. O tell Hunt and all other of my friends about it, because references of character will be required from many to serve me. Adieu, my dear Sir; I hope that God out of his love and mercy will defend and protect me in this awful crisis."</p>
               <p>(No. 8.) "To Mr. Embleton. London, Wednesday, June, 1844. Mr. Emble<lb/>ton—O God, what has happened to my beloved Rachel! she is gone, gone for ever from me. She took out of a tumbler which I had left on a table at the opposite end of the room, imagining it to be empty no doubt, as there did not appear to be anything in it to one in her situation, whilst there was a portion</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184408190037"/>
               <p>of prussic acid in it, which I had been taking a small portion of for my stomach. The reason I had it in such an exposed situation was because on my taking a little of it for my stomach, which I dare say you are aware I am in the habit of doing, when my side or stomach is bad; I think you recommended it to me among others; the stopper having broken in the phial, I was obliged to knock off the neck of it, and having done so, set a tumbler to catch the con<lb/>tents, a portion of what was saved was left in the glass. I went into another room in search of another phial to put it in, knowing well how dangerous it was to have it exposed. I was not a minute absent when Rachel having got up to use the----, and take some salts out of the glass off the table, in order to take some water after the salts, and from the clearness of the acid, not per<lb/>ceiving it in the glass, poured some water in it, and drank a portion of it. O God, what a calamity for me. I heard her in the other room, and flew to her, I called for assistance; but in a minute or two it was all over. Ashamed of my awful neglect in having left the acid for a moment in such a situation, and in awful confusion in the shock, I did not communicate the circumstances until after a while, which in consequence of my being entirely among strangers, is likely to place me in an awful position, &amp;c. &amp;c."</p>

I said, "what poi<lb/>son?"—he said, "Prussic acid"—I said, "Good God, do you mean to say that you have given your wife prussic acid?"—"No, thank God," said he, "I have not that to charge myself with"—he then began to relate how it had occurred; that he was in the habit of taking prussic acid, and I know he was in the habit of taking prussic acid when he was in London before—I had heard him say so—he said that he had been taking it, that he had by mistake broken the stopper of the bottle in getting it out, I understood him to say he had spilt some of it, that he got a tumbler, placed it on the drawers, and emptied the phial into this tumbler, and that it was his impression that his wife had come out of bed, and taken it after he left the room—he was in a dreadful state at the time he made this narrative—I then took him to Mr. Hobson—it was then proposed to go to Mr. Garrett—we went to Mr. Gar<lb/>rett, and there he made this statement.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to George Bague, of No. 19, Coles<lb/>hill-street, in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square. On the 4th of July, about half-past one o'clock in the morning, I was in bed in the kitchen, and was awoke by the noise of a gallipot knocked off the dresser, and heard a person's hand passing along the dresser—I listened for ten minutes, then heard the fire-shovel fall—I then heard the hand again pass along the dresser—I jumped out of bed, and found the kitchen door open—I went up stairs to my master's bed-room, opened his window, and called "Police"—master was there—I found the staircase window up-—I was called down in about ten minutes, and found the prisoner in the policeman's custody in the hall—when I went to bed the house was all fastened—the kitchen door is an inside one—I went to bed at twelve o'clock, and left the family up—I shut up the lower part of the house myself—I know the staircase window was shut down, but cannot say it was fastened—every other part was fastened—a person could get in at the staircase window by getting on a closet in the garden—four flower-pots which had been inside the window were moved outside.</p>

I saw this boy between ten and eleven in the forenoon in Titchfield-street, crying—the prisoner came up eight or ten minutes after me—there was a great crowd round the boy—he said he could swear the pri<lb/>soner was the woman who robbed him—I stopped her—she was going away, and very much wanted to go when I had got her—I said, I would not let her go, if she was innocent she would not be hurt—she struggled a good deal, and said, "I am innocent, let me go."</p>

On the 12th of Aug., in consequence of directions I received, I went near the water-closets, and placed myself in a situation to enable me to see the whole of them, with Peak the officer, at a quarter to six o'clock in the morning—I was in a situation to see four of the water-closets, and if I moved could see the other two—there is a gas-light directly opposite the closets, so that I could see who went in and out—there is no door to the closet—Peak was about ten feet from me—the closets are beneath the letter carrier's office, on the base<lb/>ment, at the end of the kitchen—they are self-acting water-closets—when a person sits on the seat, he fills the box with water above his head, and when he rises, the seat rises an inch, and the water immediately rushes into the basin—there are two gallons in the box, and it leaves one gallon in the basin—when the person rises, it carries down whatever is in the basin—I saw the prisoner enter the closet at ten minutes past six—he was the first person who entered that closet while I was there—I could see distinctly what he did—he tried the closet twice, to see if the water would flow, by sitting down with his clothes buttoned up, and rising up—he then unbuttoned his clothes, and sat down, put his hand into his pocket, and took from it a letter or paper—he then put his bead down to listen, to know if anybody was coming—I then saw checks and Bank-notes in his hand—he commenced examining them, and put some of them underneath him in the closet, with his right hand, into the pan—he then rolled up the letter, or paper, in a round ball, and put that in the pan—I then communicated with Peak, and he ran round and took my place—I took my station again—the prisoner was then examining papers—I directly heard a struggling, then ran round to Peak's assistance, and found him on the prisoner, holding him down on the seat—I put my knee on the seat, to prevent the water flowing into the basin—Peak pulled the prisoner off the seat—I then called for a light, put my arm into the basin, and took out two letters, some bills and checks, and gave them to Peak—the prisoner said, when he rose from the seat, "You cannot hurt me now"—he was taken into custody—they were struggling together in the kitchen.</p>

"—she said, "Yes, very much lately"—after she was gone, I went up stairs with the cook and Mrs. Gibson, and saw the child in the corner of the box, with a cloth round it—the cook pulled the cloth off, and there was the child—Mrs. Gibson and I ran down stairs screaming—I went up afterwards to see if it</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and was called in on this morning. I saw the child in a box, lying on its back, partly covered with dirty linen—the face and neck were concealed from view by a petticoat, or cloth—the string of the petticoat was tied fast round the neck twice, and the end of the string in<lb/>serted, and drawn tight—I made further observation of the body—the navel-string had been cut, evidently—I afterwards made an examination—I found the head crushed—I think the cause of death might be threefold, the crush<lb/>ing of the head; the ligature round the neck was sufficient to prevent its breathing, unquestionably, and the other cause was the loss of blood from the navel-string, which was not tied—I think the crushing of the head alone would be sufficient, and the ligature round the neck would alone be sufficient—the ligature would be sudden in its operation.</p>

Q.</hi> Was there any appearance which enabled you to say whether the ligature had been applied before or after death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It had been applied before death, I think, in consequence of a mark under the right ear, on the side of the neck—it was a full-grown child—I think it must have been living at the time the ligature was applied.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If blood was in a fluid state when there was pressure on the neck, would not all the appearances be created as if the child was alive? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You must have the power of the heart's action—I believe if the blood had not congealed it would not exhibit all the appearances I have spoken of—it would require a pulsation—the action of the heart must be opposed to it—there were appearances on the neck which I think could not be produced after death—the discoloration was the consequence of the blood circulating—it was an injury done to the vessels—the blood being in a fluid state would occasion that mark—the effect of the pulsation of the heart does not remain some short time after death—I examined the petticoat—the strings are made of tape, I believe—they are at the top of the petticoat—I do not know whether they are running strings—if I remember right they were fixed at either side—both petticoat and string embraced the child's neck—I do not think the petticoat had marks of blood on it—I think it was very dirty—it had evidently been worn.</p>

               <p>was nothing in the appearances inconsistent with the head being crushed at birth, the child dying, and the string being applied immediately after that—she might possibly have aided the delivery by putting the string round.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and live in Great James-street, Bedford-row. I keep a cash account at the house of Glynn and Co., and am in the habit of drawing checks on that house—the prisoner was in my employment from six to nine months—he was first employed as a permanent clerk—he ceased to act in that capacity, I should think about two years ago—I have employed him occasionally, and given him writing to do out of the office since that time till the present—I do not doubt that he had an opportunity of knowing that I kept an account at Glynn's—my check-book was usually on the table in my office—this is the book—there are three checks printed on every page—on the first discovery of this forgery I examined the book, and missed the last sheet from it—I have two numbers on my checks, my own private number, and the printed number which is on them when Glynns issue them, which is B. X., 901 to 1200—my number is put on them when I fill them up—it would not be on the blank checks—the check produced is not my handwriting, or any part of it, nor was it written by my authority—the signature, I should say, was a good imitation of mine—I am acquainted with the prisoner's hand<lb/>writing, and have seen him write frequently—I believe the filling up of this check to be his writing—the signature is not like his writing, it is an imita<lb/>tion of mine—the name and address on this bank-note, "James Martineau, 9, William-street, Islington," I believe to be the prisoner's writing.</p>

Q.</hi> I believe the prisoner is a relation of yours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the family do not consider him a relation—his father was my uncle—he is an illegitimate child—I have frequently seen writing of his in the office, briefs that he has copied—I cannot recollect when my attention was last called to it—his is a very stiff handwriting, and he writes very slow—I call his whole writing peculiar from A to Z—his f is always peculiar, ending square at the bottom, and every letter—this "James Martineau" is not much feigned—it is not much like his ordinary writing—it is more like his writing than that in the check—I have a stronger belief about it—he lived at one time with his mother, but I do not think he did latterly.</p>

The prisoner was our porter for twenty-one months—he lived and lodged in the house—about eleven o'clock on Sunday, the 21st of July, he came home after having been out—in consequence of something on the Monday morning I sent for a policeman, and went with him and the prisoner to the prisoner's bed-room—I directed the policeman to search his boxes—one was locked, and the other not—the policeman asked him for the key, and he gave it him readily—he unlocked the box, and found the articles stated, which are my property, and had been in the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 10, Lancaster-place, Strand. For the last three months I have not been in any business on account of ill health—before that I was with a friend, who is a solicitor, merely to occupy my time and to increase my income, intending to go into mercantile pursuits again—I know the prisoner—I first became acquainted with him on the 21st of July, at least he crossed the road in Fish-street-hill, as I was crossing towards the Monument—he came up to me, and claimed my acquaintance, saying he had met me at the Lyceum theatre—I said he might have done so, but I did not remember him—he reminded me that he was speaking to a gentleman named Myers, who I had formerly known, and had a sort of bowing acquaintance with—he said, "I think you will recollect that gentleman"—I said, "Yes, I recollect him, although I know very little of him now"—he walked and talked with me—he did not seem inclined to go, and I did not tell him to go—we went to a public-house called the Half Moon, in Gracechurch-street, where I wished to see somebody on business—I called for a pot of stout, which we took together—we came out together, and parted near the Monument—he said he saw a friend of his—I said, "Don't let me detain you," and he left—I met him again on the following Wednesday—he came running up to me at the pit door of the Lyceum theatre, and said, "How do you do, sir?" and asked if I was going into the theatre—I said I thought I was, and said, "Are you going in?"—he said, "No, I am going westward, but in all probability shall look in on my return"—that was all that passed then—I went into the theatre, and saw no more of him that night—on Sun<lb/>day, the 28th, I saw him on London-bridge Wharf, I think it is called—I was waiting, to see a person I expected from Gravesend—he came up, and said, "How do you do?"—I think he asked me if I would have some stout, and I declined—I said no, in consequence of ill health I should go home—I went home to my chambers—I said, "If you have nothing better to do, if you like a blow up the river, I shall be very glad to give you some tea"—he accepted the invitation and went to my lodgings, in Lancaster-place—I</p>

               <p>have half the chambers there, with another gentleman—when we got to the chambers the tea-things were on the table, as my friend had given the servant leave to go out—the water was boiling in the kitchen—we went on the top of the leads, as he admired the view of the river—I said, "There is a splendid view, you see up to Chelsea from the top of the house" (we were in the habit of taking our friends up) he went up with me—we returned in three minutes to the sitting-room—the window was open, and the door also—the window looks over Somerset-house—it is an upper floor—the rooms are overlooked from Somerset-house, and from Lancaster-place—he took some gin and water—I took some tea—I had said on the quay, "It is very dull always to be in the City on Sunday, if I had not come here on business I should have preferred being at the other end of the town"—he said "I am used to it, my father lived in Water-lane, my name is Joyce"—I said, "Oh, I knew your father very well, he has been dead about four years; I also knew your brother-in-law, Mr. Carrington"—after he had the gin and water, or while he was taking it, he gave another account of his family—he said his brother had treated him very ill; that he would not speak to him; that he went to the Opera the previous night, and met his younger brother there, and he passed him, and would not take the slightest notice of him—he said his guardian allowed him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; per annum, but only allowed him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for his expenses—he had spoken of dining at——, and drinking claret—I asked how he could do that with 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, it was impos<lb/>sible—I do not think he made any answer—I said it was no business of mine, but I then remarked on the subject of a bill of exchange which he had drawn—I accused him of having accepted a bill of exchange for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, which hap<lb/>pened to have been presented to me to be discounted—he said he never received a farthing of the amount, and he did not know what had become of the bill at all; he was under age, and should not be liable for it—I told him it was a swindling transaction, because he represented it to belong to his brother, to be drawn by his brother, payable at his brother's bankers'—be<lb/>fore he mentioned about the bill, he said he wished me to go and speak to his friends, and said when he lived at Camberwell he had seduced a young girl of eighteen, who proved to be in the family way; that she had been to his brother, and told him the story, and the child had died four days after it was born—I said it was an awful thing in so young a man to have seduction laid to his charge, and he should endeavour to conquer his passions; if he could not do it entirely, there were many unfortunate women about the streets, for no respectable family would receive him if they knew he had seduced a respect<lb/>able female, as he stated—he said he was afraid of the disease—I said, "Do as the French do; I have been abroad many years; use a French letter"—he said he did not know what they were—I showed him—no observation was made with regard to it—about half-past nine o'clock I said, "You must not think me inhospitable, but I wish to retire early to rest; I will walk a short distance with you into the Strand, as I wish to purchase a cigar"—I went out of the room—I said, "If you will excuse me a few minutes, I will be ready"—he said "I will take a little more gin and water during your absence"—I said, "Help yourself"—I went up stairs for about three minutes, returned to the room, and he was reading a number of cards of visitors round the looking-glass—I said, "Well, are you ready?"—he said, "No; you brought me here for improper purposes, and I will make you pay for it before I go"—I got in a great rage with him. and said. "You wretch, you shall not remain in my room, no man can be safe with a man like you; I insist on your leaving my room this instant"—he said, "I shall not, till you give me money"—I said, "You are mistaken in your man; you have mistaken my character alto<lb/>gether, in, supposing I will give you a shilling: it is very evident to me now</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184408190073"/>
               <p>how you get your money"—he then said, "Then I won't leave the room," and threw himself down in a chair—I insisted on his going—he said he would not—I said then I must to get assistance to have him taken out—I went out, and in the course of eight minutes brought a policeman back with me—immediately we got into the room the prisoner had put out the lamp, and was in the act of re-lighting it—he said immediately he saw the policeman, "Oh, policeman, take this man, he has been taking indecent liberties with me"—the policeman said, "No, you are my prisoner," or something to that effect.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How old are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Thirty-six—I have been a merchant, in Ostend and Antwerp, a owner and ship<lb/>broker, a general merchant, a salt importer, and exporter of flax—I have ceased to be a merchant about four years—I thought I had saved sufficient money to live without business at all—I lived at No. 7, Agar-street, Strand, in lodgings on the first floor, about two years, doing next to nothing, living on the produce of the shares of the vessels I left abroad—I am a man of small fortune—I am now going to establish a business again—I went from Agar-street to Abingdon-street for about four months—then to Park-chambers, Park-street, Westminster, where I have lived till the last three months—I had an office in Park-chambers on the first floor, and a room up stairs—the office was on the first floor—I had the use of it with a Mr. Ikey, an attorney—I do not know that he has run away—I used to write for him and myself too for about a year and a half—I did what he desired me—nothing dishonorable or wrong—I have been to the Judge's chambers for him—not every day in term, nor three or four times a week—I never issued a writ—I do not think he did anything in that way—he had very little business—he was a discounter, I believe, and a money-scrivener—he is living at Walworth—I saw him one day last week for a moment—he engaged to pay me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; a week, but I never got it—I got part of it by instalments—he has a large, family, and got into difficulties—I got about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; from him during the year and a half—while with him I cor<lb/>responded abroad, having some little affairs unsettled there—I never had occa<lb/>sion to attend the Judges' chambers for myself—I have no property here—it is shares in ships, but it is involved through my foolishness in putting my name to bills for other parties—it has been involved ever since I came away, and before—I did not come away because it was involved, for I have been to Ostend since, two years and nine months ago—the bankers at Bruges have the charge of my property, and also a banker at Ostend—they keep it as security—I cannot tell what my liabilities are—Mr. Ellis is a friend of the prisoner's, I understand—I have known him—I gave him a home when he had not one for two months—he did not sleep in the house—I gave him everything but a bed, which I had not got—that was in Abingdon-street—I was there about four months—I was introduced to Ellis about three years ago by the son of the Hon. Mr. Hare, of Leamington—it is about a year and a half ago that I gave him shelter—I never gave shelter to anybody else—the son of the Rev. Mr. Probyn of Twickenham lodges with me in Lancaster-place—the cham<lb/>bers are in his name—I share in the expenses—a solicitor, named Robinson, in Essex-street, is the landlord or agent—I have been there about three months—we have one large sitting-room, two bed-rooms, a kitchen, and two smaller rooms—the sitting-room is on the third floor, and the bed-rooms in the roof—they are unfurnished—we pay 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; a year—I have seen Ellis once within the last eighteen months—he knocked at my door—I happened to an<lb/>swer it myself, and ordered him down stairs—he said he wished I would allow him speak to me a moment—I said, "No, you shall not come into my place; if you wish to speak to me I will meet you in the presence of a third party"—I had not quarrelled with him, but heard he had been living by swindling and living a very irregular life—he had accepted a bill, he said it was accepted by–</p>

               <p>Mr.———When the prisoner reminded me of his speaking to Mr. Myers at the theatre, I recollected him—I believe Myers is a merchant—I was not on intimate terms with him—I have not spoken to him ten times within ten years—it was the prisoner said, "What a fine view you have from the window"—I did not say to him that I took strangers up, but Mr. Probyn and myself were in the habit of doing so, as we are proud of so fine a view—when I met the prisoner, on Sunday the 21st, I did not ask him how he was amused on the Friday—I did not say I was thirsty, when we got to the door of the Half Moon—I asked him to go and have some stout—that was about half-past six—I was going there to meet a gentleman—I ex<lb/>pected to find a Mr. Knight there—I wished to purchase some cigars of him—he trades abroad, and promised to get me some—he lives somewhere near Tri<lb/>nity-square—he is steward or something of a steam-packet—when I got near the inn, I said, "I am going in here, will you walk in and have some stout or beer"—he went in—I called for a bottle of stout—I paid one shilling for it, and he paid sixpence for two cigars, which we had—several people were sitting there—Mr. Knight did not come—I did not very much expect him—I was not certain of meeting him there—I did not meet a butcher there whom I knew, or a butcher's lad—I spoke to one person there whom I had met before, a gentleman in the Manchester trade, from Manchester—I do not know his name—I did not take the prisoner anywhere else—we came out together, and walked as far as Gracechurch-street—he said he saw some friends, and left me—I swear most solemnly that I did not make an appointment to meet him the next Sunday on London-bridge wharf—I met him on Tuesday the 23rd, at the entrance of the theatre, as I have described—I said I thought I was going in, because it was not exactly an order I had, it was a pass—a friend had come and said, "If you like to go in you can, for nothing"—it was Mr. Smith, of Barton-street, Westminster—he is a gentleman in Somerset-house—I was very undecided whether I should go in, as I do not care much about theatres—an order and pass are the same thing—I left my lodgings on purpose to go, but a man may change his mind—it was about half-past nine—I think I stayed there about half an hour—I shook hands with the prisoner—I did not invite him to come in, nor remind him of an appointment for Sunday—I never made one—I got into the City on the 28th about six—I was not on the wharf above three minutes—I went to find the man about the cigars—I waited some time for him, and found he was gone to Gravesend—he had promised to get me some cigars very cheap—I waited at the Half Moon an hour—I had left home about a quarter to six in a boat from Waterloo-bridge—I landed at London-bridge—I dined at my chambers that day with Mr. Probyn, Mr. Dudley, a gentleman from the Admiralty, and a very respectable lady—we have a servant lad, and a charwoman when required—the servant lad is here—he was not at home on the Sunday—I did not refuse to give his name—he wears Mr. Probyn's livery—we do not pay him wages—we clothe him and give him what we please—he is about fourteen years old—I met the prisoner as I was coming out of the wharf, and shook hands with him—I did not express either joy or sorrow at meeting him—I did not expect to meet him—after telling me his name and who he was, I invited him home—he said he had had tea—the gin and water was standing on the table—we went on board a steam-boat—I paid for myself and he for himself—I solemnly swear that I bought two cigars at Waterloo-bridge, and gave him one—it was near eight when we got there—it was about a quarter to ten when I went for the policeman—when I got to my lodging the tea was set for two I think—there was only Mr. Probyn to come home—we generally have some one drop in about tea time—I did not go down and fetch up cold meat, we had none in the house, I think, at least I did not take any that night—I did not give the prisoner a</p>

               <p>card nor show him one and tell him that was not my name—I did not ask if he liked women—not an indelicate word passed from my lips, nor an indeli<lb/>cate act—I produced the French letter to him—I have been at Ellis's father's house, and smoked a pipe with his father once or twice—I have seen his brother—that is two years ago, when he lived in Vincent-square—I do not know how he got his living—he slept at his father's—I never dined with him in the Haymarket but once, that was not with him, but with a Mrs. Fenton, who, I believe, is a married woman, at the Cafe de----, that is the only time Ellis was there—he and Mrs. Fenton dined together there—Mrs. Fenton does not keep the house, but a lady living on her means, in Albany-street, Regent's-park—I was never there—she lived at 76, New Bond-street, when I saw her—she lived there by herself—I had very little knowledge of her—she was in<lb/>troduced to me—I paid for Mrs. Fen ton's dinner, but not for Ellis—I met him there by accident—I did not tell the policeman not to take the prisoner into cus<lb/>tody if he could get him out of the house without, nor anything of the sort—I got the French letter from Calais—I produced it from a small box on the book-shelves—I did not show him any prints—we have rio such things in the place nor any books—there were no figures on the French letter—I did not leave him in charge of anybody while I went for the policeman—I had told him I must call for assistance if he did not leave, that he knew where to find me if he had anything to say against me—I did not produce any friend before the Magistrate, nor ask the officer if it was necessary—he did not say he thought it was—I did not say the steward of the steamer sometimes gave me smuggled cigars, and was there a necessity to produce him—I said, "It might injure the man's reputation in the steam-packets if it was known he occasionally smuggled cigars"—I did not say he refused to give evidence—I would have produced him if my solicitor had advised me to do so.</p>

I was spoken to by the prosecu<lb/>tor on Sunday, the 28th of July, from half-past nine to ten o'clock—from what he said, I went to Lancaster-place, went up to a room, and the prisoner had got a lucifer match in his hand, about to light a lamp—when he saw me he said, "I give him in charge for taking indecent liberties with me," pointing to the prosecutor—I told him the prosecutor had given him in charge for at<lb/>tempting to extort money from him, by accusing him of taking indecent liberties with him—he then put on his hat, and went with me to the station.</p>

I went with the other officers—I produce a file, one counterfeit shilling, four counterfeit sixpences, and part of a mould, which I took off the fire—the heat of the fire caused it to crumble—it is in pieces—there is only an impression on one piece—the women assisted in trying to get the male prisoner away from us—at the time he put the shillings into his mouth they lodged in his throat—I saw the lump—I saw he had something in his hand, and, in trying to get it, one of his teeth caught my hand, which caused me a bad hand for a week or so, and from that hand this shilling dropped, with a little piece of the mould—the women's language and conduct were very violent—Jones got up from a bed, where she was sitting, went to the mantelpiece, and laid hold of something, I could not see what—as soon as I succeeded in getting the hot shilling that dropped on the boards, and put the male prisoner in the corner, I went to the mantelpiece, and from a shell there I picked out four counterfeit sixpences—that was the very corner to which Jones had gone.</p>

This is a plaster of Paris mould for casting sixpences—it has the impression of both sides of a sixpence on it—it is a perfect mould in all respects, and appears to have been used for that purpose—these are four counterfeit sixpences—all of them appear to have been cast in this mould—here are also two others which have been cast in this mould, and one that has not—here is a small portion of a plaster of Paris mould which appears to have been broken—it has a small part of the impres<lb/>sion of the obverse side of a shilling on it—the three letters "<hi rend="smallCaps">VIC</hi>" in the word "Victoria" appear clearly on it—here is a counterfeit shilling of the present reign, just as it comes from the mould, with all the surplus metal on the edge, just as it is cast—it has similar letters to those on the mould—here is a <hi rend="italic">get</hi>, which appears to have been produced by a mould, and which fills up the channel when the metal is poured in hot—here is a small file, with white metal in the teeth of it—it would be used to remove the surplus metal off the edge of the coin when cast—here is an iron spoon, which might be used to melt the metal in, and appears to have been so used—here is some metal which appears to have been in a state of fusion—it is white metal, simi<lb/>lar to that of which the counterfeit coin is composed—here are other tools, a pair of scissors, a pair of pliers, and a knife, which are all articles used in coining—the plaster of Paris is similar to that of which the moulds are made.</p>

On the night in question I went with my sister to see Mrs. Morris home—I do not know the name of the street—as we were returning home I saw the prisoner and another man—the prisoner laid hold of my sister's arm, and said, "Jane, my dear, where are you going?"—my sister ran away from them across the road—I went with her—we were going home up Holborn—the two men fol<lb/>lowed us—when we got to Newton-street we met the two journeymen bakers, whom we knew—my sister asked them if they were going up as far as Drury-lane—they said, "Yes," and walked with us as far as Smart's-buildings—-the two men still kept following us—when we got to Smart's-buildings we bid the bakers good night, and they went away—we turned down Smart's-buildings—the prisoner ran after my sister—I ran away from him—I suppose he thought I was going for a policeman, and he ran after me, and knocked me down, and when I was down he kicked me with his boot in my head—here is the mark—I had not said or done anything to him—my sister came to get him away from me, and he hit her in the mouth—I bled very much indeed—a policeman came up, and picked my sister up—she was lying in the road—I got up myself, and was taken to Bow-street—from there I was sent to the hospital, where I staid six weeks all but three days.</p>

I know Mrs. Young and her sister—on the night of the 3rd of July I saw them in Holborn, at the top of Newton-street, and two men following them—they told me the men were abusing them all the way down Holborn—they were near enough to hear what was said—they were close behind—they wished me to go as far as</p>

               <p>Smart's-buildings with them—I had a friend with me, and we went, I should say, about 200 yards, to the top of Smart's-buildings—we there left them—after I had gone about six yards I heard a noise, and Mrs. Yonng calling "Police"—I went back, and saw the prisoner knock the prosecutrix down, and kick her in the forehead after she was down—the other man was behind him—Mrs. Young was standing a little way off—I did not see anything happen to her—I took hold of the prisoner—he called to his brother to call a police<lb/>man, and give me and my friend in charge—he did not say for what—I held him till the policeman came and took him into custody—the brother walked down to the station after us—I had never seen the prisoner or his brother before, to my recollection.</p>

I was on doty about twelve o'clock this night in the neighbourhood of Smart's-buildings, and heard the screams of some females—I proceeded to the spot, and saw Mrs. Young lying on the ground—while assisting her up, I was called to a crowd of persons, twelve yards distant, and found the prosecutrix bleeding profusely from the head, supported by a man—the prisoner was pointed out to me by the crowd, and I took him into custody—I looked at the prosecutrix's hands—there was not the slightest appearance of mud upon them—the prisoner had complained of her throwing mud at him—he appeared to be sober—I conveyed the pro<lb/>secutrix to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at Charing-cross Hospital when the girl was brought there about one o'clock—I examined her—she had a lacerated wound at the upper part of the forehead, extending to the scalp, and her face was discolored with blood, the result of the wound—it was such a wound as might have been inflicted with a kick from a shoe—the skin was cut—she appeared to have lost about a table-spoonful and a half of blood—I dare say not more—she was six weeks in the hospital—the wound was not quite to the bone—it might have been dangerous—she got well of the wound very soon, but inflammation of the eye coming on, we kept her in for that—that was not the result of the same injury—it was a pustular inflammation, which never occurs as the result of violence, and had no connexion with the injury on the head.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's brother. I had been spending this evening with him—we left the public-house a little after twelve, and went up Holborn—I live at No. 21, Wootton-street—my brother lived at No. 27, Clare-street, Clare-market—we were arm-in-arm together, and were very jovial, singing a song—we saw two men and these two women together, a great way up Holborn—they appeared to be <hi rend="italic">larking</hi> and as we approached them, the girl insulted us and said, "We will have a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi> with these fellows"—she went to the kennel, and gathered two handfulls of mud to throw at us, but pre<lb/>vious to that some words passed between us—the men insulted us also, and a scuffle ensued—the men not finding themselves strong enough for us, ran away towards Drury-lane—the women, I believe, ran down Smart's-build<lb/>ings—the girl had thrown some mud at my brother, and we ran after her, calling "Police," as a matter of course—I had escaped the mud by standing on one side, and my brother received the whole of it—in running after her, she fell against the iron palisades or bars in the place, and on her face on the stones—my brother stooped down to pick her up, to hold her till the police came up, when the elder girl <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> my brother—my brother <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> her, and she fell—at that moment the police came up—I was there the whole time, and I declare solemnly, on my oath, my brother never struck her, or kicked her—it was entirely accidental.</p>

                  </hi>. In Dec. last I lived in Church-street, Bethnal-green, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch; it was my dwelling-house. Between half-past five and six o'clock, in the evening of the 26th of Dec., I left my home perfectly secure, to go to my father's, at Stepney—I locked the door—the window was down, and the shutters too—I returned about half-past eleven, and found two cane-bottom chairs, a pair of sheets, and a blanket, and the other things stated, taken away—the prisoner is a chair-caner—I knew him—he came the next morning, and sympathised with me, and said he was very sorry to hear of it—I heard no more till the 16th of June, when a woman, who I believe to be his wife, came and gave me information—I then gave him into custody for the robbery—he said he knew nothing about it—I went with the officer and the prisoner to Leonard-street, where they told me he lived, and found my property there—he did not say anything.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlady of this house. The prosecutor gave me his umbrella—I placed it outside the door, it being a wet day—in a short time it was missing, and the prisoner was the only person that went out of our house—he had been sitting on a stool—when it was missing I looked for it, but could not find it—soon after the prisoner went into a wheat field opposite our premises, and then he returned to two other persons in the tap-room—they had a pint of beer, and went out altogether—one went on to the Chertsey-road—the prisoner and one of the others went on till they came to the wheat field, and then the prisoner went into the field, and came out with the umbrella—I ran and took it from him—he wished me to make it up.</p>

                  </hi>. I have known the prisoner for the last eight or nine year—I knew him living at Romford, and also at Wapping—he carried on business as a medical man at Romford, and in a small way at Wapping—he has been in the habit of attending me for the last two years—I keep a lodging-house for sailors at No. 2, Martha-street, St. George's-in-the-east—I have lived there three years and a half—I came from Shadwell—I have lived at the east end of the town from a child—I saw the prisoner on the 16th of July in Aldgate—he overtook me—I was in company with a young man named Wardle, who assists me—we had some conversation with the prisoner, and went down Fenchurch-street with him—we crossed Gracechurch-street, and saw two persons in Lombard-street—I do not know what they were doing—they accosted us, they were uttering something together—they were moving about and they came up to us—one of them had something in his hand, and asked for the bank, or a bank, or something of that kind, in broken English—the prisoner directed them to the Bank of England—the taller one of them said, "No, no," and the shorter one said, "This is here," and he presented the paper to the prisoner—I did not see what was on the paper—nothing else passed between them to my knowledge—they walked towards a banking-house, I do not know the name of it, and got on the steps—I cannot say whether any of them went in—I walked on and Wardle with me—I do not know whether the prisoner went in—I went down to Gravesend the same day—there was a letter directed to me two days afterwards, and that was the first intimation I received about the piisoner—I did not go to him—I was sub<lb/>pœnaed to come here.</p>

               <p>nine o'clock when we got to Aldgate—we had not sat down anywhere—we were standing at Aldgate looking at a horse which had fallen down, and the prisoner overtook us—he asked me how I did—I said better than I was thank him—he spoke to Wardle, and he asked us where we were going—we told him we were going to Richmond—he said, "I am going to Fenchurch-street (or Lombard-street) to buy a waistcoat"—he asked us to go and look at a pattern of the waistcoat—we agreed—it was all in our way to London-bridge, where the boats go from—I do not know that it would be the nearest to go along Gracechurch-street, but meeting with the prisoner he asked us to go with him—persons often go a little out of their way—we went to a tailor's shop in Lombard-street, kept by Hubbock or Hubbert—I think it is on the right hand side of the way in coming from Fenchurch-street—I saw the clothes there—we did not go into the shop—the prisoner proposed to go into the shop, but I advised him not to go in, and advised him to go to a shop in the Poultry, where I said I had bought waistcoats—we were all three going to the Poultry, and in going along we saw the two persons—I think we first saw them on the left hand side of the way, but I did not take particular notice of it—one was a tall man, and one a short one—the tall one had mustachios—I cannot tell whether he was fair or dark—they were talking to one another in broken English, and overtook us—they had hats on, and the tall one had a dark frock coat on—I cannot tell what they were muttering—they were very friendly from what I noticed of them—they were talking in a language I did not understand—I should imagine they were quarrelling—the little one had a paper in his hand, and the tall one asked for a bank or the Bank—the pri<lb/>soner directed him to the Bank of England—he shook his head, and in broken English said that was not what he wanted—the short one presented a paper to the prisoner, and the prisoner said, "I will show you where the Bank is," and he said to us, "Walk on to the Poultry, I will overtake you"—that was the reason why I and Wardle walked on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Dear. The prisoner came to my master's shop in the middle of March last—on one occasion, when he was in my master's parlour, Atkins came into the shop, and told me he had taken a shop at Fulham, and he wanted some goods to stock his shop—he had a written order, and selected groceries to a large amount—I told him there must be some reference if he wanted credit; that Mr. Dear was engaged with a gentleman in the parlour—I went in, and asked him to step out—Mr. Dear came into the shop, and White followed him—Atkins rose, and touched his hat, and White distantly returned it—Mr. Dear called White back, and they spoke together—White then left the shop, and when he was gone, Atkins said, "Good God! is not that old White?"—he said, "What an extraordinary thing that I should meet him here! I have not seen him before for three or four years"—he said he was a very large builder, and nearly the richest man in Lon<lb/>don; that he was building a great many houses at Queen's-row, Dalston—Mr. Dear told Atkins that he would have no objection to supply him if he could give a reference, and he referred to a man named Wilkins—Wilkins afterwards called, but Mr. Dear declined the order—I saw White there again the following day—he and my master were in conversation—I heard White say he would be bound for Atkins for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, I cannot say which—upon that Mr. Dear ordered me to put up the goods, which I did, and they were sent the following day to Fulham, according to Atkins's order—I delivered them to Hunt, the carman—White called again the day after the goods were sent—he saw Mr. Dear, and I saw an order entered for about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; worth of goods for Mr. White—White came again, and ordered some more goods, to nearly the same amount, to be sent to Queen-street, and said he would call and leave a check on the Saturday morning, when he would sign the guarantee—I never saw him afterwards.</p>

I knew the prisoner as Mr. White for five or six months—he employed me to take possession of his house, in Queen-street, Cheapside—I lived there till he starved me—he used to send me to Mr. Thomas, who was tried here by the name of Atkins—Thomas lived in Golden-lane, and as I knew Mr. White used to stop at Thomas's, when there was a distraint put in his house, I used to go to Mr. Thomas's to see White—letters used to come to Queen-street, and I used to take them to Golden-lane—I used to see Mr. Thomas there—I left messages there for Mr. White—I was in Mr. White's service about six weeks—he paid me very little—the landlord put a distraint in while I was there—there was the outside of ladders, with no steps, a few bricks, and some chimney-pots on the premises, an old chest of drawers, and some "Bank of Elegance" notes—I have got two of the notes in my pocket now—I have seen White and Atkins at the Leaping-bar public-house together—I remember Mr. Dear coming to Queen-street after the groceries had been left—I told White, Dear had been—he taid, "D—him, so long as nobody else is there"—five officers came there after White for several days.</p>

On Saturday, the 10th of Aug., Duckering was brought back by the two policemen—Duckering said something to me—I sent for Baugh, and repeated to her that Duckering had said she had given him the things—I said, "John says you gave him these things (they were then on the table), you can do as you like about answering"—she hesitated, and said, "I did"—there was a loaf of bread, some dripping, two cloths, and some potatoes—Baugh was not justified in parting with any of these things, nor Duckering in receiving them.</p>

The prisoner was their journeyman—I had occasionally missed some cuttings—on Tuesday evening, July 30th, I marked some cuttings with a sort of notch, and weighed them—the next morning I received information from Stedman about half-past seven o'clock—I then weighed them again, and missed loz. and 10dwts.—it was the prisoner's business to leave the premises to go to break<lb/>fast at half-past eight o'clock—I placed myself in the hall, but he did not come down till ten minutes to nine—he then came running down with a hurried step, and as he got to the door—I said, "Hodges, you must come back; you have been in my weighing-room this morning"—he said "I have not"—I said, "You have got property of your employers"—he said, "I have not"—he appeared agitated, down went his hand, and down went the silver on the stone floor—I saw it fall at his feet—I took it up and showed it to him—it has the mark that I put on it the night before—this is it—it does not pre<lb/>cisely correspond with the weight I missed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. James M'Kean, who keeps the Belgrave Head, in Spur-street. On the evening of the 4th of Aug. I was standing at the bar, and saw the prisoner come down stairs from the ale-room—he went quickly out at the street door with a bundle in a table-cloth under his arm—I had never seen him before—I went up to the second floor front room, and missed the property stated—(the ale-room is on the first floor)—I found all the linen turned out of the washing basket, and lying about—the velvet scarf had been lying on the bed five minutes before, and that was gone—it was Clara Harriet Brown's, my master's niece—the table-cloth was Mrs. Mary Ann M'Gagan's, the shirts James Duell's, and the petticoat was mine—it was all in the house of Mr. James M'Kean—the whole of it was worth 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had been in the room ten minutes before, and it was all perfectly safe—I afterwards went to Vine-street station, and saw the prisoner—I swear positively to him, though I never saw him before, as we have the gas in our passage, which gives such a light.</p>

I saw the prisoner and another in the Strand, a little after eight o'clock, close behind two gentlemen—the prisoner lifted up the outside gentleman's pocket, and then he went to the inside gentleman's pocket, and drew this handkerchief out—he crossed the Strand—I followed and col<lb/>lared him—he took this handkerchief out of his clothes and threw it down—I took it—he commenced a struggle, and in holding him I lost sight of the gentleman—I do not know who he was—I was in plain clothes.</p>

I know the prosecutrix by the name of Mrs. Hawkins, but not by the name of Lancaster—I saw her on the evening of the 5th of Aug., at the Ship, about half-past five, standing at the bar, and she had a quartern of gin—I was standing at the door—she asked me to go into the tap-room with her, and have a drop of beer—I went in with her, and had a drop of beer—she ordered six or seven pots, altogether—when she was pouring out the se<lb/>cond glass of gin, the glass was broken—I think she stopped there till about ten at night—I was there all the time, drinking some of the beer which she had furnished—I and my wife went with her to the Angel, which is in the middle of Hammersmith town—we had a pot of beer there, and she had 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of oysters—we came back to the Ship again, and the prisoner was in the tap-room—the prosecutrix told me to order a pot of beer—she then went out, and came back in about two minutes, and drank part of the beer—the prisoner was there then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of the Docks. On the morning that the Orton was stopped I went on board her about seven o'clock, and found 43 bladders of brandy, measuring about 38 gallons and 1 quart—there were 13 gallons of dark brandy and 25 gallons and 1 quart of pale—I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Honduras</hi>, which was in the Dock—her cargo was brandy—I sounded some casks—one was "N. B. 957," and one other after—I found they were not full—three of the largest casks had been pierced with a centre<lb/>bit, and the centre-bit was found in the prisoner's boat—it would have made the holes—I tried it to the holes, and they fitted exactly—the holes were filled up with a cork—I have samples of each of the brandies here.</p>

I saw Bridget Fleming at the hospital, with a wound behind her left ear, about three-fourths of an inch in length—it did not reach the bone, but appeared as though some instrument had been pushed under the skin—I thought that a common dinner-knife, which was shown to me, was the most likely instru<lb/>ment to have effected it—I have seen her since, and some bruises appeared near the wound, which would make it less likely than I at first supposed—the wound was somewhat of a crescent shape, and there was a slight wound on the margin of the ear, which seemed a continuation of the other wound, as if the ear had been pressed against the head at the time the wound wasinflicted—the wounds were not dangerous—I only saw her once after<lb/>wards.</p>

On the after<lb/>noon of the 9th of Aug., I saw the prisoner leading the prosecutor, who was rather intoxicated, down White Horse-street—the prisoner beckoned to a female as he came up to our door—I followed them till I met a policeman—the prisoner asked the gentleman to go up Bear-street—he said it was not the way home—the prisoner said he would take him round the other way—they went a little further, and the prisoner leaned upon his breast, against the wall in Butcher-row, and he took a pin from his breast—I had noticed the pin before—they both fell down—the prisoner was rather intoxicated—they went up Bear-street—I followed them, and they went down a kind of court or alley—I went and asked the gentleman to come out of the place—the prisoner said he would fetch a policeman, and give the gentleman in charge for half-a-crown, for bringing him from Blackwall-stairs—I begged of him to fetch one—he went and fetched one—we came down the Com<lb/>mercial road, down to Arbour-square—the gentleman, the prisoner, and I went to the station of our own accord, without a policeman—in going to the station the prisoner tapped me on the shoulder, and said to mind that he was halves—I saw the policeman, and gave the prisoner in charge—I saw some gloves and some silver taken from the prisoner.</p>

About two months ago the prisoner came to our shop—he said he was come for a set of blacking-brushes for Mr. Leslie (who is Lord Harewood's brother or son, and lives opposite to us)—I said I thought he had made a mistake, as we did not serve the family, and he went away—on the 8th of Aug. he came again, and said he had brought an order from the valet of Mr. Leslie for a set of blacking-brushes, and a clothes-brush—I let him have them—he said the valet would call the next day and pay for them—he mentioned about his having come before for brushes, and said, "This time I have brought a written order"—he said Mr. Hobbs, Mr. Leslie's valet, had given him the order.</p>

I was on the spot, and saw the wheel come in contact with Mrs. Jones—I saw her soon after she was thrown down—I found her insensible, beginning to change colour, blood issuing from her nose and ear—I imagined that she had fractured her skull, and that turned out to be the case—I was at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination.</p>

I live at Deptford, On Thursday evening, the 20th of June, I saw the prisoner in Giffin-street, Deptford, creating a disturbance—I saw William Fuggle, the policeman, advise him several times to go in-doors—he said he would, and Fuggle left him, but finding he would not, he turned back to him, and said if he did not, he should certainly take him into custody—the prisoner then struck him a violent blow in the chest, and nearly knocked him backwards—he then ran into the passage of the house—Fuggle pursued after him, and in trying to take him a struggle took place in the place—he got Fuggle's head in between the door and door-post—I stepped up and asked him if I could render him any assistance—he said he should be obliged to me if I would, which I did, and by forcing the door back the constable released his head from his hat—the prisoner then ran up stairs into the back-room, first-floor—Fuggle requested me to go up with him, which I did—he asked the prisoner several times to open the door—he said he should not—at last he opened it, and struck me a violent blow across the head with an iron weapon of some kind—I said, "I am done"—I then fell back stunned and senseless—I was taken to Mr. Arthur's, who attended me for a month—I was not able to do anything for six weeks—I had done nothing to provoke the prisoner more than releasing the constable's head from the door.</p>

The prosecutor was brought to me on the night of the 20th of June last, between ten and eleven o'clock—he appeared stunned, and was bleeding very profusely from the head—he was not insensible—the scalp was completely divided at the anterior portion—it was a lacerated wound and severe, about an inch and a half long, and to the bone—the bleeding might have bad a beneficial tendency—he was under my care about a month—he was unable to leave his room for something more than a week—the symptoms were favourable—it must have been a very severe blow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Bowerman, the prisoner's brother, and live in Belvidere-road, Lambeth. The prisoner came to reside with us three or four months before the 1st of July—I had no reason to sus<lb/>pect that she was in the family way—on the morning of the 1st of July, about half-past eight o'clock I went out for some salts for the prisoner, as she told me she was not very well—I did not recommend her to take medicine—she told me her sister had given it to her when she was ill—I was gone about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour at the outside—I had a key and let myself in—I found the prisoner standing at the foot of the stairs—I observed a great deal of blood in the passage and on the stairs-—I told her 1 thought she had been delivered of a child—she positively denied it and said she had not, that</p>

On the 1st of July I received a communication from Moody, in consequence of which I went into the roadway leading to my master's premises, and saw a new born female child—I picked it up and put it in my apron—the navel string was exposed, and through that I observed its not being many moments born—on the way to the doctor's I looked at it, and it was foaming at the mouth—I observed a lump on the side of its head, and the shoulder very much dis<lb/>figured—I took it to Dr. Carruthers's shop, by the York-road, Lambeth—a policeman was sent for—the child was alive.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the surgeon of Lambeth workhouse. On the 1st of July a messenger from the workhouse came to fetch me—I went, and saw the child—it was in the possession of a nurse—the head appeared very much contused, the bones of the skull appeared fractured, and the back of the child was bruised very much—it lived about two hours after I saw it—an after-birth was also produced to me, I think by Hart—in my judgment, the bruise on the head caused the death—the other bruises were not of a very serious nature.</p>

Q.</hi> Do you know the age of the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe she is about nineteen—the head is the first part that makes its appearance in the world, in a confinement—I should think the bruises were not such as would arise from the child striking its head against the stairs, if suspended from the mother—striking the head against the stairs, or any hard substance, would produce the appearances I saw—the loss of blood, if the mother deli<lb/>vered herself, would very much affect her mind—it might affect the brain, so as to produce almost frenzy—I should say a mother so young as seventeen or eighteen would have great difficulty in delivering herself—it is very doubtful how long it would take for a girl of her age to deliver herself, it depends on the obstacles met with—supposing the pains of labour had not come on, I should think it would be impossible for a person to be delivered under some hours—I cannot say—I examined the person of the prisoner when she came into the hospital, about two hours after I had seen the child—there were symptoms of her having been delivered.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a newsvender, at the Railway station, London-bridge, and live in Duke-street, Southwark. In March last I had a cash-box in my bed-room containing 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in gold, and three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; notes, one of which was No. 61086—I took this memorandum from the note when I received it from a customer—I know Buckley—in Nov. last she requested me to lend her 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, to relieve her from some embarrassments which she was then in, and she would pay me in a fortnight—I lent it her, but she did not repay me—in Dec. she met me in the Borough, and asked me for the loan of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get a shawl out of pledge, that she might be enabled to get a situation or earn a better living—I said I would not lend her any more money—she said, "I am really in the most destitute condition"—I said if she was so destitute, she might come to my house, and probably my wife would relieve her, by allowing her to remain in the house, and providing her with victuals—next day, when I went home to dinner, I found her there, and there she remained for five weeks, supported by us—in Jan. she obtained a situation as servant of all-work, in the Kent-road—my wife was very ill, and being in want of a servant, Buckley's sister, Brown, came to us immediately after she left—on the 10th of Feb. the sister applied to me for some money, which I lent her—I then prevented Buckley coming to the house, suspecting she had stolen a handkerchief of mine—she did not come to the house after that with my con<lb/>sent—at the time she was residing with us, her husband was in Ireland—he was a labourer—at the time I lent her the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, he was keeping a beer-shop in Francis-street, Westminster-road, and their means there were so insuffi<lb/>cient, that Messrs. Thone, the brewers, turned them out because they had not money enough to pay them for the beer—I heard that from Buckley—in March her husband was in the hospital—I was not at home on Friday even<lb/>ing, the 8th of March—I might have been out as late as eleven—I left my wife at home—a lady, named Thompson, was lodging in the house—in con<lb/>sequence of something her servant communicated to me, I made inquiries, and missed my money on Monday the 11th of March, between a quarter and half-past twelve—my wife first missed it—I heard that Buckley had been there on the Friday preceding—nothing was missed between the Friday and the Monday—the last time the cash-box was seen safe was on the Thursday—I know this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; note now produced, No. 61086—that, with two others which have not been found, was in the cash-box.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Wellington-street, Strand. I have seen Buck<lb/>ley once—a relative of hers, named Quin, lived servant with me—I have known Wigzell about a year—on the 29th of June she brought me a note to change—I took the number of it at the time—I scratched it with my finger<lb/>nail on the back of a letter—I have it here—it is 61086—I sent Mary Quin to get it changed—I believe she is a relation of Wigzell's—while Quin was gone Wigzell said her husband had found it—she afterwards said, "If any<lb/>thing is said about it, for God's sake say it was given to you by a gentleman"—I live at a cigar-shop.</p>

Salati on that—Fielitz tried to imitate it—Valler said he was quite satisfied, and what he would give him to do, the signature he wanted him to do would not be so long as Salati—he then produced this (F), and said that was the work, and he wished him to put a full name similar to that, and he should have fifty for him—he appointed next Saturday to call at the house at eight in the morning to come to my residence—he never came.</p>

               <p>twelve o'clock on the 6th of July I was in Lambeth-walk—I saw the prisoners together—they turned down Regent-street—Fitzgerald went into one shop previous to his going to Mrs. Gadd's—he came out again, and they went down Regent-street—I saw Coombs standing out by a post—Fitzgerald went into Gadd's shop, and came out with the till in his two hands—they then both turned round the corner, and were out of sight—I have been in the police, and had seen both the prisoners before, and knew them—I pursued them at fast as I could—they ran down Dorie-street—there is a kind of bend in that street, and I lost sight of them, but just as I got near the corner I heard the sound of money rattling—I got round the corner, and saw these two farthings—the prisoner had got rid of the till, and had something in the centre of a handkerchief, and both of them had hold of it—I called, "Stop thief," but I could not catch them—I went to a garden at the corner of Dorie-street, and the persons said they had picked up the till—I got this till there—the pri<lb/>soners had passed that place as they were going—I am superannuated through injuries I received in the force.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a laceman, and live in High-street, Borough. In consequence of some circumstances I made an arrangement with Mrs. Bell, on the evening of the 26th of July—I marked 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the following morning, at ten o'clock, Mrs. Bell was to spend the whole or part of it—she came, and</p>

               <p>spent 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—shortly after I met Mrs. Bell I returned to my house, and sent the prisoner out for an errand—I threw a shilling on the counter from my pocket, but I drew the till out and shut it again, as if I took the shilling from the till—he went out, and staid two or three minutes—I then examined the till, and missed one shilling, but I thought he might have spent it, and I did not take him then—the till owed him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for some coppers that he had put is in the morning, and in an hour and a half my wife passed half-a-crown into his hand, and he gave her two shillings, which she immediately passed into my hand, and one of them was the marked shilling which was missing from the drawer—he did not take them from the drawer, but from his waistcoat pocket—my wife was not aware of the marks on the money—I was fearful to give the prisoner into custody—I consulted the officers, and I directed them to come at six o'clock in the evening, and take him—they found another marked shil<lb/>ling on him which was not missing at the time the other was.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 15th of July I saw the prisoner in the New-cut, coming across to Charlotte-street, riding at a very furious rate—I saw him urge on the horse with his right hand—he applied his spur, and likewise beat the horse with his right hand—I saw him some</p>

               <p>time before I saw the deceased—the deceased was crossing from Rowland Hill's chapel, across Charlotte-street, when he was knocked down—I heard Kelly cry out three times—when I first heard Kelly cry out the deceased was not far from the horse's head—he had not time to get out of the way of it—I do not know which way the child who was with him escaped, but I think Kelly's hallooing made the child let go the father's hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with my father, John Samuel Read, on the 15th of July, crossing from Rowland Hill's chapel across Charlotte-street—the prisoner was just going to knock my father down when I first saw him—I was by Rowland Hill's chapel when I first heard Kelly cry out—I only heard him call out once—I did not hear the prisoner call out—I was behind my father when he was knocked down—I did not cross with my father—I stopped to look at some sheep which were going down Blackfriars-road.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant surgeon at St. Thomas's Hospital. On the 15th of July, Read was brought into the hospital perfectly insensible—the cause of death was extravasation of blood into and upon the surface of the brain—I inquired into the nature of the accident—the blow and concussion that he received were the cause of death—the appearances were such as were likely to have been produced by the accident described—there was a small scalp wound which was trivial, but there was extravasation of blood sufficient to cause death.</p>

                  </hi>. I was driving my own omnibus this day from Kennington-gate to the Angel at Islington—I saw the prisoner on horse<lb/>back—there are four roads meet at the spot described—I saw the deceased and the little boy about the centre of the road, in the carriage way, and the prisoner coming along out of Great Charlotte-street to go into Little Char<lb/>lotte-street—he was in a condition to see the deceased before he called out—he called out twice—he pulled up sufficient to have cleared the deceased if he had not turned, but his hat blew off, and he stooped—the boy ran back again to the pavement—while the deceased was stooping the shoulder of the horse struck him in the side, which knocked him down—I did not see whether the horse kicked him or trod upon him—the prisoner was travelling a gentle canter, at the rate of seven or eight miles an hour—he certainly was not galloping furiously.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a consulting surgeon. I am not at all acquainted with the prisoner or his friends—Cowling told me the prisoner was to be tried for manslaughter—I said perhaps it was important for him to have as many witnesses as he could, and as a matter of justice I had no ob<lb/>jection to state what I knew—I was riding upon the box of Cowling's omni<lb/>bus this day with the driver—we were going very slowly, and were very close to Great Charlotte-street—I saw the prisoner coming along on horseback, at the rate of seven or eight miles an hour—the horse lifted his feet very high, and made a great noise, something like what they call a butcher's trot—when about half way across Black friars-road the prisoner hallooed out—the deceased was passing along from Rowland Hill's chapel, as if going along Blackfriars-road towards the Surrey gate—he was not going along the crossing that is used there—he was further in Little Charlotte-street—the boy was with him—they made a movement to cross before the horse, after the prisoner had called out—I did not notice the deceased's hat fall off, but he seemed to make a halt and hesitation, and turned round—the little boy ran back, leaving him in the road, and it was then that he was struck by the horse's shoulder—the prisoner was not beating or spurring the horse at that time that I saw—he checked when he hallooed out—he might have stopped the horse entirely, but I considered at the time it was the deceased's hesitation, and turning round in the road which caused the coalition—I should say the prisoner pulled up his horse within six yards of the deceased from the place where he was struck—he turned back of his own accord, and rode back to the accident, and then the omnibus I was on drove on—I had no idea the coalition would have killed the deceased—he was not thrown forcibly on the ground, but made a rotary motion, and then fell—I do not think there was any kick, as from the position of the parties, if there had been, it would have been at the lower part of the man, not his head—I did not observe anything furious in the prisoner's driving—it was not a place which was likely to be dangerous—I consider he gave sufficient warning, that if there bad been more persons on the crossing they might have got out of the way.</p>
