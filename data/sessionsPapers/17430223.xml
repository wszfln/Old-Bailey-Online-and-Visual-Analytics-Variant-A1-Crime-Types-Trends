               <p>- I am Porter to Mr Lane: I was just come back from delivering a Burthen; says this Girl, One of the Women who were in the Shop, has stole a Cheese; I threw down my Basket, and asked which Way they were gone; and followed them, the tallest had nothing upon her. I found it in the Apron of the shortest, and said, Oh! you brazenfac'd Hussies, how could you come into a Shop under the pretence of buying, and steal a Cheese? The shortest one said, she did not take it, but the other Woman took it; I found them in Bull-head Court.</p>

            . On the 29th of January, the Prisoner came to my Shop, to offer two four- pronged Forks unfinished. I said they looked pretty suspicious, and did not care to buy them. He said he found them. I told him it would be the most fair and reputable Way to keep them, for there would be Warnings out about them. He said he would sell them presently, for he once found a Gold Watch Case, and carried it to the Gentleman, according as the Advertisement directed, and the Gentleman did not give him any Thing. - He came to me before the Warnings were out, or I had stopped him.</p>

He asked me what it was worth an Ounce; I told him: He said he had been bid 5 s. 6 d. I told him then he had no Occasion to ask if it was Silver. There was a Woman with him, who came into the Shop. He said he had about forty Ounces; he took a brown Paper from under his Coat, and showed them me; I asked him how he came by them, and he said he found them; said I, these Things are certainly stole; whether you found them or no, if you act like an honest Man, you will keep them by you; or leave them with me, for there will certainly be Warnings out after them; he said, he once found a Gold Watch-Case, and found the Owner out by the Coat of Arms, and the Gentleman was so ungenerous that he would not give him any Thing; and he said, if I would not buy them he would sell them to somebody else directly - there were thirty three Ounces three Quarters.

Missing my Goods, I advertised them, and had some Bills given to the Shoemakers, for I thought they might be sold to some-body of the Trade : Mr Laws came to me, and told me, he believed he had bought some of my Goods; he said there were two Pair of plain Clogs; on the Thursday following, he sent his Man with another Pair, I went, and the Prisoner was secured: They were my Cloge, these are the Goods, the Prisoner served his Time with me, which was out about fourteen Months ago; I charged him with being concerned in the Fact, and he said, that himself, Johnson, and Morris, were concerned in this robbery: On the Saturday Night, he said he watched my Wife into the Closet, and while she was there, he stole the Key and Pin out of the Window; that they came again about Two o'Clock, and took the Bar and Shutter down, and took the Goods out of the Window; that they divided them among them.

            . The Prisoner brought some Clogs to my House, and I bought them, as I had bought of him several Times before; I did not suspect them to be stole, till I had seen Mr Hollingsworth's Advertisement. He came to me again, and I stopped him, and Mr Hollingsworth came and owned the Goods. The Prisoner said, that late on Saturday Night, he watched an Opportunity, when the good Woman's Back was turned, and whipt the Key and Pin out of the Window-Shutter, and waited till about two or three in the Morning, and then took the Shutter down, broke a Pane of Glass, and took out twenty Pair of Clogs, and one Pair of Leather Pattens; that they divided them, and there was seven Pair a Piece; and he impeached two others. - Colonel De Veil asked him whether he had any Body concerned with him, and at first he said no; the Colonel told him it would be better for him to confess the Truth, as he might have an Opportunity of saving himself; then he fell a crying, confessed it, and told us his Accomplices; he said he was the Projector of the Thing, and was concerned with them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him, when he bought them of me, whether he did not think I could make them for the Money he gave me, or that he could buy them of other People so?</p>
               <p>Laws. We always buy cheaper of them than we do of a Shop-Keeper. They will sometimes give their Labour away, and they can afford to sell them cheaper than a Shop-Keeper can. I detected him as soon as I suspected they were stole.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Master says he did not see the Shutter down till Eight o'Clock in the Morning; if it was broke at Two, How could the Watchman go by so often without seeing it, and letting him know it?</p>
               <p>Hollingsworth. Then you question whether it was broke open at all?</p>

I was the Person, that entered the House; and I will tell you, by what Method; I lay concealed upon the Stairs till Three o'Clock, and then I thought they were all asleep. - At three o'Clock I came into the inner, and then into the outer Court, and Bulley helped me up over the Pallisades; there was a Sash-Window, which I lifted up and entered in, as better knowing the House than he did (though he knew it pretty well). I went down, opened the Door, and let them in, and they struck a Light with their Tinder-box, which they had with them, and broke the Beauset up; they filled two Bags, which they carried away with them, and they left more Plate behind, than they took away: They might have taken Plates and Dishes along with them, which they said were Pewter, and they would not take them; but they were Plate; it was better than this Trumpery.

I unbarred and unbolted the Door and let them in - at the outer Door of the House - they went directly into the Kitchen and struck a Light with their Tinder-Box, and lighted a Candle; I shewed them where the Beauset was; and with a Gimblet and a Knife they opened it, and took out what they pleased; they made themselves up 2 Packs, and then went into the Kitchen to see what was there, and they took that Sauce-pan; there was another which was a little blacker than that, which they would not take: I suppose they thought it was not Silver, but they took enough away, and too much too - I am sure the 2 Prisoners are the Persons who took the Plate away, Gentlemen: I have not known the Woman above three Months, but I have known him 20 Years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know she is his Wife?</p>
               <p>Steele. I do not know whether she is or not, he has 2 or 3 Wives.</p>

On Sunday Night last, Mr Taylor sent for me, with a Message, that he desired to speak with me; he said, he believed he had got a Person who would give him Information of the People who had got the Plate: I went with the Person to a House in Horselydown, but I did not see them that Night; I went over again the next Morning with a Search-Warrant; there are two Doors to the House, 2 of us went in at the Fore Door, and I and another went in at the Back-Door; the first Person I saw was

            , Surgeon. I saw the Deceased about three Days after this unfortunate Affair happened; the Reason I sent my Apprentice was, I thought it to be only a common Quarrel, and I love to keep out of those Things if I can: My Servant gave me an Account in what Manner he was wounded, he had one of his Teeth beat out, and had a Wound upon his Forehead; I visited him several Times, he complained of Bruises; he had declined taking of Things some time before he died, I apprehended the Reason of that was, for fear of Expences: I opened him the 16th of this Month.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any Thing when you opened him, by which you can swear, what was the Occasion of his Death?</p>
               <p>Perkins. All the Inwards of the Body were perfectly found, except the Left Lobe of the Liver; I made an Incision and found an Imposthume in it: I understand he had been an ailing Man before, and had lately had a Fever; the Fever might have settled there, and have been the Occasion of the Imposthume: - I believe this might hasten his Death. - The Blow he had on the Head could not occasion that Disorder in the Body; a Blow on the Body will too often occasion an inward Disorder. <rs id="t17430223-21-verdict113" type="verdictDescription">

Says he, D - n your Blood, and threatened me if I did not go back what he would do to me. I knew the Captain, and went to him, and he sent him to the Black-Hold. Then he said, a Custom-House-Officer had taken the Goods from him by St Giles's Pound, and when he found the Commitment was made for him to go to New-Prison, he owned where the Tea was; that there was nine Pound at Mr Lovelace's, ten Pound in another Place, three Pound at another, and two Pound his Wife had.</p>

I went to one Mr Kirkpatrick's, and informed him of what had happened, and he went along with me; she came back in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174302230019"/> about an Hour and an Half, and was asking for her Child; says the Woman of the House, Don't you know the Woman that robbed you? That's the Woman: Mr Kirkpatrick, desired me to go to Justice Frazer's and get a Warrant, and he kept her in the House till I got a Warrant, and they carried her to the Round-house, and took her up Stairs to search her; the Constable said, You must not burt the Woman, you must be gentle with her; she wanted to go to the Little-house, but the Constable would not let her, she was searched, and the Money took from under her Arm-pits; then I told her, she might go to the Little-house, and she said, You be d - d, Sir, I do not want to go to the Little-house, any more than you; she said, the Money was mine, and desired I might have it, there were Eighteen Guineas, and she said, she would give me a Bond, or Note, for the rest.</p>

            . I was with the Prosecutor at Lancaster's and had a Bowl of Punch; after that was out we had another; Brown pulled his Money out and counted it, and she counted it, and took it off the Table; says he, What have you to do with my Money? says she, Sir, you need not be afraid of your Money, if it was ten thousand Pounds: She said, she wanted to make Water; he gave her Liberty to go, and it was not 2 Minutes before she made off: She was taken up, and I saw the Money taken from her, there were 18 Guineas, it was concealed somewhere about her Breast. She told the Justice if he would take his Money again and make it up, she would give him a Note for what she had made away with; and sometimes she said, he lent it her. - He was not disguised with Liquor.

I offered her one Guinea, and at last I came up to two, rather than have any farther Trouble; she said she had borrowed it for two Days, and she would give it him again when she was able and willing. She said she did not mind a Warrant; we took her to the Watch-house, and kept her till the Beadle came, and then she was searched, and eighteen Guineas were found about her Breast. When she came before the Justice, she was in a Swoon; and she fell down upon her Knees, and said she would give Bond for any Thing he would, to make Satisfaction.</p>

            . I was Constable of the Night, the Prisoner was brought to St Martin's Round-House, and was very abusive; I desired her to go up to be searched, but she would not; the Beadle said if she would not go up, she must go down, so he went down Stairs with her; she desired to go to the Vault first; I had not Presence of Mind just then, but I presently recollected myself; Thinks I, she has certainly got this Money, and wants to convey it away. She said she had something to do that was not proper to be done before Men. I told her I would not suffer her to do it till she was searched. She was very unwilling to have her Gown pulled off. I found she was guilty by her Looks. The Beadle untied two of her Petticoats, and I told her I would search her to her Smock, if she would not confess; she seemed to pull something out of her Pocket, and went to conceal it, as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174302230020"/> I suppose, under her Arm Pits, but the Beadle caught it in her Hand before she could convey it there - She did say she borrowed it of the Prosecutor, and that she would trounce me for robbing of her.</p>

Said I, Did you know the Woman before ? Yes, said he, I know her very well at Portsmouth, she used to come on board the Ship with Goods. Said I, How came she to get your Money? said he, I left it with her because I thought to be out all Night upon the Rake; says he, I knew my Money was very safe, because I knew she was to receive some Money in a little Time, and that she could not run away. He told me, that a Friend or two of his and her's came to Town to be Goods, and that their Acquaintance had laid out 40 or 50 Pounds at Pawnbrokers Shops, and other Places that the Prisoner had taken them to.</p>

               <p>They then stated the Circumstances relating to these six Bonds with which the Prisoner was charged, and to which only their Evidence would be consined : That in 1736, there being then a great Number of East-India Bonds in the Custody of the Bank; and the East-India Company resolving to reduce the Interest, that made it necessary to apply to the Court of Chancery, to have the taken out and exchanged for the Company's new Bonds; and that some of these Bonds would appear to be some of those Bonds which were thus brought to the Bank upon such Exchange; that as soon as they were brought there, they were carried to the Account of the particular Persons to whom they belonged, and the Prisoner himself gave Receipts for them, which should be produced: That on the 21st of April, the Court of Chancery, in the Cause of Broome and Broome, (that Cause being then at an End) ordered seventeen Bonds which were in the Bank to be delivered out; they went to the Bank to receive these Bonds, and seventeen Bonds were delivered them, by the Prisoner at the Bar; but those not being the same identical Bonds which were described in the Cause, but of different Numbers, upon this there was an Application made to the Bank, to get the right Bonds; and the Directors desired Mr Waite to look them out accordingly. Nobody thought there was any Thing unfair in it, but that he had taken the seventeen uppermost Bonds without any particular Reason; this occasioned an Enquiry, and the Prisoner said he would look into it, and set it right; but no Body suspecting him, he took an Opportunity of getting away; and though there were frequent Advertisements, with great Rewards for the apprehending him, there was nothing heard of him till he was taken in Ireland, about two or three Months ago. That Mr Waite going away in this Manner, occasioned a farther Enquiry: He had a little Desk at the Bank, wherein they imagined there might be some Bonds; this Desk was ordered to be broke open, and there were two Bonds in it, which were a little before brought in by Order of the Court of Chancery.</p>
               <p>That as these Bonds were taken away, the Bank had endeavoured to trace them, in order to know how they had been disposed of, and by whom; and were able to prove that the Prisoner at the Bar carried six of them to a Broker, said they were his own; that the Broker sold them for him, and that the Money was paid into his own Hands; and from thence they hoped it would appear, that the Bonds were stolen by him, and that he applied the Money to his own Use; that there would be a little Difference as to the Evidence, with Respect to some of the Bonds: These Six, being all the Bonds they could trace, it would be proper to state upon what Account they were brought into the Bank.

            2341, both inclusive, and the Prisoner gave a Receipt for these Bonds, dated July 23, 1737; which says, they are received for the Governor and Company of the Bank of England.</p>
               <p>Then there is No. 2740, brought in, in the Cause of Boswell and Smiter; this Bond was delivered into the Hands of the Prisoner at the Bar, and he gave the like sort of a Receipt for this, as he did for the other two: Then these three No. 9671, 20311, 23335, were brought in by Order of the Court of Chancery, in the Cause of Wheeler and Harvey, (there were twenty in all) these were brought to the Bank, when the Prisoner happened not to be there, and were delivered to another Cashier, but upon the Prisoner's Return, as he was the Person that principally managed this A ffair, they were delivered to him; and these are three of those Bonds which they should prove were sold by the Order, and on the Account of the Prisoner at the Bar, and if so, there would remain no Doubt at all, that the Charge was brought home to the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>That considering the Nature of the Case as it stands together, his disposing of these Bonds clandestinely, without any Sort of Authority, without communicating it to any Person belonging to the Bank, or concerned for the Bank; clandestinely conveying away these Bonds, delivering them into Mr Willoughby's Hand, as his own, directing him to sell and dispose of them, receiving the Money for them, and converting it to his own Use; these Bonds being taken out of a great Number which were under his Care; his not carrying away the whole Number, but separating of them, and converting them into Money for his own Use, in Fraud of the Bank, in Fraud of the Suitors, (if they had not Reparation made them by the Bank) and in Fraud to all Mankind; putting the Money into his Pocket and running away with it: If considering it in this Light, and under these Circumstances, this should not be allowed to be a felonious taking, what upon Earth could be said to be a felonious taking: What is the Difference between this and going to the Coffers of the Bank and taking out so much Money? the Bank are equal Sufferers, for they are to make this good: If he had got by this iniquitous Way 5000 l. it is the same as if he had gone to their Coffers and taken 500 l. out of them: That always, in these Cases, of great Weight; that the Jury are to enquire whether the Prisoner sled for it or no; the Law had a good Intention in that, for flying is an Institution of Guilt. That the Indictment is laid for stealing these Bonds out of a Dwelling-House, which takes from the Prisoner the Benefit of the Clergy; and the Bank is the Dwelling-House, where the Accomptant-General used to live with his Family, and if any Doubt were made of that they were prepared to make it appear in Point of Law, to be a Dwelling-House; and it is not laid, in the Indictment, to be the Dwelling-House of any particular Person, but properly and cautiously laid to be a Dwelling-House, wherein Zerubbabel Crouch, and divers other Persons to the Jurors unknown, did then and there inhabit; and this was done to prevent any Inconvenience that might arise from laying it as the Dwelling-House of a Body corporate. In like Manner, as in the Case of Bambridge, Warden of the Fleet, that Prison was laid to be a Dwelling-House, wherein A. B. and divers other Persons, to the Jurors unknown, did inhabit.</p>

               <p>Collyer. I cannot say that I do. (The Receipt was shewn to him ) I own this to be my Hand writing, it was brought to me by Mr Standish, who was an entering Clerk.</p>
               <p>Mr Standish. I received these Bonds in Mr Waite's Absence and entered them, Mr Collyer sign'd the Receipt, [The Act of Parliament directs the Receipt should be signed by a Cashier] and when Mr Waite came back I delivered them into his Hands - It might be 2 or 3 Hours after I received them - I gave them to Mr Waite and he locked them up in his Desk - it was his own Desk; we have each of us a Desk to lock up every Thing we have in Trust - No Body had the Key of that Desk but himself. - These Bonds should regularly have been carried down into a Vault. The Directors have the Keys of the Vault; Mr Waite had only the Keys of a particular Chest. - I never went down with the Directors, and do not know whether one, two, or three go down.</p>

               <p>King's Counc. There is another Thing we are ready to prove, that as the Bank is obliged to make good these Bonds, that they have bought others and replaced them.</p>
               <p>The Order of the Court of Chancery of the 10th of July 1741, was read; whereby the Bonds deficient in the Cause of Draper against Pit, Boswell against Smiter, &amp;c. to the Amount of 133 were ordered to be replaced by the Bank.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pyle, an Officer of the Report-Office, produced the Certificates, whereby it appeared that the Bank had replaced them.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. My Lord, as to Matters of Fact, I am under very great Restrictions, and that is the Misfortune of the Prisoner. He is only assisted, if Matter of Law arise in this Case, and then we are only at Liberty to speak for him, as to that. I submit it upon the Prosecutors own Evidence, whether upon the Circumstances they have proved, he is guilty of the Crime laid to his Charge. I shall not endeavour to state any Thing contrary to the Facts; and considering the Evidence in the strongest Sense, the single Question is, whether this Taking of his does amount to a felonious Taking or not. I will not dispute that the Bank has a special Property, and may bring an Action of Trover, and lay an Indictment for it: And I would not have this forgot, and I believe the Witnesses will not deny it, that as the Prisoner is a Proprietor in the Bank, he may have a special Interest in this Corporation; these Bonds may be the Property of the Bank, but the Question is, whether he, as a Proprietor of Bank-Stock, has not a Right with the rest of the Company; and whether a Man, even in that Respect, can be indicted for stealing Goods in which he has a Property; that will be one Thing to be considered in this Man's Defence, and I could even submit it upon the Circumstances of that single Point, whether this does amount to a felonious Taking.</p>
               <p>I will not state the whole Facts, because I know I am not allowed to do it, and therefore I will state it upon their own Evidence; and I beg leave to say, that the Prisoner has been entrusted with these Bonds, that he has had these<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174302230027"/> Bonds delivered to him, and has given Receipts for them in his own Name; therefore I submit it, whether, under these Circumstances, he ought to be indicted for a felonious Taking of these very Bonds which were so delivered to him, tho' I do not doubt but he did dispose of them against his Trust, this Man being under Misfortunes at that Time, tho' they were not publickly known; but I apprehend the disposing of them will never make him guilty of Felony, unless the taking them was Felony.</p>
               <p>Court. We shall leave that to the Jury, whether it was with a felonious Intent that he took them away.</p>
               <p>2d Counc. I submit it to your Lordship, whether they have gone far enough in a Case of this Nature. They have laid the Bonds as the Property of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, and have described the Money to be due to the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, and unsatisfied to them; and as to the second Count, they say, if we have not been right in laying them to be the Property of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, we have laid them to be the Property of a Person unknown; and not any one of the Witnesses they have produced has shown, that the Governor or Company of the Bank of England, have any Right to this Money at all; and according to the laying of this Count in the Indictment, they should have shewn the Money to be due to the Governor and Company of the Bank of England; or according to the second Count, that the Bonds were the Property of a Person unknown. I must submit it to your Lordship, that they have failed in proving either Count, so as to affect the Prisoner; for if, as they have proved the Governor and Company of the Bank had a Property, then these Bonds were not the Property of Persons unknown; and if the Governor and Company of the Bank could not receive the Money for them (being a Deposit only) then the Money cannot be due to them, as is set out in the Indictment.</p>
               <p>King's Counc. You mistake it, in the third Count it is, was due and unsatisfied to the several Proprietors thereof; in the fourth Count it is laid to be the Property of a Person unknown, and remains due and unsatisfied to the said Person unknown. Mr Serjeant Wynne says right, that it will maintain an Action of Trover, or support an Indictment; the Bank were answerable, and we have proved they were answerable.</p>
               <p>2d King's Counc. Take this one Way or the other, it incontestably hits him: First, they are laid to be the Property of the Bank of England; secondly, the Property of a Person unknown. Now take it upon the first, it cannot be disputed but that the Bank has a special Property: In the Case of a Bailment of Goods and Pledges, the special Property is in the Bail, in whom the Property is placed. Wilbraham and Snow, 2 Saunders 47. A Carrier can bring an Action. They must either be the Property of those who were originally entitled to them, or the Property of other Persons: One of the Witnesses says, there was a Dispute between the Parties who had the Property in the Bonds, and this shows them plainly to be the Property of Persons unknown.</p>
               <p>(Part of the Indictment read)</p>
               <p>'' Was the Property of the Governor and Company '' of the Bank of England, and was then due '' and unsatisfied to the Proprietors thereof.''</p>
               <p>Pris. Counc. Mr Bootle says, if they do not belong to the one they do to the other, that is very true; but they have fixed the Property in the Bank of England, and therefore their being the Property of a Person unknown, is quite out of the Case; therefore they must make it out that the Governor and Company of the Bank of England may receive the Money: It will be admitted that they had a special Property, so far as to have the Custody of the Bonds, but not such a Property as to receive the Money, or that the Money was due and owing to them. They have laid this Money to be the Money of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England; they might safely have said the Money was unsatisfied, but it was not the Money of the Bank of England. The Gentlemen of the other Side say, that the Bank has made it good; but I apprehend what the Bank has done, was upon a Time subsequent to the Fact, and this should have been at the Time of the taking away, therefore I think this does not support the Indictment. Then, as to the second Count, it says the Property of a Person unknown.</p>
               <p>King's Counc. It says each of the Bonds is the Property of a Person unknown.</p>
               <p>Court. I think this is the Description of the Bonds; it says the Bonds were the Property of the Bank of England, and that the Bonds were then due and unsatisfied to the Bank, and the Proprietors thereof.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. It is due and owing to the Proprietors thereof.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is entitled to receive the Money due upon these Bonds; may not the Person who has the Custody and Possession of them receive it?</p>
               <p>King's Counc. They are endorsed to the Bank.</p>
               <p>Court. If you will but look at them, you will see they are endorsed Blank.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174302230028"/>Pris. Counc. Whoever had the lawful Possession of these Bonds, cannot be guilty of Felony.</p>
               <p>Court. I may have the lawful Possession of a Thing, and yet be guilty of Felony.</p>
               <p>King's Council (to the Prisoner's Council.) If you will argue the Point of Law, go on, or else examine your Witnesses.</p>
               <p>Pris. Couns. We want to examine your's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Collyer called.</p>
               <p>Pris. Counc. Give an Account to my Lord and the Jury, when these Bonds were delivered to Mr Waite, which were brought to the Bank in his Absence?</p>
               <p>Collyer. I can give no Account of it at all, till I turn to the Receipt. I believe they were delivered to him that Day. This is my Hand-writing; the Bonds were delivered to the Prisoner, the 7th of April, 1741. - They were the Bonds in the Cause of Wheeler against Harvey. These are Part of those twenty Bonds.</p>
               <p>Pris. Council to Standish. Don't you know that Mr. Waite is a Proprietor of Bank-Stock.</p>
               <p>Standish. I believe he has been possessed of Bank-Stock - I cannot swear whether he is now or not. *</p>
               <p>* The Prisoner had been possessed of 1000 l. Bank-Stock, which he transferred as Part of his Security; but this did not appear in Evidence.</p>
               <p>Pris. Counc. We cannot get at the Bank Books to prove this.</p>
               <p>King's Counc . He has no Bank-Stock. The Prisoner's two Receipts are dated, one on the 23d of July, 1737, the other, on the 22d of December, 1740, and the other Bonds, for which Collyer gave a Receipt, came to his Hand the 7th of April 1741, and they were sold the 27th of the same Month by his Order; and therefore I submit it to your Lordship whether this was a felonious taking or not.</p>

            . c. 25, the stealing and carrying away Bonds and other Securities (or Choses in Action, as they were then called) could not be Felony; but by that Act of Parliament it is made Felony. As it is agreed that the making this Felony, is founded on this Act of Parliament, I desire it may be read, and then I will submit it to your Lordship, that this is not a felonious taking, as the Circumstances will be made out.</p>
               <p>The Clause read.</p>
               <p>'' And be it further enacted, by the Authority aforesaid, That if any Person or Persons, after the said 29th of June, shall steal, or take by Robbery, any Exchequer Orders, &amp;c. East-India-Bonds, &amp;c. being the Property of any other Person or Persons, or of any Corporation, notwithstanding any of the said Particulars are termed, in Law, a Chose in Action, it shall be deemed and construed to be Felony, of the same Nature, and in the same Degree, and with or without the Benefit of Clergy, in the same Manner as it would have been if the Offender had stolen, or taken by Robbery, any other Goods of like Value with the Monies due on such Orders, &amp;c.''</p>
               <p>Pris. Counc. My Lord, I shall trouble your Lordship with a Word or two upon this Head; and I believe, upon the Circumstances of the Case, this will not appear to be a felonious taking; the Words have been read to your Lordship, that such Persons who shall steal or take, by Robbery, any Bonds, Orders, &amp;c. shall be guilty of Felony, as if such Offender had stole Money or Goods: It was admitted, on the other Side, that this was not Felony by the Common Law; (the stealing of Bonds, Warrants, &amp;c.) and he was pleased to give a very good Reason for it, that these Securities were not so common, or numerous as they are now; and therefore the Case of Property being very much altered, there was a Necessity of altering the Law, and, I believe, the Act of Parliament takes Notice of it fully: It is not a declaratory Act of Parliament, but introductive of a new Law, and the Question is, whether they have offered your Lordship any Evidence to bring this Case within the present Act of Parliament: By this Act of Parliament, it must be an actual stealing or taking by Robbery: What Evidence has been offered to your Lordship, to shew that there has been any stealing, or taking by Robbery? they are Terms extremely well understood in Point of Law; if they are taken by the Person who has the Possession, (that is a right Possession) if it is by the Privity or Consent of the Owner, or by an actual Delivery to the Person, by him or his Order, that cannot make it to be a felonious taking; the Intention of the Statute is only to make Choses in Action, and which are Part of a Man's Property secure; that seems to be the Intention of the last Act of Parliament, that the taking of these should be punished in the same Degree and Manner, as if a Person had taken Goods or Money to the same Value. But the Law makes no Difference in these, it intends no Alteration at all, either in the Nature of the Crime, or the Consequences of it. My Lord, I take the Thing to be pretty clear, that where a Thing is delivered to a Person;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174302230029"/> where it is entrusted with him, and put into his Possession and Custody, I think that cannot be Felony; though the Party does unhappily abuse his Trust, that will not make it Felony, it will not alter the Original Trust so as to make it Felony; and I believe there are many Authorities which may be mentioned to prove this, 1 Hale 667. The Gentlemen say, it is very clear that he sold them, and converted the Produce to his own Use: It was urged that the strongest Argument of his Guilt was, his flying and running away with the Money; an honest Man is sometimes forced to go out of the Way for Debt; but this does not infer the Crime of Felony; and I will suppose, for Argument Sake, that the Prisoner has converted this Money to his own Use, and, if so, it is certainly a Misdemeanor, and a Breach of Trust, for which he must be answerable another Way: Aand in Answer to such a general Argument as was made Use of in the out-set; I must say, that any Man that designs a Felony does not use to give Receipts, but he gave Receipts under his own Hand to shew the Delivery of these Things, and his receiving them: And, as I have mentioned Possession in general, I may further add, where a Man is intrusted with Goods, and has the Possession of them, for a particular Purpose, that Man cannot be guilty of Felony. Hawkins 89.</p>
               <p>If a Man has Possession of any Goods, by Delivery, he cannot commit a Felony; as with Respect to the Case of a Carrier that goes away with Goods which were put into his Hands to deliver to another. Hale's Abrigdment 61. Hist. Pleas of the Crown, 506. Hawkins 89.</p>
               <p>If the Carrier goes away with these Goods, carries them to a wrong Place, by which they are lost, or sells them, it has been determined over and over again, that this is not Felony. One of the Gentlemen made use of an Expression, that the Prisoner separated the Bonds, that he had Possession of them, and took them out of a greater Number; that he embezzled them and applied them to his own Use. I do allow there is a Distinction in this, for if a Carrier breaks open a Pack, or a Chest, or a Trunk, and sells Part of the Goods, the Carrier then may be said to be guilty of Felony. If a Man delivers or lends an Horse to another, and he rides away with it, this Person is not guilty of Felony: This is a common Case in all the Books, and I rely strongly upon it. I have known the Case tried here. Suppose a Man comes to an Inn-keeper under Pretence of chaffering for a Horse, and when he has got upon his Back, rides away with it; this is not Felony. 1 Hale 504. But there is a Distinction in the Statute, where a Servant takes a Horse, without the Leave of his Master, and rides away with it, that is Felony by the Statute of

            .</p>
               <p>I might trouble your Lordship with a great many more Cases, but I will leave it upon this; here are a great many Bonds delivered to and entrusted with an Officer of the Bank, and he sells them, &amp;c. I submit it to your Lordship, that from the Authority of the Officer, it is not a felonious taking. I am not contending that a Man is not answerable another Way; but the Question is, whether the Law will support a Prosecution for a Felony. As to Mr Waite's being guilty of a Misapplication of the Money, to be sure he is, but that such Misapplication does not amount to a Felony; I am confirmed in it, by an Act of Parliament made very lately, to prevent Accidents of this Kind for the future; and I believe, the Gentlemen will find no Retrospection in the Act; it is the Act of the 15th Year of his present Majesty c. 15, p. 538. This Act of Parliament says, '' If any Officer, or Servant of the said Company, (meaning the Bank of England) being intrusted with any Note, Bill, Dividend - Warrant, Bond, Deed, or any Security, &amp;c. Money, or other Effects, belonging to the said Company, or having any Bill, Dividend-Warrant, Bond, Deed, or any Security, or Effects of any other Person or Persons, lodged or deposited with the said Company, or with him, as an Officer or Servant of the said Company, shall secrete, embezzle, or run away with any such Note, Bill, Dividend Warrant, Bond, Deed, Security, Money, or Effects, or any Part of them, every Officer or Servant so offending, and being thereof convicted in due Form of Law, shall be deemed guilty of Felony, and shall suffer Death as a Felon, without Benefit of Clergy.'' I apprehend this Clause shews the Sense of this Body, the Sense of the honourable Persons who advised them in this Case, and the Sense of the Legislature, that this was not Felony before; for they will find that this is not a declaratory Act, (there being no declaratory Words,) but is plainly introductive of a new Law. I am far from thinking that such a wise Body, as the Legislature is, would make a vain, or a needless Act; for if this was Felony before, what Occasion was there to make it Felony? I hope this Act of Parliament, which is a publick one, will not be looked upon as a nugatory Act, but have its full Weight in Favour of the Prisoner, and that a Jury of Englishmen will regard it as such.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174302230030"/>2d Coun. The Question is, Whether this is a Breach of Trust, or a Felony? I shall not dispute with the Gentlemen of the other Side, but that there is a special Property in the Bank, and the Gentlemen might have brought an Action against the Prisoner, and may yet do it; and I hope if they can have a Remedy in a Civil Way they will never succeed in a criminal one. I apprehend the taking of these Bonds is no Felony at all; but if it is so, it is a Felony by the Act of Parliament of the 15th of his present Majesty; It is said, If this is not Felony, what is Felony? The Case of a Carrier has been mentioned, but I apprehend that is not applicable to the present Case. A Carrier had Goods delivered to him to carry to a particular Place, he carried them and delivered them at that particular Place, and then takes them away, that I agree is Felony; for when he had delivered them at that particular Place, his Trust determined, he had divested himself of that Property he had in them, and when he took them away, then the Felony commenced, then was the unjust taking, for there must be an unjust taking to make it stealing: But it is not thus in the present Case, for as the Bonds always remained with the Prisoner, the Question will be, Whether he can be guilty of stealing these Bonds from himself, and I apprehend no Man can be guilty of stealing from himself what he has in his Possession. My Lord, it is said, by the Council for the King, that there was a special Property in these Bonds in the Bank of England, but in Respect to this, I would mention the Act of Parliament of the 12th of George I. for by that Act the Bank is only entitled to the Receipt of the Interest, the Money was not due to them, but the Suitors, and therefore the taking cannot be Felony in this Case. In the Act of Parliament of his present Majesty, it is indeed declared, If any Person belonging to the Bank does secrete, or embezzle any Thing belonging to them, that Person shall be guilty of Felony: But this Act of Parliament was made after this Offence was committed, and therefore does not reach the Crime this Man is charged with; and therefore, I hope, upon the Circumstances of the Case, this Man does not appear to have acted any otherwise than in Breach of his Trust.</p>
               <p>3d Council observed, among other Things, that if the Prisoner had been intrusted with these Securities, without giving any Receipt for them, there might have been a Difference in the Case; but here Mr. Waite had 'em by a Sort of a Contract, for she gave a Receipt for them, which proves he came not by them tortiously, or that he robbed the Bank of them; for having them thus in his Custody, he made himself a Trustee to the Company, and was answerable for the Value of them; and the Bank is not destitute of a Remedy in this Case, inasmuch as they take Security of their Officers, and I submit it to the Court, that the Act of Parliament of the 15th of

            . was not a declaratory Act, or explanatory of any other Act of Parliament, but a new Law, and that the Offence charged upon the Prisoner was not Felony by any former Law.</p>
               <p>4th Counc. My Lord, I will leave the Facts as they now stand, and not trouble the Court with any thing in Relation to the Nature of the Evidence, but consine myself merely to Matters of Law, and make a Parallel between this and other adjudged Cases, from Time to Time, and show that there's no Reason to distinguish this from any of those Cases. Before the Statute-Law, stealing a meer Chose in Active, could not be Felony; therefore it was thought necessary to make the Breach of that great Trust, which is reposed in the People of the Bank, Felony, because if they thought themselves at Liberty to play Tricks of this Kind, and not be punished for them, it would be of the last Consequence to the Publick. The Words of that Act of Parliament are plain enough to me to show that this Offence is not in any former Act: For the Act says, '' If any Person shall steal or take by Robbery;'' stealing is a transferring the Possession, and that privately from a Person; taking by Robbery, implies a Force, for there cannot be a Robbery without an actual Force; there cannot be a Robbery in this Case, if it is any Thing it must be a stealing. Could he take these Things without the Consent of the Persons who put them into his Hand? Has not he a Property? Had the Governor and Company embezzled these Things, Could they be guilty of Felony? No, they could not, but they are liable to make Satisfaction to the Suitors in Chancery: What Right is there to distinguish Persons? They have entrusted him as their Servant; he is as much entrusted by them, as the Court of Chancery entrusted the Bank; and he, by his Receipt, is liable and answerable. Put the case, that the Bank had a Mind to make a little Use of a Parcel of inconsiderable Papers for a little Time, though I do not suppose they would. What would have been the Consequence, it would not be Felony?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174302230031"/>King's Counc. They cannot commit a Felony, for they are a Corporation.</p>
               <p>4th Counc. I know a Body-Corporate cannot commit a Felony, but each of them separately may be guilty of Felony. Now I beg leave to consider how it may be distinguished in Point of Law, for Waite had a special Property in these Bonds. If I lend my Watch, or my Horse to a Person, and he goes to Market and sells them, this is not Felony, this supposes a Contract, and gives the Party a Remedy at common Law; besides they have Security for his good Behaviour; all the Officers of the Bank gave Security, and as to the Property there should be a Distinction made in this Respect, for there may be a Property for a particular Purpose; and when a Person has Possession of a Thing lawfully, there an Action of Trover only lies against the Person. If a Carrier is robbed, he may maintain a Prosecution, because he has a special Property for a particular Purpose. A Man that comes legally by a Thing, cannot rob himself; for if he had a Right to the Possession, he must have stole them from himself, he could not have stole them from any Body else. Then as to the late Act of Parliament, my Lord, for what End and Purpose could this Act of Parliament be made, if it was not the Sense of the Legislature, that the stealing of these Securities was not Felony before; but the Reason, as I apprehend, was, and in Point of Law, must be taken to be so, that the stealing of Choses in Action, was not Felony before. Suppose he forgot or mislaid a Bond, and could not find it, must he be indicted for a Felony. I very well remember a remarkable Case *, (that went out of this Court upon a special Verdict, whether the stealing of Chancery-Records, taking them out of the Office, and taking the Stamps off, and selling them, was Felony; but the Court of King's Bench gave their Opinion upon it, that it was not Felony, and the Party was acquitted, and it was the Voice of the whole Court, that it was not Felony. But this new Act being made, plainly shows that Mr Waite is not guilty of Felony, as it was not Felony before this Act. But should we be so unfortunate as not to satisfy the Court and the Jury, that this is not Felony, then I should be glad if the Court would be pleased to indulge us in such a Manner, that the Facts may be stated, in order that the several Points may be more fully argued; and that we may have Time to lay Reasons before the Judges, which, in this material Case, ought to be very maturely considered, and that it may not be left to a Jury, to determine Quo animo he took them.</p>
               <p>* In the Mayoralty of Mr Alderman Perry. See the Trial, January Sessions, No. 124.</p>
               <p>Serj. Agar. It is, my Lord, admitted by us all, that the Bank had so far a special Property in the Bonds, as to receive the Interest, but not otherwise.</p>
               <p>King's Council. My Lord, I beg a few Words by Way of Reply, in Behalf of the Prosecution; but before I argue the Points of Law, it will be proper to see upon what Ground we stand, in Point of Evidence. By the Act of Parliament, these Bonds are to be carried to the Bank, to be received by the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, and Receipts are to be given for them; and the Act of Parliament makes the Bank of England expressly liable for the same. According to the Evidence, these Bonds were carried from the Court of Chancery to the Bank, and as the Bank have proper Servants for every Branch of their Business, the Prisoner at the Bar was the proper Person to receive these Bonds from the Accomptant-General of the Court of Chancery; and I do lay this as a Foundation, that as soon as they are delivered into the Bank of England, they are that Minute in the Possession of the Bank; let them remove that Corner-Stone if they can, they are in the Possession of them, whether they are under their own Lock and Key, or the Lock and Key of their Servant, for it is their Possession in Point of Law: The Gentlemen would insinuate, that these Bonds are not to be considered as delivered into the Possession of the Bank, but into the Possession of Mr Waite, for Mr Waite has given Receipts for them, and made himself answerable for them; but they have omitted the most material Part, that he receives them for, and subscribes the Receipt for the Governor and Company of the Bank of England; his Receipt is not such a Receipt as will entitle the Suitors to call upon him for the Money, not such a Receipt as will entitle him to it; for though this Man's Name is to the Receipt, it is in Point of Law the Receipt of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England. If a Servant gives a Receipt, and says, for my Master such an one, Is not this, in Point of Law, the Receipt of the Master? Because this Money is received by the Servant, is it not the Receipt of the Master? It is as much mine as it I had signed it. They would turn us round, and tell us we are to bring an Action, and make this a Breach of Trust:</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174302230032"/>I should be glad to know whose Trust it is that he has broke: Would they say he has broke his Trust with the Court of Chancery, they cannot say he has broke his Trust with them. - They have brought it out, but not as a Point of Law, that a Man cannot steal from himself; no more he can abstractedly, but he may commit a Felony of what he has in his own Possession; and I will make it out very plain from the first Case put by Mr Serjeant Wynne, Hale 506, in the Case of a Carrier, says, that if a Man delivers Goods to a Carrier, to carry to Dover, and he carried them away, 'tis no Felony. But if a Carrier, after he has carried Goods to the Place appointed, secretly takes them away again, Animo Surandi, in such Case the Possession which he received from the Owner being determined, his second taking, is in all Respects, the same as if he was a Stranger. I will put a middle Case: If a Carrier, in his Journey between London and York, will unpack Goods, and take any thing out of a Case, Box, or Pack, that will be a felonious Taking; for he had no Authority at all to separate these Goods, his Authority was to receive the Bundle entire, and to deliver it entire at such a Place. Let us compare the Cases: here are twenty Bonds delivered at one Time into the Hand of this Man, and three of these are taken by him for his own Use, he is in the same Case with the Carrier who takes part of the Goods out of a Parcel, and does not deliver them to the Party they are for, but disposes of them, and applies the Money to his own Use; the Question is, whether this is not Evidence to a Jury of a felonious Taking.</p>
               <p>The next Case they mention, is that of lending a Horse; that if a Man lends a Horse to another, and he rides away with it, it is not Felony. And they have put a Case which they cannot make out, that if a Man goes to an Inn to hire a Horse, and gets upon his Back and rides away with it, that is not Felony; but I believe they cannot make a Book-Case of it; that it is not Felony, for in that Case the Horse is not lent to him, and therefore it must be a Felony. I would not have them run away with this as a Point, but I hope there are no Horse-stealers here, for this is too dangerous a Doctrine to be delivered in this Place. - But the Gentlemen, they say, as to what has been done by Mr Waite, that is not such a Stealing, as comes within the Meaning of the Law; but as I have proved that those Bonds are in the Possession of the Bank of England, as soon as they are delivered to him, those Persons who make away with them are liable to be punished for a Felony. There is a Difference between having the Care of Goods, and the legal Possession of them; for when a Man has no more than the Care of Goods, the Possession is all the while, in the Judgment of the Law, in the Master. I will venture to lay it down as a Rule, that that Sort of a Servant may be guilty of Felony in taking those Goods to his own Use. Serjeant Hawkins, in his Pleas of the Crown, p. 90. says it has been received as Law, that those who have the bare Charge of Goods may be guilty of Felony; that is, when they are entrusted with a Parcel of Goods, the taking out part of them is Felony; and one who has the bare Charge of Goods, or the special Use of Goods, and not the Possession, that is a legal Possession, he may be guilty of Felony. The first Case he puts, is the Case of a Gentleman's Butler; every Gentleman, I believe, does not lock up his own Plate, or keep it in his own Custody, and when a Butler is hired, there is nothing more known, than that an Account of the Plate is taken in Writing and delivered to the Butler, and the Plate is delivered into his Care, he has the cleaning of it, and is the proper Person to take Care of it; and he has it by that Delivery, if I may so say, intrusted into his Hand; it is a determined Point, that by being in my House (in Point of Law) it is in my Possession, and if my Butler will take a Piece of my Plate and sell it and put the Money into his Pocket, he is Guilty of Felony. 1 Hale, 506.</p>
               <p>Dyer, fol. 5. It is determined there, that if a Butler disposes of a Piece of my Plate, he is Guilty of Felony, and must suffer Death, if it is to the Value of 40 s. - Now as to this Sort of Bonds, I find they remain in the Custody of the Person who has the Care of them, till the Directors go down to put them into the Vault, and then he that had the Care of them, goes down to the proper Place to lock them up, in the Sight of the Directors: This is not like a Case where Goods are delivered to a Man to keep in his Custody, I take the Case of the Butler to be stronger than the present Case, for there he has the Plate by the express Act of the Master delivered to him; and when he goes away, the Plate is counted over and delivered back.</p>
               <p>The next Case is that of a Shepherd, who is employed by a Farmer to take Care of his Sheep. There was a Notion that the Shepherd was so entrusted with the Sheep, that if he run away with them, he could not be prosecuted for a Felony. See Hawkins, and Hale's Pleas of the Crown, 506. A Shepherd, by disposing of one Sheep is guilty of Felony; for he has only the Care of them; he is not generally entrusted with them, the Law distinguishes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174302230033"/> between having Possession of a thing, and only having the Care of it.</p>
               <p>There is another Case put of a Servant who has the Key of an Appartment delivered to him, that he may be Guilty of Felony, if he takes any Thing out of it; for tho' he has the Key of the Chamber, the Goods are still in the Possession of the true Owner.</p>
               <p>Then there is another Case put; if a Man goes into a Tavern as a Guest, and has a Piece of Plate set before him, not with standing he has Possession of this by my Delivery; if he walks off with it, he must walk to Tyburn, or else be carried thither; for it is only delivered to him to use, it is not a Delivery of Possession.</p>
               <p>There is another Case put by my Lord Hale, fol. 506, if an Apprentice embezzles his Master's Goods or Money, out of his Shop, it is there determined to be Felony; if I go abroad, and leave my Shop of Goods in the actual Possession of my Servant or Journeyman, to dispose of while I am gone, and he makes away with any Part of it, it is Felony; for not with standing his Possession, the legal Possession is in me; and there is a Rule in Law, which I will put the Gentlemen in Mind of, that tho' there may be a Sort of a mixed Possession, the Law always supposes the true Possession to be in him who is the Master, and he is judged to be really in Possession. And since they are praying Aid of this Act of Parliament which makes this Felony, which was not Felony before, and that as the Act does not make Use of any declaratory Words; they conclude, that Persons who committed such Facts before, were not Guilty of Felony - I do agree, that there are no Recitals of other Acts, and no retrospect Words, and therefore they conclude, this Act must only be designed as a Punishment for Facts committed, subsequent to the making of this Act; and the Gentlemen would insinuate, that this Man was in the entire Possession of these Bonds, and that by disposing of these Bonds he has made a Breach of that Trust which they had reposed in him: If, I say to a Person, Sir, take Care of these Bonds for me, till I come to Town, and he misapplies these Bonds, that is a Breach of Trust. Now the Act says, any Officer being entrusted, &amp;c. But this Man had not that Sort of Trust, and the Act would have been very improperly made, to have had declaratory Words in that Instance. It is very well known, we have a Number of Statutes, which are made to put an End to Differences which were quite unnecessary: And, I will put the Gentlemen in Mind of a Statute, which they hear of almost every Session at the Old Bailey, that is, the Statute of Stabbing; does any Body consider that as a New Law? And, I will submit it to your Lordship, whether there is any Doubt, but that that Act runs as this does. (Be it enacted.) There was one Thing more said, by the Gentlemen of the other Side, if this is a doubtful Case, if there are any Difficulties in Point of Law in relation to it, in Favour of Life, say the Gentlemen, we hope the Court will not hastily determine a Point of this Consequence.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I am very ready, where the Court has any reasonable Doubt, to refer any thing of this Nature; but I cannot see, how they can make a Special Verdict of it, for there must be Facts found by the Jury; and if the Jury say, he did take them with a felonious Intent, there cannot be a Special Verdict, if they say he did not take them with a felonious Intent, there is an End of the Case; I cannot see how it can be any otherwise, than by the Direction of the Court to the Jury. I am sure, in the Case of a Man's Life, I would not strain any Point of Law, and, I am sure, my Clients would not desire it; but when you come to consider the Case of the Butler as having the Plate, and the Case of the Shepherd as having the Sheep in their Custody only for Care: These Cases seem to be such Authorities, that we have Reason to expect, your Lordship's Direction to the Jury after summing up of the Evidence, that this is Felony in Point of Law.</p>
               <p>2d King's Counc. My Lord, I hope to be admitted to speak a few Words on the same Side; and as those four Gentlemen have so elaborately handled this Point, I would willingly make some Observations upon the Case; and I think, according to the Argument of those Gentlemen, the whole Question amounts to this, Whether as Mr Waite had those Bonds delivered to him, by the Court of Chancery, and did not come by them by any fraudulent Means, this can be any more than a Breach of Trust, and that to make this Felony will be going beyond what bath ever been known to be adjudged Felony, and they have stated several Cases to shew that this cannot be Felony; and now, my Lord, to turn to that which I think has been inconteleably proved, I submit it to your Lordship, Whether upon the whole Scope of the Evidence, the Case does not appear to be this and no otherwise, that these Bonds were legally, properly, and in Point of Fact in the Possession of the Bank, and that Mr Waite, though he was the Hand that received them. though he was the Hand that went to receive the Interest upon them, was still acting only under that Possession, in like Manner as every Person, who has the Care of Things, which are in the Possession of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174302230034"/> another, may be said to act; that he gave Receipts for these it is true; But who was it for? why, for the Bank of England, and from these Receipts the Possession is fixed directly and absolutely in the Bank : The Law charges the Bank just the same as if they were actually kept in the Hands of the Directors of the Bank; and the Bank has in Fact, and it is nothing but what is founded upon the Principles of Equity and Justice, made good the Loss, which has arisen by this, to the Proprietors; therefore considering this in every Light, it cannot be taken any otherwise than that this is the Possession of the Bank. How is Mr Waite then to be considered ? Why merely as a Servant who only has the Care of them; and it was from this that he had an Opportunity of disposing of them; Then, my Lord, this being laid down, supposing I am right in that, the only Question that does arise upon on this is, Que animo, did this Man take these Bonds ? he took them, gave them to a Broker as his Bonds; he sells them for him, gave him the Money, and he put it into his Pocket, Quo animo, was this done? I shall allude to the Case, put by Sir

            4.9.''</p>
               <p>And my Lord Hale, so great a Man, lays it down positively as referring to these Authorities: I would consider how this Case stands before your Lordship, with Respect to the Prisoner: If a Butler, by embezzling his Master's Plate, be guilty of Felony, (the Plate that he has the Charge of) how does Mr Waite stand? Had he any more than the Charge of these Bonds? If any one of the Bonds reach him, it is the same Thing as if the whole Number were proved upon him: Consider what his Possession was; it was only their being in his Hand to convey them to the proper Repository, and when they had Occasion to receive the Interest, or the like, he is the Hand to whom these are committed to do this, or that Act relating to them, and I do not apprehend that they are any otherwise under his Care than only for this particular Purpose. A Shepherd cannot be said to have the Superintendency of the Flock, but he has a Sort of a Care of it, and if he runs away with any Part of it he will be guilty of Felony. Where does this differ from the present Case, either in one Thing or the other? Dalton c. 155. It is likewise taken Notice of by my Lord Hale, with respect to an Apprentice, that if he embezzle his Master's Goods out of his Shop it is Felony: Why may it not be as well said, that an Apprentice, by having the Key of the Door belonging to the Shop, has Possession of the Goods to dispose of them as he shall think fit ? This is only a Trust reported in him for the Profit of his Master; Where is the Difference between this Case and the Case of Mr Waite ? My Lord, I beg Leave to mention another Case in my Lord Dyer, Fol. 5. That if a Master delivers to a Servant 20 s. in Silver to change into Gold; or Leather to make Shoes, and he runs away with the Gold or the Shoes, it is Felony. I will take this for Argument Sake, that Mr Waite had Possession by the Delivery; I do not take it as a Fact but only argumentatively; Suppose these Bonds were incontestably delivered to Mr Waite, and in the Possession of him, and he sells these Bonds and runs away with the Money, where is the Difference between this Case and the Case my Lord Dyer makes use of: Suppose a Servant has 20 s. in Silver deliver'd him, by the Hand of the Master for a particular Purpose, (so were these Bonds delivered to Mr Waite for a particular Purpose, not to sell or dispose of) and the Servant, instead of turning the 20 s. of Silver into Gold, and delivering it back to the Master, he runs away with the Gold; Where is the Difference between this Case and that of Mr Waite? I will take it for Argument-Sake, that he had this Possession for the Bank; but if he sells these, and puts the Money into his Pocket, it is Felony: Where is the Difference between this and the Leather made into Shoes? The Leather was delivered for that very End and no other: But if he runs away with the Shoes, he is guilty of Felony. They have been pleased to say, that it was with the Consent of the Bank that this Man had these Bonds; the Bank consented that he should have the Care and Management of them, to receive the Interest, and exchange them, as there should be Occasion; But was it the Consent of the Bank for him to sell them? For though he had in the first Instance acquired the Possession of them, and had them in his Power; yet if that is consined to a particular End and Purpose, and he goes beyond that, there is no Consent in the Bank for any other Purpose. The Gentlemen took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174302230035"/> Notice that I had some Allusion to this Case, when I said, that where a Person has Goods delivered him for a particular Purpose, as a Carrier or Waggoner, who has Goods delivered him to carry, and he breaks open the Bales, and takes out part of these Goods, (though the whole were delivered him by the Hand of the Owner) that is Felony. They took Notice, that in my opening, I did allude to this Fact, so I did, I do not deny it. Here were a great Number of Bonds delivered to this Man, he did not dispose of them all, but some of them. Consider what Difference the Law makes in this: If a Parcel of Goods is delivered to a Person, and he sells part of them, he is guilty of Felony. I do not apprehend, but that the Circumstances make a considerable Difference, and the Matter rests upon the Application, and it is reduceable to this, Quo animo, With what Mind did this Man do this? Whether he did it with a Design to put the Money into his own Pocket, and if he did, it is the same as if he had gone to the Coffers and took out the Money, and put it into his Pocket. And then they refer to another Act of Parliament, made very lately, and say, that is a very plain Parliamentary Declaration, that no Servant of the Bank, before that Act of Parliament, could be guilty of Felony for stealing Notes or Bonds, &amp;c. and that if it was Felony before, there would have been no Occasion for this Act of Parliament. By a Statute of the 1st of Queen Anne, it is enacted, that whoever steals Goods or Chattels to the Value of forty Shillings, in any Dwelling-House, is guilty of Felony without Benefit of Clergy; before this Law, it was (as I think may farm it ) a Clergy Felony; but this Act which they mention, 15

It makes Choses in Action stand upon the same Footing as Money or Goods did by other Acts; and though there was a Provision made against this before, yet it was such a Provision, that if any Person of the Bank stole any Bonds, &amp;c. and it was not in a Dwelling-House, he and the Benefit of the Clergy. However if this can be put in such a Manner as to be serviceable to the Prisoner, God forbid I should be against it. It has sometimes happened, that upon an insufficient Finding, the Prisoner has got off Scot-free, because the Court could give no Judgment upon it. My Lord, all that is to go before the Jury is Quo animo, did this Man take these Bonds, whether it was with a felonious Intent, or was it a Breach of Trust. The Law makes this Distinction, whether it was a Breach of Trust, or a felonious Taking. The Court cannot determine this, it is a Fact, and this lies before me Jury. I only mention this that we may not go into any Mistake, so far as that this Man shall not have Justice done him, either to acquit him or to convict him. I am not for having him convicted, if the Law does not convict him; God forbid I should desire this if the Law deems him innocent.</p>

               <p>Wright. My Lord, I think it unnecessary in a Case of the Nature of my Crime, to give the Court any Trouble; and therefore I plead guilty, and I hope I shall be recommended to his Majesty's Mercy by the Court and the Jury.</p>
               <p>[To which he was answered by the Court, that he had already pleaded, not guilty, but he might withdraw that Plea, and plead guilty; but informed him, if t here were any favourable Circumstances in his Case, if he pleaded guilty, the Court could not take any Notice of them; and that the Jury cannot report any favourable Circumstances, because the Circumstances do not appear to them: Upon which he agreed to take his Trial.]</p>
               <p>Mr. Belchier. On Friday the 21st of January, the Prisoner, who calls himself Stephen Wright, came to my House about seven o'Clock in the Evening, under Pretence of having some Complaint that required my Assistance; and in a very short Time he told me, that his Business with me was to have my Money; he held a Pistol to my Breast, and demanded my Money; I was surprized at that, and told him as he had the Appearance of a Gentleman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174302230036"/> he might be in Necessity, (I desired him to take away his Pistol) and I put my Hand into my Pocket and gave him two Guineas; he said that would not do for his present Necessities; I put my Hand into my Pocket again, and gave him three Guineas more, he said that would not do; and that Life or Death were equal to him, he was in such Circumstances; I put my Hand into my Pocket again, and pulled out a Guinea more; he took it, and seeing my Watch he demanded that; I told him as he had got six Guineas he might be satisfied with that; but he was not, and took my Watch out of my Pocket. I seeing an Opportunity, rushed upon him, took the Pistol out of his Hand, threw him down, and called my Servants; and then we took the other Pistol from him, and the Watch out of his Hand; and then he said he was so much distressed in his Circumstances, that Necessity obliged him to do what he did.</p>
               <p>Q. This was not the first Time he was with you, tell the Story.</p>
               <p>Mr Belchier. He was at my House on the Monday, and enquired for me. I was not at Home; he left Word with my Servant, that he would call the next Evening. Tuesday the 18th, was the first Time I saw him at my House; he staid then about a Quarter of an Hour, and talked to me about some imaginary Complaints. On Friday the 21st, about two o'Clock, I received a Letter, Stephen Wright, wrote for me that Morning; wherein he says, he had discovered some other Complaint; that if I thought proper, I might order him something for it; that he would come that Evening to my House, and bring five Guineas, which he hoped would satisfy me: When he came, I told him, though he was a Stranger, with Respect to the five Guineas, as he appeared so much like a Gentleman, I did not think he had any Design to impose upon me; and I told him that his Complaint was only imaginary; and then he told me that he had no Complaint, but his Business with me was in the Manner as I have related it to your Lordship.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask Mr. Belchier, whether I held the Pistol to his Breast?</p>
               <p>Mr. Belchier. When he pulled the Pistol out of his Pocket, he held it to my Breast, and said, Sir, your Money: I said, Take the Pistol away and you shall have my Money.</p>

We took Coach, and went, and when we came there the Play was over; we returned back again, to the Tilt-Yard Coffee-House, went into a small Room, within the Coffee-Room, and called for some Punch; we were told that Mr. Richardson was there, and enquired for Capt. Wilson, the Prisoner desired leave to introduce him; then Capt. Skerret, said, d - n him he is a Scrub; or Words to that Effect; He shall not come into my Company: Capt. Wilson said, he believed he mistook his Character, upon which they had some peevish Words. Wilson went out, and Skerret told me, I was as had as him (meaning Richardson) upon which, I told him, he seemed vastly quarrel some the whole Night, and No-body had given him any Reason; and that it was a Matter of Indifference to me, whether he came in or not, as I had never seen the Gentleman before; Skerret's Answer to me was, d - n your Blood, your are a Rascal; upon which, I laid my Hand to my Sword, and said, my Station in the Army, would not suffer me to bear such Language. - I cannot tell, whether I drew my Sword or no; and I believe, I said, if Mr. Skerret has a Mind to quarrel with any Body, I am his Man, for he has grossly affronted me: Upon which, the Woman of the House, and one Mr Walker, who was in the Coffee-Room, laid hold of me; I told them, they might let me go, for I promised them upon my Word and Honour, I would have no Words with Skerret that Night, we went into the Room again, shook Hands, and were Friends. - This Quarrel, which was the Occasion of his Death, was immediately afterwards; (he was going to quarrel with me again, but I would not) the Deceased turned about to Wilson, what he said to him, I cannot tell; I saw them both bounce up all on a sudden, and go into the Coffee-Room, who went out first, I cannot tell; Mr. Walker and I continued sitting by the Fire: I saw Mr. Richardson follow them, heard him call the Guard, I told Mr. Walker, should not follow them, for fear I should fall into the Quarrel myself. - I did not see what happened in the Street; when they returned, I saw Wilson glance by the Door of the little Room which I was in, and saw some Blood upon his Shirt, I started up, and went to the Door of the Room, and immediately saw Skerret break loose from two Soldiers of the Guard, who had hold of him in the Coffee Room; after Skerret had broke loose from the Soldiers, Wilson met him half Way, in the Centre of the Coffee-Room, and they began to attack one another afresh, and fell to pushing; I drew my Sword, and beat down their Passes, and told them, they were both under Arrest. - There were a good many Passes; I beat them down as fast as I could. - The Deceased had a Wound in his Breast, pointing a little towards the Right-Side; he said, he had got enough for this Night, dropped down, and died on the Spot. - From the first to the last of this Quarrel, it was not above a Quarter of an Hour.</p>

               <p>Gadsdon. I think Capt. Mr. Caugh gave me this Sword, and bid me take care of it. - This is the Deceased's Sword; it lay naked in the Room, after the Deceased was dead; it was bent at the Point. [The Sword was bent about six or seven Inches towards the Point.]</p>

            (to Capt. Mr. Caugh) Did not the Prisoner draw his Sword first upon Capt. Skerret?</p>
               <p>Capt. Mr. Caugh. I am not certain who drew first.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the Wound the Deceased received in his Breast be given, if he had been in a Posture of Defence?</p>
               <p>Capt. Mr. Caugh. I do not know, - the Wound might be received when he was off his Guard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Gadsdon. Did not you see the Deceased seize upon me first?</p>
               <p>Gadsdon. Really I cannot say whether he did or not. - Skerret's Sword was draw g before Wilson's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Skerret's Sword drawn at the Time that Richardson laid hold of Skerret the bid him be quiet?</p>
               <p>Gadsdon. The Sword was first drawn by Skerret, at the Time Capt. Mr. Caugh said, If you have a Mind for a little Diversion, I am your Man; that was at the Time Richardson had hold of him, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Capt. Richardson (confirmed the other Evidence, with Respect to the reconciling the first Difference). As we were sitting together in the little Room, I heard Capt. Skerret make use of the Word dare; and all on a sudden, he and Capt. Wilson jumped off their Seats, and rushed out of the little Room into the Coffee-Room. I went out after them, and saw Skerret in a rising Posture. I took hold of his Sword which was drawn in his Hand, and in endeavouring to get it from him, I run the Point into the Calf of my Leg, and desired the Servants to call the Guard. Skerret got from me, and rushed towards the Street-Door; Wilson was then at the Door, and said, stay, or helt. till I have drawn my Sword. I went into the Street, saw three Soldiers, and called to them to part them for fear of Murder. - Skerret's Sword was drawn at first, but Wilson's was not. I heard their Swords clash, but the Soldiers parted them. Wilson came in first, then Skerret came in, and the Soldiers had hold of him by the Arm; and the Soldiers struggled to get the Sword from him, but Skerret got from the Soldiers and advanced towards Wilson; Wilson was at the other End of the Coffee-Room with his Sword in his Hand; and then Wilson advanced towards him, and they made several Passes at each other. - I do not know whether the Wound was given in the Street or in the House.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mackenzie, Surgeon. I was called about one or two in the Morning, about the 20th of January, and when I came into the Coffee-Room, I saw Mr Skerret lying upon the Floor; he was dead before I I came. I found a Wound in his Breast which was mortal, and was desired by the Coroner the next Day to open the Body; there were four Wounds in the Trunk of the Body; one on the right Side, which penetrated into the right Lobe of the Lungs; there was another on the Breast-Bone, which went through the Sternon; there was another Wound towards the left Groin, but that did not penetrate, - the Wound went aflant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Heath, Surgeon. I was sent for to view the Body. I endeavoured to introduce a Probe, which I could not do. I found a Wound upon the Breastbone; there was one passed between the fourth and fifth Rib on the right Side, penetrating into the right Lobe of the Lungs; and another a little obliquely into the Sternon, which I apprehend to be the mortal Wound. - I do apprehend he was in a fighting Posture when he received that Wound; he might receive it when he was recovering from a Lunge; - there are two Wounds which did not penetrate, and one upon the Leg.</p>
               <p>Q. How deep was the Wound?</p>
               <p>Mr. Heath. It was through the Breast-Bone, a little obliquely into the left Ventricle of the Heart. - He was in a disadvantageous Posture when he received the Wound. - I do not say he was in a Posture of Defence. - The Wound was a little inclining to the Left. - There was a Wound on the left Side of the Navel. - I am not a Judge of Duelling, - but I apprehend that Wound might be received on a Recovery from a Lunge.</p>

               <p>Gen. Wentworth. Last September was Twelve-month the Prisoner came to me in the Island of Cuba, upon the Recommendation of a Gentleman, and I appointed him a Lieutenant; he is a Person of a civil peaceable Behaviour.</p>
