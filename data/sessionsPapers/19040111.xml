I am the wife of James Hall, who drives the engine of a roundabout—we live at 11, London Road, and we have a rifle range there—I am a depositor in the Post Office Savings Bank—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced.</hi>) is my bank book—I knew the prisoner when we were girls, but I had not seen her for about fifteen years until she came to me in London about Easter—I saw her from time to time until July when I went to Sheerness with my husband and the steam roundabout—I arranged with the prisoner that she should look after our business in London while we were away—she was to keep the business open and pay expenses and to keep the balance—we left on July 11th. and went to four different places—we left the prisoner plenty of stock, so she had nothing to buy—the rent was 22s. a weck for the shop and 6s. a week for her room for seven weeks; after which she was to move to a room over the shop in London Road, where she had to pay 1s. 6d. more—I think she moved in September—the most she ever had to pay was 29s. 6d. a week—I corresponded with her every week, and told her that if she wanted any money she was to let me know—she replied to my letters, but never suggested that she wanted any money—she said business was very bad, and I wrote and said that she was not to want for anything, and she never said that she wanted anything until the last week before I returned home in November—I had been home twice in the meantime—the prisoner was there when I returned—when I went home in the last week in October I asked her for my bank book—to the best of my knowledge I had left it in my dressing table drawer, which was not locked—I left everything unlocked because I trusted her—I had not wanted the book before that—the prisoner knew where it was because she had the use of the drawer—I had given her no authority to draw on my banking account, or to sign my name or to get any money from the account—when I asked her for the book she hummed and hawed about it, and said, "You don't want that, do you?"—I said "Yes," and she went and got it—then she said, "Do you know what I have done? I have drawn £2 from it to pay the rent"—I said</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Secretary's Office, at the General Post Office—some time before December 8th information was brought to me respecting a cheque which had gone wrong in the post—in consequence of certain information I spoke to the prisoner about it at the Stratford Sorting Office—I cautioned him and then said, "I am making inquiries respecting a letter containing a cheque for £30 5s. 9d., sent to Messrs. A. Boake Roberts &amp; Co., Stratford, on December 2nd, by Messrs. J. Muir &amp; Sons; the cheque was returned to the senders, re<lb/>questing that an open cheque might be sent to Mr. G. Scott in lieu thereof: do you know anything about it?"—he replied, "I know nothing about it"—I showed him a letter purporting to come from Boake Roberts &amp; Co., and the cheque and envelope in which it had been sent, and said, "Have you seen any of these documents before?"—he said, "I have not"—I asked him if he had any objection to his rooms being searched, and he said, "No"—I gave instructions for them to be searched, which was done by Vaughan, who brought to me the statement of account, and a draft of the letter which had been sent—I showed them to the prisoner, and said, "Do you wish to say anything to me about them?"—he said, "Nobody but myself knows anything about the matter; I did not intend to defraud: I wanted to pay the money back; I wanted to borrow some money, and I resolved to pay the money back at the first opportunity; it is evident that I must have got them from the Post Office, and they passed through my hands in the ordinary course; I certainly did not in<lb/>tend to keep the whole of the money, and I intended to pay it back at the first opportunity; the letter was addressed to Messrs. A. Boake Roberts &amp; Co., Stratford"—afterwards he said, "I took the cheques, as I wanted to buy the 'Encyclopaedia Britannica': I did not want to buy it outright, but I wanted some money to make a few payments."</p>

I am head porter at Rowton House, Hammersmith—on December 4th I believe the prisoner had been living there for about a fortnight—he had a locker, and this is the key which refers to it—I remember him being removed by Aldridge on December 4th, and as they were leaving the lodging house I saw the prisoner throw away or drop a key, No. 764, just by the front door—I picked it up, and afterwards gave it to the police—there is a locker for every lodger who has a weekly ticket—Harris was a quiet and respectable man in the house—the prisoner had a weekly ticket, otherwise he would not have had a locker.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical practitioner, of 36, King's Square, and on January 1st I was acting as divisional surgeon—I was called about 2.30 a.m. to 295, City Road, and in the kitchen I saw the body of a child in a perambulator; it was recently dead—there was an incised wound on the upper lip about 1 1/2 in. long, another in the neck from one ear to the other, dividing the tissues and very deep; another one 1 in. long, about the right ear, and another behind the right ear, all incised—the one in the throat was one which would be almost immediately, fatal—from the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination I found that the body was that of a well-nourished and healthy child—the cause of death was syncope, caused by the wound in the throat—I also saw the prisoner there; he was in a state of extreme intoxication, and smelt strongly of rum—I noticed blood on the back and a little on the palms of both his hands—his wife appeared to be sober—I noticed no sign of blood upon her.</p>

I am a widow, and live at 89, Old Church Road, Stepney—the prisoner is my son—he lived almost opposite me—the deceased was also my son, and he and his wife lived with me—he was thirty-three years old—the prisoner has not been on good terms with me for some time—I do not know why he was on bad terms with me—as far as I know, I have done nothing to cause any ill feeling—the prisoner's wife and the deceased's wife were not on good terms; they had quarrels—on December 26th, between (1 and 6.30 p.m., I was having tea in the front room down stairs—my younger son John was there, and also the deceased, a man named Thomas Cain and Mrs. Deesey—the deceased's wife was not there—the deceased had been out in the early part of the day, and had returned, I think, about two o'clock—he was then the worse for drink—he had some dinner, and then lay down in front of the fireplace and went to sleep for about three hours—when he woke up I suppose he must have been getting over the drink—we began tea about 6.20—as we were begin<lb/>ning</p>

               <p>the prisoner came in and began to abuse me—I said, "I do not want none of your abuse; you had better go out"—I could not follow what his abuse was—I said I did not want any disturbance—he would not go out, and the deceased got up and tried to put him out—Cain got up, and with John got in between the deceased and the prisoner—John got the, prisoner outside, and I then saw the deceased fall on to the sofa—he said something about a pricking in his side—I then left the house and saw no more of him until I saw him at the hospital—in the morning of the 26th I had been in the Green Dragon with a neighbour—I saw the deceased there—he gave me a drink—I did not see the prisoner there at all—I saw a Mrs. Cutbill; she spoke about a quarrel between herself and the prisoner's wife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stevedore, of 26, Dalgleish Street, Limehouse—on December 26th I was at 89, Old Church Road, having tea with Mrs. Stewart—the deceased and Mrs. Deesey and John Stewart were also there—shortly after we had begun, the prisoner came to the door and started abusing his mother, who asked him to go, which he refused to do—he used some filthy language—he also mentioned the name of "Emma"—I know now that that is his wife's name—he was swearing, but I do not know what the quarrel was about, if there was one—after the prisoner had been asked to go out, but still kept on abusing his mother, the deceased got up and went towards him—the deceased was sober then as far as I know—I was perfectly sober—when the deceased went towards the prisoner a struggle started, and I stepped in between them—my face was towards the deceased and my back towards the prisoner—I put my arms round the deceased and laid him back on the sofa—just after I had done so he said, "I have got a pain in my side"—at the same time I found that I had got a cut on my arm—I thought someone had bit me—I have the mark now, and this is the cut in my coat—when I put my arms round the deceased I found that he had been wounded in the region of his heart—he had on a shirt, trousers, and boots, but no coat, waistcoat, or cap—I went and fetched the police from Stepney Station.</p>

I am a Bachelor of Medicine and am house surgeon at the London Hospital—about 7.15 on December 26th the deceased was brought in in a collapsed condition—he was undressed and put to bed—I examined him and found that he had a wound about 2 in. long about the level of the sixth and seventh costal cartilages where they join the breast bone—it was not the bony part of the ribs, but the cartilage—there was no visible bleeding, but there were signs of hemorrhage going on internally—I came to the conclusion that it was necessary to perform an operation—I sent for Mr. Percy Furnival, who, when he arrived, stitched up the heart—I assisted him—that was an absolutely necessary operation—we found that the wound had penetrated the heart wall—it had not actually gone into the cavity of the heart—there was a great ft deal of bleeding going on at the time—he improved after the operation, but next morning he collapsed again, and at 2.55 a.m. on Monday, the 28th, he died—I got to him about five minutes after he was dead—if we had not performed the operation, in my opinion the injury would have been fatal within a few hours; as it was he lived for about twenty-eight hours—I was present with Dr. Grant at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the cause of death was due to the stab in the chest, the wound in the heart, syncope, which of course was helped a good deal by the amount of blood that he had lost, and also by the condition of the left lung, which had been also wounded, as well as the walls of the heart—the wounds might have been caused by this knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a director of Marion James &amp; Ker, Limited, manufacturing chemists, Durham Grove Works, Morning Grove, Hackney—the prisoner has been twice in our employmnet—on the second occasion he was engaged on March 2nd, 1903—the agreement is dated March 10th—by it the company agrees to pay him as their traveller 5s. a week and 15 per cent, on all orders except perfumes, and supply, a box and samples for his use to be returned at the termination of the agreement, or in default a payment of £2, and the traveller agrees to report the result of each day's business and to pay in all moneys, cheques and orders, and is forbidden to use money paid to the company for his expenses, upon pain of instant dismissal, a week's notice being otherwise required—some trouble arose in April as to money not being accounted for, in consequence of which I gave him a written notice for May 2nd, and asked him to call and give an explanation—I received in reply an undated letter on May 3rd from 21, Milman Street, asking me to continue his services—I replied that I would let matters rest till Saturday morning—I did not see him then—his dis<lb/>missal was suspended at my wish, and on June 2nd I wrote him, "Please be here to-morrow evening at six o'clock, and bring your samples with you"—he did not come till June 11th—I asked him if he was going perfectly straight with us—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Do we owe you anything?"—he said, "No, you do not"—I said, "Do you owe us anything?"—he said, "No, I do not"; so I instructed our lady clerk, Miss Williams, to make this note: "Sothern says we do not owe him anything, 11/6/03"—that day I received from him this letter, undated (<hi rend="italic">Asking for</hi> £1 <hi rend="italic">till Monday.</hi>) to which my co-director replied on June 12th that we were astonished at his application for money, and his not calling to settle the account, which placed him in an unenviable position—I then received this letter of June 15th, in which he says, "I will bring down samples and book to-morrow morning. I regret leaving your firm, as I believe I could do a big trade, but require more money and an arrangement by which I should receive a certain amount per week"—he came on the 16th with his samples, which 1 took—after settling his account with my colleague, when he came out I told him he would not represent us any more, and therefore would not want the samples—we have not received amounts from Daily, of May 18th;</p>

A. Cooke"—in addition, there has to be an independent certificate of identification—this is it, purporting to be signed by "W. Elliott, 44, Waldemar Avenue, Fulham," in the presence of F. A. Cooke as witness—the claim was found to be in order, and a cheque for £12 16s., with a receipt form, was on July 28th sent to 31, High Street, Fulham—with the claim also came the certificate of the entry of the death in the register.</p>

               <p>now know as Bernard German—he was dressed as a barber—I was shaved—while there the prisoner opened the door and handed a packet to the assistant, and said, "These are those that I promised you last night"—the assistant handed me the packet—there were about two dozen post<lb/>cards—I selected twelve—I asked the assistant how much he wanted for them; he said 9d. each—I offered him 6s. for the twelve—I paid the 6s.—the prisoner all this time was standing on the steps looking in, half way. in the tobacconist's shop and half way in the barber's shop—I asked for an envelope, which the prisoner gave me as I was passing out—the assistant handed the 6s. to the prisoner—as I went out I said to the prisoner, "Will you come over and have a drink?"—he said, "No, I cannot leave the shop"—this is the envelope, and these the photographs I bought.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know whether there was a name over the door or not—there are two shops; the back one would be a parlour if it was not a shop—you go up two steps to it—there is a glass door between the two shops—there was no curtain over it on this night—on the first night the postcards he displayed were similar to those in the window—on the second night I was shaved quite properly—there was nobody in the barber's shop but German, and Cohen was in the outer shop—there was not a little boy there—I had a general conversation with German while being shaved—when finished I said, "You have a riddle on the wall"—he said, "Yes, it cost me £5"—I took it down and played it, and then the prisoner handed the cards to the assistant—the prisoner was standing in the doorway—the door was open the whole time—on this occasion I had two men with me—the conversation about the money was with German, whom I paid—I say he handed the money to the prisoner in my presence—I am sure I asked the prisoner for the envelope—I took the assistant out for a drink—I paid German for the shave—I cannot say whether he handed that money to the prisoner; I know he paid the 6s. to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the office of the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies, Somerset House—it is necessary prior to the registration of a company that there should be a Memorandum and Articles of Association signed by at least seven persons, each of whom takes a share or shares—the documents are taken to Somerset House and filed there—they must disclose the total amount of capital of the company, and a fee is payable in proportion to the amount of such capital—on a capital of £1,000 the fees are £67s. 6d.; on £2,000, £8 17s. 6d.; £3,000, £12 7s. 6d.; £10,000, £33 2s. 6d.; £15,000, £46 17s. 6d.; £50,000, £143 2s. fid.—if documents are left for registration without the fees, they are returned the same night by registered post—a company cannot be registered with exactly the same name as the firm registering it, unless the original company is in liquidation—I produce the file of J. Byrne &amp; Co. Limited, of April 15th, 1899, capital £2,000 in 2,000 shares of £leach—it' was registered by Byrne &amp; Co., of 95, High Holborn—it may be registered by an agent or some person interested in the company—amongst the</p>

               <p>original signatories in J. Byrne &amp; Co., Limited, were Richard Smith and Alice Byrne, with witness "J. Byrne"—one of the objects of it was to carry on the business of company promotion and registration, and to publish books and pamphlets—by Article 27 of the Articles, "James Byrne shall be chairman and managing director for ten years"—the file comprises an agreement of April 1st, 1899, by which Byrne sells and William Clinton, on behalf of the company to be formed, buys Byrne's business for £500 in shares—that is the consideration—each year a return of the capital and shares has to be made to Somerset House—in September, 1900, I find that 507 shares were taken up, including, the 500 vendors' shares—in the Register of Directors the first directors were James Byrne and Frederick William Taylor, who was also secretary—by August, 1901, I find that Taylor resigned and Alice Byrne took his place as a Director—by September, 1902, I find Alice Byrne had resigned and Richard Smith had taken her place as a Director—I find then that 532 shares had been issued; twenty-seven were held by Mr. Smith, of which twenty-six had come from Alice Byrne—there is no later return—I was at Somerset House on October 7th, 1903, when certain papers in reference to Yeomans, Limited, were pre<lb/>sented at 3.50 for registration, by some clerk—there were no fees left with them—they were returned to the clerk, who brought them—they were not too late to pay the fees—we could not have examined the papers, but the fees could have been paid up to 4 o'clock—next day we received this letter from James Byrne (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the enclosed papers were tendered yesterday, but were too late, and requested that they might be examined, and the necessary stamp duties would then be paid</hi>)—there were no fees with them, and they were returned on the 8th by registered post.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> One man companies are not unusual—a great many companies that are registered never proceed to allotment—there are a great many companies on the file in the name of Smith—when a clerk comes to register a company, he might give his own name, when the registration would be entered in that name—as far as I can ascertain, thirty-one companies have been registered in the name of Byrne &amp; Co., during the last six years, to August 3rd, 1903—I do not know the names, of the prisoner's clerks—I cannot tell without the file who registered the company of Sutton Gardner—I cannot say that thirty-one represents the volume of business done by the prisoner during those six years—we satisfy ourselves that the papers are in order before the fees are paid, but if they are brought in late in the afternoon the people are allowed to pay the fees before the papers are examined—if we refused to register the fees would be returned—since the Act of 1901 came into force the requirements are much stricter on registration—before the new Act no declaration of compliance or list of persons consenting to act as directors was necessary—if the list of directors contained the name of any person who has not consented, the applicant is liable to a fine not exceeding £50, so that it would be of the greatest possible moment to the applicant to see that all these things are in order before he delivers the list—I went through a list of companies with Sergeant Haines, with the indices, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190401110048"/>
               <p>ascertained which companies had been registered and told him—any altera<lb/>tion in the title would invalidate my answer as to the number—a company in the list prepared may have been registered by a clerk from the prisoner's office, but I doubt it, as I should have seen it was the same address.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> In going through the list with Sergeant Haines of companies registered by Byrne, I found the printed name of Byrne &amp; Co.—I can suggest no reason why some of the companies should have the name of Byrne on, and others should not, if they were, in fact, registered by him or by his clerk.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Colthurst Cottages, and am a journey<lb/>man printer—four or five years ago I was engaged by the prisoner as printer at 25s., and increased to 35s. a week—I first worked at Woolwich on his premises, and afterwards at Eagle Street, Holborn—I printed generally Memoranda and Articles of Association and prospectuses—one set of memoranda was very much like another—I could keep a good deal of it set up—we moved from Eagle Street to Church Passage, Chancery Lane—I got my wages regularly up to last June; £12 15s. was owing me when the prisoner was arrested—I was one of the signatories of J. Byrne &amp; Co., Limited, and had one share, for which I paid nothing—the prisoner's wife died in August, 1902—about that time a Mr. Marshall spoke to me, and in consequence I asked the prisoner whether I was a director of his company—I did not know—he said that I was—I then had twenty-seven shares—I paid nothing—I have never had any dividends—we had no board meetings—Mr. Marshall was secretary—I had no right to draw cheques—I never acted as a director, and was not told that I had any responsibilities—I went on setting up type—in February, 1903, the print<lb/>ing office was <hi rend="italic">burgled</hi>, and a quantity of type missed, which stopped the printing for a fortnight, I should say—I did not print these pamphlets (<hi rend="italic">Produced.</hi>)—the gentleman at the back in this photo is Mr. Taylor.</p>

I live at 25, Lillie Road, West Brompton, and was the prisoner's clerk in February, 1902, at £1 a week—at that time the offices were in Holborn: they consisted of two rooms on the first floor, and he occupied the upper part of the house as private premises—the front office was occupied by Mr. Marshall, the secretary, the prisoner and myself, and the back one by three clerks, I think there were—I left him on April 16th, 1903—when I went there was only one typist left, Miss Woolway, and an office boy—I was told if any callers came to com<lb/>municate with the prisoner up stairs—when fresh callers came the prisoner if he was in, would see them; if not, Mr. Marshall—he was very seldom</p>

Smith, cartage con<lb/>tractors, at Suffolk Park Road—in 1902 I got a pamphlet like this—I bore it in mind, and after my father's death I communicated with the address on it, 95, High Holborn, but the reply came from 200, Strand—my brother and I went to see the prisoner in March, 1903—we were desirous of forming our business into a limited company, and discussed it with him—he said it was a good concern to turn into a company—the suggested capital was to be £15.000—we asked his terms, and he said 10 guineas for the printing and out of pocket expenses, and that the registration fees payable to Somerset House would be 150—we told him we could find our own capital, and he said unless he was allowed to find some money the business would not pay him—it was agreed that he should find up to £8,000, for which we were to pay him 5 per cent, commission—my brother signed his letter of authority, dated April."3rd—my brother drew a cheque for 160 10s. in my presence and paid it to the prisoner—he gave this receipt—the company was to be brought out. I think, the Saturday after Easter—a Memorandum and Articles of Association was prepared and sent to us</p>

               <p>—I kept it a day and took it back—the company was not registered on the day arranged—I called on the prisoner—he told me he had applied to Somerset House for registration, but they had returned the papers because there was another firm of the same name already registered—he suggested three other names, all variations of Smith—we arranged a name—no company was registered—my brother wrote to Somerset House—after that he wrote to the prisoner on May 8th—I went again several times, but. could not see him, but after I and my brother got into the street we saw him come from the office—we had been waiting there for some hours—I went up to him and asked him to give me two or three minutes—he had a gentleman with him—he said he would by back in half an hour—I said, "I'll wait for you"—I went back, and was told that the prisoner would not be returning to his office that afternoon, as he had to attend a meeting—I saw him later, and told him we should be compelled to take proceedings—he said there was no necessity for that; he had been very hard up lately, and that he did not. keep our money one hour after he had got it: that he was expecting some more money, and would then get on with our business at once—our company was never registered, and we never got back any of our money—we talked it over with a friend, Mr. Dixie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We did not consult Mr. Dixie, we chatted over the matter with him—he was a solicitor's clerk—I did not know the name of his firm, and never went to them—I asked Dixie to do the best he could for us to get our money back from the prisoner—he said he would write—he was to get something for his trouble—the prisoner said he would return £50 of our money, and we assigned that to Dixie—part of our complaint against the prisoner is that he led us to believe that £150 should be paid to Somerset House—in the letter I signed it is called an "agreed fee"—I knew there was a good deal of printing to be done—I know that a company is not formed without trouble.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 20, Nunhead Lane, Peckham, and am the last witness's brother—I remember seeing this red pamphlet about the time I decided to turn the business into a company—I remember seeing the Press opinions in the pamphlet, and from them formed the opinion that Byrne &amp; Co. were a respectable firm; I subsequently went and saw them with my brother—I signed this cheque, dated April 7th, for £160 10s.—it was handed to the prisoner—I remember communicating with Somerset House—in consequence I inquired of the prisoner whether he had registered the company—he said he had sent down, but they had refused to register under the name of "J. &amp; A. Smith &amp; Sons"—I received a letter from Somerset House, which I showed to the prisoner, (<hi rend="italic">This stated that no refusal to register under the title had been sent.</hi>)—the prisoner was very much annoyed at our writing, and said we were not justified in having done so—I had just previously to seeing him, discovered that the registration foe was only 5s. percent. instead of 1 per cent., and told him so—he first denied having said so—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190401110054"/>
               <p>I protested that he had. and a Mr. Lee, who was with me, also said that he had—the prisoner ordered Lee out of the office and then said to me, "As to you. Mr. Smith, your solicitors can write to me"—I said there was no need for that: if he would register the company the matter could be settled, and he promised to do so—he gave me some forms which he said it was necessary to rill up—I took them away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I read over the letter of authority before signing it—I understood the term "agreed fee"—I had had a discussion with the prisoner as to the general terms, what work lie was to do, and how much he was to be paid; then I signed the letter of authority—the agreed fee was to include the whole of the expenses, but not his trouble—he was to get something more for that—he did not get any more because he did not carry the thing out—some time after first seeing him. a clerk called at our works, taking particulars for the prospectus—I never saw a prospectus; the instructions were withdrawn—it was supposed to be in the printer's hands—it is not true that I told the prisoner I did not want known the condition of our business—it was not in a bad condition or insolvent—nothing was owing but trade debts and a personal loan to ourselves—the prisoner said we could have some money out of the capital raised to pay off the loan—I was not being pressed for payment of the loan.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 13, Bellwood Road, Nunhead, and am a solicitor's managing clerk—in June last I saw Mr. A. W. Smith—in consequence I went to 200, Strand and saw the prisoner—I asked him why he had not registered Smith's company—lie said he could not register it because he had not got the prospectus signed—I told him that it was necessary in this case for the prospectus to be. signed before he registered the company—he agreed to that—he promised to register it by the next Friday—this was on a Wednes<lb/>day—on the Friday I called again and saw the prisoner, and asked him if he had registered the company, and he said No, he had not got the money—I asked him what he had done with Smith's £160—he said he had used it for registering other companies, that he had had money to register other companies, but that he had used it—I told him the matter would be laid before the Public Prosecutor, and he said he took care to keep out of the hands of the police, and he did not care what I did—he promised to register the company as soon as he got some money in—I saw him several times subsequently, and came to an arrangement to return 50 of the money—I have never received the £50 or any part of it—I saw him later, and he produced a post-dated cheque which had been given him. and said as soon as he had cashed it he would pay £25 on account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw him twenty or thirty times—the matter had been placed in my hands to recover what I could—Messrs. Smith first asked me to see the prisoner about getting him to register the company—I saw that the prisoner would not do that, not having the money, and so I advised Messrs. Smith to get back what they could—after that I had authority to do what I liked and get back what I could—I have had experience of company work in a solicitor's office—it is a very common</p>

I am a glass importer, of Edgecombe Street, "Stonehouse, Devonshire—in June, 1903, I received a pamphlet entitled Limited" from Byrne &amp; Co.—I forwarded 2s. to them, and received a book called "Guide to Company Formation," written by Byrne—I wrote to the firm on May 22nd, and" it was finally agreed with them that my business should be turned into a limited company, of 1,000 preference and 1,000 ordinary shares—I signed this letter of authority, agreeing to pay £."37 10s. for floating the company—I had a good deal of correspond<lb/>ence with the prisoner in respect to the company—on July 2nd this cheque for £."37 10s. was handed to him—it has been paid—I had some difficulty in seeing him, but ultimately I succeeded—he sent me some fresh forms—on October 6th I came to London with my solicitor, and next day called at 200, Strand—I was not able to see the prisoner—I went to Bow Street and made inquiries—the next day I tried to see the prisoner, but failed—I received a message from him, making an appoint<lb/>ment for the 8th, which I did not keep—I applied for a warrant, and he was arrested on the 8th—my company was never registered, and no money ever received back.</p>

               <p>fees"—I proceeded to take him to Bow Street, and when passing Somerset House he said, "Do you refuse to let me go and pay the fees on those papers?"—I said, "I cannot allow you to do so now; you are under arrest"—he said, "Very well: I ask you now because I shall have to put that question to you in the Court"—further on, on the way to Bow Street, he said, "Well, Sergeant Haines. I know you have been very busy about me for some time past, but I do not think you bear me any animosity; I hope you won't say more than you can help; this is the only case against me, I suppose; if so, I can soon dispose of that; I have a complete answer to the charge"—he was taken to Bow Street Police Station—the charge was read to him—he made no reply—I found on him two £5 bank notes, about £4 and some odd shillings in cash, a P.O. order for 2s. and two cheque books, one of the Civil Service Bank and the other. the Economic Bank—I searched his offices, 200, Strand, the same day and found a counterfoil receipt book, which I have examined and made a schedule of—the first cheque is dated September 11th, 1902, and the last July 24th, 1903, and shows a total sum received of £l,043 5s. 6d.—I find there are twenty-two companies not registered and seven registered—I have made a search at Somerset House with Mr. Hole, and those that I say were not registered by the prisoner are those that I have not been able to find any registration of.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and have been seven years in the employ of Mrs. Brown, of 22, Burton Court, Chelsea—I have a sister named Gertrude Dann, who was staying at Burton Court on November 25th—on that day she went to Harrod's Stores, and was arrested there with one of the countermen—I heard that she had been taken to Westminster Police Court on November 26th—I did not go—there on that day., but I am aware that she was remanded, and that bail had been asked for, of two sureties, herself in £25 and another in £25—on November 27th the prisoner came to see me at Burton Court with Mr. Pierce, whom I know, and who introduced the prisoner—I had never seen him before—Mr. Pierce was a friend of a friend of mine—I had told him the day before the trouble I was in with my sister—he said that the prisoner would stand bail for her, and I said I was very glad—the prisoner introduced himself by taking out what he called his certificate, saying that lie was the bailiff of Brompton Court—I just looked at it; I did not go into the details—he asked me what I was prepared to give him for standing bail, and I said I had not very much in the house—I had three sovereigns, which I handed to Mr. Pierce in the prisoner's presence—he gave it to the prisoner later in the day—' we all then went to Mr. Dutton's, who was defending my sister—from there we went to the police court—I waited outside, and then went home—I heard afterwards that the prisoner's bail was not accepted, as inquiries had to be made—the prisoner came to see me on November 30th, the following Monday, and said he would stand bail for my sister if I would find some security to deposit at the Court—I said I had nothing, but I would go and ask a friend of mine—the security was to be a cheque for £25, to be made out to him and left open to be deposited in Court—I went off to see Miss Hundy, a friend of mine who keeps a lodging house, and both Mr. Pierce and the prisoner accompanied me, but they did not go in with me—I took the certificate given me by the prisoner to show her—she gave me, this cheque (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), made out to "Frederick Henry John Werndel," which I gave to the prisoner—we then went to Parr's Bank, Sloane Square, where the prisoner cashed the cheque—that was</p>

I will give myself up"—then I went to the police station—I did not have a girl friend with me at the time—the prisoner is a Volunteer.</p>

               <p>1s. 6d.—that is all that took place—there is absolutely no truth in the suggestion, that any impropriety took place—on November 30th I was at my rooms, when Gietl knocked at the door with a letter—I shook my head, as I could not be bothered with him that night—he handed me this letter, which had no address upon it—I just tore the edge of it open and saw that it was closely written, so I said, "Very well, I will see what I can do"—he then left—that is all that took place on that occasion—about half an hour after he had gone I read the letter, and I immediately went round to Gray's Inn Police Station—this is the letter—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "Parker Street House, Parker Street, Drury Lane, London, W.C., November 30th, 1903 Sir,—Two days ago I happened to meet in the street at a very late hour the bearer of this letter, a countryman of mine; as he was starving, and asked me for help, I gave him, of course, some money to buy some food, and asked him to see me the other day again. After cross-examinations the other day about his doings here, he told me at last all you have done with him at your house in Gray's Inn Court, No. 10, on Tuesday night. I suppose you know very well that your doings on that occasion were against the law, and what would become of you when it would be known at the right place. He has a man who has seen life. I am far away of being the cause of your ruin, only it enraged me, as I hear you sent that poor starving fellow away with having your unlawful pleasure, giving him 3s. I am going to tell you now what I wish to see you in a course of twenty-four hours to do for him. Let him have suffi<lb/>cient money to get new clothes for him, to pay the fare to his native town, Vienna, Austria, and a couple of pounds in his pocket, that he can get on all right. I leave it quite to you to arrange the matter as you please, and promise you after you have done this—that means after you have behaved like a gentleman—the matter is settled and buried for ever.—Yours truly, <hi rend="smallCaps">OTTO REICHNER</hi>"—at the police station I asked to see the inspector, but he was engaged; so, as I was anxious to take immediate steps, I went to Mr. Barron, my solicitor, and told him what had happened.—the same night I wrote a letter, of which this is a rough copy—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>) "Sir,—Any further letter you wish to write in the same absurd strain as yours of date, please address to Messrs. Barron &amp; Son, 55, Lincoln's Inn Fields, solicitors. If you deliver another to me I. shall immediately take that and your first to Scotland Yard without the slightest hesitation. I, too, gave your poor young countryman a little money, because he was cold and had nothing to eat. I went straight to Scotland Yard, Gray's Inn Police Station, but inspector was so much engaged I could not wait. He would doubtless have arranged for me to meet you. You have an Englishman to deal with, and your letter is too disgusting for words"—I did not hear any more of the matter, except for a note from Mr. Barron next day, until December 14th, when the prisoners came to my place and tried to see me—I refused to see them except in the presence of a witness—I did not let them into my rooms, but shortly afterwards my brother James, whom I was expecting, came up, and I then agreed to hear, outside my rooms and in his presence, what they had to say to me—I said, "Well, what is it you want with me; do you mean to say you are</p>

               <p>going to blackmail me?"—Reichner said, "I confirm the terms already made in my letter," and that he was prepared to be charged for black<lb/>mailing, through me and through M. Barron—I said I did not want to charge them for their own sakes, but that was the only alternative—Reichner did all the talking—I do not speak German—when I first met Gietl he answered my few questions in English—it was not good English, but he could quite easily make me understand what he meant, and he seemed to understand what I said—I then went round to the station and charged them.</p>

I am house surgeon at Charing Cross Hospital—at about 3 a.m. on December 26th the prosecutrix was brought to me—she was in an excited condition—she had a wound on the upper part of her chest on the left side, about 2 1/2 inches deep, passing downwards and inwards towards the mid line of her body, under the skin and muscles, but above the ribs—she was attended to and sent up stairs—she discharged herself next morning—by the position and nature of the wound it is very improbable that it could have been caused by her running up against something—I think somebody had stabbed her.</p>

Kennington—I am the prisoner's brother—I remember his having an accident when a boy—he has a discharge from his ear—at the sight of blood he would go off numb and dead looking, just as if he had come from under chloroform—he would be heavy and dizzy—I remember once we were in a baker's cart, and we knocked a lad down—my brother went off into a fit, and I had a job to bring him to, because he thought the lad was hurt a good bit—there was a butcher's shop next to our garden, and my brother</p>

                  </hi>, F.R.C.S. I practise at 6, Manchester Square, and am an assistant surgeon to the West London Hospital, and hold many degrees—I examined the prisoner on January 8th—I was informed of the injury to his head when a boy—I found that he suffered from middle ear disease, evidently of very old standing—he had a perforation of the tympanum, and there was a lot of discharge coming from the middle ear—it might have been due to an injury, or to scarlet fever—the disease is active, and he is quite in a dangerous condition—he has a drooping of his left eyelid, which is consequent on a gunshot injury—both eyes seemed bloodshot, more so than normal—he runs his words into one another, and when nervous his speech becomes quite jumbled, and he loses control over it—he seems to me of a very lethargic turn of mind—he did not volunteer any information at all to me—cases are common where the sight of blood induces vomiting, and a partial unconsciousness is produced, which causes staggering and eventual exhaustion and drowsi<lb/>ness—the prisoner's symptoms, as described are perfectly consistent with this peculiar condition—a doctor, if he had been called in, could have differentiated between this condition and drunkenness—if he had been drunk, the pupils of his eyes would have been dilated, and his mental condition would have been different.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was asked to examine the prisoner by Mr. Devenish—I had been told of the accident, and that it was alleged by the police that the man was drunk—I could rind nothing to repudiate that—I inferred that Mr. Devenish was acting for Messrs. Hoares.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. I practice at 25, Bucklersbury—I examined the prisoner on January 7th and 8th—he has middle ear disease, resulting from an injury—it is a common thing that such an injury would affect the semi-circular canals which are connected with the middle ear—the equilibrium of the brain would be upset—he had a droop of the eyelid, and his speech was not clear—on the first day I examined him he was dull and apathetic—the second day he was better—the disease can cause very grave symptoms, it upsets the whole nervous organisation—I have known several cases where people have been affected by the sight of blood—it would be more noticeable in a dull man like the prisoner—under these circumstances the vomiting, heaviness of speech, and sleepi<lb/>ness would be quite consistent with sobriety—in a case of this character a shock would retard the absorption of the stomach; thus alcohol could be smelt for some time afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, Eastney Road, Catford, and am a leather merchant, of 18, Australian Avenue—I am one of the prisoner's creditors for about £140—in the ordinary course of business he gave me three months' bills—the goods were supplied about July. 1902—I had had no previous transactions with him—the bills became due, one in October, and one in December—when the first one became due my bankers, the London Joint Stock Bank, discounted it for me—it was for £106 15s. 6d., due on October 8th—the bank gave me notice of its dishonour, I think, on October 9th, and on Sunday, October 12th, I called on the prisoner at his private house, at 48, Brushfield Street—no one else was present—I asked him why he did not pay, and how he stood, and whether he could pay—he said that he could not pay, and that he should very likely have to call a meeting of his creditors—next day I went again to Brushfield Street, between 9 and 10 a.m.—I did not go in—it is his business place as well as his residence—I saw a heavy van with two horses outside the doc r. as used at Spitalfields Market, with three or four cases on it—it was being loaded—there was another case on the pavement, which appeared to be very heavy, more so than it should have been if there had been boots in it, and I concluded it contained leather, which will pack close, while boots will not do so—three or four men were dragging at it, trying to shift it—they seemed to have difficulty in doing so—it was put on the van, which drove away with the four or five cases on it—I followed it as far as Bethnal Green Road, when I lost sight of it—I wrote down the name on the van But I forget it now, and I forget who I gave it to—I did not know that the prisoner dealt in leather—he represented himself to be a whole<lb/>sale boot manufacturer—I do not know what description was up over his premises—there was no description of a leather merchant there—I do not think I had any correspondence with him—I took his orders verbally—about thirty minutes after I lost sight of the van I saw Mr. Doggett.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think I sold the goods to the prisoner in July, because the bill was for three months—I have not got a copy invoice or my books here—I sent him a sample before the bulk went—I applied for his custom, he did not seek me—the goods were in two lots; they were market value—I suppose he bought them because he thought they were cheap—I have never seen this card, "L. Solomons, Wholesale. Export Boot Manufacturer and Leather Merchant"—I was not aware that he was a leather merchant—I made inquiries about him from Mr. Doggett and others—I have seen no card of the prisoner's at all—I found that he was connected with the boot trade for twenty years, not the leather trade—he could not make boots without leather—I heard that he had worked himself up from nothing, and that he was a most respectable trader and had always carried on his business in a respectable and straight<lb/>forward manner—I 'did-not know that he could not write anything but his name, which he had learnt to do—leather is often put in cases; I send all my leather away in cases—the top of the case on</p>

               <p>the pavement was not uncovered—I could not see inside it—there was loose paper over it as far as I can remember—it is not the practice of the trade to leave an end open—this case was evidently going to be sent away to town and not into the country, and in that case we should not trouble to close the top up except with paper—if I was sending a case into the country I should nail it down—if I was sending it to another part of the town by my own van I should not do so—I cannot say what was inside these cases—a man who is accustomed to move bales and barrows would move a case more easily than a man who is not—the case had no rope round it—I do not know if those two men (<hi rend="italic">Harris Jacobs and Lacomb were brought into Court.</hi>) are the men I saw driving off in the van—I took more notice of the cases than of the men—it struck me at the time that the two men were very different in appearance—I thought it was suspicious—I thought it would be very little good to ask the prisoner about it—I thought it best to find out where the goods were going to—I did not go to the prisoner then—I thought it very little good to question a man like that—I went to 'see Mr. Doggett—I think I gave him the name and address on the van—I do not know where the van went to.</p>

               <p>to Crispin Street on the 13th—the daughters would not let me in—I put my head inside, but could see very little stock—it was generally crammed right up—the same day I went to the Bankruptcy Court and made an affidavit and presented a petition—on January 30th, 1903, about 1 p.m. I went with Mr. McLellan and the tipstaff of the Bankruptcy Court and others, to 45c, Fashion Street, Spitalfields—we found there a lot of the goods that we had sold to the prisoner, and which were not paid for—the owner of 45c Fashion Street is a boot manufacturer—I think his name is Jacob Smith, but I believe he or his wife trades as Margolis—we saw him there—we searched all the house that was open—one room was locked—in the part of the house that was open I found a few skins, which the <hi rend="italic">clickers</hi> were at work on, and which I recognised—Margolis eventually came in, and we said we wanted to see inside the locked room—after we had said that we should have the door forced, he produced the key—there was a little other leather there besides mine—we only seized what was mine—the value of that which we found was about £300, trade price—the trustee took possession of it for the creditors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That was the only room in the house where there was leather, except what the men were working on—down stairs there was some sole leather—I do not know if that is generally kept in cellars—I do not have anything to do with it—I believe it is put into the most handy place, being heavy stuff—some of the leather being worked upon was mine—the stock at Brushfield Street was on racks—the boots were tied together with pieces of string, and when they were hard up for room they were put in piles—the room down stairs was about 16 feet square, and the one at the back about 12 feet by 8—I have not the slightest idea how many thousands of boots there would have to be to be worth £4,000—the glove hide was worth about £60 to £80—all the rest of the stock was boots—there were not many tens of thousands of boots—there was some glace kid goods, and things which would run into hundreds of pounds very easily—I saw goods and boots there to the value of quite £4,000—I should say you might put it at £1,000 in boots and the rest in leather—I was in the habit of going over the prisoner's place, and could see whatever I wanted to see—the cellar at Crispin Street was always used for bottom stuff, which I do not deal in—it was not cardboard—my carmen often told me that there was no room at Crispin Street, and they had to take the goods to Brushfield Street—the greatest value of goods that I have seen at Brushfield Street is from £600 to £800, and in the cellar at Crispin Street, £200 or £300—the ground floor there was partly used as a store room and partly as a workshop—there were two or three machines there, not a dozen—I have seen three or four men working there—I daresay I have seen £4,000 or £5,000 worth of boots there, and on the ground floor, perhaps, £700 or £800 worth of glace kid or box calf—it was put all over the place—sometimes you had to climb all over it to get into the little office—there were two or three other floors which were used as work rooms and store rooms—I think I said before the Magistrate, "I should say the usual amount of stock there was £2,000 to £4,000," but I think that was from June—I am not such a good judge of boots as I</p>

Salamons—I did not induce the prisoner to leave Salamons and come to me all I did was to offer him all my goods, and, unfortunately, they suited him—I do not know whom he left in order to buy from me; he must have left somebody to buy our stuff in the quantities that he did—he had something to do with Tebbitts and Kitts, and others—I believe Kitts a creditor—I cannot say now how much we were paid by the prisoner during the last six months; I should not think that it was £900—very likely we received i'1.000 during the whole of the year—that was by bills—he did not pay anything during the last six months—we never got anything after. June—my ledger would show the exact amount that he paid—I have not gone into the cash payments at all—I found about half a dozen cards, like this one, in the prisoner's desk—they looked very now—I think it was after we got the right to search by the petition—I think it was in November—I took my accountant to the promises on October 13th to see if we could get any money out of the prisoner—my accountant is not my debt collector—we were going to try and see his books—if we could not get any money we wore not going to try to get him to make a statement that he would become bankrupt—I did not know he was going to become a bankrupt—I have asked people if they can meet their bills hundreds of times—Mrs. Margolis made a claim against the trustee of this property—it was hoard before Mr. Justice Wright—I hoard his decision—I believe it was that Mrs. Margolis had failed to establish to him that she was the <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> holder of the goods, or that the trans<lb/>action was entered into good favour—I hoard that she was the person who was claiming the goods—I have never dealt with her myself—I do not think Mr. McLellan went with me to the Bankruptcy Court on October Kith—I went with Mr. Kennard—I think we got there about 1.45—wo got an interim receiver appointed the same day—t believe he took possession the same night, I presume on my motion—I acted under the advice of a solicitor.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. THOMAS</hi>. I began to deal with the prisoner on our ordinary terms, which were either cash or monthly account—then when I went over to see about the money he told me that the people he was doing business with drew at three months, so we allowed him what we call our monthly account—it was not six months; it would bring him up to the end of February—every one of those payments were paid as they became due—the bills were met as they became due, until those which became payable within a week or a fortnight of his bankruptcy—there were no six months bills—no money was paid between February and June, and we agreed to take bills between those two dates—we got the bills as soon as we could—there was a bill for goods had on January 31st, due on June 4th and 17th, for £363; goods had February 20th and 24th and March 6th were paid for on June 30th; goods had on April 4th and 14th paid for on July 4th, £119 15s. 8d.; goods had May 5th and 14th, paid in August and September. £107 and £106; and goods had on May 22nd and September 13th, cash £126—the next bill which would become due in the ordinary course I think would be October 7th—I presume the next one after that would be in November, and then in December—I did not supply the prisoner for two years with very little goods, owing to disputes between us—there are always more or less disputes with this sort of customer, but that had nothing to do with our supplying the prisoner with goods—I do not know what value of order Salamons got from the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing director of Baxter's Leather Company, 46, Tabernacle Street—we are creditors in the prisoner's bankruptcy for £592—on Friday, October 10th, 1902, I called at his promises in Brushfield Street—money was owing at that time—I do not think I saw the prisoner—I saw his daughter Annie—I could not obtain payment—I noticed that the conditions of the premises were normal; that is to say, there was an abundant quantity of stock to be seen—on the 13th I received a telephone message from Mr. Bernard Hoffman, my co-director—I went to Brushfield Street—I met Mr. Hoffman outside, we went into the prisoner's premises and saw him—the place had been divested of stock—it was exactly as if there had been a removal—I did not say anything to the prisoner about the condition of the premises, because I did not see what the condition was until after I had had an interview with him—later the same day I went to Crispin Street—I had been there frequently—I went there on the 10th, when there was plenty of stock—when I went on the 13th I only had an opportunity of seeing the interior of the premises to a certain extent—I was not allowed to go beyond the ground floor—it had been divested of stock, but not so much as at Brushfield Street—there was still a little stock left—there were a few shoes about and some machinery—I had visited Brushfield Street between 9.30 and 9.45—I had an interview with the prisoner there in his own office on the first floor—Mr. Hoffman and Annie Solomons were present—towards the close of the interview Jessie Solomons came in—when I first went in the prisoner commenced to cry loudly—I asked him what it was all about, and what he was sobbing for—he said between his cries that he was being pressed by his creditors—he mentioned Nichol<lb/>sons, Sons, &amp; Daniels, and Moseley Bros., who he said had served him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190401110095"/>
               <p>with a summons, or were going to do so, in the County Court—he also mentioned Scriven Bros.—I said, "Now, look here, Solomons, if this is a straight and honest affair, and what you say is all that is the matter with you, I will help you; but if it is not, you will get no consideration from me"—I asked him to give me the whole of the facts without reserve—he made no reply, but continued to cry loudly; he said, "They won't let me go on, but they are going to sell me up; they won't let me go on"—I asked him, in effect, whether he could pay his debts—he continued to cry, "It is no use, I cannot go on; they are going to sell me up"—Annie Solomons joined in the conversation, and agreed with her father that they could not go on—I asked to see the books—Annie said they were not there—I had some difficulty in getting a definite answer from her, but she ultimately said that they were with a cousin at Bow, being made up—I said, "Well, we really must see them; cannot you fetch them or send for them?"—she said she could not—I offered to pay for'" a cab to fetch them—she said they were probably not at Bow, but at Highbury—I said, "Very well, we will send a cab to Highbury for them"—she demurred to that, and said her cousin would probably be out, and that we could not get them if we sent—I still insisted that the books should be produced, and then the prisoner himself offered to produce them at five o'clock—an appointment was made that they should be produced to Mr. Hoffman and myself-at five o'clock at Brushfield Street—I went there at that time—I did not see the books; the prisoner was stated to be out—Annie was out, and we could not get inside the place—there were only some children there—the private dwelling house is at Brushfield Street—I then went to the ground floor of Crispin Street but was prevented from going through the factory by the prisoner's brother, Jack Solomons—I have been in the habit of going through the factory for years—I was in America, but for six weeks only—I think it would be fair to say that the prisoner always kept about £5,000 worth of stock at his two places—I have supplied him with goods for years—it would be untrue to say that his stock on May 12th was £150, as stated in his goods account—in previous years he had the reputation in our house of paying very promptly—he usually paid at seven days, and took an extra discount by doing so—he spoke to me somewhere about Juno, 1902, and said he would require further time—the account had been running into longer dates some little time before then, the reason being that the merchants and factors with whom he traded were not prepared to accept goods, trade being so quiet, and also that he had to carry the stock—I told him he could run the account a little longer—the amount for which he was indebted to us at the time of his bankruptcy was excep<lb/>tional—the quantity of goods which he received during July, August, and September, before his bankruptcy, was considerably in excess of that purchased in the same months of the preceding years—it would be natural that he should want to go on manufacturing, although he had to carry stock, as he would have to keep his customers going—I have dealt with him for eight or nine years—the amount of his purchases in July, August and September, 1002, was £500 18s. 6d.; in 1901, for the same</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190401110096"/>
               <p>months, £305 14s. 4d.; and in 1900. £300 12s. 10d.—he never was a leather merchant, or a dealer in cardboard or thread, or in anything ex<lb/>cept boots and shoes—this is the form of stationery' which I received from him in September, 1902.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known the place for many years—there was an increase of business after the prisoner took the Crispin Street Factory, which I think was about five years ago—there has been a sub<lb/>stantial increase in the business up to 1902—I will not say that the in<lb/>crease has been month by month—there was an ordinary quantity of goods on the premises, as far as I could see, on October 10th—our business with him increased as far as we would allow it—we are not always disposed to supply everything that a trader is prepared to buy—he never sold any sole leather to our knowledge, nor did he put himself forward as a leather merchant—if he had we should not have supplied him; we should have known that he could not have sold it honestly—we have supplied leather to people who sell it again, but not to this class of man—we should sell it to a merchant of standing, but not to a small shoe merchant—it would not be a mystery to you if you were not in the trade—a small boot manufacturer, if he could pay cash, could come to us or any other wholesale leather house and buy the goods on the same terms that the prisoner could—it is a matter of absolute knowledge that the prisoner could not get a better price for the leather than we could—I do not know the Avon Boot Company, of Tunbridge—I know Mr. Gluckstein—that was a fraudulent affair—they were tried at this Court a little time ago, and if I had known that the prisoner had sold them one pound of leather I should have closed his account at once—I did not know he was selling to fraudulent bankrupts—I do not do so if I can help it—I must admit that I am taken in sometimes—I think I have heard of Levenstone and Lazer; I think they made application to us for credit, which I refused—I call the prisoner a small boot manufacturer: he only employed 150 or 200 people—-firms in Norwich and so on employ thousands of hands—firms are small in the East of London—I should consider the prisoner to have been a pretty fair manufacturer for the East of London—I know very much larger ones there—when I returned to his premises at five o'clock to see the books I did not then know that the interim receiver was in possession—I did not know that he was in possession until after<lb/>wards—I went to Brushfield Street about 9.30 or 9.45 a.m., and stayed about half an hour—I did not see the boots being loaded into a van at that time; there were none in the place then—as far as I know, boots were only stocked on the ground floor; the rest of the place was used as a dwelling house—I did not go to Crispin Street till later in the day—at five o'clock there was about £20 worth of boots there—I know about how much the trustee to the Official Receiver received for a parcel of boots which was sold, but that included some boots received from the work-people, and were not disclosed at the time of the bankruptcy—the prisoner puts work out, and there were a number of boots in the hands of work-people who. I know, had instructions not to bring them in—I heard one of the workpeople say that while we were hunting about to find the</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant, of Devonshire Chambers, Bishopsgate—on December 1st, 1902, I was appointed trustee in the prisoner's bankruptcy—before that I had been acting as accountant to Mr. Doggett—as trustee, the books of the prisoner's business came into my possession—I had seen them in November—I found an invoice book among them—it was not brought up to date—the last invoice copied was July 10th, 1902—the last entry in the ledger was, I think, on Sep<lb/>tember 30th, 1903—there was no entry in the ledger or day book of any sale to Margolis or to Jacob Smith or Rachael Smith—I found no reference anywhere to sales of leather, cardboard or thread—I did not find any entries of sales of leather in September to Cohen—there was no entry of a receipt of a bill for £98 from Magnus on October 12th, or any other date—the last entry in the day book is October 13th—the entry is "October 13th, Barney Solomons, £13 4s., 96 linen thread at 1s. 6d."—when I first saw that book I say that entry was not there—I am afraid I cannot fix the date when I first saw it; it was some time in November—this other entry on October 6th was not there then; the last one was "September 30th, various goods, £151 11s."—I do not know of my own knowledge where the books were up to October 13th—in the ordinary course, after an interim receiver is put into a business, the books are left on the debtor's premises until a receiving order is made—this receiving order was made on November 12th, 1902—the statement of affairs was prepared on November 21st, 1902—an amended statement was filed on December 13th, a goods account filed on December 4th, and the cash account on January 15th, 1903—from November to January the books were in the prisoner's possession for part of the time—I let him see them. at the request of the Official Receiver—on December 11th the prisoner's banking account was overdrawn by £141 3s. 7d.—on October 13th I attended his premises with Mr. Doggett—the proceedings on the contested petition lasted from October 15th to November 12th—the prisoner was required to file an account from May 12th to November 12th, 1902—the cash account covered the same period—the total amount of purchases, according to the goods account, was £10,637 5s. 7d., for wages £4,025, total £14,662 5s. 7d.—the total amount disclosed as to sales during that period was £8,952 5s. 10d.; those were sales of which he gave particulars—the actual value of the stock in hand when I took possession was £545 19s. 8.;</p>

               <p>have the money to meet them—I think one became due on October 7th—I believe it was for £40 or £50—Feldman called for payment several times, so I gave him Magnus' bill for £98, which would liquidate the first bill and would be something on account of the other—the bills were paid into the bank and were discounted—I cannot remember when I paid them in—together they came to £116 17s. 4d.—they were drawn on July 4th—there is a discount entered in the pass book of 13s. on July 11th—the next bill is entered in the pass book on November 1st, when we were debited 11s. 7d. for discount—when my father became bankrupt the trustee stopped payment of Magnus' bill for £98 6s., which I had given to Feldman, who claimed the amount—there was an action with regard to it before Mr. Justice Wright, in which Feldman was successful—the trustee re<lb/>covered as to one bill and not as to the other—Feldman arranged to give me the balance which he owed us on the bill, but he did not do so; he said he had had enough trouble in getting the money on the first bill, and he meant to have something on account of the second, which fell due after the petition was presented—there were other bills which were not dis<lb/>closed in the cash account—that was not an oversight—they were given to people from whom we purchased—we do not keep a bill book for these bills—one was paid to Messrs. Baxter, and has since been paid over to the creditors—there was not much more stock during the early part of 1902 than we usually had—we bought exactly the same quantity that we were accustomed to buy—we never had an excess of stock at any time; we always bought as we wanted it—in October we purchased goods to the value of £150 only—that was raw material for making boots and shoes—on October 8th or 10th there was a normal amount of stock on our premises—it would not be true to say that it had disappeared by the 13th—no stock was removed between October 10th and 13th except what I have spoken to—we purchased glove hide from Scriven Bros, only—the last purchase was three months before the bankruptcy—we have not had any in the place since July; it was used up as it came in—Messrs. Fryer, Cooper &amp; Co. sold our stock after the bankruptcy—5,000 pairs of boots and shoes were sold after the petition—it is very hard to say what our average amount of boots and shoes was—sometimes we had a big stock and at other times very little—I should call 5,000 pairs a very good stock—I do not think we ever had more than 5,000 pairs in the place—we had a large quantity of leather, some machines, and a motor there—we had book debts—I cannot remember what they were worth—sometimes we had bad debts—I believe the bad debts were £917 19s. 10d., and good book debts £89 3s. 3d.—you cannot help making bad debts, people go bankrupt—we only gave credit where we were obliged—we never wrote our bad debts off—I do not know how old they were—they were not ten years old, they were only about two—I remember Mr. Younger calling—I do not remember the date—I told my father to put in his affidavit that Mr. Younger had called and said the goods were to be removed from the ground floor, as they were a source of danger in case of fire—Younger came and told us to have some machines and cases removed, as we should have somebody falling over them—my father must have made</p>

Wilson and Co., Essex Street, Strand—the Official Receiver appointed them to help me—I did not tell Mr. Wilson—that the search warrant had been issued before it was issued—I made no disclosure with regard to the goods sold to Margolis—Mr. Wilson wrote up the cash and goods account from my information—I do not know that there is no mention of Margolis's name in the goods account—if there is no mention it must be his omission—I told him to whom I had delivered goods—I did not tell him that there had been invoices with regard to those goods—he did not ask me, and I only told him what he asked—it is absolutely untrue to suggest that these invoices did not go to Margolis until after the search warrant was issued—I do not remember the date of the search warrant (<hi rend="italic">January</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1903)—as Mrs. Margolis bought the goods I gave her the invoices—there was no reason why the</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Collinson Street, Southwark, and am an electrotyper's assistant at 21. Camomile Street, with Messrs. Hudson &amp; Robinson—I have seen some copper shell in the hands of the police—it was made by my employers—I identify it as formerly belonging to my thai—it went through my hands, and a certain amount was sold to Levin &amp; Co.—I identify this copper because we are the only people that make it for the particular printers, Messrs. Alabaster &amp; Passmore—we have a yearly contract for making it, and the plates are the catalogue plates of Messrs. Dickins &amp; Jones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am prepared to identify this, it being a boot-plate—I say this is "Dickins &amp; Jones" and not "Every" on the top—I was shown some other plates at the Police Court—I identified those as our property, but did not swear to it—we had made some similar—I admit that there are plenty of people who have this sort of pictures of boots with the price underneath. and that sort of thing—it is about three mouths since we sold this.</p>

Arnold, Star Lane, no number, I had not seen before, came to me on December 11th, about 10 a.m.; he bought live or six bags of shell copper, weighing.3 cwt. 2 qrs. 11 lbs., for which I paid him 12s. a cwt.; at the same time he brought nine pigs of lead, for which I paid him 9s. a cwt. I asked him (Arnold) where he got it from; he said in the usual way of trade"—he gave a description of Arnold—the prisoner was taken to the station and charged with being in possession of this lead and copper—he said nothing when charged—I found no moulds or furnace on his premises.</p>

I mean to do it"—he did not say what it was—I hold him back while his mother got up off the floor and went out of the room—she was blooding—I advised her to go to a doctor—I remained in the house, and about 12.45 p.m. the police came—the prisoner stayed in the house till they came—he did not wish to go away—he was the worse for drink—from 1O.30 to 12.45 he was sitting in the kitchen.</p>

Inches long—the wound on the right of her nock was just under the jaw bone; it was quite superficial—the one on the left side want round the posterior angle; it was not near any dangerous vessels; the wounds on the hand were quite superficial: I think they were inflicted while she was defending herself.</p>
