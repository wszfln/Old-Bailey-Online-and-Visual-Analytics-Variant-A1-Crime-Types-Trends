These are my cases - they are worth about 4l.; the door which opens to the street does not at once admit you into the shop - there is a lobby, and on the right there is a door which enters the shop; the outer door is always open - the house is in the parish of St. Martin, Ludgate.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I did it through distress - I had been out of work a long time, and did not know what to do to get a bit of bread.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the night of the 16th of February I saw the prosecutor in Battle-bridge, about forty yards from Haddon-place - he told me he had been robbed; his account appeared sensible and correct - he said two women had robbed him; I went with him to the house, No. 3, Haddon-place, which is kept by the prisoner Brown - I know that; I found her there - Smith and her were both in the room when I went into the house; Gates went into the room with me, identified them, and said it was the room they had been in, and that they were the persons who robbed him; I asked Brown what she had to say to it - she said she knew nothing about the robbery, that some man came into the house, and ran away, and she had called out Police - Smith said she was not in the house at the time, that she had just come in - I took them to the station - Brown had 6s. 6d. in silver and 9d. in copper in her pocket; the prosecutor had said he had lost about 6s. 6d.; she said she had had the money before he came to the house - I found nothing on Smith.</p>
               <p>Brown. Q.Do you not recollect my calling you into the house, before you saw the man? A. No you did not call me in.</p>
               <p>Q. I said the man ran in with his basket, and two young men rushed in after him, and desired you to look after them? A.No; I had not spoken to you that evening. The prosecutor said Brown robbed him, and Smith held his hands the while.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence. The man came into my house and asked if I had got a fountain. - I said I thought the street was the best place for him; two men rushed in and wanted to strike him, and said, "Jack come out;" I went to the door to look for the Police, and saw Smith - I asked her to go and look for a Policeman; she came in; the two men ran away - he took his basket and ran after them, then returned with the Policeman, and said we had robbed him; he was asked which had robbed him, and pointed to Smith - he said the same at the station; I said she was not there, and then he said I assisted to rob him.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. Brown fetched me into the house; I found this man scuffling with two others; the Police was called - the prosecutor remained in the house, and presently he took his basket and went out - he came back in about twenty-five minutes, with a Policeman, and charged us with robbing him; I was not in the house at the time; he said at the station that I had robbed him, and then accused Brown of it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q.Where did I first meet you? A.By St. Luke's church - Mitchell-street is close by the church; I did not put any questions to you, nor stop you at all - I did not ask you the way to Brick-lane; I was not drunk - I had but one pint of beer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Your face was bruised very much - was it cut at all? A. Yes, under my nose; the skin was broken, and the blood flowed very freely; there was a great deal of blood to be seen on the wall - my skin was mostly cut by my lips; it was broken a little about my eye.</p>

I said I did not know; the prisoner George was out in the big yard - he did not see or hear what passed between us; I was taken by the Policeman on the Monday; I did nothing with the box but looked at it- the Policeman asked me if I had a little box; I said Yes, and pulled it from under my bed, and gave it to him - I was in prison for a week, and while there I heard John Godwin asked if he stole the money; he said Yes, he had stolen two guineas - that he gave them to his brother, and his brother gave him 8s. out of it.</p>

I received the box and the property in it from Fuller - I took John Godwin, and found 9d. on him; I told him the charge - he denied it, but going to the station-house he told his master and me that he had robbed the house; his master told him to tell the truth, and it would be better for him - I took George Godwin afterwards, and asked him if the ear-rings belonged to Mrs. Conway, and said his brother John had told me he had taken Mrs. Conway's ear-rings, and given them to him; he denied it, and I took him to the station-house, and on the road he said he could not find them till to-morrow morning; he never told me what he had done with them - I received these ear-rings from Gillmore.</p>

I asked where he had been - he said up stairs. I said, where there - he said, up stairs - I asked him again, and he made no reply; I turned round and saw the room door open - I seized hold of him, and called my husband, who secured him; the bundle contained the articles stated in the indictment, which are worth 6l. 12s. at least - it was taken out of the first floor front room, which I had locked, and had the key in my hand - he showed my husband the key which he had opened the door with - five keys were found on him - he was quite a stranger.</p>

On the 11th of October I locked the warehouse and left the premises between two and three o'clock, leaving him on the premises, with May and McDonnell; I gave Evans directions to bring me some oil that evening to my residence - I went home - he did not come with the oil - he did not come next morning as usual to fetch the key, which I had brought home, but I found he had absconded without even asking for his wages - four days' wages were due to him; I came to town about half-past ten o'clock in the morning of the 12th, and found the street door open, as it usually is; my warehouse door was open, and the padlock taken off - no violence had been used, it had been opened by keys, and I found the keys on the premises; I examined the workshop, that had been unlocked, and a key left in the door; I lost the property stated in the indictment out of the counting-house - the whole amount is between 1400l. and 1500l. I have recovered none of the property in the indictment; I did not see Evans until the 26th of March, when I saw him at the station-house - Pike was taken into custody on the night of the 15th of October; I saw him at the Police-office, and heard some conversation between him and Higgins, and heard him say to Higgins, that 50. or 100. was no object - that was all I heard; it was not intended that I should hear it at all: after some examinations Pike was discharged; but before that I went back in a coach with him to the prison - I asked him to tell me the truth about it - he said he could not do it there, but he would in prison, if I could get an order to see him, which I did; he then said he could do nothing about it in that prison, but if I could get him to Clerkenwell prison he might see his friends there, and something might be arranged; about a week after his discharge I met him in Hatton-garden, and said to him,"Well, Pritchard, we disturbed you again on Saturday night" - he said, "Yes, but if you keep disturbing us we shall not be able to do anything, but if you let us rest quiet a while, very likely there will be something done for you." There was a drawer belonging to a pair of scales in the warehouse; on the 11th of October I called Evans to that drawer - there was a parcel in it containing two old seals, an old chain, and an old key, which had been cleaned up; it was for Mr. Page - I called Evans' attention to that parcel; it is very seldom I keep property there; among other things taken that night, that parcel was taken out of that drawer - nobody knew it was there but Evans and me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Have you ever found these things since? A. No; the money was in an iron chest, about half a yard from that drawer. I never heard of a woman threatening to swear a child against Evans - I am a goldsmith and jeweller - I am also a hackneycoach master - my wife manages that for me - I keep seven hackney-coaches, but no coachmen, nor any weekly servants - I have men to take the coaches out - they never come to the premises in Serle's-place - I had two men in my employ at Serle's-place, and have had ten before now, but they had no knowledge of the premises - they were never in the room by themselves.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.Did Evans know where your iron chest was, and that you kept your money there? A. Yes; the chest was under the counter - nobody could see it without going behind the counter; Evans knew I kept money in the iron chest, and where the precious stones and all the property was.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not the workmen go behind the counter? A. Not unless I was there - I never knew them behind the counter when I was there; I do not recollect anybody ever going there.</p>
               <p>RICHARD MAY. I was in the employ of Mr. Half-penny on the 11th of October - I remember his going home that day perfectly well; I locked up the workshop, and put the key in a secret place in the passage - Evans knew where it was, because he put it there himself at times - it is a place known to me and the persons in the establishment, but to nobody else, to my knowledge, except to the prosecutor; John McDonnell, who is about forty years old, was there also; about four o'clock I sent Evans with a seal, to take with a parcel given to him by Mr. Halfpenny - he left the workshop for good at four o'clock - he was to take some oil to Mr. Halfpenny's house at Islington, but not to return; his work was over at four o'clock; I left the premises at half-past five, as it was impossible to see to work, and we had no lights at that time - when I left, the back parlour (which is the counting-house) was safe as Mr. Halfpenny had left it, when he took away the key - the padlock was on it, and it was to all appearance safe; McDonnell left about five o'clock - I was the last person there; about half-past seven next morning I went to the premises, having a job to do - I went to where I had placed the key of the workshop the preceding evening - it was gone; I crossed the yard, and found the key in the lock of the workshop, and that lock was unlocked: Evans generally came to work about nine o'clock, but he never came at all that day; I discoverd about half-past ten that the counting-house was open - I went and looked at the cupboard, which was open - I found a phosphorus-box on the counter, and some gold filings about - the place was rausacked; I went and told McDonnell; I then looked at the iron chest, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110011"/>found that open - Mr. Halfpenny came in about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many apprentices has Mr. Francis? A. I do not know; he has young men working for him, I cannot say how many - I was working there as a jeweller; I am a jeweller now and a cheesemonger - I set up a cheesemonger's shop in Kingsland-road on the 12th of November, and from 1829 to May, 1832, I was also a cheesemonger; I do not consider mine an extensive trade.</p>

             (Police-constable F 35). I know Pike; I heard of this robbery on the 13th of October, and on the 15th of October I saw Pike in Middle-row, Holborn, with the prisoner Evans - I knew Pike well before; I had seen him a few days before in a fustian jacket very shabby - on the 15th of October when I saw him with Evans; they both had new clothing on - apparently every thing was new, shirts, stockings, clothes, and every thing; they walked very quick past me - I was in company with our serjeant; they did not run, but walked very fast past us - I ran and got up to them; Evans put a handkerchief before his face, and turned back as if to pick something up - they turned back down as far as Glo'ster-court; they then both ran off like a shot as fast as they could run, and in Fox-court I lost Evans all in a moment; I secured Pike, and asked him who it was that was with him - he said he had no knowledge of him; I said, "Your name is Pike" - he said, "What do you want with me? my name is not Pike; I know nothing of the name;" I said, "I want you on a charge of felony;" he said,"I am a respectable man, and live at a bookseller's in Bow-street;" I said that was all in my way, and he would have an opportunity of seeing his friends, for I was going to Bow-street; we went along, I and Stace having fast hold of him - he said he was very thirsty, and in Long-acre I consented to his having some porter, and in the house he took a purse out of his pocket - he refused to let me look at it - I forced it out of his hand, and found four sovereigns in it; we went along, and I said, "Now this is the shop you say you live at, I will go in with you" - he said,"It is of no use telling a lie, I don't live there at all;" I took him the following morning before the Magistrate, and in the outer office he said, "It is of no use your pursuing the charge, and if you don't there will be a friend of mine here in ten minutes who will stand 50. or 100.;" Mr. Halfpenny was close by me (I wanted him to hear it) - I said, "What did you say?" and he repeated the words again; he was examined and remanded from time to time for six weeks - he told me at two different times, in Mr. Halfpenny's presence, that it was no use keeping him there, for the man who had the property he should not have an opportunity of seeing as long as he was kept there, but if they had him turned up, or let him out on bail, he had no doubt he could make it all right; I was unable to apprehend Evans up to this time - I had been looking for him all the time; after repeated examinations the Magistrate discharged Pike; I saw Evans in custody afterwards, and Pike was taken the same evening again.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.When you took him you told him it was for felony - he made various excuses, and said if he could get out, there was a man who would stand 50. or a 100., and he could do no good in that prison; but if let out on bail he could make all right? A. Yes; I had charged him with being concerned in breaking into this house - I charged him with Mr. Halfpenny's robbery - he made these observations afterwards; he was present when I signed the charge.</p>

            . I am a constable of Hatton-garden. On the night of the 26th of March I took Pike into custody, hearing that Evans had been taken; on the 27th they were both brought to Hatton-garden, and locked up separately - I went with Mr. Halfpenny into the lockup place, and asked Evans what he had to say about his master's property; he said he could not say any thing till he saw his uncles, Joe and Jem, and asked me to go after them - he said, would Mr. Halfpenny lend him any money, and if he behaved well to him he might not be at all the loss - Mr. Halfpenny would not lend him any; I took out 1s. and lent it him - he was at that time charged with this robbery, and Mr. Halfpenny was present.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had any body sent him 6d. worth of brandy? A. No; I had the keys of the place, and am satisfied nobody went in to him - I knew his friends, but know nothing of his father quarreling with him, or taking his wages from him, which made him go to Birmingham - I have known Evans about eight months, but did not know he was in Mr. Halfpenny's employ - I know his uncles, and went to them for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the boy he was sure to be bellowsed? A. I did not; I have heard the phrase - I never said he was likely to be hanged, nor try to terrify him in the least.</p>

            ; we live at No. 8, Serle's-place - we let the back parlour and workshop to Mr. Halfpenny. On the evening of the 11th of October, a little after six o'clock, I heard a voice, which I knew to be Evans' - I knew it perfectly well - the voice came from the passage which leads to the counting-house or warehouse; it appeared to be about six yards from the counting-house - the voice was speaking to somebody else, and I heard another voice answer; but I did not hear what they said - I can be certain the voice I heard was Evans' - I stated that at Hatton-garden; and while I was saying that, Evans replied that he could account for being there - I knew nothing of the robbery till Mr. Halfpenny came in the morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many apprentices has your husband? A.

            . I am the husband of Eleanor Francis. I was at home on the evening of the 11th of October, and saw the reflection of a light over the shutter of Mr. Halfpenny's counting-house; the shutter does not come within six inches of the top - there was a light, certainly, in Mr. Halfpenny's warehouse - it was from ten minutes to a quarter after six o'clock; it was a very unusual circumstance - I went down and mentioned it to my wife.</p>
               <p>MR. MALLET. I am clerk to the Magistrates at Hatton-garden. I took this examination of Evans from his own mouth, and afterwards read it over to him, and it was signed by Mr. Rogers, the Magistrate - Evans did not sign it; he was not asked - (read)</p>
               <p>The prisoner. Evans, says, "I went for the gallon of oil that evening, and to the two places, Mr. Evans states; I left at a quarter to four o'clock, and, on account of it being so early, I thought I must come back again, and I just went to the yard door. - I saw the shop was locked; I could see no key in the door, and went out again; that convinced me there was nobody at work - it was about half-past five o'clock. I took the oil bottle home to my father's. I might have muttered something to myself in the passage; when I came to the middle door in the passage it was open, and I recollect saying to myself - oh! this door is open for a wonder! that is all. I am quite innocent of the robbery."</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to the prosecutor's premises about half-past ten o'clock on the 12th of October; here is the padlock of the outer door, and the key in it; I found a crow-bar or jemmy, a phosphorus-box and matches, and three skeleton-keys, one of which fitted the padlock of the warehouse door, and the other opens the iron chest; the other will not fit the iron chest - there was a wax candle, which was not lighted, but one seemed to have been burnt.</p>

               <p>Pike's Defence. I have very much to complain of the prosecutor and Policeman making the statements they have - it is very easy to impute words to me, and very difficult for me to reply to them; there has been a gross perversion of words: Is it likely I should offer an officer 50l. or 100l., in the presence of a prosecutor, not to press the charge? Is it consistent with common sense? it appears Mr. Higgins is always offered money by every body he takes; when I first met him I said my name was Pritchard which certainly was false, but that is my mother's name, and she actually lives in Bow-street; Stace said he thought there was a bookseller of the name mentioned in Bow-street, and when they took me to Bow-street I requested them to let me call on my friends, but they refused till they went first, and it is not very probable I would allow them to alarm my friends, unless I went with them - I said I would not let them go at that time of night, but next morning I asked if he had been - he said he had not; he says I said I expected a friend in ten minutes - now, he knows I could not send out to any body at all: as to my promising to make it all right, I appeal to Mr. 
               <persName id="t18330411-15-person264">Flower</persName>
             the solicitor, whether I said so; he came accompanied by Mr. Halfpenny to the House of Correction; Flower asked whether I was able and willing to give them information - I said it did not lay in my power, and that I had said over and over again I knew nothing of the robbery: Halfpenny said, "You have said so twenty times, but I know better"- Flower said, "Are you willing to give us information?" I said I was willing if able, but I knew nothing about it - I was always beset by somebody; I said if I was at liberty and could get information, I would certainly do it, if able- I had several with me about giving information; but as to saying if I was out I could see the man who had got the property, it does not stand to reason that I should say so: I was eight or nine weeks in custody, and then discharged - since that there has not been another shadow of evidence produced but what was on my examination then; as to being with Evans on the 15th of October, it was not Evans; there was a witness at Hatton-garden who was of consequence to me, but they found her deposition was not of advantage to them, and she is not here; she could prove Evans was actually destitute, and in want of victuals and money, and she supplied him with food and 7d., instead of being in new clothes that day.</p>

            . I was with the officer when Pike was taken, and am sure Evans is the man who was with him - they were both dressed in new clothes.</p>
               <p>Pike. That man has worked for the prosecutor three years; he did not come to any of the examinations to state that Evans was the boy.</p>
               <p>Evans. What Higgins says is false; he apprehended me once for picking pockets.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to MR. HALFPENNY. Q. Is this paper your hand-writing; it has just been sent to me anonymously - look at the name but do not unfold it? A. I do not think it is - it is not.</p>
               <p>Q.Read the document now, and tell me if you will swear it is not your hand-writing? A.This appears like my hand-writing - it is mine; I did not lose any houes; I signed this paper to get part of my property back - I got some of it back, but none of that which is stated in the indictment; I believe the person's name who I signed this for is Jackson; I did not think it was my writing at first.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.This is dated 21st December, 1832, and says "I hereby agree not to prosecute any party connected with the robbery of my house, which took place on the 11th of October," who did you sign that for? A. A man named Jackson, because he promised to bring me my property back; I signed it with that view,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110013"/>and to get a conviction against him and all the parties; I expected to see all the parties; I have recovered about 170l. worth of my property; I obtained it from a cabman, who rode up my yard, and rang the bell - it was stones of different descriptions; when I said I had recovered none, I meant none of the property in the indictment - I understood that to be the question asked me.

On the 23rd of March, at ten minutes before seven o'clock in the evening, I went out, I locked my room door, and left the key in the landlord's room down stairs - I was absent about twenty-five minutes; when I came home I took the wrong key up by mistake, and could not open the door; and as I went down to change the key I heard a noise, and looked round and saw two men come out of my room. I called out, "Hallo, what do you want there?" they said they were only going to inquire for a friend, and at the same time they were rushing past me; I caught one by the coat, and followed them down stairs, calling thieves - Mrs. Green opened the door of her room, with a light in her hand - she alarmed the men in the shop, who ran into the street - she came to my assistance, and we stopped both the men in the passage, by the door, but they got out - I followed one to the corner of the house, where I saw my husband take hold of one of them - he had ran out on hearing the alarm - he took Connolly; the other was followed as far as Blenheim-steps, and was not taken that night. I have no doubt about Connolly, for he was taken in my sight. Cooke was the other man, I swear positively - I knew him to be the same man when I saw him, and I swore positively to him; I was present when Connolly was searched - nothing was found on him, but in a pitcher of water, which stood in the shop under where he stood, a purse was found containing three sovereigns, a silk handkerchief, and three skeleton-keys - I lost nothing from the room but the purse, handkerchief and three sovereigns - it was my purse, and contained that money - it was left in a drawer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long after the transaction was Cooke taken? A.More than a fortnight - I never said I did not think he was the man - it was dark when I came home - I was rather confused - I kept hold of the skirt of one of their coats till I got to the bottom of the stairs, but I saw them both plainly when they stopped in the passage - the struggle lasted not more than ten minutes - we had a candle in the passage.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How far is your house from Blenheim-steps, where Connolly was taken? A. It is not more than ten houses from our house - I only took hold of one of their coats - Connolly was brought into the shop after he was taken - there was only one person in the shop, whom my husband was shaving - there was a crowd round the door, and a man came in before he went out - nobody else came into the shop - other people stood by the door - there might be four or five persons altogether in the shop when the pitcher was searched, but there was no more at that end of the shop; they had not been round the prisoner - I cannot say who might have gone near the pitcher - when I came down there was not more than five persons in the shop - he denied all knowledge of the things in the pitcher, but I saw him put something down - I told the Magistrate so - I never said, that when I went out I found the street door open.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure your door was locked? A.Quite sure.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How far are the steps from your house? A.About ten houses.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You was not frightened? A. I was rather alarmed - the passage is about ten yards long - the prisoners rushed by me as quick as they could - I instantly followed them, and saw their faces - they could not get out of the door so quick as they wished - they stood sideways, and looked me in the face, both of them - the candle was not above a yard from the door - I had it in my hand, and my child in my arms - I was rather alarmed - the child is four years and a half old - I did not see Cooke again for more than a fortnight - I cannot tell the colour of his coat or cravat, I took most notice of his face - he had a black hat on - I saw his face and his hat too.</p>

            . I apprehended Cooke on this charge and another charge, on the 29th of March, at a new beer-shop in Crown-street, Soho; I found a phosphorus-box and a crooked chisel in the room he lodged in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How do you know he lodged there? A. The key I found in his pocket opened the room door; he told me it was the key of his room door - he did not say where the room was; I went there by information.</p>
               <p>MRS. BALCOMBE. The handkerchief is my husband's, and the purse is ours, and contains the money we had.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is it not because you usually lock your door that you say you did so that morning? A. I will not swear it positively, but to the best of my recollection I locked it; I have not found the spoons and pins.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 29th of March, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was standing at the bottom of St. Martin's-lane, and saw the prisoner in Hemming's-row, with a bag and a handkerchief; I had seen him before, and followed him - I saw him first go on one side of the street, then on the other, and look behind him; I followed him as far as Green-street, Leicester-square; I then went up, and asked what he had got - he said clothes; I asked him whose they were - he said they were his own: I asked where he brought them from - he said that was another man's business; I said I should stop him on suspicion - I did so, and took him into a public-house; he remained there till I got more assistance - he was very resolute, and said he would not be stopped; I got further assistance, and secured him; I took possession of the bundle, and now produce it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not tell you he had bought them of a gentleman's servant? A. Yes, when he got to the station, but not till then; it is not above ten minutes' walk - he said he bought them of a gentleman's servant that day, for 2l. 8s.; I did not find the spoons - I found no housebreaking implements on him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know her before? A. Yes, for four years - she often pawned at another shop where I had lived, but not at this shop; she then pledged in the name of Myddleton - I did not recollect her, not having served her for a considerable time; grown people generally say things are their own.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.This was at Mill-wall? A. Yes; I understand she has a husband who is employed by Mr. Fuller, a builder; she knew Martin was in custody when I took her; the house has been a lodging-house for seamen, but Martin was the only lodger at that time.</p>
               <p>MRS. REEVE.

               <p>Q. Are you blind with one eye? A. Yes; I never saw her at all - I cannot say who Mrs. Davis might have on the landing, but she only brought one woman into my room - I never said, if I made a flaw in the indictment that would blackguard me - Mrs. Davis came to me when I was in bed, before I went to the Magistrate; I then said I did not want to injure him, and, if she paid the doctor's bill, I would not go before the Magistrate; I did not kick the prisoner in the presence of West - it is West's son and Pearse who have ruined him - West keeps a disorderly house; one of my apprentices was convicted yesterday.</p>

             ABRAM. I am assistant surgeon to Mr. Griffiths. On the 12th of February, I saw the prosecutor at his house, in Tudor-street; he had received some severe wounds from a sharp instrument - they were clear incised wounds, one near the joint of the hip, the other about the centre of the exterior of the thigh; I found cuts about his clothes, but no other wound on his body - they were not dangerous wounds,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110017"/>not calculated to do any great harm - they would not maim him; they were about three quarters of an inch deep, and must have been inflicted with great violence, I think.</p>

I was sweeping the passage down stairs in my father's house, and heard a noise next door, about ten o'clock in the morning; I heard William Davis say to my father "D-n your blood, I will murder you;" I looked out to see what was the matter; I saw my father take William Davis by the collar, and throw him down; I looked into the door of the building - I saw my father have the boy by the collar, and throw him down on his back; I saw my father struggling with the chisel to take it out of his hand, and he attempted to stab him in the breast while he was attempting to take it out of his hand; my father jumped up, and Davis jumped up - father pushed him out of the door; I rang the bell for my mother to come down, and my father fell down from loss of blood (fainting); the prisoner went up stairs, came down again, and went away - he was not up stairs a minute; he had nothing in his hand when he came down - he did not say what he went up stairs for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw him after this took place? A. Yes - his face was not bleeding.</p>
               <p>JOHN BISHOP. I am an upholsterer and cabinet-maker. My daughter came to me rather terrified, and said, "Father, Mr. Hutchinson is lying bleeding to death, the boy has stabbed him;" I put on my coat and hat, and went and found the prosecutor in his own room.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say Hutchinson had struck him? A. I think he said Hutchinson had kicked him and knocked him about - the prisoner had a little cut on his lip; it was only bleeding a little - he wiped it off with his handkerchief; it did not bleed much.</p>

My master was in the constant habit of ill-using me, ever since I refused to go to the Political unions with him - he restricted me to come home by nine o'clock, and if not at home then, he locked me out; he was constantly quarreling with me because I would not write to my mother for money - I was kneeling down to my work, which I was obliged to do, he came and kicked me, and accused me of telling tales, which I denied; I got up to prevent his hitting me again, he knocked me down, kept kicking me in the ribs, and told me to be gone and never come near the place again.</p>

            . I am a cabinet-maker, and live in the same house as the prosecutor. I was coming out of my room door and heard a cry of murder, in Stone's house adjoining; I went to the parlour, and the prisoner was laying across the rafters or joists - the prosecutor was standing over him; he said, "D-n you, get up," and gave him a kick - I saw that; the prisoner said, "Let me get up," and as he attempted to rise, I saw the prosecutor strike him in the mouth with his fist, but at that time the prosecutor was wounded; I did not see the wound given - the prosecutor said, "The rascal has stuck an inch and a half chisel into my thigh;" he kicked the prisoner in the side, and struck him in the the mouth - I have had no quarrel with the prosecutor; he claims 9s. 6d. for work which Stone, my landlord, has paid him.</p>
               <p>GEORGE PEARSE. I am a bricklayer and plasterer, employed by Mr. Stone, at his house, in Tottenham-court-road. On the 22nd of February the prisoner came and asked my leave to open the shutters of the house, to let some light in; I was on the scaffold at work at the time - the prosecutor came and ordered the prisoner in, but what he said I cannot tell: in about ten minutes I heard a scuffle, and heard Hutchinson say if he did not get out he would murder him, and I heard the prisoner cry murder three times distinctly; I was at the window of the room: it was certainly the prisoner's voice, for there is a great difference between them; I got off the scaffold, went round and heard the prisoner say, "Give me my shoes, and I will go;" I then returned to work; I have known Hutchinson two years, and know he had a macharoni.</p>

Bank note - I did not know the prisoners before that day, but am not mistaken in them, having seen them at the public-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What sort of a night was it? A.Rather dusk, not very dark; I did not see the moon; Saunders was brought to me at the Falcon in custody, about half-past nine o'clock or twenty-five minutes to ten that night; but I cannot say what I stated then, for I was so knocked and beat about; I did not say he was not one of the men; when I had recovered myself I said he was one of the men - I did not say I could not tell them; I told the Magistrate they ran so close together I could only speak to these three; I did not say Herring robbed me - I blamed him for not assisting me; he ran away: I did not say I could not swear to Saunders.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you remember Darvill, the officer, bringing Barton to you at the Falcon? A. They were taken there; I do not recollect saying he was not one of them: I cannot recollect what I said that night - I knew the men perfectly well, but I was kicked, beat, and jammed; I had hardly a bit of life in me; I never said Barton was not one of them - I am sure of them all.</p>
               <p>Carter. Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate you did not recollect seeing me before, but the men had on dark jackets who robbed you? A. Yes, and a jacket was put on you, which was the one you robbed me in; I had been in your company all day, and when you put the velveteen jacket on I knew you again - I did not know you so well before; I told the Magistrate it was nearly dark, but they were the men.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you swear to them before the Magistrate, or say to the best of your knowledge they were the men? A. To the best of my knowledge - I was beat about so, and was weak and faint; I know these three, but not all the party; I was not so sure of Carter till he put the jacket on, but I did not say he was not one of them.</p>

            . I am a fiddler. On the 25th of March I was at the Falcon with Gates and his son - there were a dance there; I did not see either of the prisoners at the house - I drank with Mr. Gates about eight o'clock; I did not see any body else drink with him - there was about twenty people in the room; the dance was there - I came out about nine o'clock to go to Harefield with Gates and his son, but before we had been out of the house five minutes, a gang of seven or eight overtook us in Page's-lane, about three hundred yards towards Harefield; they seized Gates, and threw him down - about five of them ran up together and got round him, and in my fright I ran back to Uxbridge, calling Murder! as I went along; I could not identify either of them - before I could get assistance, Gates came back and complained that he was robbed; I cannot swear to any of the party - it was a dark night; there had been a little rain before we started - it was so dark that I could not distinguish a person; it would be impossible to swear to a person - when I came back to the Falcon, Saunders was there; (I had been to call Darvill, the constable;) Darvill was not at home - then I went to the Falcon, and found Saunders, and Gates complained that he had been robbed; I rather think the three prisoners were present at the robbery - I saw two of them with velvet frocks on, who I think were Saunders and Carter; I could distinguish the velvet frocks - I do not venture to swear they are the men; Saunders had a velvet frock when I saw him, and a velvet frock was found in Carter's bundle when he was apprehended next morning; all of them might have had velvet frocks.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long after the robbery did you get back to the Falcon? A. It might be twenty minutes - I found Saunders there; I ran back to Uxbridge, being in danger of my life; the principal of them wore velvet jackets, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Carter. Q. Did not Mr. Gates say he could not swear to us it was so dark? A. He might - I did not notice what he said; I do not recollect seeing you at the Falcon; Gates accused me because I ran away, but he was so agitated he did not know what he said.</p>

            . I was at the Falcon, and saw Gates and his son there with Herring, and saw them go away - all the three prisoners were there; Gate went away about nine o'clock - Herring went with them Gates went out first, and the prisoners went out close after them - at the same time the doors were open; I was giving charge at the door to a constable - there was a row in the house; I let Gates in again when he came back; when the prisoners went out, Saunder said, "Bill make haste - he is gone - come on;" it might be twenty or twenty-five minutes after that when Gate came back and complained that he had been robbed, and a very few minutes after there was a knocking at the door, and Mr. Murray said, "It is me;" I let him in and then Saunders and Barton came in - Gates was in the room then, but I was keeping the door; nothing was said about the robbery in my hearing; I had to assist to take two men to the cage for a row, and I do not know what passed - I never saw Carter afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not Carter go down to the cage of his own accord? A.

            . On Monday, the 25th of March, I was going home - I live next door to the Falcon. I heard a terrible noise at the Falcon, and went to see what it was; it was about twenty minutes after nine o'clock - I saw Saunders, and I believe Carter, knocking with their feet at the door, to get in; Saunders said, "We must get in, or else they will murder my father - I went to the door and shook it; they knew my voice, and opened it, and Powell let me in - Saunders and the other pushed in, and two boys ran by and said, "A man has been robbed in Page's-lane" - when we got inside the house there was a terrible scuffle about a glass; the constables were bleeding, and some people in the house were bleeding - in about ten minutes Gates came in, very much exhausted and agitated, and said he had been robbed - the constables at that time had just handcuffed some men for an assault; Gates went and sat down for about ten minutes before any body took notice of him; but, after the other men were sent out in custody, Gates began to describe the men that robbed him, as being dressed in dark clothes - I pointed to Saunders, and said"Why, surely this must be one of them?" - Gates said he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110020"/>was one of them; he was given into custody; and when the other prisoners were taken to the cage, my father, not knowing Saunders was charged with robbery, said, "You may let that man go;" he was let out, and he followed the other prisoners to the cage - I told my father he was charged with robbery; I went and sent a constable after him, and he was brought to the Falcon - Gates would not positively swear to him; he said he believed him to be one of the men, but he was agitated very much, and would not then swear to him - next morning Carter was brought to the Falcon, on suspicion, and I said to the young man, Why you was here last night, keeping the door, and you was differently dressed last night?' - he then had a sleeve jacket on - the constable handed his bundle, and there was a black velveteen jacket in it; I said, "Put it on," - he did so; and I said, "Well, surely you were here last night" - he said, "Well, I was very drunk, and I do not know whether I was or not" - I meant he was the man who had come in at twenty minutes after nine o'clock,</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You found Saunders' father in trouble about a row? A. Not at that time, Saunders was discharged after I pointed him out to Gates; he went down to the cage after that - he was about ten minutes in the house before I directed Gates' attention to him, but there was a row; he was twelve or fourteen feet from Gates, and several people were passing and a crowd round him; he was agitated and flurried.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know Darvill, the officer? A. Yes; he came to the Falcon after Gates - I did not see Barton there for a considerable time after some others were taken to the cage - Moses Gates said that he was one of them, but did not speak positively that night; he said that night, some time after he was searched, that he had held his mouth - he said he believed him to be the man, and then that he was sure of him.</p>

               <p>Carter's Defence. I was at Uxbridge fair and got drinking; I went to the Jolly Ostlers about half-past eight at night, and never left it but for about five minutes, to go into the yard.</p>
               <p>JOHN JONES. I am a pig-dealer, and know Saunders - I saw him about four o'clock in the afternoon, at the Lion, and went with him to the Falcon about nine; I did not go in there myself, but about nine a person came into the Lion and said Saunder's father had got into a row at the Falcon - he and another or two directly went down to the Falcon; I walked down, and when I got there he was kicking at the door to be let in - he got in at last; I left him - he had been at the Lion more than half an hour when he was fetched from the Lion; I had been in and out of the Lion, and he was sitting there every time I went in.</p>

I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner on Monday, the 4th of March- he was charged with taking away this musical-box; I took him into another room to search him - I cautioned him, and told him he might do as he pleased, he might say nothing, or he might save me a great deal of trouble; he denied it - I said it was useless denying it; he afterwards said I should find it in Old-street-road, at Mr. Coates' - a woman gave me the box there from between some bedticking on a shelf; I took it to Mr. Sawer - he put the clock on it, which exactly fitted it.(Property produced and sworn to).</p>

The prisoner is an entire stranger; this plait was on the first-floor warehouse - I had seen it safe on the Saturday, about six o'clock in the evening; the warehouse was secured by shutters to the windows, and one door was bolted inside, and the other door was locked on the outside - I am not certain whether the key was not left in the lock; I went to the warehouse on Monday morning, and found this property had been taken away - it was worth about 200l.; I saw it that morning in Seager's house - he is an officer; I was certain it was the same plait.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was there any mark on it by which you could identify it? A. It had; I was not the last person there on Saturday - I left one or two persons there; I left about six o'clock - I never recollect a customer taking plait away in a coach; it is usually packed in boxes or trusses.</p>
               <p>HOWELL GODDARD. I am beadle of St. Ann and Agnes, which parish this warehouse is in. On Sunday evening, the 17th of March, I was going along Noble-street, towards the warehouse, and saw a hackney-coach coming towards me; I saw a man just ahead of the coach - I have not seen him since; another man was driving it; it was coming along at a very slow pace - I kept it in sight about three minutes; I cannot say who was driving it at that time, to be certain - the coach was beyond Mr. Nutting's house when I first saw it; I saw it come by the house - it did not stop; the man who was ahead turned his face to the wall at the corner of a passage, he looked at me, which made me take notice; the coach went down St. Ann's-lane, and the man crossed towards me, and turned up Maiden-lane - I did not see him again: the coach went to the bottom of St. Ann's-lane, returned back again, and came along Noble-street; I saw the number behind was plastered with mud - there were numbers on the side, but they were on very small round plates; I watched the coach into Falcon-square, and as it rained hard, I went in and put on my great coat, and went out into Falcon-street, and saw the same coach standing at the corner, close against Aldersgate-street; I am quite sure it was the same coach - the coachman was with it - I believe it to be the prisoner, but I do not speak with certainly - he had a drab great coat on; I went over to the watch-house in Little Britain for assistance - Seager came with me, and I found the coach was then gone; I desired Seager to go round through Falcon-square - I went down Aldersgate-street, and met the coach coming down St. Ann's-lane, at a quick pace; I said to the coachman, "What have you got here?" (the prisoner was the coachman then - nobody else appeared to have any charge of the coach;) he answered, there was a gentleman inside - I opened the door - there was nobody inside at all, but there were three large bags; I desired the prisoner to come down off the box - he said he was hired by a gentleman by the Post-office; I desired him to lead the horses to Little Britain, and I then gave him in charge - I found the bundles were straw plait; I left it at the watch-house while I went to Noble-street - I went in at the back door of Nutting's house, went to the front door, and found it on the spring lock; I went into the warehouse - the key was in the lock, inside the house; there was no violence on that door, but on going up stairs I found some large drawers broken open in the warehouse; I found this jemmy on the floor of the first-floor warehouse, and on examining the door which leads up to the second floor, on the stairs, I found it had been forced open - it was only fastened by a small bolt; I went up to the attic, and found the window open - I then went and got the key of an empty house, two doors off, and on the balustrade of that house, under a trap-door, there were footmarks, and the tiles were off the roof - that would give access to the window of Mr. Nutting's house; I went to the watch-house, searched the prisoner, and found on him a gimblet; on examining the bags in the coach, in one of them was found eight small skeleton-keys and one blank one, with was on it - and this large key was loose in the bottom of the bag, and that opens the door of the empty house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found the prisoner was a hackney-coachman? A. Yes; an umbrella was found in the coach - I heard so; I lost sight of the coach three times - I did not know any thing was amiss at first, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110022"/>had suspicion, as the number was daubed; I did not see any body inside the coach - while I was absent any body might have escaped; I had not the least reason to suspect the robbery was contemplated till I saw the coach; I first went to Mr. Daw's and then to Mr. Nutting's, they being the only persons in the trade; I asked the prisoner how many times he had been up Noble-street - he said only once, that a gentleman called him off the stand at the Post-office, put an umbrella into the coach, and told him to follow him - he never claimed the plait; I cannot tell when the warehouse was broken open; he said the gimblet was to make holes in his harness, which might be the case; the bag the keys were in was at the bottom of the bag the plait was in - the horses' heads were towards the empty house; I did not see the coach stop at the prosecutor's door - the prisoner did not attempt to escape.</p>
               <p>THOMAS RIVERS. I am a patrol of Aldersgate ward. I was at the watch-house in Little Britain at nine o'clock, and saw Mr. Goddard bringing the hackney-coach along; he left it in my possession - on opening the door there were three bags of straw plait, which I took into the watch-house - the prisoner was sent into the watch-house first; under the coach seat was found this umbrella, wringing wet - Goddard left the prisoner in my care; he returned in three quarters of an hour, and Seager took possession of the property; I saw Mr. Nutting next day, and he claimed the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It had been raining? A. Yes, very hard.</p>

On the 17th of April, about half-past eight o'clock, I saw a gentleman call the prisoner's coach off the rank at the Post-office - it was very wet; the gentleman said, "Follow me to Noble-street" - the prisoner followed the gentleman up Falcon-street; he had been about a quarter of an hour on the stand - I did not see him again till he was at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know the number of the coach? A. No; I did not see the gentleman get into the coach, nor the bundles put in; it is Mr. Seabrook's coach - it was dirty, having been out all that wet day; I did not attend before the Alderman - I told Seager of this that night.</p>

When the prisoner came out she gave me some things in a bundle, and a man took them home - I had not taken the man with me; he was a stranger to me - I went to the prosecutor's house about two o'clock, and came away about five - I did not see what was in the bundle; I walked part of the way with the man, and then rode home - the man carried the articles upon his shoulder, I suppose - I paid him for carrying them - when Mrs. Richardson came to my house she found the things up stairs in my bed-room- I had not opened them; she had no trouble in going up stairs - she said if the things were given up without a search-warrant, she would not interfere any more in it; she said she supposed I knew the business she came on; I said No, I did not - she said Elizabeth had been robbing her, and she had come for the things which were brought from her house last night; I said, I had not brought any thing - she did not claim a piece of carpet which was on the floor - I said I had nothing but that old piece of carpet, which Elizabeth had given me some time before, but I do not know when - I do not know whether there was a child's toy, called a Noah's Ark, at my house; I do not know whether the prosecutrix asked me for a piece of coarse cloth - I do not remember that I denied having it; I do not know whether she found it at my house, as the things were all in a bundle - she followed me up stairs, and the things were on the floor.</p>

I knew her sister lived at Batterses, and for that reason I went there: the prisoner had been staying with her before she came to me - my French teacher came to me for my cook to have two hours' absence on the day her sister came to my house; when I went to the prisoner's sister's, I left word for the prisoner not to leave my house till I returned, but she ran away five minutes after I was gone; she came the next day to demand her wages - this old piece of carpet was on her sister's floor at Battersea; these other pieces, which were in the bundle, are pieces of my drawing-room carpet - I know this cloth by a cut which I made in it; I compared it with what remains, and it makes up the exact quantity I had.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have heard Eliza Newman examined - is it true that you had considerable trouble before you saw the things? A. Yes, she said she had nothing of mine, and I had no right to come without a search-warrant - I said I thought she would like me better to come alone; the things were not tied up - I could see what they were.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ARKELL (Police-constable N 68.) I took the prisoner the next day - I went in at the back of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110024"/>house, and found her sitting in the passage in a chair, and this property by her side.</p>
               <p>MRS. RICHARDSON. These are my property; they had been kept in the servants' bed-room, at the back of the kitchen.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Where was this sack? A. On the top of the load - the tilt was folded over this, and over part of the load; the prisoner went back quietly - I had him in custody, but did not take hold of him.</p>

A.We give them a bushel every night for three horses - he had his chaff and oats mixed in a bag, and I should think he had three parts of a bushel in his nosebags; he had more than he ought to have had besides this- he had no business with this at all.</p>

There is one counter which goes round the shop; there was one other person serving at the time the prisoners were there; and one other man standing in the shop nearer the door than I was - these two women came in first, and the men close behind them; I should know the other man if I saw him - ours is not a regular haberdashers shop; we have not a great many customers- I did not know I had been robbed till the next morning; these handkerchiefs are part of what I showed them.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA FREDERICK CLEMENTS. I am an inspector of Police. The female prisoners were given to me on the 1st of March - they objected to my searching them, and I sent for a woman; these four handkerchiefs were found on Turner, tied up in this blue one - John Sherman afterwards came to the station, and I took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know the prosecutor's shop? A. Yes, I think it is half a mile from the station; I saw this property taken from under Turner's clothes - she had a cloak on, but it was under her other things.</p>

             (Police-constable F 35.) I took the prisoner into custody - he told me on the way to the station that he had taken the spoons, and it was of no use denying it - unless Mr. Cuff forgave him, without mentioning the circumstance, he would rather be transported; in searching the room to which he directed me as his (and of which I found the key in his pocket) I found two files, with silver filings in them.</p>
               <p>MR. BANKS. These are our spoons - the prisoner had not been employed there that day; there are sixteen or eighteen spoons a year lost from there, for which the waiters are responsible.</p>

               <p>RICHARD DEVKIN. I am an inspector of lamps at Kentish-town; I live in Grenville-street. On the evening of the 19th of February, I saw the prisoners near the bridge on the Hampstead-road, and two others with them; I suspected them, as one of them had just come out of a shop, and I took Hughes, who was running from the shop; I found two domino boxes, and three balls in his pocket, which he said one of the boys had given him, and he had given him a knife; I left him at the Britannia, public-house, and went and took the other four; I found on Smith one of the balls, and a small domino box, and on Setter, this squirt - one box was found in the tap-room.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.For what you know Elstole might be running after the thief? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HOLMES (Police-constable K 221). I was on duty about four o'clock, and saw the two prisoners run by me - Tyer had this coat under his arm; I watched them for about one hundred yards - they then turned the corner I kept on Mile-end-road, and saw them again running up the Bow-road and another person with them - the other two persons then got over a fence, and Tyer gave the coa over the fence to one of them; I got over, and pursued them across two fields - they dropped the coat, and as I was fatigued, I took up the coat and returned to the watch-house, as I knew that my brother officer had taken Tyer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Had you lost sight of them? A. Yes, certainly; Elstole was taken about six o'clock, I think - he had run as far as Limehouse.</p>
               <p>JAMES STILL (Police-constable K 35). On the 25th of February, between four and five o'clock, I was at my own door, two carpenters came and told me three men had run up the road with a coat under their arm - I ran and saw Tyer with the coat on his arm; I cannot say whether Elstole was one of the other persons, but Tyer gave the coat over to one of the two who got over the fence - I took Tyer, and asked him who the other parties were; he said he did not know - he was walking along with this crowbar up his arm, and his hands in his pockets; I found on him this candle and a knife - the coat was brought in about a quarter of an hour; Elstole was brought in between five and six o'clock.</p>

I was on duty, and saw the three men running - I followed them; two of them got over the fence - I followed them as far as Bow-common-lane; Elstole and the other then placed themselves against a wall and showed fight - the other man then took up a brick, and threw it at me, as he said to knock my b - y brains out; they then ran off again - I followed them to the wooden bridge; I then saw a gentleman in a chaise, and I called to him to stop them -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110028"/>he turned Elstole back, and I took him; the other got away.</p>

             (Police-serjeant D 6). On the 28th of February, I took the prisoner at Mr. Simpson's for taking a piece of ribbon in his shop; I found this ribbon in a box which I got from No. 53, Connaught-terrace - I took the box to the station, and asked the prisoner if it was hers, she said it was; I found several other things in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I believe the things you found were advertised? A. Yes, but I found the owner of this ribbon by going to different shops.</p>
               <p>MR. ROBERTS. This is my ribbon - I cannot tell when I lost it.</p>

About the 23rd of February, the prisoner came to match a yard of black silk, which she had previously bought a dress of; after she was gone I missed thirteen yards of silk, which had been on the near counter where she had been - I saw the silk at the station, with some ribbons and handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.You are sure she was in your shop about the 23rd of February? A. Yes; ours is but a small shop - we missed silk of this sort, but there may be more of the same sort; it has our mark on it.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Is your master here? A. Yes; I swear I saw her purchase a piece of silk of this description of a short man, of a dark complexion - she bought it ten days before she was taken: she paid 26s. for this and some ribbons: it was on the mat just inside the door - the man was there half an hour; I saw the silk in the kitchen - I do not know whether it was measured, but they said there were thirteen yards; I went out and got change for a sovereign for the prisoner to pay for it - she cut this bit off the end of it, before the man went away, to try if it would wash.</p>

The prisoner came to his shop on the 28th of February, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening - she bought a trifling article, went out, and came in again in ten minutes, and asked for two or three other articles, which the lad was showing her - I saw him showing her some ribbons; he rolled up one, put it in its place, and showed her some others; he called me, and said he missed one - I went forwards to look for it; the boy said he was sure he missed one - I placed myself between her and the door, and looked for the ribbon, but could not find it in the drawer; I asked the prisoner if she had put it into her pocket-handkerchief by mistake - she said No; her umbrella was by her side - I asked if it had fallen into that; she said No, she did not carry things in her umbrella; I said a piece of ribbon was certainly missing, and as Mr. Simpson was out, and I was left in charge, I must detain her - I asked if she had any objection to wait; she said No - I asked if she would walk further into the shop and take a seat; she walked in, and sat down by the stove, in the middle of the shop; I still kept between her and the door - she seemed very uneasy, as though she could not sit quiet; I apologised for keeping her so long - she said it was of no consequence, and presently she slipped her shoe off her foot; she stooped to put it on again, and I saw her put her hand under the stove, which stood on her left - she then said she could not wait any longer; I sent for an officer - she then got up, and came towards the door; I still kept between her and the door, and told the other boy to look under the stove, which he did, and brought out this ribbon, from the very place where I had seen her put something; when the officer came she begged not to be sent with him - I told her it was her own obstinacy in denying that she took the ribbon; she then said,"Well, I did, don't let me go" - I understood her to mean that she took the ribbon; this lace was found on her at the station - it is my employer's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long have you been in the service? A. Three years - I had seen the prisoner several times before, but did not know where she lived; I was serving other customers when she first came in, but not the next time - I was then two or three yards from the boy who served the prisoner; I was doing nothing.</p>

            . I have seen the prisoner at my master's - she came on the 28th of February, about eight o'clock in the evening; she first asked for stay-laces - I served her, and she paid 2d. for it; she then asked for blood lace - I showed her some; she told me to cut her a yard off at 8d.; she gave me 1s. - I gave her the change; she then left the shop, and returned in about ten minutes - there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110029"/>were some muslin handkerchiefs by the door, marked 6d.; she told me to cut her off one, which I did; she then asked for some band-ribbons for the waist - I showed her a drawer of them, and opened four or five pieces: she said there was none that suited her - I turned to get another, and saw her put her hand to the drawer, take it out, and put it behind her; I looked, and missed one at 2s. 6d. a yard - I then called Mr. Kirby, and told him; he asked her if she had any objection to take a seat - she said No; and she took a seat - Mr. Simpson did not come, and she got uneasy; I was sent for an officer - the other boy took this ribbon from under the stove; I was at the station-house, and saw the officer take her cloak off, and under her arm was this other piece of ribbon, which is not my master's - I did not see the lace found on her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you and your fellow-servant talked over this matter? A. No; I have certainly spoken to him about it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HORSFORD (Police-serjeant D 6). I took the prisoner, and searched her at the station; I found on her a roll of ribbon, a sovereign, three shillings in silver, five keys, one yard of blond lace, two yards of net, and a net handkerchief - this roll of ribbon was given me by the shopman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she not tell you where she lived? A.She told me at No. 15, George-street, which I found was not true; but by a letter found on her I discovered her address.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BURTON (Police-constable D 14). I searched the prisoner after she had been confined about an hour; she was brought out of the cell, and asked if a trunk belonged to her - as she was sitting before the fire she pulled up her petticoats to warm her legs, and I saw something hanging down, I asked what it was, she said her garter; I took hold of it, and about two yards of this lace came down - I said, "You may as well give me this?" she said "You may take it, it is gone as far as it can" - there were three other charges against the prisoner, but the parties would not prosecute.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 24th of March, I was informed a man had been robbed, by a girl who had crossed the road - I followed the prisoner, and took her in George-street - I saw she was trying to swallow something; I took hold of her throat, and put my other hand to the back of her head; a sovereign and a shilling dropped from her mouth, which were taken up and given to me - she desired me to give it to the man, and said it was all she had taken from him, except 6d., which she had spent.</p>
               <p>JURY to JAMES MURNANE. Q.Was the 6d. expended in drink, of which you partook? A. No; it was not spent to my knowledge - I had not been in company with her.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you stated all he said? A. Yes, to my knowledge; I have not been drinking to night - I have had no spirits; I had only a pint of half-and-half.</p>

             (Police-constable E 44). On the 1st of March I was with Powell; I saw the prisoner Halford take something from the prosecutor's pocket, and give it to Rowland - I followed Halford, and took him in Liquor-pond-street; I brought him back to the shop where Rowland was - Rowland said, "See what you have brought me to; you know my father is respectable;" Halford said, "Do not drop down upon your luck, it will be all right, keep your own counsel."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Rowland seemed very much shocked? A. Yes, he cried, and on the road to the watch-house also.</p>

            which is my father's name; he had given me the handkerchief - Rowland seemed quite overcome.</p>

               <p>Halford put in a written Defence, stating that he had found the handkerchief in the King's-road; that he gave it to Rowland to look at, and was running to avoid being run over by a cabriolet.</p>
               <p>Rowland's Defence (written). The young man who is charged with me for this offence, was introduced, about three months ago, by a schoolfellow of mine, named Robson - I met him on the day this occurrence took place, and we walked on, conversing together, when, suddenly, Halford was a few paces before me, and, turning round, placed a handkerchief in my hand, saying something, but what I did not know, in consequence of the hurried manner - at the same moment the Policeman seized me, and accused me of stealing the handkerchief - I went with him, and Halford ran away - whether Halford saw the Policeman cross the road, and so gave the handkerchief into my hand to save himself, I cannot tell; but I most positively, though humbly, protest my innocence, and declare that at the time the handkerchief was placed in my hand I was totally unconscious with what object it was so done, and believing at the moment that it was Halford's own.</p>
               <p>Rowland received an excellent character.</p>

            . I lodged at the White Horse on the 26th of March - I went to bed about ten o'clock, and about twenty minutes to five in the morning I heard a noise, which seemed to be in the back part of the house; I laid still for ten minutes, and then heard a bolt burst, as I thought, at the front door - I got up, looked through the window, and called the watchman and the Police; I heard nothing after the bolt went - my wife got up and struck a light; I took a poker in my hand, went to the front door, opened it, and let the Policeman in - I found the front door fast, and the back door was fast; I put my hand against the back parlour door - that flew open, and the shutters and the window of the back room were open wide enough to let a man in - the bolts of the shutters were undone; two great holes had been cut through the shutters, the bolts unfastened, and two squares of glass broken - there were footmarks in the snow in the yard; I saw the prisoner in custody afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you observe the footmarks of one person or more? A.Only one - it did not snow when I came home at night; thirty-seven holes were bored in the shutters by a center-bit - I went to bed before the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>ZACHARIAH BAKER. I am a Policeman. I was in Spital-street early on the morning of the 26th of March, about one or two hundred yards from the White Horse- I heard Wood call out Watch and Police; I went to the White Horse, and called my serjeant and other assistance - we were let in by Wood; his description of the shutters and window is correct - I saw footmarks in the snow in the yard, and I followed those footmarks immediately; they led me over six or seven fences at the back of the house, and I heard a rustling at the door of a house in the eighth yard - I traced footmarks to that door; the serjeant and I tried to force the door in, but could not - I heard that door bolted before we got up to it; there was a back window - I broke two or three squares of glass, unfastened the hasp, and got in; I heard footsteps going from the ground floor to the first floor front room, and there I found the prisoner, sitting at the foot of a bed, where a male and female, and a young child were in bed; the prisoner was sitting with his legs across, his arms folded, and his coat and his hat off, which were all wet by the side of him - he appeared to be asleep; I disturbed him, and found in his pocket two street door keys and a box - I took him to the station-house, and afterwards to the watch-house; he would not give us his address - I took his shoes off his feet, and compared them with the marks in the snow, both right and left, all the way, and they corresponded all the way; they were new left and right shoes - I compared them with the snow, they fitted exactly; the marks were deeper than above the soles - I did not compare it by making a mark by the side of the footmark, but I put the shoes into the footmarks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it snowing when you were called? A. A little; it was about twenty minutes to five o'clock - the snow ceased a minute or two after I got into the house; the prisoner was found about one or two hundred yards from the prosecutrix's - I got over seven wooden fences and a wall, following the footsteps, and my serjeant followed with me; the serjeant of the patrol went round the front way - I wear right and left shoes, but mine had hob-nails; I compared his shoes about half an hour after I secured him - the water did not drip into the footsteps; it was light enough to see that - I knew the person by sight in whose room he was found; I have not been there since - the prisoner was pretending to be asleep, sitting in a chair at the foot of the bed, all over wet; no housebreaking implements were found.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. From what part of the house did you trace the footsteps? A. From the shutter of the back room, where the breaking had been.</p>
               <p>JOHN McWILLIAM. I am a Policeman. I went with Baker to the White Horse; I got there about twenty minutes to five o'clock; I did not hear any noise till I heard the alarm; I then went into Mrs. Pawson's house - we went through the house, and traced the footmarks through the snow to the other house, and I heard the door slammed in and bolted - he got in at the window; I got in, went up, and took the prisoner: when Baker aroused him I looked under the window, and saw his shoe laying there, wet - I said to Baker, "Take him to the watch-house;" he said he would be d-d if he went without his shoes: I said,"Are these your shoes?" he said Yes, and put them on - we took him to the station-house; I afterwards took his shoes off, and compared them with the footmarks - they corresponded.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You must have been at the person's heels when he got into the house? A. Yes - he went into that house, but he was never in my sight; I only say so from hearing the door slam while I was in the yard - I examined the room, but found no housebreaking implements; I have no reason to think the person who lives in that room has gone away - the prisoner said he could prove by the man in the room that he had not been out all night, except for a pot of beer - I said, "That man knows me better than to come up and say so."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What did the man say? A.He made no answer; my footmarks were almost as large again as the prisoner's, and Baker's had hob nails - the prisoner's had small brads; there were no other footsteps to be seen in any direction.</p>

            . I am the wife of Thomas Willocks- we live in Wentworth-street, and rent a house at No. 1, <placeName id="t18330411-58-crimeloc339">George-street</placeName>

I locked the door of that house safe at half-past seven o'clock, and about nine I went across, and found the street door open - knowing nobody was in the house, I got a light, and pushed the street door further open; I saw a man's hat laying down, with the padlock and staple off of the parlour door, which was on it at half-past seven o'clock, when I had locked it; I called a Policeman, and went into the parlour with him - I found the dining-table moved out of the back parlour to the front parlour door, and the pillows and bolsters shifted from their right place - I had made the bed all in order before I went away; I found the pillows and bolsters doubled in two, and laid at the foot of the bed - the prisoner was laying on the bed, with his face downwards; he was in a most deplorable state, without any shoes on - he pretended to be asleep; nothing was missing, the property was only removed - I am quite sure the table, pillow and bolster had been removed; I had polished the table, and put it under the window - the bolster and pillow were on the bed when I went out; only one lodger lived in the house, and she was out - I had left nobody in the house.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL GREEN. I am a Policeman. I was on duty in Wentworth-street on Tuesday, the 12th of March, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening - I went to the house, in consequence of the alarm, and found the prosecutrix holding the street door; the lock and staple laid by the hat in the passage - I went into the front room, then into the back room, and saw the prisoner laying on the bed- he appeared to be very heavy asleep; I shook him - he did not take any notice; he appeared to be sound asleep - I laid hold of his legs, and pulled him off on the floor; he then said, "Halloo! halloo!" I said, "How came you here?" he made no reply; I said, "I shall take you to the station-house;" the pillow and bolster were laying on the bed, doubled up, and the table was moved from the window towards the door, about three yards - I took him to the station-house, and when he got there he answered every question put to him, and did not appear so drunk as when I first found him; he gave no account how he got there in my hearing - the staple had been drawn.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you ever see me before? A. Yes, once, in the same room; I took him out of it about a month before, on suspicion of coining - he was sitting there with a woman who then occupied the room; she had nothing to do with the house at this time - the house is let out in rooms to girls, but at this time only one lodged there, and that was up stairs; she slept there - they call her Jane.</p>
               <p>SUSANNAH WILLOCKS re-examined. The woman who lodged in the house at that time was Jane Smith; she was a weekly lodger, and lodged there five years - her husband is at sea; I gave the house up after the robbery, I was so frightened - she lodged there till I gave it up, and she now lives with me in Wentworth-street; my husband is a journeyman slaughtering-butcher: I had seen the prisoner once before, walking by the place, and asked what he did there - he said he did not know; Smith is twenty-eight or twenty-nine years of age, I think - she does not receive visitors that I know of; she receives none at my house - I cannot say how she gets her living; she is out all day, almost - the house is furnished very comfortably.</p>
               <p>JOHN BURROWS. I was with the Policeman - his evidence is correct; we found the prisoner on the bed, apparently very heavy asleep.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About a week before this I was in the room with the woman who rented it: the prosecutrix came in intoxicated, and demanded her rent - an altercation ensued; she called in the Police: she had given them some secret information concerning me - the room was searched, but nothing found.</p>

               <p>MRS. BURTON. I know this shirt to be my husband's: it was one of those missing that night.</p>

I know he lodged at Stacey's on the 12th of February; the Magistrate told him he had got quite a smart shirt on to what he used to wear - he said, "Oh, I have got four better than this, I bought one in Kent;" he did not say where he got this one - when it was taken off<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110034"/>his back, he did not say he borrowed it of Mrs Stacey, or give any account of it.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner into custody; the witness Fleet handed the box to me.</p>
               <p>EDWARD FLEET. I searched by the direction of Lloyd; I went into the yard and saw two or three persons looking for the box - the prisoner was in the yard, doing his work - I asked him if he knew any thing about the box of money which was lost; he said he did not - he did not point out where it was; I found the tin box up in a loft where lumber was kept - I had been up there once or twice before for a former landlady who lived there, and I thought it might be thrown there, and there I found it; I called to Mr. Brown to come and receive the box from me, but he did not, and I handed it down to Wheeler, who gave it Lloyd.</p>
               <p>ANDREW LLOYD re-examined. Whether Wheeler or Fleet gave it to me I do not know, but the prisoner kept his eye on the loft, which made me suspect it was there, or in the cess-pool.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He kept his eye on the loft, and yet you thought it was in the cess-pool? A. Yes; the loft and cess-pool are both together; I meant the place where the water comes in; Fleet was reaching up there when the prisoner was looking up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The prisoner did not tell you where it was to be found? A. Just at the moment it was found, he told me where it was, and when it was found he told me he had stolen it to buy him clothes; he said, "You will find the box under the rafter on the left-hand side," and at that instant Fleet called out,"I have got it."</p>
               <p>MRS. BROWN. This is our box - it contained twenty-six sovereigns and 7l. 11s. 6d. and this purse; I left no servant in the room with him - the maid servant was up stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long before you lost it had you seen it? A. Ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and it was found in about half an hour; I could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110035"/>not exactly say how much was in it, but I know there was as much as this.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You left him in charge of the bar, and found him still there? A. Yes; he said he had never lost sight of the bar; he was only four weeks in my employ, and slept in the house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner about two years - he used to buy colour of me. On the 29th of March, he applied to me, saying he was doing work for Mr. Cadbury a cheesemonger of Conduit-street, repairing some houses; he said he had got a bill of a short date of three weeks, and he should want 10l. out in money, and the rest he was to take out in goods; he asked if I knew Cadbury - I said No, but I knew there was a cheesemonger there, and at all events I would take the bill and make inquiry; and as it was not endorsed, I took a copy of the bill, and returned it to him; I went and saw Mr. Cadbury - I saw the prisoner on Saturday morning - I did not advance him any money on the bill.</p>
               <p>MARK CADBURY. I live at No. 24, New Bond-street, at the corner of Conduit-street. The prisoner has transacted business for me as carpenter, painter, and glazier; I never authorized him to accept any bill of exchange for me.</p>
               <p>JOHN TRUEMAN. I am a Policeman. I apprehended the prisoner on Saturday week, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning - I searched him, and found a bill on him, which I produce; I took him to the watch-house, and there took out of his pocket two other bills; I told him he was charged by Mr. Cadbury and Mr. Graham with forging a bill; he began to pull papers and things out of his pocket, and this bill was in one of the pocket-books; Cadbury and Graham came up directly - this was in St. Ann's watch-house - the bill was produced; Cadbury said to the prisoner"William, this is not your writing;" he said "It is," and I think he said by G-d; nothing farther passed; Cadbury alluded to the acceptance only.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you the person who said to the prisoner "Come along, I will give you a lift if it is in my power?" A. I never said so to him; Cadbury and Graham were within hearing when he said it was his own writing - it was about a hundred yards from Graham's house; I had received information from Cadbury in the street; he said he wanted me to take a man into custody, and I took him.</p>
               <p>MARK CADBURY. (Looking at the bill) This is not my writing - I never gave the prisoner authority to put my name to it at all; I appointed to meet Mr. Graham; I met the Policeman, told him what I wanted him for, and went with him to the station-house; when I saw the bill, I knew it was his hand-writing, but I said,"Pearson, this is not your hand-writing," (pointing to my acceptance), he said it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Mr. Graham called on you about the business before you gave orders to the officer? A. Yes, I understood the prisoner was coming to 
               <persName id="t18330411-64-person582">Graham</persName>
             that morning, and had the officer ready - the bill is not endorsed.</p>
               <p>MR. GRAHAM. This is the bill the prisoner presented to me, on which I was to advance him 10l. on the Saturday morning - I should have done it if I had not seen Mr. Cadbury.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110036"/>Cross-examined. Q. You never agreed to take it? A I was to be satisfied by my inquiries first - if I had taken it the drawer must have endorsed it.</p>
               <p>MR. CADBURY. There is an account between me and the prisoner - he now owes me a considerable sum.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My solicitor heard the Policeman say he never said I had said I forged the acceptance.</p>
               <p>Four witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

The prisoner came there on Friday, and asked for six quarts of ale to be put into a bottle, and said he had a number of persons at the docks to pay, and wanted some silver - he paid for the ale; he said he had a number of men working at the docks, and one of them should fetch the bottle after the ale was disposed of; he told me he had been recommeded to our house by an intimate friend of Mr. Eayres, as a customer - he paid for the ale, and asked me if I had a man to send to Islington, to fetch his horse - I told him there was a man who could go: he was then in the bar, and asked me for a piece of paper - I had some paper in the bar, locked up in a drawer, and there was money in a bag in the drawer, which was locked, and I had the key in my pocket; he asked for the paper to write a direction for the man to go for his horse - he was sitting down in a chair, close by me; he remained in the bar, and after giving the man the direction, he said, "I will send one of my men for the ale," and went away - he had been in the bar about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour - the bag of money was locked up in the drawer, and I had the key in my pocket; after sending the man away from the house, he returned again in less than ten minutes, and said he wanted another piece of paper - I gave him some, and he wrote something; he then asked if I could let him have 20s. worth of change - I told him I could; I opened a drawer, and took out a bag, with a quantity of silver in it- he could see there was money in the bag; I counted him 20s., and he said "Let me have 2l. worth, as I have got my men to pay" - this was on Friday, the 15th of March; he took the silver off the table, and put it into his pocket - I said, "You have not given me the two sovereigns for the change;" he said, "Oh! I will give it you presently - I have been recommended by a friend of Mr. Eayres." - I said,"You may be known to Mr. Eayres, but not to me;" he said,"Have not I sent your man for a horse, detain the horse when it comes, if you are afraid;" and he went out without my consent - when I asked him for the sovereigns, he said,"Do not I tell you I am intimately acquainted with a friend of Mr. Eayres, detain the horse when it comes, if you are afraid, it is worth 30l." - when the man came back no horse was to be found; on the Sunday following he came again, and said, "I suppose you thought I was lost" - I said,"I did not know what had become of you, as you had forfeited your word;" he said, "Well, I am come to pay you" - I pressed him to give me the two sovereigns; he said, "I wish you to do something further for me, and will pay you altogether" - I told him about the man, and in the mean time I sent for an officer - he had a paper in his hand, and said he wanted to send to Islington for 7l. 19s.</p>

               <p>GEORGE CHIDZEY. I am one of the City Police. Tucker came and asked me if I saw these three boys coming down the street; he told me to take two, and he would take one - I did so; I saw the gentleman whom the handkerchief was taken from at the station-house, but he went away - I have not the least knowledge who he was, or where he lives; I found this silk handkerchief on Smith, and a cotton one on Atkinson, and a black silk one on Lloyd - they said the handkerchiefs were their own.</p>
               <p>MR. TUCKER. This silk handkerchief is the same colour as the one which they took from the gentleman, who described the handkerchief to me before he saw it, as being red and yellow, wet and snuffy, and on being produced he claimed it.</p>

On the 8th of March the prisoner resided in my house - I had an account to settle that day with my brewer, and had up-stairs a bag of money; I take it up every night, and bring it down in the morning - I took it up on Thursday night, the 7th of March; it contained from 150l. to 160l. - there were two 5l. notes, and a 20l. note; I came down at half-past six in the morning of the 8th, and as I came down the prisoner was standing at the bottom of the stairs - I have no doubt he saw the bag in my hand; I had the key of the bar in one hand and the bag in the other - he was opening the shutters of the house; I unlocked the bar-door, and could not find the key to lock the money up; I put the bag down on the seat, put a parcel over it, and went to take down the shutters of the bar, to enable me to get light - the servant was lighting the bar fire at the time; I was absent about a minute and a half, and on returning to the bar I went to the seat to take the money to lock it up, and it was gone- I spoke to Thorogood, the servant, and in consequence of what she said I looked about for my son, and he was gone; I could not find him - I found him that day fortnight; in consequence of information I went to Offley, in Hertfordshire, expecting to find him, but he had left there - in consequence of information there, the officer went with another person further; I remained at Offley - the officer returned to me in about an hour with the prisoner; he searched him, and found on him thirty-four sovereigns, four half-sovereigns, and two 5l. notes - he could not come honestly by such a sum; I examined the two 5l. notes, and I know them to be part of the money which had been in the bag, as I put a private mark on every note I take - I am sure they were part of the money I had in the bag.</p>
               <p>ANN THOROGOOD. I was in the service of Mr. Talbot. On Friday morning, the 8th of March, I was lighting the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110038"/>fire in the bar - I remember master being in the bar; my back was to him - I did not see him place any thing on the seat; I was not in the bar till master left it - I came in while he was taking the shutters down, and I saw the prisoner come into the bar, as I have seen him on other mornings; I cannot swear that he went to the seat - he passed by me, and I never turned my head to look at him; I saw master looking, and I asked what he was looking for - I learnt from him that he had lost his money; I said the prisoner had been in the bar - nobody but the prisoner came into the bar from the time I went into the bar, till my master lost his money.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM RAY. I am constable of Allhallows, Tower-street. I went with Mr. Talbot to Offley, in Hertfordshire, on Friday, the 8th of March, and in consequence of information I went to Luton, Bedfordshire, nine miles further, and the prisoner came to the Red Lion there, on horseback, while I was there - I took him into custody, and found on him two 5l. notes, which I produce; the other money I gave to the prosecutor by direction of the Magistrate - he had thirty-two sovereigns, four half-sovereigns, 5s. 6d. a brace of pistols, a silver watch, and a great quantity of wearing-apparel; I had received a caution as to the mode of securing him, and in consequence of that, as he came in, I turned round, laid hold of his hands, and handcuffed him, then drew the pistols from his pockets, and one was loaded with ball - he told me it was a good job I had secured his hands, or else I should not have gone back to my wife and family again.</p>


               <p>MR. TALBOT. These 5l. notes are mine; I have marks on them, which I made myself before I put them into the bag - they are two of the notes I put into the bag; it is my dwelling-house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.They had not been disguised? A. No; one was cut into boards, but the top piece laid on it, and had the mark on it; the timber had been rafted together in the dock, but they sometimes separate by winds - I once knew a man named Somerhall; I have heard he is now a carpenter and builder at Hammersmith.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you used your best endeavours to find Somerhall? A. Yes, and have offered a guinea reward for his apprehension; I do not know him - I know the prisoner well: the timber was brought openly in the day time - he gave me the receipt in his own name; I knew where to find him, and took the officer to him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What are you? A. I live with Mr. Brown, who keeps a china shop; I had not seen the prisoner before - he passed by quickly, but he is the man; I was sent for on the 2nd of March, and saw him again - I know he is the man.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long had he lived with you? A. Two years; I allowed him 3d. a bottle on wine, and 1 1/2d in a shilling on beer - this paper is an account of more than a week; but on the 27th of January, he left me, and never accounted to me for what he took - he came back, and I said I would give him a chance, of retrieving himself by his coming back, if he would pay me the money every night, or in the morning; he is in my debt, 19l.; I cannot tell to whom he might sell beer when he took it out - I delivered him beer and liquor to sell; when he came back to me, I allowed him his commission, but it was to be applied to the reduction of the debt he owed me - I received this letter from the prisoner - (read.)</p>
               <p>To Mr. Scott.</p>
               <p>SIR, - I take the earliest opportunity to drop a few lines to you, as a personal interview would most probably lead to an altercation, which I wish to avoid - and as I cannot, consistently with my present circumstances, return to your employ under our present arrangements, therefore if you will take the credit on your own responsibility, I will return again to your service, but to pay daily for the goods I receive from the bar - and to be unavoidably obliged to give credit is more than I am able to do in my present situation; if you do or do not approve of my proposal, if you will send an answer back by the bearer I should feel much obliged - respecting the difference between you and me, I will endeavour to collect the money I have owing to me, and pay you as soon as I possibly can. I remain your humble servant,

               <p>COURT. Q.When did he last account to you? A. On the 23rd of February - if he had then paid me more than he received, I do not know whether he might not have had recourse to this very money to have made it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Upon your oath, do you not know it was his custom to supply the people every day with beer on credit? A. I have no other way of knowing but from him, and I would not believe a word he said; this paper is dated the 24th of February, and it is when I received the money of the 23rd - when he returned, after leaving in January, he owed me 20l.; I treated that as a debt, because he begged I would do so - on the evening of the 24th of February he made an excuse, and did not settle with me; on the morning of the 25th I went into the City, and when I returned he had left - he took every thing belonging to him away, but an old coat and an old pair of trousers; I had nothing to do with the credit - he was to pay me.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prisoner owe you any thing? A. Yes, 5s. 6d., for three weeks' rent, and his wife paid it me that night; I have known him carry bright farthings about him often.</p>

A.When the officer came on the 27th to take him - I opened the door; he asked if Strong was at home - I said Yes; the prosecutor then went up stairs, and came down with the prisoner: the officer asked him what he had done with the gold he had been seen with the night before - he said he had no gold but what he had paid at his club; I did not say they must have meant the bright farthings, but I said I had seen his wife search his pockets, and she found no gold - I did not mention about the farthings, except at the solicitor's.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he drunk? A. I should not think him so - he had been drinking; I cannot say whether he was drunk or sober - I saw nothing to indicate that he had been drinking - I took the blue coat off him.</p>

             was called, he did not stop nor turn his head? A. No; if any one had called me I should have looked round - I did not see any watch.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL BRYANT. I lodge at No. 2, New-street, St. Giles' - I attend the markets with a man named Hamilton. On the morning of the 23rd of February I was in the Hand and Crown public-house, Church-street, St. Giles'; I heard a cry of Stop thief! I went out, saw the prisoner running up Buckeridge-street, and the prosecutor following him - I pursued; I had known the prisoner well - he turned into Carrier-street, and I lost sight of him in Church-lane, at the bottom of Carrier-street; there is a house there - I went into the passage, saw a young man there, and the prisoner was showing him a watch; I waited, and saw him come out with an old raggerty white coat on, and go down Church-lane - I did not try to get him taken, as it is a bad neighbourhood, and several persons were following him; I should perhaps have got killed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You know what a bad neighbourhood is? A. Yes, I have been in the habit of living in one - I told Mr. Pitt afterwards that I had seen the prisoner showing his watch; plenty saw it besides me, but no one else would come forward - I was in danger of my life for giving information; I have had two or three cracks through it, in my face from one man; I have been at the Horse and Groom, but not lately - the landlord never threatened to have me taken into custody: I have been charged with stealing a bottle of brandy - I was sent from Marlborough-street, but was not tried; I had a hearing before the Magistrate - I went before Mr. Laing at Hatton-garden on this charge; I never was there against my will - I have been there to hear about other persons, but I never was committed from there as a reputed thief.</p>
               <p>MR. PITT. I called Stop thief! and a great many persons followed me, who had come out of their doors - at least one hundred people must have heard me - many looked out of their windows, but did not assist me.</p>
               <p>EDWARD LYONS. I live at No. 16, Belton-street, Longacre. On the morning of the 23rd of February, I was in Buckeridge-street, and saw the prisoner running down- I have known him seven years, living in the neighbourhood; he had a watch in his hand, and ran down Church-street - he turned his head round once, and I saw his face:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110045"/>there were three or four persons running after the prosecutor; I gave information to the Policeman Baker, and we all went together, and I saw the prisoner in the soup-house - when he was running with the watch he had this blue coat on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near was the prosecutor to the prisoner? A. I suppose six or seven yards; the prisoner turned round - Mr. Pitt was the nearest person to him - he must have had a pretty good opportunity of seeing his face; when I saw the prisoner in the soup-house; he appeared as if he had been drinking - there were several persons there; I am a smith: I went to a shop once to buy a penny worth of something, and it turned out to be a bad sixpence - the people not knowing me gave me into custody; I know Mike Bryant, but I did not know that he had been taken there - I never heard of the brandy - I was sent to Tothill-fields from Friday till the following Thursday; I was never at Clerkenwell, only to find this bill - I never was employed by the Mint, but I gave information to the officers, and caused a party to be taken; I was not examined as a witness, and I got nothing - it was in the case of two women; it was eighteen months after I was taken up myself.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you have any conversation with Lyont - A. I went into a coffee-house about eleven o'clock on the morning of the robbery - I saw Lyons, and he went with me; he had given me information before on a Mint case, about three months ago - I have heard that he has been taken up himself, but he did not tell me; he gave information to another officer in a Mint case, I think the Session before last; I have seen him examined as a witness.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I was taken to the office they sent him after Mr. Pitt - he came, but could not swear that I was the person; he said I was about the same height and appearance - I wore drab trousers and a blue coat; I had a blue coat on, and a Brighton beaver coat over it - Mr. Laing remanded me, he made me put my hat on and turn round, and he said, "Is not that him? look at him now?" and then he said Yes; there were two or three more witnesses, and the Magistrate said they were parties concerned - I was rather intoxicated, and as I was too late to go home I went to the soup-shop, and asked if I could have a bed; I put my money in my stocking for safety, as I am not my own master - Bryant was looked upon as a party concerned with me, and I sent him with 6d. to get a breakfast.</p>

The prisoner's father had been in my employ four years and a quarter - I had in my office, among other things, a great many books of a bankrupt's estate; I missed some of them - the officer called on me in a few days, and produced two books, which were part of what I had lost; I then made further search, and found some books at Mr. Durbin's, Mr. Catchpole's and Mr. Atkinson's - they were all my property except one, which I have a doubt about; whether they were all taken at one time I cannot tell - the prisoner used to come to his father in an evening; my books had been kept in a separate room.</p>

            , and Mr. Evans was one of the executors; I had authority to receive money on account of that estate; the prisoner received some as my clerk, and it was his business to account to me for it; he from time to time furnished me with accounts of what he received; about January, 1832, I was called to give an account of my receipts, and the prisoner made out this account of 143l. 7s. 5d.; I believe I had received but two of these sums, which are here included; he drew out these other sums as being due, stating that Mr. Parry owed the estate 2l. 12s. 8d. and 3l. 3s. 2d.; he said Mr. Parry had a set-off against these sums, and they could not be paid; in January, 1832 Mrs. Berridge called on me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. I believe the prisoner had received a great deal of money for you? A.Not a great deal - he is married, and has three or four children.</p>
               <p>MR. PARRY. I paid the prisoner on the 22nd of October, 1831, 3l. 3s. 2d. on account of Mr. Holborn - he gave me this receipt for it; it was for the estate of Berridge and Evans.</p>
               <p>MR. HOLBORN. This receipt is in the prisoner's writing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I expected Mr. Holborn would have called Mrs. Berridge, the widow, as he is aware from her own statement, that within a fortnight after I received these sums of money, she knew I had received them; and I told her I would pay her them when she called for them - she said very well, and I believe she waited on Mr. Holborn, as I told her when she wanted, to come to me; Mr. Holborn knows that I found three or four blank receipts in the name of Thomas Norman, which I could have received and defied the conviction - he says that I have received some money, but not much; he did not tell you that I had to collect 2000l. in one account, and he knows it was all collected right - he sent me out repeatedly with blank receipts, which I might have filled up; I had a wife and six children depending on the guinea a week I received from him - I was always at his office from nine o'clock in the morning till eight, nine, ten, or eleven o'clock at night; the reason I said there was a set-off against these sums was, because I had told Mrs. Berridge that I had received them.</p>
               <p>MR. HOLBORN. These receipts are in the prisoner's hand-writing - I shall have to make the money good.</p>

On the 20th of February I was in the kitchen, and heard a noise in the sleeping-room, which is one pair of stairs higher than I was then, which is one pair from the street - I paused a little while, and then went up stairs; I looked into the sleeping-room, but saw no one - I then went into my master's bed-room, and as I was coming out I saw the prisoner standing behind the door; I knew him well, as he had been taken into the house by my master out of compassion - I asked him what he did there; he said he had made a mistake - I called up my master, who found the property stated.</p>

               <p>CHARLES WENSLEY. I am a livery-stable keeper at the White Lion, Putney. On the 13th of March, in the evening, the prisoner and another person came to my place; the other man was driving the mare in a chaise - he desired me to take care of the horse; I took it in - he drove it into the yard, and the prisoner gave me orders to take care of it; I went into the house - I saw no more of the other man, but saw the prisoner in the tap-room, and he told me to take particular care of the horse, as they had drove him a great way - the horse had some gruel made; the prisoner stopped there till the Friday afternoon; he said he expected the other man back, he said he was gone to look at a gentleman's horse, and he expected him back every hour - that was the same evening, and on Thursday he said he wondered he did not come back; he offered the mare to me for sale, and to several other people, and asked 13l. for it; on Friday a gentleman came into the yard - I do not know his name; he came from Croydon - he had the mare out to try it; the prisoner was present, and borrowed a saddle and bridle of me to try it with - it was tried in the road by the gentleman; the gentleman did not buy it - about five o'clock that evening the prisoner went away; he said he was going to look after his master - the horse remained there; I asked him, if any body wanted to buy it, what I should sell it for - he said I was not to take less than 13l.; he said he expected his master every hour; I asked what I was to do with the horse and chaise if his master came; he said, "I suppose you would know him;" I said I did not know - that I should not suppose any body would come but the right owner; he asked me what the expenses were - I said about 13s.; he said that was right, and he must go and get the money - he went away, leaving the horse and chaise with me; Bradfield came that night he claimed it, and took it away next morning.</p>

               <p>MR. BRADFIELD. Macklin had no conversation with me which the prisoner did not hear; he heard him borrow it, and must know he had not bought it.</p>

            . Last February I lived with him at 26, John-street St. Pancras, in the second floor of the house; we had lived there about three years; my son Robert was about thirteen years old - I remember last Shrove-Tuesday, the 19th of March, I went out that evening about six o'clock, leaving my little boy Robert, at home alive and well; he had hashed mutton and pan-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110049"/>cakes for dinner that day - my husband comes home to supper every night, and Robert was to have boiled the potatoes for my husband's supper; I gave him directions to boil them before I went out at six o'clock - I left them with him to boil; when I left home, at six o'clock, there was no occasion for him to go out for any thing - he had his boots on when I left home; I sent him for the potatoes before I went out; and then he had had tea and bread and butter; I told him, as he had no occasion to go out, to take his boots off, as he should not dirt about the room - I did not tell him to clean them; I parted with him on good terms at six o'clock - he had no apple-pudding that day; he was very regular in his conduct - he was always a good lad, and always had very good advice given him; he had been in a little place, in service in the neighbourhood, and had left it about a month - he was not in the habit of going about the streets at all, with other boys, that I know of; he had a little rabbit in the back yard, which he used to amuse himself with - I went out that night to see a sick friend; I returned, I believe, between eight and nine o'clock - I believe it was after eight, because my daughter was home before me; when I returned the boy was gone - he had not been accustomed to be out so late; he was never allowed to be out at night except when he was at his place - he had a pair of slippers, which were missing; his boots were in the room - I had not seen him take them off; he had robbed the dirt off them in my absence, but not properly cleaned them - he has ran to the door before in his slippers, but has not gone out in them; my daughter arrived at home before me and my husband too; from what I heard when I came back, some search had been made for him in the house, and I went about to make inquiry for him, and my husband and my daughter went; we went in search every where - we walked the streets, and watched the people out of the play-house; we could not tell what to think - we had bills posted up, offering a reward, a few days after; we exerted ourselves every where to find him, but without success. I know a young man named Sparrow; I did not know his name then - on Tuesday, the 26th of February, the week after I lost my son, Sparrow came to me, and brought Marchell with him as his friend; I had seen Sparrow before, at Taylor's, which is next door to me- Marchell was a stranger to me; I did not know Taylor before - I knew he lived at next door, but did not know him; I had seen Sparrow at that house, but did not know his name - I went to that house to make inquiry, but did not see Taylor; when Marchell came to me, he said he had seen the bill at the colour shop, which was Mr. Reeves' - that is the first that I recollect his saying; I understood him to mean Reeves' shop in Chapel-street, where I had placed a bill - he said he had seen the bill, and then he described the child's dress, in every respect, to me, all but the slippers; he said he had seen the child on the Thursday before, at St. Katharine's-docks - I think he described his dress before he said that; he described every thing the child had on when I left home at six o'clock, all but the slippers - he said he had on a very old pair of boots; Mrs. Richardson was with me at the time this took place - Mrs. Richardson said the child was like me; she said, "This is the mother, and the child is like her" - Marchell said "Yes, it was exactly like her, eyes and all;" my eyes are dark, and the boy's eyes were dark - they were described in the bill as dark eyes; he said he saw him at St. Katharine's-docks, loitering about with marine boys, eating a crust of bread; Marchell said that he himself was going off by a ship the next day, and the sooner we began to search after the boy the better - this conversation was between twelve and one o'clock in the day; I went with Mr. Roe to the docks immediately - I do not know that the prisoner went to the docks that day; Roe and I took a cab and went down to the docks, and at the opposite corner as we went, stood Sparrow, Marchell, and Evans - we were going across the road to Tottenham-court-road to get the cab, and saw them standing by a potato warehouse at the corner of John-street, which leads into Chapel-street, leading into Tottenham-court-road; when we got to the docks we made all the inquiry we possibly could, but to no effect, we could learn nothing about him - as we returned from the docks, just before we got to my door, I saw Sparrow going into Taylor's, next door; I put a question to him respecting Marchell, and desired him to do something respecting Marchell; in consequence of that, in about a quarter of an hour, Marchell came to my room (Mr. Roe was still with me) and Roe, in my presence, said to Marchell, "We have met with no success at the docks," that we had been searching there (I cannot exactly recollect his words) - I had made inquiry at the docks about ships going out; Roe told him also that there were no ships going out there, and that there were no marine boys there,(as Marchell had described to me) as going out from there - he put his hand out and said, "The child is there now, he is exactly like your eyes and all;" he pulled a piece of paper out of his pocket, and said he would give us the name of the ship going out - he said the name of the ship was the Hereford; he wrote something on the paper, and tried to write something more, but could not - he said to Mr. Roe, "You write it;" Roe said, "No, you write it, we can read it" - I got up to get a pen, and before I could get the pen

             came in; Marchell, before that, said he had written the name of Hereford on the paper, but I never saw it - and when Ellen came in he put the paper into his pocket and said he would go with Ellen; he and Ellen went out together - they said they were going to the docks; the centre prisoner (looking at him) is Evans - I was looking out of my window the next day, or a few days after the conversation with Marchell, (I do not know which, but it was the same week, I was looking out,) and saw Evans nearly opposite the window of Mrs. Smith, who lives opposite to me - I said nothing to him; I did not know his name at that time - I had seen him, I believe, the day they went to the docks - he was walking about the streets; he was standing opposite there, and Marchell with him, and I believe Sparrow and some other persons - Evans shook his fist at me, and said something which I did not hear, as the window was shut; he was looking up at me - the window was shut, and I was looking through it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q. The boy was missed on the 19th? A. Yes; I made great search for him that night and the following day - I described his dress and person; I went to all the Police-stations, and spoke publicly of his loss, describing his dress and person, to know if any body had seen him; I had never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110050"/>seen Marchell before he called; I offered, in a second bill, to reward any one for bringing him home - the sum was not stated; both the bills had been published before the 26th, when Marchell came; my son's slippers were black - they could not be easily mistaken for old boots.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mrs. Richardson remarked that your son was like you, Marchell replied, "Yes, eyes and all"? A. Yes, those were his words; I told him I should go down to the docks - I saw him at the corner of the street, where we crossed; I gave him nothing to drink the first time he came - when he called the second time, he was asked to take a glass of wine - he refused; I did not discover the information he gave me about the docks to be correct.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q.Where did you see Evans standing? A. In the street opposite our window; several other persons were about - it was about eleven or twelve o'clock, I think, but am not certain, and on the 27th, I think.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. He was standing nearer to Mr. Smith's window than to yours? A. Yes; theirs is an open shop.</p>
               <p>MARY ANN PAVIOUR. I am sister of the deceased. I went home to my father's lodging on the evening of the 19th of February, at ten minutes after eight o'clock - nobody was at home in the lodging at the time; I found the fire burnt hollow in the middle, the candle burnt into the socket, and the wick long, as if the room had been left some time. I saw the body of my brother before the Coroner - it was my brother's body; I know search was made for him, and bills published - I was at home when Marchell came back from the docks.</p>
               <p>GRACE RICHARDSON. I am the wife of Thomas Richardson - we live at No. 26, John-street, on the first floor. I knew the deceased Robert Paviour - I remember the evening on which he was missing; in consequence of what was said to me by his sister

            , I went into their room about ten minutes after eight o'clock - Mrs. Paviour had not returned home at that time; I examined the two rooms in which they lodged, but could not find the deceased; I noticed the fire - it was burnt quite hollow, and a saucepan was on it with potatoes in it; a candle in the room was burnt down into the socket of the candlestick - I should think the fire and candle had been neglected for about an hour - the snuff of the candle, I should think, was nearly two inches long; on the following Tuesday I was in Paviour's room, when Marchell was there - I do not recollect what passed in the room - there was a conversation; I opened the door to Marchell when he came in - I heard what he said at the door; he came in the morning - he said there was a boy of the description lurking about St. Katharine's-docks; I called Mrs. Paviour down to speak to him, and I said the boy was very much like Mrs. Paviour - he said, "Yes, what I could see of the person, he was very much like her;" I told him she was the mother of the boy - and he said, from what he observed of Mrs. Paviour, he was very like her - he said he had a child of his own, and did not know what he should do with her, for he seemed to regret very much the loss - he said he had a little child a year and a half old at home - he seemed to think it was a shocking thing; I was not before the Coroner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q. Had you said any thing about the description before he said there was a boy about the docks answering the description? A. No; handbills had been printed, and I considered he alluded to them - he said he had seen a bill in Reeves' window, in Chapel-street - that the boy had not slippers on, but old boots, and was gnawing a hard crust.</p>
               <p>Taylor. Q. Do you know me? A. Yes, by sight; you appeared a hard-working, industrious man - I have observed goods which had been japanned drying at your door.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH SMITH. I live at No. 86, John-street. I remember the loss of the deceased; the deceased left his home on the 19th of February, and on the 26th of February, about the middle of the day, I saw Marchell coming along the street, in a direction for Paviour's door; I saw him go into Paviour's door - I crossed over to hear if there was any news, and when I saw Marchell, I turned round and said, "My good friend, have you brought us any good intelligence about this little boy?" Taylor was present - Marchell said, "I think I have - I think from what I saw in the bill, the child answers the description, and when I saw the mother of the child, the two countenances struck me forcibly that he was the child;" I said, I hoped it would turn out so, but I had my doubts - he said, "Why do you have your doubts;" I said, I think, when the boy left his home with only slippers, coat and jacket on, I thought he was no more, I thought he had been burked - Marchell said, "You may rest yourself assured, that child is as well and as hearty as you are;" I said, "How do you know that?" he said, "I do" -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110051"/>I said, "Then I hope we shall see the child to-morrow" - he made no answer to that; that was all the conversation I had with him then, but after he had left, I went over again in about half an hour, and said to Taylor, "Do you know any thing of this good man, that has brought this good account" - he said, "Yes, I know him very well, he has come of creditable and respectable parents;" I said, "I hope it will turn out to be all correct, that we shall see the child by to-morrow" - he made me no answer - my house is opposite Taylor's; after the child was missing I observed something unusual about Taylor's premises, but made no observation of that kind before, not till after Marchell brought the intelligence about the child; Marchell, Evans, Taylor, and a man named Sparrow wer repeatedly going to and fro, in and out at Taylor's house, sometimes very much in liquor; they were repeatedly watching my house and me, to see, as I supposed, if I was watching them - this occurred continually till they were in custody. On the Thursday previous to the Inquest, Evans was very much in liquor, and he got sky-larking with a young woman; I saw him dancing about - Mrs. Paviour was at that time at her window - he was holding his fist up, doubled, towards the window - he was leaning against my window, and holding up his fist up to her window, and the other parties were with him, altogether; I could not hear what he said, but I judged from the motion of his lips, that he was saying something - my wife saw and heard what passed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q. After this poor boy was missing there was great excitement in the neighbourhood? A. Very great; almsot every body was running about making inquiry; I did not see Marchell before the 26th.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw these four men walking up and down watching your house; were there not a great many people walking about, and talking of the occurrence? A. The neighbourhood, at that time, had noticed their proceedings - people were perpetually going to Paviour's, to make inquiries; I saw no drink given away - what was had, I believe, they got at the corner public-house - when Marchell said the child was as safe and as well as we were, he appeared to be sincere, as if he actually meant what he said, as if he actually knew it.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q.At what time of the day did you see Evans holding up his fist? A. About two o'clock; he was intoxicated, and had been dancing on the rails, and sky-larking with my servant just before.</p>
               <p>Taylor. Q.How long have you known me? A.Two or three years; I never knew you any thing but a hard-working industrious man - when I came to your apartment I did not perceive that Marchell was in liquor; I have no recollection of saying he was drunk or foolish, as he went on in an erroneous way; Sparrow is in Taylor's employ, and frequently goes in and out on business.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Were the appearances about Taylor's premises different to what you had seen them before? A. Yes, they would pop out one or two together; I never knew of any business Marchell or Evans had there - I never heard any thing to induce me to believe they had business there; Taylor is a japanner - I understood Evans is a French polisher; I never saw Evans take any work in there, or bring any out.</p>

               <p>SARAH SMITH. I am the wife of Joseph Smith; we live at No. 86, John-street. The Thursday fortnight before the Inquest, (the 7th of March) I observed some men drinking in John-street and Pitt-street - there were five or six men; they were up and down the street all day - two of the prisoners were among them, but not Taylor; I saw Evans dancing upon his heels - he held up his fist at Mrs. Paviour, and said "You are a b - y old bitch, you shall be plagued a little longer" - I did not see Mrs. Paviour at her window, but I saw her open her window a few minutes after, when they were going up the street; Marchell was with Evans when he used these expressions - they returned back again, and went into Taylor's house; I did not observe any particular appearance about Taylor's house at any time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q.After the occurrence, was there not people running up and down the street, making inquiry? A. A great many; I did not hear Marchell say any thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q.Whether Mrs. Paviour was at her window at this time you do not know? A. No, but she opened it soon after; Evans was very drunk, and had been riotous about the street all day - it was about one o'clock.</p>

             and the prisoner Marchell to St. Katharine's-docks, on Wednesday, the 27th of February; I had some conversation with Marchell on the road - I was asked by Marchell if I thought the money was safe; (the reward of 5l. which was offered;) I told him I thought it was, and if he would cause the boy to be brought back, or bring him back, I would pay the money without any further questions - this was on our road to the docks; he said nothing about the boy at that time - when we proceeded a little further, Sparrow, (who had accompained Marchell,) observed the father, Mr. Paviour, walking behind; he (Sparrow) touched Marchell on the shoulder, and Marchell turned round away from me, and he said something to him which I could not hear - Marchell replied directly, "It is no go;" Marchell came alongside of me again, and we got into conversation about the boy<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110052"/>and he said he thought the boy was not taken away for any other purpose but to become heir to some property, or for the use of some of those swells - he told me there was a man in the City who was in the habit of giving money for boys; and he told me about a captain that hung himself at Horsemonger-lane, and said he was one of those sort; he called them hoofe - I have heard of a captain who hung himself, but I do not know whether I had heard it at time; I did not understand what hoofs meant at the time - I now understand it means a person addicted to unnatural propensities; Marchell talked about a place which he had lost through getting intoxicated - and before that, on Tuesday the 26th, I went down to ask him concerning the boy (at Taylor's house,) by Mrs. Pavlour's desire; I went into Taylor's, and asked for Marchell - he was not there; they told me to call again in half an hour, which I did, and he was not there - I went again, saw him, and asked him about the boy, if he had seen him - he said Yes, he had seen him at the docks; (I did not say I had come by Paviour's desire) and he mentioned what part he had seen him; he mentioned some letter, I think it was C, but I will not be positive - I asked him if he could get the boy; he paused a bit, and said, "Yes - no doubt but I can, but I want some one to go with me to the ducks of a spirit;" he said, "I do not want any woman to go crying and sobbing with me;" for there were many creeks and corners he had to go into, that he did like to take a woman with him - he said the mother had given a wrong description of the boy; that she had represented him as having dark eyes, and he had grey eyes and dark eye-browns - I asked him again if he had seen the boy; he said Yes, he had seen him in the docks, and he was there then - I appointed to go with him the next morning, which I did, and have stated, what conversation happened on the road; when we got to the docks, Marchell did not appear to know any thing about the docks - he took me to the place where he said he had seen the boy, inside the docks, on the right-hand; I think the letter was C - he did not appear to know his way into the docks; from his conversation with me, I caused him to be given in custody the same evening, on his return.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q.On your way to the docks, did not you converse as to the cause of the boy being taken - gnessing the cause? A. Yes; part of the way; Marchell said nothing about his being carried to the Indies as heir to some property, in my hearing - before we went on the Tuesday evening he said, "I am steward of a ship;" and that he was going out as steward to the Indies, and that the boy was going out with him - I had said nothing about 5l. rewards before this conversation; it was after Marchell made the remak about the reward that I saw Sparrow speak to him, and after that Marchell said it was no go - he appeared to me to know nothing whatever about the docks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Marchell said he was going out as steward to the Indies and the boy with him, did he name the ship? A. Yes, it was the Hereford; and he said we had better pursue the inquiry, for he was going out very shortly.</p>

            . I live at No. 64, Molyneux-street; I lodge there with my father. I heard of the boy being missed about a week after he was missing - I had not seen Merchell until I came into Mrs. Paviour's room, to go down to the docks with him; I am acquainted with Mrs. Paviour - I went to her house on the Tuesday afternoon, in consequence of her message; I have been to sea, and have not been home long - when I got to Paviour's Marchell was there; he was writing something down on a piece of paper - I did not observe what he wrote; when I came in Mrs. Paviour said, "This is the young man who is going to the docks with you;" (meaning me) - Marchell agreed to go with me; Wiggens came in a little afterwards - we left the room together, and got down stairs to the door before Marchell said any thing; he turned into Mr. Taylor's, at the next door - he came out, called me inot Taylor's, and said he could not go to the docks without 2s. 6d. in his pocket, 15d. each, to spend; Taylor was present - I told him I had got no money at all; he had said nothing about money before, in my presence - Taylor kept at his work, and said very little; Marchell was lighting his pipe over Taylor's fire - (he had sat down as if he would not go at all) and while lighting his pipe at the fire, he made a reply, and said he would make 2l. of the boy yet; he said so to Taylor - Taylor said Hush! as much as to say there was somebody in the room to hear him - I had not, heard Taylor say any thing till Marchell spoke about the 2l., and then he said, "You are talking too fast;" Marchell asked Taylor what he thought, whether it would be best to take the 5l., or to take the boy to Plymouth, and write a letter home to his mother to let her know the boy was safe - I then asked Marchell whether he thought it was of any use my going to the docks; Taylor made a reply, and said, "Perhaps the boy is gone to hell or Halifax by this time;" I then went back, and went into Mrs. Paviour's again - neither I nor Marchell went to the docks that day; I agreed with Marchell, before I left, to go with him to the docks at nine o'clock next morning; next morning Wiggens and Sparrow accompanied us to the docks, and the father followed on behind at a distance; Marchell began a conversation of his own accord, by saying there was a gentleman who gave a great deal of money for boys - that the gentleman lived somewhere in Horsemonger-lane; he said he was a captain - he said, there was a gentleman in the City, too, that was one of, these poofs, as he called them - neither I nor Wiggens had said any thing to him to lead to these observations; I never heard the word poofs before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q.When you went into Taylor's house did you enter into conversation about the boy directly? A.I only asked if he was going to the docks with me; I said if he had seen such a boy, to go to the docks with me to find him.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.When you went to the docks did you inquire for the Hereford? A. Yes; there was no such a ship in the docks, nor was there water for her to come up the river; there was a ship of that name laying at Black wall - she had been home from China about a fortnight; a vessel usually lays in port two or three months.</p>

               <p>MR. WALESBY. Q.When you agreed to accompany Marchell to the docks, had you said any thing about a reward? A. No; he asked Taylor if it was best to have the 5l. &amp;c. - I had said nothing about a reward for the boy, nor heard any thing said, more than the cause of the boy being taken away: one suggested one cause and ano<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110053"/>ther another - I do not recollect whether he mentioned about the captain as killing himself in Horsemonger-lane or living there; I never heard the expression hell or Halifax before.</p>
               <p>Taylor. Q.Did not Marchell treat you with a share of a pot or two of beer at my premises? A. Yes, and a pipe; I was not there an hour altogether.</p>
               <p>Q.When he talked about the boy, did I not say,"Don't talk too fast, but say nothing but the truth, because you are hurting the parents' feelings?" A. I heard you say something of that sort - when I think of it, you did say so; Marchell said he would go with me to the docks in the morning.</p>

            . I am the father of the deceased. Marchell and others went to the docks - I followed after them; I heard nothing of the conversation as they went along - when I got to the docks I inquired for the Hereford; there was no such ship there; she was laying at Blackwall - Marchell was quite a strangee to the docks; he knew nothing about them.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BUNDAY. I live at No. 17, Shouldham-street, Bryanstone-square - I formerly lived at Hampstead; I was in the service of Mr. Keys, of Oxford-street, at that time. On Saturday, the 23rd of February, I was accompanied by my wife, going towards Hampstead, between seven and eight o'clock; I know the bridge over the canal, near the York and Albany public-house - it was in our way to cross that bridge; it is at the end of Albany-street, Hampstead-road - when we came near the bridge, I observed one man between the public-house and the bridge; the public-house is about twenty yards from the bridge - as I passed over the bridge, I observed two men on the right-hand side of the bridge, about fifteen yards from where I had seen the one man (I cannot recollect whether the man who was between the bridge and public-house, was moving or standing still); there is a parapat to the bridge; they were leaning forwards, looking towards the water - they had a largeish parcel between them; I did not particularly notice the size - they both appeared to have it between them, and it was resting, I think, on the parapet; they were standing before it, and I thought were endeavouring to conceal it from us as we passed; any thing large might have been in the parcel - I cannot tell whether it, would contain a child of thirteen years old; it was not a basket, it appeared like canvas - as I crossed the bridge, one of the men said, "Here is some one coming;" I did not take notice of the man, who I had passed before I came to the bridge - the observation made me look at the two men, but I took but little notice of them; my wife made some observations to me which I answered, and proceeded, over the bridge towards Oxford-street, and when, we had got twelve or fifteen paces from the bridge I heard a splash in the water - it must have been caused by something large being thrown in; the noise was considerable - I consider Marchell and Taylor about the size of the men I saw on the bridge - I cannot say whether the man, who was about fifteen paces from the bridge, was taller or shorter than the two on the bridge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q.What sort of a night was this? A.Rather dark - I could not see the men's faces; I was several paces from them.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. They stood with their backs to you, and before the parcel? A. Yes; I saw the prisoners before the Magistrates, about three weeks afterwards.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. On Saturday, the 28rd of February, I was going over the bridge with him, near the York and Albany, between seven and eight o'clock; I saw two men on the bridge - I had seen one man before we came to the bridge, and two on the bridge; the two outside prisoners are like the men on the bridge; they are the figure and size of the men on the bridge; I did not observe the man in the road - the men on the bridge were leaning forwards, with their faces towards the water, and they had a largeish bundle resting on the wall of the bridge - it was something dark, but what I cannot say - it appeared more like canvas than any thing else; I heard one of them say, "Here is somebody coming," and the reply was, "It is only a boy" - it was a dark night; I and my husband, passed on - I made an observation to my husband, and he made an answer; I thought they were throwing something in which was not right; I heard the splash of water, which must have been caused by something of considerable size being thrown in, for we were at some distance when we heard the splash; I should think the parcel was large enough to contain a thing of considerable size - I cannot say it was large enough for a child - a child might be put into it; I think it was big enough for a child ten or twelve years old.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q.You were not near enough to see either of the men's faces? A. No; they were about the prisoners' size and figure, and were dressed like them, when I saw them - they both had dark clothes - the tallest had a frock-coat on, I am certain.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.When you say their dress was like the men when you saw them, where do you means? A. I saw them before the Justice - they then had clothes on like those worn by the men on the bridge.</p>

             when he was alive; I saw him the night before he was missed, but not that night - I was with him the night before Shrove - Tuesday, in John-street, and I think Taylor is the same gentleman that came up to Paviour - the man came out of Mr. Taylor's house - I had never seen Taylor but once before in my life; he lived at No. 27, next door to Mr. Paviour; I was on the other side of the way, coming home with my mother's bread, and saw the man come out of Taylor's house, and speaking to Paviour's boy - the person did not seen very pleased; I did not hear what he said; I saw Paviour's boy, as I was coming through Pitt - street, peeping through the key-hole of Taylor's door - the person came out about five minutes after that; I think the prisoner in the brown coat is the man that came out, but cannot say for certainty; the man held his hands, as much as to say "I will do something to you" warning him (holding his finger up) - I heard no words pass between them at all.</p>
               <p>Taylor. Q.Was it an older man than me? because a schoolmaster lives up stairs? A.He was about your height, and in the same kind of dress; he did not touch<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110054"/>the boy - I saw the boy peeping through the street door, which was shut.</p>
               <p>DANIEL WILLIAMS re-examined. On Monday morning, the 11th of March, I found in the canal the body of a boy, about twelve or thirteen years old; he had on a pair of speckled trousers, (pepper and salt or worsted,) a blue jacket buttoned close round, and no shoes nor slippers - he had stockings on, but no hat; I sent for the Police, and found both his arms were broken - I delivered the body to a Policeman, who is not here; I did not see the body before the Coroner - I should know the clothes again; by water the distance from the York and Albany public-house to where I found it is little short of half a mile, coming round by the water; there are no locks between the York and Albany and that spot - there may be some little shallows, but very little; the water is generally five feet deep about there - the barges draw about four feet of water there; the body coming in contance with a barge might drive it some distance - barges frequently pass up and down the canal; there is no raised water there - there is more draft of water where I found the body than at the York and Albany; the water runs both ways - the water would drift the body from the bridge towards where it was found.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM FOREMAN. I keep a coal-wharf. I found a cap in Regent's-canal, the latter end of February - I do not know the date - I carried it home, dried it, and gave it to my mother - Keys, the constable, has it - I gave it to him; I found it between the top lock, and the first bridge going to Chalk-farm, facing the York and Albany, nearly.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS KEYS. I am a constable of St. Pancras, From information I received, on Monday, the 11th of March, I took possession of these clothes, which I got from the body of the deceased boy Paviour, which was produced before the Counter.</p>
               <p>DANIEL WILLIAMS. These are the clothes the boy had on - I know them very well by their appearance - the trousers were buttoned on; I only saw the jacket,  waistcoat and trousers.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS KEYS. I received a cap from Foreman, which I now produce; there is marks of blood on the back of the collar of this shirt, and on the hind part of the shirt tail, there is marks of blood just at the seat; the cap-lining had a mark of blood, and outside the cap there was the appearance of a blow - the cap is made of green cloth, and the nap appears to have received a sharp hit - and from the shape of the cap. and the lining, I should think the blow had been given on the forehead - and the blood in the lining comes just about the place where the appearance of the blow outside is; I saw the person of the boy before the clothes were taken off, about two hours or an hour and a half after it was taken out of the water; they were wringing wet, and had evidently come from the water - I saw it at the York and Albany public-house, in the morning, at half-past nine o'clock.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Union-terrace, Camden-town. On Monday, the 11th of March, I was fetched to the York and Albany, public-house, about two o'clock, and saw the dead body of the boy - the clothes were then on his person; after they were removed I examined the body, and took notes of the examination; I conclude the fracture of the right arm had been effected before the blood had ceased to flow - that is not many minutes after death - the other might have been about the same period; a violent blow had been given on the right side of the head, and I should say it could not be given long after death, at any rate - it must have been inflicted while the blood was flowing, as there was extravasation - it was on the side of the head; I did not perceive much mark of a bruise; judging from the external and internal appearance, I should say decidedly, that the blow on the side of the head, if given during life, would have caused death; there were some indications of drowning, but I would not say they could not be caused by a blow, or apoplexy - there was no decided appearance of suffocation.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you conclude, that either from the blow on the head, or that, and the drowning, the child had died? A.Certainly - I think the fracture of the arm could not be inflicted by a barge passing over the body in the water, as the bottom of the canal is very soft, and if it was done after the body was in the water, it must have been only a few minutes after; I should say the body had been in the water about a week, or it might be a fortnight - it certainly was not very recent; the eyelids were closed, which is not usual in cases of drowing, but that is not conclusive.</p>
               <p>The witness read his notes, containing a detailed account of the post mortem examination, strongly stating particulars indicative of an abominable offence having been committed on the person of the child; which the witness stated must have been done not later than a day or two before death.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BURROWS, ESQ. M. D. I am a physician, and live at No. 42, Mortimer-street, Cavendish-square. On the Friday after the Inquest I examined the body - I think it was on the 15th of March; Mr. Curtis had seen it before me, and he was with me at that time - I have heard Mr. Curtis' evidence; I concur with him in the external appearance, but he examined the internal appearances before me, and of course they were displaced before I commenced my examination - I do not know so much about them; I examined the hinder part of the boy very minutely, and suggested that they should be removed from the body for more minute examination - it is my opinion, from the appearance I saw about the fundament externally, and the gut internally, that some violence had been done to that part of the body previous to death - I observed the fractures of the arms, about the right arm there was the mark of a bruise, nearly the size of half-a-crown, and a considerable discolouring; and it was of that nature which I believe could not have been made after death; or if so it must have been while the blood was in circulation in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110055"/>smaller vessels; it could not have been made after the heart ceased to bleed - we divided the skin off the head, and, as far as I could judge, the appearance corresponded with what Mr. Curtis stated - I think the boy must have received a blow on the head, which stunned him, or probably killed him, and subsequently to that the arms were broken, but whether he was immediately afterwards thrown into the water there is nothing to enable me to say - the blow was quite sufficient to have stunned him and produce death, but I cannot say he might not have recovered from it - nothing that I saw or have heard detailed, except these two causes, can account for his death.</p>
               <p>ROBERT PAVIOUR. I saw the body before the Coroner - it was my son Robert's body: I first saw the body about four o'clock in the afternoon of the 11th - the clothes were on then, it was my son's body.</p>

             KENT. I am Marchell's landlady, and live at No. 5. Warren-street, Fitzroy-square; my husband is a shoe-maker. Marchell came to me last October, and he was lodging with me on the 19th of February; he was at my house on the 19th of February, between six and seven o'clock in the evening - he could not go out after that without my knowledge; he came in between six and seven o'clock - he did not go out before eleven, which was the time I retired; I recollect this by a funeral which he told me of on the Sunday before - his wife and him came to lodge with me together, in October; he has one child.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.Was he acquainted with Taylor? A. I believe not before the funeral - it was Taylor's wife's funeral; I believe he became acquainted with him by going to his wife's funeral to assist; he told me he was to have 2s. 6d. for carrying the corpse, and when he got there he was too short - I never saw Taylor at my house; I believe Marchell is supported by his wife - she had money when she left her situation, as housekeeper, to a gentleman in Hanover-square; he was never out later than ten or eleven o'clock - I heard of the Inquest, but was not told to attend: I was first asked to be a witness the week before last - Keys called at my house after Marchell was in custody, and asked if I could tell where he was on the night of the 19th of February; I said, I could not tell - he came abruptly to me - but when I recollected the funeral I remembered it was on the Tuesday following - Keys called six, seven, or eight times.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not tell him, on every occaion, that you could not tell about his being at home? A.He only asked me about that the first time, when he took Marchell - I told him, when he called afterwards, that I recollected he was at home; he often went into Marchell's apartment without speaking to me; my husband was not at the home on the 19th, he was out of town - I am not obliged to say where, it is not a fair question; he was in the Marshalsea prison - I had three lodgers besides Marchell; I cannot say whether any of them were at home that night, but Marchell's apartments joined mine; and he never had a key - I went to bed about eleven o'clock; I have not told an untruth by saying my husband was out of town - for the Marshalsea is not in town.</p>
               <p>Q.Has not Keys repeatedly asked you where Marchell was on the night of the 19th, and have you not as frequently told him you could not tell? A. I do not know that he ever asked me more than once or twice; I was flurried when he came to apprehend Marchell.</p>

I know Mrs. Kent's house in Warren-street; I did not apprehend Marchell there - I took him at a public-house near there; I saw Mrs. Kent both before and after I took him, I asked her where Marchell was on the evening of the 19th of February; she said she did not know that - sometimes he slept out and sometimes at home; she invariably gave me that answer.</p>

On the 6th of March the prisoner came into the shop alone, about half-past four o'clock - she bought 1/8 of a yard of muslin; that came to about 2d. - then she asked for some flannel, and while the shopman was getting it I happened to look off some goods I was measuring, and saw her convey something from the counter - I turned to the shopman, and asked what he had left there- he said Nothing; I detained her, and she produced this diaper from under her apron, which I should sell for 4s. 9d. - she said she had picked it off the floor, which she could not have done, for ten minutes before I had placed it under the flap of the counter, to press it.</p>

On the 18th of February I was on duty in James-street, Covent-garden - the prisoner came to me, and said he wished to give himself into my custody, as he had robbed his employers at Reading, of two lace squares, two pairs of stockings, and six yards of lace - I took him to the station, and he there said he had left a trunk at the Horse and Jockey, at Reading, to be forwarded to the White Horse-cellar - he told me he had pawned some things at Mr. Boyce's; I found the trunk at the White Horse-cellar, with this direction on it "Mr. H. Petch, London, to be left till called for at the office;" the prisoner gave me the key of it - I opened it, and found these other things in it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>THOMAS GARTON. I am an officer. I got this certificate from Mr. Clark's office - I was present when the prisoner was tried in the name of John Tingay, in September, 1827 - he is the same man; he was tried for stealing sugar, and sentenced to be transported for seven years.</p>

The prisoner asked me to let her have a few things, for some duplicates, for four days, as she had some money coming from the country, and if she did not come in four days I was to do what I pleased with them; I kept them four months, and as she did not come, I took the things out- here is a bed, bolster, pillow, two sheets, and two blankets.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is the young gentleman here? A. No, he is only five years old; there was a woman and a man there, whom the prisoner said was her son-in-law.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q.Was the door of the house open? A. Yes, it is open when I go there; I have not seen any company there; I have known the prisoner eighteen years - her husband was a milkman in Pool-terrace.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How came you there? A. I once lived there; I now live in the Shambles at York - I am in town generally about two months in the Spring, and when in town I call at her house; I have not known so much of her lately - I have called there; I slept there last night - I have dined and breakfasted there; I have slept at her house more than a fortnight in the course of the last month; the door was open, and the beadle walked in there - the boy had been in before, I think about a quarter of an hour; I was there last Sunday and the Sunday before - that is not my place of residence; I live at No. 31. Cumberland-passage, and sometimes I am with my niece, in Little Marlborough-street; when I am with the prisoner, I pay her twelve shillings if I stop a week - that is my residence when I stop there for a week; I was surprised when the boy came in with the officer.</p>

            . I keep a general sale-shop, No. 95, Whitecross-street. On Saturday morning; the 2nd of March, I saw Lee and a number of other girls intoxicated - I suspected something, and about half past ten o'clock, Ryan came and asked to look at a bonnet; she said, "Never mind the price;" I told my wife to get a bonnet down, and said to Ryan "Old girl, you have been in luck" - she said, "Yes, the other girl brought the man home, but I got 25s. 6d. out of it;" she then said, "You little think where my purse is;" she then turned her back to me, and got out a sovereign and 2s. from under her clothes; she then said,"Do you smoke or chew? I got his tobacco as well when I got these, I always clear them out;" I said,"Was he a rich or a poor man?" she said, "All he had on was not worth a shilling," I then told the Policeman, and he brought the prosecutor, who stated he had lost four sovereigns; I said, "Did you lose any tobacco?" he said, "Yes, a quarter of an ounce of pigtail."</p>
               <p>JOSEPH GREGORY (Police-constable G 186). I took Lee to the station-house; she took from her stocking 1l. 7s. 6d., and put it into her bosom; I found in her pockets 1s. 5 1/2d. in copper - I then took Ryan; she said she knew nothing of the robbery, but when she came down, Lee said she had got a sovereign and some silver from the prosecutor, and she wished her to get him outside.</p>

               <p>BRIDGET KEY. On Thursday, the 27th of February, Ryan came to me, and asked me to mind her child, as she was going to sell some fruit - I said I would, and she showed me a sovereign which she had to buy fruit; I should not know it again.</p>
               <p>Ryan. On the 28th of February I went out to look for a lodging; I met this prisoner, who was a stranger - I asked her for a lodging; she said I might stop with her; which I did for four nights: on the night of the 1st of March she came in with the man - I did not like to stay in the room; I got out of bed, and put on my gown - the man asked me if I would have a drop of ale: he put his hand into his pocket to give me sixpence, and dropped a half-sovereign - I went down to the passage, and Lee came and asked me to get the man out; I said; as she had brought him in I did not like to get him out - she spoke in Irish to me; the prosecutor then sat down on the threshold of the door - I asked him to go home, but he would not; I took him up, and took him down - I was sweeping the room the next morning, and found this tobacco; she had left a bonnet and shawl at Torner's, and on the 2nd of March she gave me 2s. to go for the bonnet; he sent his wife for it; I had the sovereign and two shillings tied in the corner of my handkerchief - he said, "They are all fighting;" I said I knew nothing about it - I got the man down quietly; I did not molest him at all.</p>

I recollect the pork coming up directed to Mr. Aylwood's - it was drawn into Irish-court from the shop window, and something taken from it, but we did not know what till we sent for Mr. Golding; I had seen the prisoner loitering about when I delivered the pack at the shop - we went after him, and found him in half an hour; the meat was afterwards found.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on the 2nd of February, at Kingston; he began to speak to me as we were coming along; I told him he had better say what he had to say before the Alderman - he then said it was a planned thing with Tim Leary and Bill Allen, and they had acted as b-y rogues to him, or they would have paid the money - he said he knew it was quite up with him, when Mr. Boyd found him out - he said he was ashamed of himself, and he ought to doat on the ground Mr. Boyd walked on, as he had been a good master and a father to him; I said, "You must have made hay while the sun shone to spend 53l.;" he said, "It soon went away with the boys and girls."</p>

On the 2nd of February, which was Saturday morning, I was engaged to fetch the prisoner up from Kingston gaol - I went with Feltham; in coming up Robinhood-hill; the prisoner said, the moment the knock came to the door, and they were all called up, he knew he was wanted; in coming along he said, if it had not been for

               <p>MATILDA COWARD. I live with my mother, in Gravel-lane, Southwark. On the evening of Christmas day I was at a neighbour's house, and saw Tim Leary there and a young man named Allen; Leary pulled out some money - I went down the yard some time after, and saw Johnson, the prisoner; he asked me if I had heard any thing about him - I told him No; he said if any one asked me if I had seen him I was to say No - I cannot say what quantity of money Leary produced in his hand, but he dropped one sovereign; I cannot tell whether it was gold, silver or copper that he had in his hand - I did not take notice; if any one said it was a handful of sovereigns he pulled out that is not true.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this your hand-writing? A. Yes; this mark is mine - this paper was read over to me before Mr. Alderman Atkins; I told the same story I have now.</p>
               <p>ANN SUGDEN. I live in Gravel-lane. On Christmas-day I met the prisoner, with Tim Leary and Bill Allen - Leary pulled out some money, but it was in a dark street, and I could not see it well; he said he was going to Ireland - I was returning home some time after, and saw the prisoner, who told me if any one asked if I had seen him, to say that I had not; I had known them as neighbour's children - the prisoner's parents live in King's-gardens, Gravel-lane - I was in service at Woolwich nine months ago.</p>

               <p>RICHARD SMITH. I am clerk at the New-inn, Old Bailey. On the evening of the 21st of March the prisoners came there with a cart - I went into the yard and asked them what they had got for us; they said ten chests of tea - I said I would call a man to help them to unload; they said I need not trouble myself, but I called a man - they gave me their bill, but said they had not their book; and while they were unloading I went into the counting-house and entered them - I signed 1s. 8d. on the bill for ten chests; when they had unloaded, one of them came to the door, and said, they had but nine chests, and they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110065"/>would bring the other in the morning - I said I must alter the bill to 1s. 6d., and I gave them the note, but I did not strike off the ten; they then went away - the chests were to be sent to Cooksey, of Southampton; one of the prisoners paid me the money, and the chests were sent by the waggon - I did not observe what name was on the cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Which of them paid you? A. I believe it was Callow; they did not tell me they had an unchalked chest which they did not know what to do with - they were taken into custody the same night.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the cart loaded? A. No, but I saw it in the street; I did not see how many chests there were - it was at the Globe public-house, Crutched-friars, that I saw it; I asked Poole if they had got the right number, and he said Yes - it is very common to chalk the different chests, to prevent trouble in the inn yards; I did not see whether these were chalked - the chests ought to have been put into the cart by the yardsman, but he is not here; these ten chests were to go to Southampton - I understood the prisoners were stopped in Farringdon-street; sometimes we have mistakes in chests of tea, and I desire my men to take them to the Globe, and ask the landlord to let them remain there for the night - we have had mistakes before; I have made mistakes of the same kind.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Will you explain what you mean by mistakes? A. I have taken wrong chests from the East India company's yard, and returned them the next morning - I do not know that I ever took one too many.</p>

I was called to unload the chests of tea from the cart; I unloaded nine, one of the prisoners, (but I do not know which) pulled them out of the cart - they said they had ten to deliver; they delivered nine, and said they should bring the other the next morning - I saw they had other chests in the cart, and asked where they were going with them; they said one was to go to the Magpie and Stump, Newgate-street - I do not know where they said they were going with the others, but they stated how many they had to deliver; I asked what they were going to do with that one - they said to take it home - I said I supposed it was one that they had made for themselves, and if they made one a week they would make a good berth; they said no more, but went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did they not tell you they had ten to deliver to your master? A. Yes; I did not examine them to see if they were properly chalked or not - I forget the other places where they said they had to go, but they might have to pass Farringdon-street - I do not know how many chests there were in the cart, but there was one more than they said they wanted; they might have told me they had one more to deliver at another place than they had, and that would have accounted for all the chests, but that would not have agreed with the bill - I did not have the bill, but I saw it - they gave it to the book-keeper; there was nothing to prevent me from examining to the chests in the cart - I had not noticed them coming to the yard before; I have been twelve months in the place - I have not been drinking to-night.</p>
               <p>JOHN BLOMFIELD. I belong to the Rose Inn, Farringdon-street. On the night of the 21st of March I was informed the prisoners came to my yard with three chests of tea in a cart, and they left two of them - I saw the cart in the yard, and one chest in it - I took the King's number of it, 4468; it stood there an hour and a half - I told the street watchman to speak to them about it; they took it away about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did you speak to them about the chest? A. No, they were gone to drink - I did not see them at all - but I went into the yard, and asked why the cart stood there.</p>

               <p>DAVID RICHARDS. I live at No. 6, North-place, Liverpool-road, and am a watchman of St. Sepulchre's. In consequence of what Mr. Blomfield said, I stopped the cart in Farringdon-street; I asked the prisoners what they had in it - they said a chest of tea, and they were going home with it; I asked if they had a bill of parcels - they said No; I said they must go to the watch-house and give an account of it; when I took them to the watch-house, they said they had ten chests to deliver at the New Inn, but this one was a wrong number, which often occurred in their business, and they were going to take it home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not stop them in the road from Farringdon-street to Crutched-friars? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN MARVELL. I live at No. 25, Sea Coal-lane, and am a constable. I produce the chest of tea, No. 4468, and these cards, which Callow delivered to me voluntarily.</p>
               <p>MR. PALMER. I believe this is one of the chests which ought to have gone from the New Inn to Southampton.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not generally the case, that when chests are to go to a certain inn, that the name of the inn ought to be chalked upon them? A. It ought to have been done by Poole, but he is a stranger to the business - they might have left this chest in some place without taking it to the Rose if they had meant to have robbed me; it often happens, that the name of the inn is not marked on the chests; I have every reason to believe that this was a mistake.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Then you believe there is no ground for this prosecution? A. I believe it was a mistake; the cards which they have, generally have the number of the chests on the back of them.</p>
               <p>Callow's Defence. When I received the cards, I looked at the numbers on the chests, and I took this number for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110066"/>4768, and when I got to the New Inn, I said, "This is a wrong chest;" the book-keeper was not out of the counting-house at all till he called the porter, but he did not unload them - I took them out myself; when he came down he counted thirteen, and he told the book-keeper ten.</p>
               <p>Poole's Defence. I loaded the cart with eighteen chests; I told Callow there was a wrong chest - it was an oversight; I do not understand the marks.</p>

On the 18th of February I went to the banking-house of Barnard and Co., Cornhill, about three o'clock; I saw Stowers at the door, and received some letters from him - (Mr. Patterson, of Broad-street, is my solicitor, and has been so for some time;) after doing my business at the banker's where I staid some time, I came out, and was proceeding along the street towards Mr. Patterson's, in Broad-street; previous to that I had given Stowers a letter with directions to wait for me; I got into <placeName id="t18330411-145-crimeloc812">Spread Eagle-court</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SERGEANT ANDREWS. Q.How long after his return did you and him finally settle the account? A.Five or six months; the ship returned in 1830, and the accounts were settled in 1831 - I saw him frequently before the settlement, in the presence of his officers; I should think I saw him half a dozen times - Mr. Cooper had the account to settle before it went to Mr. Rotch; I did not attend the several meetings at which Mr. Rotch investigated the accounts, but I attended the last meeting, and I paid the balance; I have not heard of the prisoner being employed at sea since - I have frequently seen him about the streets, and at our wharf, but had no intercourse with him since; I know Lesley, a dealer in Irish provisions - I do not recollect conversing with him last year about the prisoner; I do not recollect ever saying any thing to him as to the state of the prisoner's mind - I never could have said, "Oh, poor fellow, he is mad; I have known him a long time, and think he is not right in his mind."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever observe any thing to lead you to consider he was not sound in his mind? A. I considered so from report, but nothing from my own observation - except that I understood he was much addicted to liquor, and then he was very outrageous; I never saw any thing to induce me to suspect his state of mind.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT ANDREWS. Q.Have you said to any body that you believe him mad or not right in his mind? A. I have no recollection of it - I am not entirely recovered now; my recollection did not properly recover itself till after I was removed to the surgeon's.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Have the kindness to state the amount of property entrusted to his charge on board the Partridge? A. A great many thousand pounds - he had to account for a cargo of 14,000l. independent of the ship; he returned in 1830 - the settlement of accounts was in February, 1831.</p>

On Monday, the 18th of February, Cooper gave me some letters to deliver to Mr. Mellish, at the bankers' in Cornhill; I was to wait in the street till I saw Mr. Mellish - the letters were delivered to me at Millwall; I got to Cornhill about five minutes before one o'clock - after being there some little time I saw the prisoner; I knew him before - he came down from the Exchange towards Leadenhall-street; he was alone - I was waiting near the door of Messrs. Barnard's; the prisoner said to me, "Charles, are you waiting for master?" I said,"Yes, I am;" he said, "I should like to see him - I want to speak to him;" he did not stop above a minute or so with me, for he said, "It will not do for us to be seen together, as Mr. Mellish might think there was something wrong," and then I should be to blame - I continued to wait in Cornhill (this was about half-past one o'clock); while I was there I saw Andrew Hitter, who had been an officer on board the Partridge - when I had spoken to him the prisoner came and spoke to me again; he told me he had seen young Hitter speak to me, and he said that young man was not fit to be sent to sea, that he was more fit for the situation he was in on shore; he said nothing more, except again saying it would not do for us to be seen together, as Mr. Mellish might think something wrong, and I might be blamed; and then he went down towards Leadenhall-street - I saw him return on the opposite side of the way, and he went into the entrance of the house No. 71; I was standing before Messrs. Barnard's window - I could see him walking about in the entrance; he did not go into the house, but seemed walking about as if waiting for somebody in the entrance - Mr. Mellish came to Barnard's door about ten minutes or a quarter after three o'clock; I gave him the letters - he read them, and then went into Barnard's; and while Mr. Mellish was reading the letters, the prisoner seemed to be secreting himself in the entrance of No. 71 - he was rather concealed on one side; Mr. Mellish told me to remain where I was while he went into Mr. Barnard's, as he had a letter to send to Mr. Cooper; he came out of Barnard's in six or seven minutes - he then told me to remain, or to go over to Mr. Shears' and wait for him; I saw Mr. Mellish go down Cornhill towards the Exchange - I missed the prisoner out of the entrance of No. 71, and I crossed over to go to Mr. Shears' and as I got on the pavement I saw the prisoner turn out of No. 72; I had not seen him come out of No. 71 - I merely saw his back as he turned out of No. 72; he went towards the Exchange on the north side - this was a very short time after Mr. Mellish had gone towards the Exchange; I saw nothing of what happened - he went in the same direction as Mr. Mellish, only on the opposite side; in the conversation he had with me he appeared perfectly well, rather the worse for liquor, but perfectly rational, and in his senses.</p>
               <p>JOHN FURBY. I am a painter and glazier. On the 18th of February I was cleaning the windows of Mr. Lutty's office, in Spread Eagle-court, about four o'clock; I observed the prisoner come up the court behind Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110069"/>Mellish, who I did not know then - the prisoner was behind him; he came up as close to him as he possibly could - I supposed he was going to give him a slap on the head; I saw him shove the pistol into the back of his neck, and then I heard a report - the muzzle of the pistol touched his neck; it went off, and Mr. Mellish fell backwards immediately - I was frightened, and stood and looked - I had no power to go and assist him; I saw blood on the stones - I observed the prisoner throw the pistol behind, gently backwards, the moment he fired it; I was so frightened I did not know what to do - a person went to Mr. Mellish and helped him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I suppose there were plenty of people in the court? A. There was nobody in the court but myself that I saw - I was on the ground; the court is a very considerable thoroughfare.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you notice his countenance? A. No - he looked very sullen after he had done it; he threw the pistol gently behind him; nobody had taken hold of him at that time - it was nearly four minutes before any body took hold of him, as near as I can recollect; he did not go away - he remained nearly in the same spot - he never moved off.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BEALE. I am a ticket porter. About four o'clock on the 18th of February I was entering Spread Eagle-court, I heard a report, and hastened to the spot; I saw the prisoner throw the pistol behind him - I saw Mr. Mellish arising, and heard him (Mellish) say, "What does this mean? I don't understand it - What does this mean?" the prisoner replied, 'Mr. Mellish, you tried to kill me, and I tried to kill you if I could;" Mr. Mellish walked away - I staid with the prisoner; he made no resistance, and in about a minute two street-keepers came and took hold of him; he appeared quite collected, and spoke very rationally, what he did say.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you before or behind him? A. Behind; he did not see me - the pistol was fired before I got into the court; the prisoner and the prosecutor were about nine yards down the court from the entrance, and there is an elbow in the court which would hide persons who were entering from those on that spot - I did not see them on going into the entrance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SERGEANT ANDREWS. Q.Which way did you enter the court? A. From Finch-lane; it leads from there into Threadneedle-street - it is an open thoroughfare for every body.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body coming the contrary way to you? A.Not one; I heard the report before I saw any body - the court is about one hundred and sixty yards long taking the turning and all; it is full of houses and open shops.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If any body had been entering the court in the opposite direction, must you have seen them? A. I must have seen them, for I entered directly I heard the report.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Stevenson. On the 18th of February I was in his shop in Spread Eagle-court; I heard the report of a pistol, saw the smoke ascend, and saw Mr. Mellish fall - I immediately ran to his assistance, and on his rising up he asked what was the matter; I saw the prisoner there - a gentleman asked who shot him; the prisoner said, "I shot him - he injured me of my living; I know the laws of my country, and I shall be hung for it:" he seemed to be in his senses, and sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.He seemed quite unconfused and calm? A. Yes.</p>

               <p>JOHN CORMIE. I am a hair-dresser, and live nearly opposite Spread Eagle-court, in Finch-lane. I heard the report of fire-arms; I ran into the court, and saw Mr. Mellish leaning on a gentleman's shoulder, and another gentleman supporting him; I saw the prisoner, and heard him say he had had the pistol loaded for these three months, and that it had now done its duty - that he was quite satisfied and comfortable now as it had done so; he said Mr. Mellish had not only robbed him of his money, but his character - that he was come to his last penny, and his life would be made amenable to the laws of his country, and the sooner he was taken out of that open court the better; I delivered him into the custody of Rawlins - I followed Mr. Mellish to the house of Mr. Miles, the surgeon; I did not observe any thing of intoxication or insanity about the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. He appeared to you quite collected and comfortable, as you described? A. He did; our window does not look into the court, but I heard the report.</p>
               <p>JOHN PRICE. I am street-keeper of Broad-street ward. In consequence of something I heard, I went to Spread Eagle-court, and saw the prisoner in the custody of

            ; there was a great crowd there then - Rawlins, the beadle, was in my company; I assisted in securing the prisoner - I do not know that Rawlins said any thing to him; I believe I said to the prisoner, "What is the matter? what have you been doing?" he said, "I have done it - I have followed him for a month, and I know I shall be hanged for it; I won't hurt any of you - take me where you like, I won't offer to go;" we took him to the watch-house, and searched him there - he gave up his powder-flask to me: I asked him if he had any more pistols - he said No; he said at the watch-house that he had had a law-suit with Mr. Mellish, and had lost it - that it had been referred to arbitration, and Mr. Mellish had robbed him; I have the pistol - I received it from Beale; I searched him - he had one penny in his pocket, and said that was not his own.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SERGEANT ANDREWS. Q. All his talk was about Mr. Mellish? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he say any thing more about the penny? A.He said he had not a farthing in the world that was his own, that his character was gone, and he did not know what to do; I afterwards took him in a coach to the Compter - as we went there, he said the pistol was loaded with two half balls, four slugs, and some small shot; I was in his company for half or three quarters of an hour - he appeared sober, and in his proper senses the whole of that time.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Quite unconfused and collected? A. He was rather agitated at first, but came to his proper recollection before I left him.</p>
               <p>JOHN RAWLINS. I am beadle and constable of St. Bennet Fink. On hearing the report of a pistol, and a noise, I went to Spread Eagle-court; the prisoner was delivered into my custody; on my taking him, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110070"/>said I had no occasion to lay hold of him, for he had shot Mr. Mellish, and therefore would go very quietly with us wherever we chose to take him; he said he had been injured by Mr. Mellish, and was then perfectly satisfied, so long as he been able to shoot him; he said he knew he should be hung for doing it, and said he could not help it, that the law must take its course; I took him to the watch-house - he gave a powder-flask up to Price; I went in the coach with him from the watch-house to Giltspur-street - he said the pistol was loaded with a ball split in two, and some small shot; he might mention slugs, but I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>JOHN MILES. I am a surgeon, and live in Throgmorton-street. Mr. Mellish was brought to me with two wounds, which had been received on the right side of the head; the larger wound was a lacerated wound - he was in a very exhausted state, having lost a deal of blood from the larger wound; he lost blood from a branch of an artery, which was lacerated - there was no positive evidence of the presence of any ball at that time; I did what I could to stop the blood, and accompanied Mr. Mellish to his house in York-place, Baker street, and have attended him till this time; Mr. Brodie also saw him at different times - I bandaged the head, and on the third day, we removed the dressings, and at that time there was no evidence of any ball - but at the second dressing, which was about the fifth day, one half ball had worked itself to the aperture - Mr. Brodie was able to take it out with his finger without any operation; I have that half ball here; we extracted at a later period some shot; the pistol, I should think, had been fired in a slanting direction; I think it very likely, if it had been fired directly horizontal, we should have had an injury to the bone - I suppose it rather glansed the bone; the shot was taken from very near the smaller wound - the large wound was about an inch and a half beyond the right ear; the pistol appeared to me to have slanted upwards; I have been in attendance on Mr. Mellish till now - he is considerably recovered.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Did you see the prisoner at the time? A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say my Lord.</p>
               <p>ANDREW NIECE HITTER. I live in London, and am a ship-broker. I sailed a voyage with the prisoner in the Partridge in 1826 - I was the fourth officer; the prisoner was master and commander - I might have known him about a week before I sailed that voyage with him - I joined the ship at Gravesend; we made to Cape de Verd in the course of our voyage, and at that place, I observed something particular in the prisoner's conduct - we had been on our voyage about six weeks; the chief of our crew went on shore there by the Captain's orders; (our crew consisted of about thirty-three) he ordered them to work on Sunday, and they would not, so he sent about twelve men on shore - he got others in their stead - I think the same number; he sent about three or six months of the ship's provisions away with the men - the governor would not allow them to be sent on shore without it; the men that came on board, I should think, had never been on shipboard before - part of them were slaves; they were decidedly unfit men to work the ship - we were then bound on the South Sea voyage; it was very important to keep provisions on board, and to have proper men on board.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Were these the best men that could be found? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT ANDREWS. Q. Were the men he sent on shore more fit for the work than those he received in their room? A.Decidedly so; any man who was conscious of what he was doing, would not have done it - it was my opinion, and the opinion of all of us. I remember one Sunday his nearly shooting the third mate; the ship was going out - it was after we had been at de Verd; he used to keep pistols over his head in his berth - he called the third mate down into the cabin, to have some conversation with him; the pistols were in a case - he took one up, and fired it - it just grazed the mate's ear; I saw all this: the prisoner laughed, and spoke of it as a joke to every ship we passed - the pistol had a ball in it, for it lodged in the rudder-case: I saw it there; the ball was in the ship when we came home - he kept it there to show.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean that the pistol actually struck him? A. The ball grazed his ear.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT ANDREWS. Q.Did you get to Berkeley-sound, in the Falkland Islands? A. Yes - the prisoner was quite an altered man there, we thought he had taken to drinking; I do not know whether he did or not - I do not know whether the crew took any notice of it; I was in the habit of speaking to the officers - the officers spoke about it- we all thought he was getting quite different; when we were off Galley-bay, he sent me away in a boat, with about five persons, to get turpin, which is a sort of turtle - he sent us in an open boat; we had a sail and five men, without any provisions at all - he would not let us take any: we were to go about twenty miles - he did not say how long we were to stay: he did not represent any difficulties we should have to contend with; it was his command - the weather turned out very severe: we were gone about a day and a half, and were in distress for want of water and provisions, and returned; when I came back I represented the difficulties we had undergone - he passed it off as a joke, and laughed at it; some of the men had drank salt water from necessity, and he treated that quite as a joke - he was very proud of his office as commander; he was always boasting of his big ship, saying he was master and commander of the fine ship the Partridge, and placed in the shoes of Mr. Mellish himself, and would show his authority - I considered that indicted deficiency of mind and weakness - we all spoke of it as such; it was the common opinion of us five - nothing particular had happened to have affected his mind then, he might have drank a little, but we had not the opportunity of knowing that. We went to the Marquesas - it took us about a fortnight to go there from the Galipagos; these symptoms continued - before we got to the Marquesas we nearly lost the ship, through his having a pilot who was insufficient (that was the Captain's fault) - he could have prevented it, because I had been to the place before, and knew it better than the man he employed, who was a cannibal alomost: we warned him of it, and he only laughed at us: I suppose he saw the danger of the man being pilot - we warned him of it when the ship was in danger, by putting her about; the mate took it upon himself - he was next in authority to the cap<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110071"/>tain: we had several Welch sailors - he would have one of the Welch sailors on the sofa, saying the Lord's prayer in Welch, and he would drink with him to; that was done often; it appeared to me extraordinary: it was the subject of remark among us - he had him into his berth, sitting with him on the sofa, drinking with him, talking all manner of foolishness, saying the Lord's prayer in Welch three or four times over, and asking him about Wales, and that repeatedly; I saw him heave at several whales - I was in the boat with him; we went down after a large whale, and he hove two irons at her, which missed, and then he jumped overboard upon her - I did not expect to see him come up again, but he swam back to the boat, and came into the boat - we had been out then about twelve months: I have often seen him strip himself; he would dance about in his own cabin, or in the common cabin for us all, and sometimes he would break about a dozen panes of glass with his fists at a time, and cut his hands; sometimes he would fall with his head against the window of the berth, and cut his head - sometimes he would break half a dozen tumblers, and dance on them with his bare feet; he did this frequently for months - he would have the doctor take the glass out of his feet, forehead and hands, and go at it again just the same; he said that it was through family fits, that the family were troubled with them; he would often tell the boy, after dinner or supper, to heave the plates and knives and forks out of the cabin window, or else he would flog him; he has then said he would break more - he had a sofa in the cabin; he gave that away at the Sandwich Islands, to a sail-maker; he gave no reason for it; after he gave the sofa away, he had a cradle made, something similar to an apple-stall which women have in the street - it had four legs to it, two stools and a platform to it, and a thing covered over it- he would sleep in that: I heard him order the cooper to make it in place of the sofa - I should think the sofa was the most useful thing: this appeared to me the act of a man not in his sound senses - he would dance round the chairs half naked, or waltz with the chairs in the cabin, and sing - this surprised me very much; no man in his senses would be so absurd - he often used to sleep with his head on the table, and a pistol by him, he has done so ten, thirty, or forty times, sometimes by day and sometimes by night; it was dangerous to sleep with a loaded pistol close to his ear; they were horse pistols, with a barrel of ten inches perhaps; sometimes the muzzle of the pistol would be towards him, and sometimes put towards the fore part of the cabin; we spoke of it to him - he was very impatient of controul: he was a passionate man, and very jealous of his power and station in the ship; we had a person on board named Thompson, who had a sleeping place to himself; I have seen the prisoner jump on the top of him when he has been in bed and asleep, with a pistol in each hand - Thompson was the mate, a chief officer; I have often seen that; it was quite a common thing on board - he did not keep company with Thompson at all; the pistols were sometimes loaded and sometimes not - he would sometimes come and throw a jug of cold water into my face when I have been asleep; I always remonstrated with him - he said it was to show his authority as master and commander; he sometimes put the bottles on the cabin table, and took his steel or knife and fenced with them, and sent them away to the other side of the cabin, liquor and all; he would often jump out of his bed in the night, and say the devil was in the cabin - he often said we were going to rob him, and he would lock every thing up - these symptoms increased more and more; we all spoke of it - the cook died during the voyage in my arms, in his berth, and the prisoner would not sleep below for six weeks or two months after, for fear of his ghost - he gave that as a reason; he was completely mad at the Sandwich Islands for six weeks, and had two doctors to attend him - the doctors thought he would have died there; we had then been out nearly two years - we were refreshing the ship there; I saw him at intervals: he was laying almost dead when I saw him - he had his head shaved; I think he got worse after that - I thought his mind in the worst state when we got nearer home, some of us locked him in his berth, for he had got mad altogether; (we had been out forty-five months; he was going to blow the ship up in the chops of the channel) - we locked him up by common consent, for the safety of the ship: he continued always so till we got into the Downs: I left the ship at Blackwall - he was worse then, and the pilot had to put him below - the prisoner said he would shoot him if he could get a pistol; the pilot was in command when the ship was in the river - I parted with the ship at Blackwall on the 10th of July, 1830, and he remained in that state till I left the ship.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Did you communicate these things to Mr. Mellish as soon as you arrived? A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mr. Mellish personally? A. All the officers did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. Mellish your opinion of the state of his mind? A. Yes; I spoke, I do not exactly know to whom - I spoke more to Captain 
               <persName id="t18330411-145-person1083">Dale</persName>
             (who is dead) than to Mr. Mellish - I had to communicate with Mr. Mellish and Captain Dale, his agent, on business when I quitted the ship - I was alone with Mr. Dale sometimes, and told him of this conduct - I saw Mr. Mellish there sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Captain Dale die? A. Two years ago nearly - he died in 1831; he was my uncle - when we were at a place called Goa, the prisoner abused the governor, and threatened to shoot him: the governor had sold him some iron, and they disputed about a dollar, or a dollar and a half - I do not know that he had pistols with him; I saw him for some months after I quitted the ship - I always thought, and still think, that he was of insane mind; I have seen him sometimes lately on 'Change, but we never spoke after all was settled - I only saw him after I left the ship to settle the affairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Was that your first voyage? A. The second - we had been three years on the first voyage; I was then under Captain Hewit, in Mr. Mellish's service; I have not been to sea since I went with the prisoner - I am now a ship-broker; the instances I have named were dispersed over the whole forty-five months of the voyage, and I have not named one hundredth part of them; I wrote home to Captain Dale at times, but not so often as I ought - I did not write till after we had been out two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did those letters contain information of his unsound state of mind? A. No, not much - they did contain<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110072"/>some; I cannot tell when I named it - I did not write to tell him Captain Folger was a madman; I cannot remember what was in the letters; I never wrote to Mr. Mellish, but I wrote to Captain Dale I suppose about six times - I wrote to him from the Sandwich Islands.</p>

               <p>Q. That was while he was mad, and under the care of a doctor; did you tell the captain that? A. No, I do not think I did - I wrote to him from Goa; I do not think I named it then, for when I came home he always blamed me for not telling him; the first instance happened at Cape de Verd, when he put the men on shore for not working on Sunday - I do not think there was any British consul there; I should say decidedly he was sober when he shot at the mate - they had had no words; he took the pistol and fired it; I do not know whether he knew it was loaded - it was about nine o'clock in the morning that he sent us out to catch turpins; we might have done that in a day or less, but he sent us different ways - they are not caught so easily - there may be none when we go; they do not live in the water, but up in the bushes.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had had provisions with you, might you not have been out longer than he liked? A. We might, but there was no water there - I never saw the pilot that he took eat human flesh, but he has said so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know whether he could have got a better pilot there? A. No - a pilot is a man who knows the coast he comes off of, but I knew the coast - I did not know the soundings, and do not believe that any body does.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He jumped on a whale's back, and back again? A. I cannot say he jumped right on her, he jumped after her, and into the vortex of the water where it had gone down - he swam back; he used to skip and dance on glass when on the Japan coast, and at different times on the voyage - we did not attempt to confine him; he struck the surgeon once; the surgeon did not confine him - there was a consul and British people at the Sandwich Islands; many of these things happened before we got there - we complained to the consul there, but he threatened to take us all out of the ship, and flog us all; I do not know why, but because we disputed the prisoner's authority, madness, and stupidness; on coming home we did not remonstrate with the government about the consul's conduct - I know many sailors who are not afraid of ghosts; he was going to blow the ship up in the channel - there were some King's ships in the channel, but we did not complain to them, nor when we got on shore - we were glad to get clear of him.</p>
               <p>Q. In the whole voyage was not the prisoner extremely drunk and dissipated, both on board and on shore, spending and throwing away Mr. Mellish's property, and wasting it? A. Yes, after the time I mentioned, but not at first - we told Mr. Mellish about the proceedings on the voyage, and how he had wasted his property; I did not tell him it would be improper to pay him any money - I told him the whole proceedings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell him you believed Folger was mad? A."Mad and drunk" I have always said; I do not know that I ever spoke to Mr. Mellish so much as to say he was mad, because others spoke more than me; there were three besides me, and we all spoke together, saying he was mad and drunk - I told him and Captain 
               <persName id="t18330411-145-person1084">Dale</persName>
             all I have told you to-day, word for word, the whole proceedings of the voyage.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you told him the prisoner was mad at the Sandwich Islands? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Did you tell him you believed him to be a madman, and not in his right senses? A. I do not know that I exactly said that - it might be the effect of drink at first, but he was mad several times on the voyage; I considered it was brought on by drink at first.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You continued to see the prisoner afterwards, did you not tell any friend of his that he was in a state which he ought to be looked after and confined? A.No, I did not trouble myself about him; I was tired of him - I knew he was going about this town.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT ANDREWS. Q.When you communicated with Mr. Mellish was it at Mr. Mellish's request? A. Yes, I attended with the other petty officers - Thompson was the chief officer and the chief speaker; Mr. Mellish had us there to ascertain what had been the prisoner's conduct - we explained all these instances, and one hundred which I have not named; Thompson would have to take the command of the vessel if the prisoner was unfit- I have seen the prisoner drinking and drunk; I told Mr. Dale all these circumstances, leaving him to judge of them - we were treated with contempt by the consul.</p>
               <p>ARCHIBALD LESLEY. I am a provision merchant, and live at Wandsworth. I made a communication to Mr. Mellish (since Folger's return) of what Folger has threatened or talked about; Mr. Mellish smiled, and said"Poor fellow; I believe the man is crazy or mad!" I had heard what Folger had said of Mr. Mellish, and I thought it my duty to put him on his guard respecting Captain 
               <persName id="t18330411-145-person1085">Folger</persName>
            , because I thought he might attempt to injure him - the prisoner spoke in a very violent manner, and said he had a good mind to horsewhip him on Cornhill; this was about this time two years.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not state in the conversation, that Mr. Mellish had behaved badly to him in many matters? A. In the settlement of his account; I understood him to mean that he had not given him so much as he ought - I did not tell Mr. Mellish he had said he would horsewhip him; I told him enough to put him on his guard - Mr. Mellish smiled, and said, "I believe, poor man, he is crazy or mad, I do not know which;" I will undertake to swear he either said crazy or mad - the prisoner did not attempt any violence on me or the passengers; I observed no violence in his manner; but as soon as he spoke of Mr. Mellish he seemed to go quite intemperate and to talk about the matter - I knew the Partridge, and who she belonged to, and talked to him about it.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there any thing to lead you to suppose he was not right in his mind? A. I thought his behaviour very indiscreet, to speak of a gentleman on the top of a coach as he did - I was not afraid to sit by him.</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN BLISSON. I was in a South Sea whaler in 1826 - I met with the Partridge in the voyage, and knew the prisoner as commander - I did not see much of him; I saw him at Guan - I was communicating with him about fourteen days, till I left the port; his conduct appeared extraordinary in one or two cases - in some business he had to transact with the governor his conduct appeared that of a man not in his right senses, and I made an observation to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110073"/>that effect at the time - I never knew any thing else of him - I was once in his company at home.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.When was this? A. I saw him three weeks before he committed this act - I was in his company about three hours; he was in liquor then - I met him about Change; he spoke about Mr. Mellish - I believe no man was more kind-hearted and humane than he was, but he has always appeared under great excitement when he had spoken of Mr. Mellish; he was quite calm and collected till Mr. Mellish's name came in question - I have seen much of persons who are insane; the disorder begins when the subject which caused their malady is raised.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. You did not know him before 1829, I believe? A. Yes, for three or four years before that; I know he was a little the worse for liquor when he abused the governor - I was obliged to apologise to the governor for him; I attribute his extravagant conduct to the effect of liquor - nothing was mentioned about Mr. Mellish in 1829; when I saw him three weeks before this, he was labouring under the effect of liquor.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When persons in a calm state have gone off when a subject has been named, have not those been cases where the mind has been under some delusion? A.Generally; I have been with two or three masters of ships in similar cases, and there has been something which operated on their minds.</p>
               <p>Q. He was the worse for liquor when you saw him for three hours three weeks before this occurrence, but not drunk? A. Yes, he was evidently excited by liquor; he spoke violently of Mr. Mellish, and said he had been wronged by him.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT ANDREWS. Q.Did he not speak of Mr. Mellish as having ruined him in character and fortune? A. He did.</p>

             KELLY. I was formerly captain on board a merchant vessel - I was Vice Consul of the Society Islands once, but not when the prisoner touched there as captain of the Partridge; I saw him at the Sandwich Islands when I was in command of the Sophia; I never knew him before - I have met him on Change since his return; from what I have seen of him, he is certainly not of sound mind - I do not consider him in a condition to take care of himself.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. When did you first become acquainted with him? A. At the Sandwich Islands - he was under my observation for about a month there in 1829; I saw him again about eight months ago on Change, and several times since; I was never on board his ship at the Sandwich Islands - I saw him frequently on shore; I have often seen persons labouring under the effects of constant drunkenness, present the appearance of persons of unsound mind - I always supposed his case to be the effect of nervous excitement, brought on by excessive drinking; I know he was in the habit at that time of drinking to a great excess - the extraordinary conduct I saw, was in my judgment, the consequence of excessive drinking; I have met him eight or ten times on Change, and conversed with him within the last few months, and then I conceived him mad; I have talked with him alone, and in the presence of others before February - I observed to one or two friends that he was mad, for when conversing about Mr. Mellish and his loss, his conduct was so strange and he had such a dreadful nervous excitement and trembling; I observed to my friends, that I thought he would commit suicide.</p>

               <p>Q.Was he at those times under the effect of liquor? A. On one occasion he was, it was evident he had been drinking; I cannot say that he was not labouring under the effects of liquor on the other occasions - these were mere casual meetings on Change; our conversation was not of any great length - I did not communicate with Mr. Mellish; I had not the pleasure of knowing him - the prsoner's conduct was more violent when Mr. Mellish was named - but his general conduct was wild, inconsistent; he had a strange incoherency of speech, flying from one subject to another.</p>
               <p>Q. At times when he was not in liquor? A. Yes, he frequently said Mr. Mellish had taken away his character, and he had nothing worth living for; I never observed him under any morbid delusion.</p>
               <p>JAMES CURTIS. I keep the Rum Puncheon at Gravesend. I have known Mr. Folger more than two years; he has lodged with me occasionally - he has passed a great deal of his time in my view; his conduct has certainly not been rational, like a man in his senses - I have seen him do a great many actions which a man in his senses would not do; I have reasoned with him about it, and so have other people in my house - the last thing I can recollect, is, that he came down from London in the evening, it was a very cold night; he said, "Curtis I will go and have a warm bath" - he went and had a warm bath, he got tipsy afterwards, and next morning he had another warm bath, and went and stood on the bridge; I said,"It is a very cold morning, you had better not stand there" - he said, "Never mind, it will not hurt me," and in the afternoon he had another warm bath, and then called a waterman to row him over to Tilbury Fort; the waterman did not bring the boat soon enough, and he jumped into the water, and pulled the boat to him - I took him up stairs and put him to bed, he was so wet; I believe his mind disordered, and very bad - I have heard him speak very violently of Mr. Mellish indeed; as soon as Mr. Mellish's name was mentioned, he was like a madman directly - I have had to get him out of the bar, and persons have made the remark, "Curtis, you will have to get a strait jacket to put this mad Captain into very shortly;" when his mind was not directed to Mr. Mellish, he was as good as possible - he brought a little boy to my house once, and behaved kindly to it, and so he did to my children; he has been at my house a month at a time.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. His violence was always when Mr. Mellish was named? A. Yes - it is on that violence I form my opinion; I have seen him violent on other occasions - Mr. Mellish was not named when he had the warm bath; he was not in liquor when he jumped into the water - he had been tipsy the night before; he went to bed about eleven o'clock - it was between three and four o'clock the next afternoon that he jumped into the water; he had dined, and we had a pint of port.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know whether a little<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110074"/>iquor will affect him? A. He can take a great deal before it takes effect; I never endeavoured to get him confined - I have said it was a pity somebody would not take him in hand and govern him; I put him out of my parlour by force when he was sober, the latter end of last summer.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT ANDREWS. Q. Was not Mr. Mellish always in his mouth and thoughts? A. Yes, he began talking about him with nine people out of ten, who came to my house - I thought I should hear of his being picked up in the canal someday; he has said he should like to horsewhip Mr. Mellish, and bought a whip for that purpose - he said several times that Mr. Mellish had ruined him, and taken away his character.</p>

            . I keep the Dog and Duck, at Queenhithe. I have known the prisoner about two years; I have bad opportunities of observing his conduct and manner, and the state of his mind - in my judgment, at times his mind is unsound.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you mean when he is labouring under the effect of liquor? A. I have seen him so when he had not been taking any thing strong to my knowledge; I have frequently seen him in liquor - he lodged with me(but did not board) for eight months, from August, 1831, to April, 1832; he came down stairs one night nearly naked, after having been gone to bed about ten minutes, and when told of it next afternoon, he knew nothing of it - he had not drank to excess that night; he always took something - he drank to excess at times.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. He had not drank to excess that time? A. I did not perceive it; after he went to bed I always went to see if his candle was safe - I thought it proper; he was constantly in the habit of drinking to excess, but I have seen a difference in him when he has not been drinking to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>RICHARD HEMMINGS. I am a waterman. I have known Folger well, these six or seven years, down to the present time; I generally rowed him by water - I have taken him to London or Greenwich; I observed a great deal of oddness in his manner - he would sit in the boat as comfortable as any man, when all of a sudden he would get up and stamp his feet, and behave very strange - that did not endanger the safety of the boat; I did not like to see it, and I used to talk to him - he was sober enough then; he always paid me regularly - he did not stand particular as to what his fare was; I have continued to see him about twenty times in a month down to the present time - I thought him a man of odd manner, like out of his mind: he was not in his right mind, in my opinion.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN, Q. You only rowed him about? A. No, the last time was about two months ago; I rowed him from the Dog and Duck to the King's Arms about a month before this occurred - and he kept going on as soon as he saw Mr. Mellish's wharf, stamping his feet and throwing his arms about - he did not say so much then as at other times; it was about two o'clock in the day - he was sober then, in my opinion; he always landed where he told me to take him to - I never charged him any thing; he used to pay me without charging - I have seen him very tipsy; once or twice at the Dog and Duck - his conduct was just the same then; once in particular he was very bad.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Can you mention any particular instance of his not being right in his mind? or have you known him violent only when Mr. Mellish was named? A. He always used to mention Mr. Mellish; he came to me one day, and told me to row him to St. Katharine's-dock as hard as I could - I did so; he said, "Make your boat fast and come ashore directly;" and before I could get ashore he said,"Come along, I am in a terrible hurry" - he got into a coach, and told me to jump in; he told the coachman to drive as hard as he could, somewhere about two miles - he knocked at a door and inquired for some woman, and kept running about the house; the woman came - he said,"Bear a hand, I want to get to Gravesend as quick as possible;" the woman got into the coach and went with us- we drove to the steam-pocket wharf; I saw him go on board the Eclipse, and saw no more of him; he was very bad that afternoon - he had not been drunk that I know of; that was last summer.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ANDERSON. I am a tailor, and live in Cannon-street, St. George's East, I know the prisoner very intimately, probably for ten or twelve years; occasionally I considered him decidedly of unsound mind - I have had opportunities of observing his conduct and manner very frequently; I have seen him frequently the latter part of last year with a pistol about him - I saw him with a pistol at a tavern; at one time, he was sitting at a table - there were eight or ten persons there; it was on the 5th of November - it was at the Kettle-drum in Ratcliffe-highway; he frequently attempted to discharge the pistol, but it did not go off - I saw him put the powder into it, but on my taking hold of him I believe the powder fell out; I saw him put the cap on - it was a percussion pistol; I did not see him put any thing but powder into it - he discharged a pistol at my house early in the evening, on the same day, when people were present; it was loaded - he would have put a ball into it, but I prevented him; he fired it in the yard - not at any thing particularly; he would have fired it in the house, but I prevented him - I conclude he was of unsound mind, from the general violence he has shown whenever Mr. Mellish's name has been mentioned, or whenever he came near Mr. Mellish's premises; I have frequently been with him - he has been perfectly sober at that time; it has been at nine o'clock in the morning - I have observed this occur at all times; he frequently said that Mr. Mellish had deprived him of his character - he was continually harping on that; that was principally since the arbitration has been decided - he said this when sobe ras well as drunk; I have not seen persons of unsound mind - I have known persons driven to drink by disappointment and distress.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose he visited you? A. Yes, continually down to this affair.</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN KING. I have been in the South Sea fishery. I have known the prisoner about seventeen years - he sailed with me in 1816 and 1817, in the Elizabeth, which belonged to Mr. Mellish - I have not seen much of him for the last twelve months; he was a very fine young man when he sailed with me, and one of the best young men I ever had, and I believe he was then in his right mind, but I do not believe him to have been so for these last three or four years - he has been to my house several times, and I have observed a very great alteration in his conduct; I believed at those times his mind was disordered, and I have told Mrs. King so - this was when he was perfectly sober;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110075"/>I have children, and he always had them on his knee when he came to my house - he was not a man who would take another's life, if in his right mind - I never noticed any of these appearances before he sailed for Mr. Mellish; I have not a doubt but that has been the cause of his disordered mind - he could get no employ; he has told me that Mr. Mellish refused to give him a character - I do not think he has spoken on any subject without bringing up Mr. Mellish; he has been more exasperated a great deal when Mr. Mellish's name has been mentioned - I have seen him go by my house in an open landau, like a madman, huzzaing, and holding his hands out in the street; I considered him of a disordered mind.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q.When he first came to you was he sober? A. Yes, I have never seen him intoxicated - I do not go into company; he occasionally called at my house - I have seen him there two or three times in the course of the last year; it was three or four months previous to this transaction that he was in the landau - I live at Deptford; I never saw a sailor huzza along the street unless he was intoxicated.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you mention any instance of insanity besides his speaking with violence of Mr. Mellish? A. No.</p>

               <p>MR. MELLISH. I never had any application from the prisoner for a character - I have had no conversation with him, except in the settlement of accounts; I never expressed to him, that if asked I should not give him a character - I was present when Mr. Rotch told him he could not expect a character from me, after what had been stated.</p>
               <p>WRIGHT WELBY. I live in Spa-road, Bermondsey, and am a sail maker. I know the prisoner as a neighbour - in my judgment he is of unsound mind, for he almost shot me; I had never spoken to him - it is three months ago - between eight and nine o'clock in the morning I had occasion to go down my yard; I heard the report of a pistol, and heard the fence crack - I saw the handle fall off a trowel which was stuck in the wall; I was about three feet from the trowel - the prisoner was about ninety feet from me at the time; the shot split the trowel handle - I cannot say whether he was shooting at me or the fence, for the fence is nearly as high as my hat; the fence was between me and him - the ball came in a direction towards me; there was nothing which I could see in the fence to shoot at - I have seen him walk upanddown the yard, at six or seven o'clock in the morning, as if he was out of his mind, raving - he appeared to be in a deep study, and then he would shake his hands and stamp his feet - there was no apparent cause for that; I saw nothing to provoke his anger - I have observed him do this several times; I concluded he was of unsound mind.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Your premises are separated by a fence? A. Yes, and there is one house between his and mine.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA WHITNEY. I live at Bermondsey. I have known the prisoner nine or ten months - I lived within one house of him; I have seen him behave extremely curious in many instances, and believe him of unsound mind - he has come into my shop three or four times within an hour, and laid out 6d. or a 1s. in children's sweetmeats, or toys, and he would take and throw them on his parlour floor; I consider no rational man would do that - I sent them home by my little girl, and they were sent back again; he has thrown them down on the floor, but not in my presence - I understand so, because his wife would not take them in; I have been probably an hour or an hour and a half with him, at his house or my house, and three or four times in public-houses - he repeatedly mentioned Mr. Mellish's name, and as soon as his name has been mentioned; he has been shaking, and said Mr. Mellish had not only robbed him of his money, but of his honour and character, so that he could not get another ship - from these instances I should say he is not in his right mind; he has been perfectly sober on these occasions - I have seen him in liquor, but more frequently quite sober than drunk.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Can you mention any circumstance except hearing him speak of Mr. Mellish violently, to induce you to believe him out of his mind? A.Certainly; I have seen him act very imprudently to men at work on the road before his own door - he treated them very profusely with liquor; he took them in, gave them brandy, and sent for half-and-half for them, and gave a boy 2d. or 3d. to go a few yards to fetch it for them.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM JORDAN. I live at Spa-road, Bermondsey. I live about sixty yards from where the prisoner lived - I have not seen much of him; I have seen him occasionlly, generally at the public-house which I go to take my lunch at; I have met him occasionally at a public-house about eleven o'clock in the morning - I have seen him mostly sober there; I considered he acted sometimes rather flighty, and was easily turned either to generosity or anger - I was out with him one day at the time they were canvassing; he had a pistol with him, and offered to sell it to me (he behaved like a man that was a little bit frightened) - I said I did not want such a thing; he might have had a glass of grog at the time - I think it was like a man deranged his exposing the pistol.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q.How long ago was this? A. It was the day they were canvassing for Mr. Beanclerk - I think in February; they were going down to the Royal Oak in carriages - I was not canvassing.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you think his mind unsound? A. The generality of his conduct was flighty - he was easily led either to anger or affection; I can give you no further instances of it - one night after that he was snapping his pistol in the faces of the people at the door; it was not loaded; it was to make a report to please the children - it was a percussion pistol; he was rather silly than otherwise - he put the pistol into his pocket.</p>

            . I am a coal-merchant, and live at Rotherhithe. I have known the prisoner about twelve months - I have had opportunities of observing his conduct and manner, and think him of unsound mind; on the evening of the 8th of February last, the Friday week previous to this, when I entered the room at the Europa inn, he was sitting in a sort of sleepy posture, as if dozing - on his left-hand side was Captain Corner, and on the other side was Captain Lawson - Corner aroused him, and he immediately started up, and said he did not know there was a d-d blackguard in the room; nobody answered him for some time, till at last Mr.

             got up, and remonstrated with him on the violence of his conduct, and after his advice he instantly sat himself down, and put<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110076"/>himself in the same position as if to doze; Captain Lawson began a conversation about a sermon preached at church, and all of a sudden he jumped up, and said, "Captain Lawson, who sits there, is a d-d rascal." and then he looked completely insane; there is a gentleman in Court, who, at the request of us, took him under his arms, and drew him out of the room, as we did not consider him safe; this was between nine and ten o'clock in the evening - I do not think he was drunk; I have learned that he had brandished a pistol once before, and I consider if he had had a pistol at that moment no man's life would have been safe.</p>

The prisoner applied to me about three years since, to assist him in some law matters - his affair with Mr. Mellish was part of what he wanted advice about; he attended my office frequently on the subject; I knew him before that - on the former voyage he appeared a very different man to what he did on his return from that voyage; he was quite an altered man; I acted on his instructions for a certain time on the subject of suing Mr. Mellish - there was other business; there were actions brought against him by different seamen - the business was rather complicated; I considered the man on his return in a very excited state - I ultimately refused to act for him; a tender was made by Mr. Mellish; I thought it reasonable, and advised him to accept it - he refused; I stated my reasons in writing, and declined to act for him - it was plain that the advice I gave him was right, but he treated me as if I was misleading him; ten actions were brought against him by the seamen - I could have settled all those for 60l. - he refused that, and if they had gone on he must have been ruined; I told him I considered I had not advised him right; and I had brought about the arrangements with Mr. Mellish, which was through the friendly interference of Mr. Rotch; he behaved to me with gratitude on the former voyage, and made me a present; about a week before this transaction he met me on 'Change, and said, "What do you mean? why do you not get me a character from Mr. Mellish?" I said, "Have you sent to Mr. Mellish for a character?" he said, "Oh no, he has taken away my character, and I don't care about it;" he spoke in a wild incoherent manner; I said, "Mr. Mellish is only bound to give a fair answer to your character while in his employ;" he went on with wild ejaculations and I left him - he said, "Mr. Mellish has taken away my character, and you ought to have got me one;" after I wrote the letter to him I had no further intercourse with him, except meeting him occasionally - I consider, and I thought then, that his head was in a state of disorder and derangement.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.When you saw him on 'Change he had wit enough to know you were his attorney against Mr. Mellish? A. I have mentioned his words; I certainly consider he referred to me as such - when he settled with Mr. Mellish he brought the cheque to me, settled his account, and by my advice invested the rest in stock; I consider he was mad in not taking my advice in the different actions against him - when I gave him that advice he would frequently clench his fist, stare wildly, pace about the room, and appear any thing but a rational being; I knew some of his friends; he had no relatives in this country, or I should have advised a distringas on his property in the Bank.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to a Magistrate and state your opinion of him? A. If I had I expect I should have been laughed at, for, according to my opinion of the laws of insanity, I had no right to do so; he never threatened Mr. Mellish or any body in my presence; I heard he had spoken angrily about me, and previously he was full of gratitude; I have repeatedly seen him staring about the street; all the while he attended on me about Mr. Mellish's business I thought it was the effect of excitement; but after that was closed I thought him not rational; it was after the settlement that I declined to act for him.</p>
               <p>MR. GILBERT McMURDO. I am surgeon of the gaol. I have been in the habit of seeing a good many cases of lunacy; I saw the prisoner either the second or third day after he came into the gaol - I saw him at Giltspur-street on the second or third day after the transaction; I have had almost daily conversation with him - I have taken pains continually to observe him, thinking it probable I might be asked my opinion; I have no knowledge of any symptom which he has exhibited to make me come to the conclusion of his being of unsound mind.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT ANDREWS. Q.How often have you seen him? A.Very nearly daily; there has generally been some other persons present - the wardsman and four or five who reside in the same ward; they were generally present, so as to hear what I said to him; I have been with him half an hour and three quariers of an hour at a time; I was told it would be likely I should be wanted, by the Lord Mayor - I was not subpoenaed to-day, but was told very likely I should be wanted; the Lord Mayor did not desire me to be here to-day; the Clerk of arraigns told me it was very likely I should be wanted, and I had better be in attendance; on one occasion the Lord Mayor met me, and said, "Mind you see that prisoner, for it is very likely we shall want your evidence" - I cannot answer whether that was the day he had been examining the prisoner.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. You are employed by the Corporation? A. Yes; I go to the Compter daily to see the prisoners - the persons with the prisoner have been always perfectly silent when I was conversing with him; my object was entirely to ascertain whether he was of sound mind or not.</p>

From information, I accompanied Cope and Forrester to the prisoner's house, Duke-street, Aldgate - Forrester went in first, Mr. Cope and I followed; we had agreed on a signal, which he made, and Cope and I went in - the prisoner was asked if he had any Greek paper, (meaning paper with Greek characters on it); he said he had none - in the meantime his stock, which laid on the counter, was turned over, and we found about a quire of a Greek Testament; we searched about, and found about two reams of the same sort, about forty quires; he was asked where he got it, and he said he bought it of a man named Griffin, who lived at a bellows-maker's in Holborn; we searched for Griffin, and found he lived at a clock-maker's - there was no bellows-maker in Holborn; he was not at home when we went</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Did he give you such a direction as led you to the clock-maker's to inquire for Griffin? A. Yes - after a great deal of search Forrester found him; if a work hangs on hand the booksellers sometimes sell it as waste - we took stock on the 1st of March; I suppose the works missing would nearly fill two waggons; we had not taken stock in Water-lane for six years - the Delphin Classics have been printed about twelve years - the Greek Septuagint was printed in 1829. and the Testament about two years ago; I cannot say at how many periods this property may have been taken - the prisoner is a retailer of waste-paper - it is a regular shop, and has"Dealer in waste paper" written over the door; one quire of our paper was on the counter, and the rest on the shelves in the shop - he made no difficulty about our searching; I asked if he had any Greek waste-paper - he said No; the quire on the counter did not lay uppermost - waste-paper is bought in the bulk, which often consists of different works, but we never sell any wastepaper.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Could he have a quire of loose paper on the counter without knowing it was Greek? A. Certainly not; I am sure he said he bought that of Griffin - we never sold any of it; it is usual in the trade to call paper with Greek printing Greek paper.</p>
               <p>DANIEL FORRESTER. I am a City officer. I accompanied Mr. Folthorpe, and Cope to the prisoner's house; I asked if he had any clean newspapers - he said, No; I asked if he had any waste demy - he said he had not; I did not hear him asked about the Greek paper - I was not near enough to the counter; I searched and found a quantity of paper claimed by Mr. Folthorpe, which I produce, this is all that was found at the house, except one sheet, which I produce.</p>
               <p>MR. FOLTHORPE re-examined. The paper was mixed up; they are all of the same book - this is all the paper that was found; this is a sheet of another sort, the first latin exercises - all the rest is Greek; here are about two reams.</p>
               <p>DANIEL FORRESTER. I went to Mr. Henman, fishmonger, Bow-lane, the same day, and found some paper that Mr. Folthorpe identified - I did not go any where else; I found about a ream at Henman's - I took the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Has not the prisoner a hesitating mumbling manner of answering questions? A. Yes, I believe he has; it appears to be his manner.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Mumbling or not, did you understand his answers? A. Yes, many of them.</p>
               <p>MR. FOLTHROPE. This paper found afterwards is part of the Delphin Classics.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL GRIFFIN. I am a labourer in the East India warehouse, Crutched-friars - I lodge at a clock-makers in Holborn. I have sold paper to the prisoner - I did not sell him this paper; I never saw it till it was produced at the Mansion-house - I have sold to him paper, two, three or four times; there was a parcel of printed paper which I bought of Mr. McLean, in the Hay-market, but that was all English printed characters.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What paper did you sell him? A. I sold him about 8 cwt. of coach way bills, which I bought of Bumpus, in Holborn, and about 2 cwt. of English printed paper - I looked through the whole of it; paper is sold sometimes in bundles, but I looked through the lot I sold him, and do not think such characters as these could pass my eyes without being seen - I used not to open every sheet I bought, but was always particular where I bought it: I may not open paper sometimes, but I did in this case - I should examine to see the quality of the paper; what I sold him was plain English characters; I am employed in the East India-house in the early part of the day, and deal with several persons; I never deal in Petticoat-lane - what printed paper I sold the prisoner. I bought of Mr. McLean; I have dealt with the prisoner three or four times - there was no Greek characters in any that I sold him; I never said I had sold him paper consisting of different works - I am not a Greek characters in any that I sold him; I never said I had sold him paper consisting of different works - I am not a Greek scholar.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you particularly examine the paper you sold the prisoner? A. Yes, as to quality and the character of the print.</p>
               <p>DIGHTON MOTT. I am a poulterer in Leadenhall-market. On the 16th of February some paper was ordered of the prisoner, and sent in; I saw him write this receipt, and paid him for the paper, and here is five quires of the paper which I bought of him - there was originally a ream of it; we used the rest in our business - I never looked at the works; I gave him 9s. a ream - it is Latin</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The last item of this bill refers to the lot you have produced? A. Yes, I have dealt with him for six months - very few in our line buy paper in reams; we buy small quantities - I took very little notice of it, and had no conception of the value; he used to sell small parcels of paper in the market, and had a stall there for paper.</p>
               <p>EDWARD HENMAN. I am a fishmonger, and live in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110078"/>Bow-lane. About Christmas I bought some paper of the prisoner, which the officer has produced; it was Latin - I have one sheet and a half of Greek, which is all I had left; I bought three or four reams of Greek, or there might be only three reams of Greek, or two reams, but it is all used I am certain - I bought two reams of Greek, and the last four reams of the Latin; I paid him 9s. a ream.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESLEY. Q.Is this Greek or Latin? A.Latin; I think there are some Greek characters in the notes, and at the head of them - I attend Billingsgate; the prisoner occasionally comes into the market and sells publicly there - he brought this paper to me.</p>

               <p>MR. FOLTHORPE. Both these parcels of paper are Mr. Valpy's - I know nothing of Griffin; this paper was never sold from our warehouse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I buy paper by weight, without examining the print - I did not know that I had any that was improperly come by; I gave the value for it - it cannot be supposed I have a capital to buy such a quantity as Mr. Valpy lost; it must have gone somewhere else.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q.Are you quite sure you delivered a good sixpence to her with the bad one which she gave you? A. I gave it out of my till; I will not be positive it was a good one - I cannot be certain whether that was the one she detained or another.</p>

               <p>MARY JONES. I am servant to Mrs. Wood. I went outside the counter to look for the good sixpence, and saw a sixpence between Lamb's fingers; I said, "You have it between your fingers?" she said No - she put her hand behind her, and dropped it, Mr. Wood picked it up; they were all three together at the time - master took the sixpence up, and gave it to Lightfoot.</p>
               <p>Lamb. She was not there at all, nor was her master. Witness. I am sure we were there - and that I saw the sixpence between her fingers, and saw her drop it.</p>

               <p>THOMAS LIGHTFOOT. I apprehended the prisoners, and received the sixpence from Mrs. Wood, and another from Mr. Wood; I got a sixpence from Mason - they are all marked differently; I know one from the other - I asked the prisoners to turn their pockets out, and Mrs. Wood to search them, but she declined it; Lamb had 2d. and 4d.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110079"/>in halfpence, Walker had 1d. piece, and Deaton had two pieces of mutton - I found no sixpence on any of them.</p>
               <p>JOHN FIELD. I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint. I have examined this money - the sixpence produced by Mason is counterfeit; the other two are likewise counterfeits, and I believe all three were cast in the same mould.</p>

             a sixpence, which she refused - I took it, and threw it on the floor; Deaton said, "Don't be foolish, don't throw it away, give it her again if she asks to see it" - I said, "No, if it is bad, let it go;" she called her husband down, and said I had given her a bad sixpence - he said, "Perhaps you have been taking more;" she said No, but looked in the till and found another - he said, "Who gave you that?" she said,"That woman," pointing to Deaton; he said, "Where is the money you offered?" I said, "There it is" - he stooped down and took it up.</p>
               <p>Deaton's Defence. Mrs. Wood refused the sixpence, and it was thrown away; she said, "I will show you the difference," and opened the till - Mr. Wood was called down; Mrs. Wood said she was a better judge of money than to have taken a bad one.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MARSHALL. I live in Aldersgate-street. At a quarter past seven o'clock in the morning of the 28th of February. I was in <placeName id="t18330411-150-crimeloc841">Holborn</placeName>

               <p>GEORGE ROOKE. I live in Goswell-street. I was standing in Brook-street, Holborn; I saw the prisoner and another young man following the prosecutor and another gentleman - I saw the prosecutor cross Brook-street, and as he got on the foot pavement on the other side, I saw the prisoner take out his pocket-handkerchief; I was about four yards from him, and am quite sure he took it, but I did not see what he did with it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How long had they followed the prosecutor? A. I only saw them at the corner of Brook-street; I am quite sure the prisoner drew it - his companion started off immediately I think, for as soon as it was done I missed him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did you not state that you were in a shop? A. No, I was outside the shop window; I had no idea who you was till I saw the deed committed - I did not state that I went into a shop and said I was determined to follow you; you were so near to the prosecutor it was almost impossible for me to tell the colour of the handkerchief - I went and asked the prosecutor if he knew the prisoner; he said No - I said "Look into your pocket, your handkerchief is missing;" he put his hand into his pocket, and his handkerchief was gone - I said, "That is the thief."</p>
               <p>CHARLES HART. I was in company with the prosecutor; I had seen his handkerchief in his pocket a few minutes before it was taken - the skirts of his coat were very narrow, and it was easily perceptible; I saw no one with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>CHARLES WILDING (Police-constable E 125). I took the prisoner; I found only two duplicates on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There was no one with me; I had my hands in my breeches pockets from Holborn-bridge up to that place - I said I was willing to be searched if they took me to a proper place, but I would not be searched in the street; I am quite innocent of the robbery.</p>
               <p>GEORGE ROOKE re-examined. Q. What kind of person was it who was with the prisoner? A. I fixed my eyes so much on the prisoner that I did not notice the other; they were walking side by side as near as possible - they were almost treading on the prosecutor's heels; it was their manner that drew my attention.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Do you think the prisoner might have handed it to his companion without your seeing him? A. He might; I lost sight of his companion immediately he took the handkerchief - I am quite confident the prisoner is the person who took it.</p>

On the evening of the 2nd of March the prisoner came to the shop, and asked to look at some bonnet ribbons; I placed two drawers of ribbons before her - she bought two yards and a half, which came to 3s. 6 1/2d.; she gave me 3s. 6d. - while serving her I observed her take a piece out and place it on the counter, and her handkerchief over it; when she went out my master followed her, and I followed her at the same time - when she was returning with Mr. Evans I saw the ribbon drop from under her cloak, between the shop and the street; Mr. Evans desired her to pick it up and bring it in, which she did - it was about four yards from where I served her, and a door was be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110080"/>tween us; she had gone out as far as the end of the window - she had a cloak on; she had no bundle - she could not have swept it off with her handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.This might have been a mistake? A. No, Sir; I had served her before - the value of what she stole is about 1l. or 25s.</p>
               <p>GEORGE EVANS. I keep this shop. In consequence of what the last witness said I followed the prisoner out; she had got four or five yards from the door, and was just turning round the corner into Grafton-street - I saw the ribbon drop as she was returning into the shop, in the door-way; she said she did not know that she had it - I lieve it must have been dropped from her pocket handkerchief; the ribbon she had bought was in paper, in her hand - her cloak had a large open sleeve; I am sure it fell from under her cloak; I desired the officer to take it.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MOORE (Police-constable E 16). I received charge of the prisoner - I produce the ribbon, which I received from Mr. Evans.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that the shopman had been joking with her while serving her, and that he must have rolled the ribbon up with what she purchased by mistake - that the paper had unfolded when the prosecutor had accosted her, and the ribbon must have fallen out.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM THOMAS. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Wise, the deputy clerk of the peace, at Maidstone; I was present at Maidstone last July, and know the prisoner is the person who was tried there.</p>

Thomas Fordham is my brother; I know the other two prisoners by sight- there is a hole where the coals are shot at Mr. Cox's; I do not recollect seeing Isaacs, the prisoner, do any thing at the hole, but I saw him put some shoes into a bag - my brother was on the step of my father's door; Isaacs then went away alone - I did not see any one assist him to put them into the bag; I saw some shoes on the counter when I came down stairs the next morning, and my brother said, that George Gilbert had brought them, and I might do what I liked with them - I pawned them at Tilley's.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Now let me remind you, that you were examined before the Magistrate - do you mean to swear you saw nobody go into that hole? A. No, I did not.</p>

On the morning of the 21st of February, the prisoner came and bought a shawl, and as she was going out, I asked how many shawls she had got - she said two; I asked her to produce them - she produced the one she had bought of me; I asked her if she had not got a red one - she then took a gown from under her arm, and in it was a red shawl, which she said she bought of Mr. Ward, where she bought the gown, which Mr. Ward would prove; she had bought a light shawl of me.</p>
               <p>MARY TAYLOR. I was in the prosecutor's shop. I saw the shawl under the prisoner's arm, and told Sizer.</p>
               <p>JOHN NICHOLSON (Police-constable K 38). The prisoner was given into my custody; I received the shawl from Sizer.</p>
               <p>JAMES SIZER re-examined. It was folded up in the gown; I did not perceive the gown till afterwards, but I had turned my back twice towards the prisoner - it is worth 1s. 6d., and I think the one she bought was 5s.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that Taylor had been fumbling about the gown, which was on the counter, and must have put the shawl into it.</p>

            . I am a lance corporal in the East India company's service - I went into their service directly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110083"/>after I came back from Portsmouth, where I went after I gave evidence in this Court; I had been convicted of another offence, and got my pardon. On the 5th of July last I was at the Bank public-house, about ten o'clock in the morning; I saw Grimbley and Smith there, and agreed with them to go out and pick pockets - we picked Mr. Holmes's pocket near Berkeley-square; Smith took from him a red morocco pocket-book - I saw in about five minutes what it contained, there was one 100l. note, four 5l. notes, one 20l. note, and a silver pencil-case; we took a coach in Davis-street, and went to the Bank public-house: the pocket-book was destroyed, and we went with the notes to the prisoner's house, in Eagle-street, Holborn - Grimbley did not go; I saw the prisoner, told him I had some notes, and gave them into his hand - I told him we had got them from a gentleman in Berkeley-square; I proposed to sell them to him - he told us to come along with him; he did not say where, and we went with him, but before we went I saw Watts come to the prisoner's door; he was asked what he wanted, and went away; I then went out with Smith and the prisoner - we took a cab in Holborn, and drove over Waterloo-bridge; as we were going along I told the prisoner I had no money, but I would sell him the pencil-case, which I took out of my pocket, and he gave me 2s. for it, which I paid for the cab - we went to the Belvidere-road, where the prisoner's father lived, knocked at the side door, and his father let us in; the prisoner produced the notes, and told his father they were to sell - I think they had remained in his possession from the time I had first shown them to him; his father asked what we wanted for them - I said 100l.; he said he would not give that, but told us to stop a bit, which we did - he put the notes into his waistcoat pocket, and went out; he then returned, called us up stairs, and said he would give 90l. for them, which was agreed to - he went to a large chest, and took out a bag of sovereigns and some notes; he then came down into the parlour, counted out thirty sovereigns, and gave us three 20l. notes - I said the notes were no good to us, as we wanted it all in gold; he said he had lately taken all his gold to the Bank, and got notes for it - the prisoner then said he had ten sovereigns in his pocket - he would give us that, and go with us and get the notes changed at the Bank - the prisoner got a pen and ink, and wrote his name and address on the top of the notes which his father gave us; we then took a coach, went to the Bank, and got gold for the notes - the prisoner took ten sovereigns, and gave us the other fifty.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. This was not the first time you had been out? A. No - I was taken for a robbery in St. Martin's-lane; I was taken up for receiving some knives - I was looking at them, and was taken; I was not taken for stealing a purse - a person named Stevens stole it, and I had the duplicate of it on me; I was taken for a pocket handkerchief about three months afterwards; I did not say at the last trial, that it was between five and six weeks after; I was sent on board the hulks before the last trial, but I was not pardoned on condition of giving evidence against Guest; Mr. Thomas and Mr. Higgins called on me, but no promise or inducement was held out to me - I voluatarily told them all about it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did not Higgins tell you, that he dare to say, Mr. Stafford would get you a pardon? A. No Sir, I do not remember it, not till after I made my statement.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. Do you mean to say, that at the time you got into the cab, nothing had been said about where you were going? A. No, Sir, no further than over the water.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear last time, that before you got into the cab, you were told by the prisoner to come along with him, and he would take you to his father, who would sell the notes? A. I do not remember it: he told us he was going over the water; I do not remember more than that; I do not recollect his saying he would take us to his father's, and sell the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say at the last trial, that you asked 120l. for the notes? A. I might have said so, my recollection is bad in that; I have not talked over this subject since last Session - I had sailed before this trial; I had known the prisoner before that time; I always understood he lived in that house, and occupied the shop and parlour; I told him how I got the notes; I made the contract with Guest's father; I put the pocket-book into the fire at Mr. Page's - Grimbley and Smith were present; I gave the notes to the prisoner - I cannot say whether they were returned or not - they might be returned to me, but they were not to Smith; the prisoner's father might have asked him if he had any money which he could lend him when he pulled out the ten sovereigns; the prisoner was present all the time we were there.</p>
               <p>THOMAS KNOX HOLMES. I live at No. 10, Grafton-street, Bond-street. On the 5th of July, I went out with a pocket-book, containing 100l. Bank note, two 20l. notes, a 10l. note, and some others, and a pencil-case, which I could swear to - they were stolen from me - I have seen the pencil-case.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Was there any mark on any of the notes? A. Yes, on 125l. of them, which I had received for a cheque, but I had other notes in my book; this is the pencil-case which was in the book, and was taken from me that day - it had been repaired a few days before; there was a seal on, it which had my crest - the head had become unsoldered, and I took it to be mended.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH HENRY LLOYD. I am a silversmith, and live in the Strand. I repaired this pencil-case for the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>GEORGE DYER. I am a clerk in the Bank. I have the three notes for 20l., which were brought on the 5th of July, by some person who had sovereigns for them; the name of 
               <persName id="t18330411-162-person1172">W. </persName>
            Guest, No. 42, Eagle-street, is on each of them.</p>
               <p>JOHN KENNEDY. These are the notes on which the prisoner wrote his name.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen him write before? A. Yes, in his own place; I was very often there - I do not know whether I stated so at the last trial; I can swear I was present when he wrote these words on these notes, at the table at his father's.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH HIGGINS (Police-constable F 35). I believe this writing to be the prisoner's - I have seen him write; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110084"/>saw him once making out a bill respecting a watch at the Bank public-house - it might be six months before this transaction, and I saw him write once at the Black Horse, and I have a letter in my pocket which came from him, I believe, but it was anonymous; I should take these notes to be nearly new - I saw Adamson find this pencil-case on the prisoner's father.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Then you saw the prisoner write on two occasions? A. Yes; I had no particular reason for taking notice of his writing, but it is curious to see thieves write - I stated here at the last trial, that I had charged a respectable person as being a suspicious character, and apologised to him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What quantity of writing did you see of the prisoner's? A. It was respecting a watch; it appeared as if he was making a bill - that was at the Bank; I do not recollect what he was writing about at the Black Horse - he did not write his name on either of these occasions; this W is what I can speak to.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am entirely innocent.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM LOCKE. I live at No. 15, Featherstone-street. On the evening of the 20th of February I saw the prisoner go into the prosecutor's shop, take the desk, put it on his head, and walk out - I asked the prosecutor's wife if she had sold it; she said, No - I then took the prisoner, and brought him back; he said, "What am I to do? I must live some how."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is false to say I went into the shop; a man told me to carry it.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN ROBERTS (Police-constable G 223). I took the prisoner, and have the desk.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WHITLEY. This is my desk; it was safe in my shop that day.</p>

               <p>JAMES CHAMBERS (Police-constable G 176). On the morning of the 13th of March I was in company with Collins in Tabernacle-walk - we met the prisoner with a stove on his shoulder, which we saw had been fresh pulled out; we followed him, and asked where he got it - he said from a house down the street, that a man gave it him to carry to Old-street, but the man was gone; we took him, and on inquiry we found an empty house with the door open - we went in, and missed a stove from there.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN COLLINS (Police-constable G 217). I was with Chambers - I went to the house in <placeName id="t18330411-166-crimeloc926">City-terrace, Old-street-road</placeName>

               <p>JOSEPH DELL. I live in John-street, Borough, and am employed by Mr. Thomas Letts, to superintend the repairs of his houses - he has a house at No. 11, City-terrace; I have seen this stove fitted there, and it fits exactly - it is the same pattern; Mr. Letts lives in the Wandsworth-road.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. A person in Tabernacle-walk asked me to carry it for him, and said he would give me sixpence.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM PICKARD (Police-constable E 65). I searched the prisoner and found nothing on her - the other person had 2s. 11 1/2d.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not have them - I was only waiting while she looked at the handkerchiefs; she said she wanted a red one, and there was none but of a very old pattern - I did not throw these down; the shopman held both my arms tight.</p>
               <p>THOMAS COLSTON. I took hold of her arms, but she slipped one of her hands away, took the handkerchiefs, and threw them down.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character, and her former mistress promised to employ her.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. He stated before the Magistrate that I went to it six or seven times. Witness. No, I said you carried it twenty or thirty yards; he did not give me time to take him before he threw it down; a shopkeeper picked it up, and I pursued the prisoner - he was taken in George-gardens, nearly a quarter of a mile off.</p>

               <p>JAMES HALES. I am a cheesemonger, and live in Bethnal-green-road. I heard a noise, ran out, and saw this table in the middle of the road; I took it into our shop - I saw the officer running after a man; I cannot say who.</p>
               <p>HENRY DELLER (Police-constable K 200). On the evening of the 27th of March I was in Bethnal-green-road, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner running, pursued him, and took him in George-gardens; I was within ten yards of him during the whole pursuit - I cannot tell whether he fell, as the place was dark in George-gardens - I had lost sight of him in turning the corner; he was out of breath - he said he would come with me, and that he had been nicely knocked about; I suppose he meant that he had fallen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You told the Magistrate you did not know whether I stopped, or any person stopped me. Witness. You were up when I came to you; I cannot say who stopped you - I think you had been stopped by some one.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner go from his house at Hammersmith, on Sunday, the 24th of February, about eight o'clock in the morning; he went to the pig-stye in the yard, with something concealed under his coat - I saw him come from the pig-stye again, apparently with nothing; I saw Mr. Reynolds take the mutton from the stye about four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How long have you known him? A. About three months; this is a common yard to seven or eight houses - the stye is about twenty yards from the house I live in; I know Goddard, but I did not see him with any meat - I am married, but my husband does not live with me; I get my living by shoe-binding - I have never been in custody for robbing my master.</p>
               <p>JOHN REYNOLDS (Police-constable T 1). I produce the meat; I got part of it out of the prisoner's pig-stye - I then searched his house, and saw the mark of a chisel on the boards, as if they had been raised with it; I found this chisel in the room - I raised the boards, and found the other piece of meat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was this? A. On the Sunday afternoon; I had been there in the morning, and found the prisoner and some children - the prisoner was about the yard; he asked me if I wanted a hammer, and I said Yes - and he brought me one; I did not search the pig-stye then, but I did the privy and some of the houses in the yard; I went up stairs to search the prisoner's house, and found some little bits of suet there - he said it was some tallow he had dropped from his candle the night before; I then went away, but was not satisfied; I went again, and found the meat as I have described, in the pig-stye - any person might go to the pig-stye; it is in a public court.</p>

I lost an iron column from a passage opposite my house - I had seen it safe two days before the 23rd of March, when I missed it; I found the prisoner and four other men offering it for sale in Cowcross-street - I could not get any assistance to take them, so I went and asked them if it was for sale; the prisoner said Yes, and asked me 1l. for it; I told them I would give them 15s. if they would take it to the end of the street - the man at the shop then came out, and asked me if it was mine; I said it was - the other men<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110086"/>then said the prisoner had employed them, and they walked off - I took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not ask any price for it; I said these are the men that brought it - ask them. Witness. Yes, he asked me 1l. for it; he did not say the other men had brought it - it was laying down; the men were all in one party, and I suppose a quarter of a mile from my house.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH COALES. I keep a smith's shop in Clerkenwell. On the 23rd of March the prisoner and four other men brought an iron column to sell; the prisoner said, "Mr. Coales, will you buy this piece of iron" - I said, "Where did you get it?" he said he was digging, and a person gave it him - I asked one of the others where they got it, and he said he did not know; I declined buying it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM COSTELLO. I live at Hatton-wall. I saw the prisoner and the other men take the column from opposite our house, in the yard; I asked him where he was going to take it - he said his master had sent him for it; they took it down Hatton-garden - I went and told the prosecutor; I am sure the prisoner is one of the men.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Peter-street; I was pretty groggy after my day's work, and I met four men in Ray-street with this iron - I said, "You have got a heavy load;" "Yes, (said one of them,) do you know where we could sell it" - "No, (says I) but perhaps Mr. Coales would buy it, come and ask him;" I went and asked him - I walked round and left the men with it; this gentleman then came up, and said "Is this for sale?" "I do not know (says I) but there are the persons who belong to it."</p>

On the 1st of March the three prisoners and another man came into the shop, about four o'clock- the person not in custody asked to see some silk waistcoating; I showed him our pattern-book, but he said he must see them in pieces, he could not tell from the patterns - I got down several pieces of silk, and showed them to them all four - when they had looked at them, one of the prisoners asked me if I had not a silk like the one which John Sherman had on - I showed them the nearest we had to it; the person not in custody picked out two, and asked me to give him patterns of them, and deposited a shilling, saying he would send his lady - and then they all left the shop; as soon as they were gone Mr. Wild told me to look over the silks, which I did, and missed five yards of waistcoating of the pattern I have in my hand - three of us immediately went out in pursuit of the prisoners, but could not find them; I returned home, and missed another piece of seven yards and a half - the value of the first was 1l. 18s. 9d., and the other 3l. 7s. 6d. - I have seen them both since.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA CLEMENTS. I am warehouseman to Mr. Wild. I saw the three prisoners and a man not in custody come to the shop - the last witness showed them some silks, as I was engaged; they went out together, and in consequence of what I afterwards heard, I went in search of them - I went into several streets, and at last I saw the two female prisoners at the end of Poland-street - they crossed into Oxford-street; I passed them, and while I was considering the best means of taking them, they saw me stop - they ran into a public-house, and went through the house: I went in and asked the landlord if there was any way out at the back - he said No; I sent for an officer, who came and found these two pieces of silk in the privy - they are my master's.</p>
               <p>JOHN HARDY (Police-constable C 149) I was sent for to the public-house - I went to the privy, and found the two females there; I desired them to come out, which, after a little while, they did - I searched the privy, and found these two pieces of silk on the soil.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA FREDERICK CLEMENTS. I am an inspector of the Police. John Sherman came to the station to see the females, and I took him.</p>

I am the wife of this prisoner - I was married to him in St. Luke's church, and the certificate can be obtained there; I met Turner in Oxford-street - she asked me to go with her a little way; she was taken ill, and we went into this house - while we were there there came a knock at the door; we opened it, and the Policeman was there, with the prosecutor - he said he should not have suspected us if we had not gone in there; my husband was not in company with me the whole day.</p>

I went with Allen to sell some things; I went to a lady's house, and when I came back I saw Allen with half a dozen plates in her hand against the lodge - I said, "Don't take them:" I put them back, and said I would have nothing to do with them - she then took and wiped them, and took them into a shop, but the people would not have them - she then gave them to me to hold, and as she did not come, I gave them to Gibbs to hold - I am quite innocent.</p>
               <p>Allen. I am quite innocent.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You did not miss any of these till Dr. Dewsnap's groom brought you a bridle? A. No; it was my father's business once, but he has left it three or four years; there was a person named Bottle in our service, but I do not know what has become of him, that I can confidently swear - I did not take him any where.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a clergyman seeing you and him together at Margate? A. Mr. Bottle came down to Margate unknown to me, while I was there for a week - he was married in May last, and he was turned away from our service in September - it was in July that he came down to Margate - his wife was not with him there; I believe she was at home - my father and mother were not with me; Bottle knew where I was; he came down on Saturday, and staid till the Sunday evening; I never told a person named Goodlad, that if the prisoner had not set up in business at Hammersmith, I would not only not have interfered with him, but I would have given him a good character for honesty; I said, if he had left quietly, I might not have interfered with him, if he had not interfered with my business - I did not discharge him for any fault.</p>
               <p>GEORGE KENNEY. I am a tailor. I have been in the habit of making clothes for the prisoner; I made him a suit of black - he paid me a sovereign, and I received a chaise harness in payment of the rest - I have no doubt this is the harness; he said if I could get a customer for it it would be serving him - this was in August last.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did you do with it? A. I went to Dr. Dewsnap, to see if it would do for his horse; it was to be 4l. - the prisoner occupied a room, and worked as a harness-maker; Dr. Dewsnap dealt with the prosecutrix, and the prisoner must know that any thing he sold him the prosecutrix would have any opportunity of seeing; the harness was not quite finished when I made the clothes - he did not desire me to conceal it.</p>
               <p>NICHOLAS SALMON (Police-constable T 96). I produce the harness; I found the reins, the bit, and the traces at Mr. Heady's, where the prisoner lodges; the traces are not finished - they are lined with brown leather.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I made the traces at my own lodging.</p>

               <p>JAMES COVEY. I know I made this collar. I do not know for whom; I am a master for myself - I make six hundred in the course of a year, and sell them to saddlers.</p>
               <p>Witness for the Defence.</p>
               <p>CHARLES LINDERGREEN. I sold a pair of winkers to the prisoner, similar to these; I saw the prosecutrix on this business - she said if the prisoner had left Hammersmith she would not have interfered with him, and given him a good character; it is impossible for a person to speak to these traces - I could cut fifty strips out of one hide; these ornaments are as common as can be.</p>

I received this letter by the post on the 22nd of February, and on the 14th of March I received this letter (No. 1), and on the 16th I received this by the post(No. 2); it inclosed ten 5l. Bank of England notes - (looking at them) these are the notes; I received the letter about half-past one o'clock at noon, and marked the notes in the evening - I have written my own name at the back of them; in consequence of the receipt of these notes, I went to the bankers in about ten minutes after receiving them from the postman, and I ascertained that they were forged - I went to Mr. Aberdein, a solicitor in Honiton, within a quarter of an hour after receiving the letter; I went to him in consequence of seeing a letter in the postman's hands directed to Miss Cox, who is a lace manufacturer, and I knew Mr. Aberdein was a friend of hers - she herself was at Brighton at the time; I had noticed that the letter was a very similar one to mine- I found the postman in the street, and got him to deliver Miss Cox's letter to Mr. Aberdein, who opened it in my presence (looking at it, No. 3); I have every reason to believe this is it - it was a letter bearing that appearance; I did not take it in my hands - it enclosed eight 5l., and one 10l. Bank notes; I made no mark on those notes - Mr. Aberdein and I transmitted the notes in separate letters to Messrs. Freshfield's, the Bank solicitors; I made up a letter the same morning, (and sent it by post, as desired, in the letter I had received,) purporting to be the invoice, addressed to "

Bishopsgate-street, instead of the number of the Bull Inn, as it was going from thence to Norwich - he asked me if I would take it in for him; I asked if there would be any thing to pay for it - he said No, as all his parcels from the country came paid; I then said there would most likely be the porterage, and if I paid any thing would he refund it - he said certainly, and I agreed to take it in; he said he would call in on Monday - on Monday two letters came, directed "Mr.

               <p>REBECCA STONE. I am bar-maid to Mr. Pearce, at the Four Swans. On Tuesday morning, the 19th of March, between nine and ten o'clock, I was in the bar, when one parcel came directed to William Jackson, No. 84, Bishopsgate-street - I gave it to Mr. Pearce; between ten and eleven o'clock the prisoner Coster came in, and asked for a glass of ale; I had seen him before, but did not know his name - he said he expected a person by the Ipswich coach, or he might come by the Bury coach; I told him we had no Ipswich coach until the evening, and the Bury did not call at our house; there was a letter in our bar addressed to Mr. Farmer - it had been there nearly a week; he saw the letter, and asked me if I knew Mr. Farmer - I said I did by sight; he said he had had money from him, and that he had taken a friend of his in, of the name of Jackson, for nearly 200l. - he said if Farmer called again, I might say a person had been there who knew him, and knew of his pawning a watch in St. Maryaxe - but he ought not to have named it, as he was a brother Mason; this was the second time that he came - he staid about a quarter of an hour the first time, and went out into the street, and I saw him standing against a post opposite the door - he could see into the bar from that post, but not into the yard; he came back in about a quarter of an hour, and staid nearly an hour - it was during that time that he had the conversation about Farmer and Jackson; he was standing against the bar at that time; he said he had been in the habit of using the Black Lion, but in future he should use our house - he had a glass of ale the second time that he came: he said Jackson kept a tavern at the west end of the town - I left the bar, and saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. If the Bury coach did not stop at your house, it would be necessary for a person to stop outside to stop it? A. Yes; he went out once - he spoke of Jackson as living at the west end of the town, not in Bishopsgate-street; I have seen Coster bring letters to the postman at our bar, and he has drank sometimes at the bar - the bar is in front of the street - the coach office is up the yard; he could see partly up the yard when he stood in the street, but not into the office.</p>

               <p>JOHN CLIFFORD. I am book-keeper at the Four Swans, Bishopsgate-street. On Tuesday morning, the 19th of March, Mr. Pearce brought these two letters to me, and these two parcels, and directed me to take charge of them till they were called for; he gave me the letters about seven o'clock in the morning, and the parcels came about nine or ten - the prisoner Smith called about two o'clock, and inquired if there was any parcel directed to Mr. W. Jackson; I asked him what part of the country he expected them from - he said from Honiton, in Devonshire; I told him I had two or three parcels for him, and gave him the two parcels and two letters - I told him there was 7s. 4d. to pay for them; he put down 8s. - I said he had given me 6d. too much; I returned him the 6d. and 2d. - there were three or four sixpences among the 8s.; he seemed rather confused, and told the money over two or three times - he then took the parcels and letters, and walked out of the office; he was pursued by Mealey the officer, who had been waiting in the office ever since eight o'clock that morning, and could not be seen by any body.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did Smith appear in rather a bad state of health at the time? A. Yes, I thought he was agitated; he walked out rather quick, at the rate of four miles an hour - I am certain he did not say Mr. Jackson had sent him for the parcels.</p>

               <p>HENRY PEARCE. I keep the Four Swans, Nos. 83 and 84, Bishopsgate-street. These two letters were received there - I did not see them myself till the Monday evening; I had a communication that day with Mr. Cope, in consequence of which Roe was placed, on Tuesday morning, in a room over my gateway, and Mealey in the coach-office - Roe could see the coach-office door, and into the street, from the room he was in; I placed Mealey in the coach-office about half-past seven o'clock - in the course of the day two parcels arrived, one by the Exeter mail, and the other by the Devonport; the Exeter one came first - I took that in myself; Stone took the other in, and gave it to me - I took them each up stairs to Roe, then took them into the coach-office and gave them to the book-keeper, telling him when the person came for them, to ask him where the parcels came from; I was about the tavern, in my business, during the day - my son sent for me when Smith came, as I had desired him, and I went directly to the coach-office, expecting to find Jackson inquiring for his parcels; I did not find him, and I went to my son in the front bar, and learned that he had been there - I went into the street, and then up the gateway into the coach office - he had not been there; I went back to my son again; I went into the street again, and saw Coster on the opposite side of the street, looking up the gateway - I had never seen him before, to my knowledge; I went a little way down the street, and kept sight of him - I saw my brother-in-law on the opposite side of the street, and crossed over to speak to him; I stood talking to him, still keeping Coster in my eye, and Coster walked past me, towards Bishopsgate church, and after getting by me I saw him stoop to look under a hackney-coach - he was on the same side as me; he appeared to be looking at something on the opposite side of the street, and he looked under the next coach - I saw him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110091"/>turn round rather suddenly, after looking the second time under the coach, and run; I then turned round, and saw Mealey, the officer, coming across the street - Coster ran past me; I pursued, and overtook him - I turned round, and saw Roe coming with Smith and the two parcels; I gave Coster to Mealey, and went in a hackney-coach with them to the Mansion-house - when I stopped Coster he appeared to be in a hurry, and said he was going to the booking-office; he did not say what booking-office - when they were in the coach they did not appear to know each other at all; they appeared to be very strange.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. A great many coaches go from Bishopsgate-street? A. Yes, Coster was standing still when I saw him; I did not see him leaning against a post - he was not walking up and down till he passed me; I saw him standing still for two or three minutes - he then walked by me, and looked under two coaches; the prisoners did not speak to each other in the coach - and by that I say they appeared strange.</p>

            . I am a constable of the City. I was at the Four Swans, Bishopsgate-street, about half-past six o'clock in the morning of the 19th of March; I was placed in a room over the gateway, and could see the door of the booking-office - I saw Smith come there about two o'clock in the day; I saw him go into the booking-office, and come out with two brown paper parcels under his arm - I immediately ran down stairs, went out at the front door, and observed Smith going in a direction from Bishopsgate church; I immediately followed him, at a little distance, and observed Coster on the other side of the way, abreast of Smith - I saw Coster turn his head round, look towards me, and then towards Smith; I then observed Smith looking over his right shoulder with his right eye - I immediately ran forwards, and caught hold of Smith, and at that moment Coster turned round and ran away; he being on the other side of the street, I immediately called to Mealey to run and catch him - he did not appear to understand me, and I called out Stop thief! Mr. Pearce brought Coster to me; I knew him before - I cannot say that I knew Smith's person; I put them into a coach and conveyed them to the Mansion-house - Smith gave me the two letter out of his pocket; they had no conversation together in the coach - nothing passed to lead us to suppose they were acquainted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You were not many minutes going to the Mansion-house? A. No - they were on different sides of the street; my eye was on one and then on another - my attention was directed to them both: the street was not particularly crowded them; I knew Coster very well, and know he knew me - I have been an officer seven years; he has nodded to me, and I have been at a house where he has been - there were no coaches except those on the stand, to the best of my knowledge - no coach passed; it was not a minute and a half from the time I came out till I took Smith - I was at the end of the coach-stand when I saw Coster; I saw no coach with four horses pass.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You were stationed over the gateway? A. Yes - it took me a little time to come down stairs; Smith had just turned the gatepost when I got out - I was about ten yards from him; I did not ask him for the letters - he gave them to me at once; he said, "Oh, take them."</p>

               <p>DANIEL MEALEY. I am one of the City Police - I was appointed nine months ago. I was at the Four Swans on Tuesday morning, the 19th of March, in plain clothes; I was in the booking-office, behind a partition; I could not be seen at the counter - I heard Smith come and ask if they had not a parcel left there in the name of Jackson - I looked round, and saw him go out with the parcels; I followed him about twenty yards - he was afterwards taken by Roe, who pointed on the other side of the way; I looked over, and saw nobody in particular running, as there was a coach-stand - I saw Coster with Mr. Pearce; I ran and took him from Pearce; he was put into a coach.(Letters read).</p>

            . I am a jeweller. I know both the prisoners - I first knew them in 1819; Smith was in the Fleet prison at that time; and about a month afterwards he came out of the Fleet; and I saw him in Coster's place in Staining-lane, and at Bridgewater-square also; Coster was then carrying on business in the name of Coates and Co. - Smith used to be there, writing letters for him; I knew them until the beginning of 1820: I became acquainted with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110092"/>the hand-writing of both of them - this letter (No. 4) is in the hand-writing of Smith; they called themselves factors - I do not know whether Smith was a partner; Coster's private house was in Bridgewater-square - I have seen Smith there also, as well as at the counting-house; (looking at another letter No. 6) this is Smith's hand-writing, it is my belief; I have not the least doubt of it; (looking at the three letters Nos. 1, 2 and 3) these are in a hand-writing which I have seen Coster write many times, when he has not signed his own name to them; I have not a doubt of their being his hand-writing - (looking at a letter to Mrs. Cox, No. 5,) that is Coster's hand-writing, in which he used to write.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where is your jeweller's shop? A. In Ray-street, Clerkenwell; I am a working jeweller, and do not keep an open shop - I work for myself, and sometimes as a journeyman.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH WALKER. I am the brother of the last witness - we were in partnership together once, and became acquainted with Coster; we did business with him - our transactions lasted about a month; I did not see him afterwards till very lately - I know Smith, and I have seen Coster pay Smith wages for his service in his counting-house; I have very little recollection of Smith's handwriting - I know Coster's writing perfectly well; (looking at the letters Nos. 1,2,3, and 5,) these are decidedly in his hand-writing; I am certain of them - I am sure they are all four his writing; his burried hand-writing is very different when he is putting his thoughts together, to be copied, but that is the calm and collected hand he writes, after he is copying it out of a book, in which he writes - I have seen him write letters which he has not put his own name to; he unfortunately forged my name.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You saw him in 1820? A. I believe it was in 1819 - I had nothing to do with him afterwards; I spoke to him about six months ago.</p>

             and Co.; he carried on business in that name from October, 1831, until about a month or six weeks before January - I believe he then took a counting-house in Windsor-street, and then went to New-street; I have been employed by him to copy letters for him - I commenced in October, 1831 - I wrote a great many letters for him, and during the whole time I was in the habit of seeing Smith in St. Helen's, acting as his clerk; I became acquainted with the hand-writing of both of them - these two letters are written by Smith, to the best of my opinion - these four I believe, on looking over them, to be written by Coster; they are not in his usual hand-writing, but I have seen such writing as this of his, when he has been particular, and had them written so as to be fully understood - but his general hand-writing is in a great hurry, and not so legible; I believe them to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are they not written in a current running hand? A. Yes, not a forced hand; I have not seen him write that hand very often - I think I have seen him write like this, but should be very sorry to swear positively; I have received written directions from him, which he has acknowledged - they were lists of names and addresses; I have written into the country for him, and those lists were returned to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are you sure these letters are in Smith's writing? A. I believe them to be his - I know one Lewis; there is a similarity to Lewis' hand-writing, but I do not believe it to be Lewis' writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this paper, whose writing do you believe it to be? A. I am not aware that I have seen this writing; I have seen Smith write like this, but it is impossible to say when persons are in the habit of varying their writing - I have done nothing for this year and a half, but writing letters for Coster; I never became bail for any body.</p>
               <p>SIR J. SCARLETT. Q.Have you been pretty much employed writing letters for Coster since 1831? A. Yes, I have written twelve letters a day, and twenty-four or thirty, according to the number he wanted; he appeared to carry on a great deal of business; Lewis was a clerk of Coster's - I have known him as long as Coster, for eleven years.</p>
               <p>MASON STEVENSON. I am an attorney. I have seen several letters from Coster, and have seen him write;(looking at four letters) these bear strong characters of his hand-writing, but the writing I have generally seen is more of a running hand, but still there are the strong characteristics of the hand, that I have not the least doubt of their being Coster's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How long is it since you saw him write? A. I think about eighteen months; I saw him write six times, but I have perhaps seen fifty or one hundred letters from him, addressed to my late partner, Mr. Gates - we dissolved partnership about eighteen months ago; I have seen no letters from him since.(The following letters were here read.)</p>

               <p>Coster's Defence. Were it not that my case has been prejudged, and that I had been libelled, vilified, and slandered, indeed already condemned, by the public newspapers,(and that in a manner little becoming the situation they hold in society,) I should await your verdict with the most perfect tranquillity, under a conviction, that my innocence fully entitles me to an acquittal; but a penny pamphlet has been sold in the street, professing to contain an account of our committal as two noted swindlers, for forgery; this has been carried about London, and the newspapers have thought proper to make statements about me; but when I see so respectable a Jury, I am satisfied I shall have a fair English trial, and I think I shall be able to convince you of my innocence - that I never wrote one of the letters, or caused one to be written; I have done business with a gentleman in your box some years back, to some considerable amount - I respectfully submit the case before you as a mere abstract question, whether the letters given in evidence were written by me - and I trust, the respectable evidence I shall produce, will place that question beyond the possibility of a doubt; I have been a general dealer in sundry articles for twenty years - I have paid hundreds of ready money to most respectable persons - the prosecutors' have rested their case solely on the evidence of the Walker's, to prove my writing; it is fifteen years since I had any connexion with them, and I paid 200l. to Joseph Walker for chains, which I supposed to be gold, but found them to be spurious, and could not make a farthing of them - they are the only persons who take upon themselves to swear to my writing; I believe all of you must know the difficulty of a man writing two different hands, without his hand being discovered, without being able to disguise it; you are well aware of the power that my prosecutors have, and the means they have of bribing people; and I know that they have bribed my clerks, whom I relied upon for my defence, and my papers have been taken away, which prevents my showing my bills; I declare most solemnly I know nothing of the letters in question; the respectable evidence I have to offer, in opposition to that of Walker's, will at once convince you of my innocence; you will recollect how ready and willing the Police-officer was in giving evidence, and saying he saw my fellow prisoner looking over his right shoulder with his right eye, and every device he could use to prejudice your minds against me; there cannot be a more public place than Bishopsgate-street, and coaches are going to and fro every moment; I assure you, I had nothing to apprehend to run for; I was not aware of Smith's being taken, nor had I been with him; I was not aware of his having gone to the Four Swans for any parcel; the reason of my running, was becasue I saw a friend a few yards before me, who was going from the Spread Eagle into the country; I might mend my pace to catch him - I said I was going to the booking-office, meaning the Spread Eagle. Gentlemen, you will observe, when I went to the bar of the Four Swans in the morning, I inquired when the Ipswich, not the Honiton coach came in; I told him I expected a gentleman from Ipswich to stop there; I had a note the day before, stating he would be in London, and expected him by some country coach that morning; all the Norfolk and Suffolk coaches which start from the other side of Ipswich, must come through Ipswich, and I could not tell what time he would come; I was waiting, thinking I might see a Norwich coach come in - I saw one put down a passenger at the next inn; I went and asked, Pearce, the son, if the Ipswich coach had come in, and he said No; I understood him, that one came in between one and two o'clock, that was the reason of my going there at that time; I declare I never mentioned the name of Jackson - I knew Farmer; he had taken a watch from a friend of mine, whose name is quite different from Jackson; how they connect the name of Jackson with it, I cannot tell - it is a similar name, but not Jackson; young Pearce, who has been trained, no doubt, by the powerful enemy I have, says

If any of you gentlemen, belong to the Society of Guardians for the Protection of Trade, I trust you will waive all prejudice from your minds, as to having seen my name in their list for some years past; all I crave from you is justice without prejudice. I am informed that Lush has had a large sum for swearing to my writing; it is true I have paid him a deal of money for copying letters, knowing him to be in a starving condition, but he does not venture to swear that it is my writing. Mr. Stevenson has not brought one of my letters forward to compare - that would not suit Mr. Freshfield's purpose; there is not proof of my having put the notes into the letters; there is a chain of circumstantial, suspicious evidence; when I prove that neither of the letters are my hand-writing, I trust an end will be put to the case at once. I have been twenty years in credit, and can have at this time 1000l. on credit, if I wanted it, and if I could not obtain it, I should be merely arrested and kept in prison as a common debtor; and is it likely I should pass forged notes, to be transported for life. Smith never was my clerk in the whole course of his life - he has sold goods for me by commission, and I positively deny sending him for the parcel - they do not attempt to prove, the paper with the address of

I solemnly declare I am totally<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110094"/>ignorant of the corrupt cause that has given rise to this prosecution; I knew Jackson when I was in the habit of visiting Manchester - he failed there, and I have lately renewed my acquaintance with him; I met him in Whitechapel - he said, "I want you to do a little business for me; we will go and take a glass of ale - I have written to two correspondents of mine in Devonshire for samples of light goods, they will be in two small parcels; I intended them to go to the Black Bull, but have addressed them to No. 84 - have the goodness to call at No. 84, in my name, and give them this paper when they come; I don't expect them before Monday or Tuesday - ask them to take them in; I know the party well, and expect, they will pay the carriage - my reason for not going myself is, because I expect there are one or two write out against me;" I agreed that it should be Tuesday before I saw Jackson again - I went to Bishopsgate-street, as the witnesses state; I called on Tuesday, and having learnt the parcels had come, went up the gateway, and came out with them as another man would, and had not got far down when Roe took me - I gave them up, not knowing there was any thing wrong; I have now stated nothing but the truth - it was in consequence of Jackson's representation I went; I have nothing to do with the correspondence.</p>

            , ESQ. ALD. I have been many years carrying on the profession of solicitor to a great extent - I have been concerned both for and against Coster for several years - I have had nothing to do for him for the last five years, but before that, for perhaps eight or ten years; I cannot bring to my recollection any instance of seeing him write, but I have had many letters from him, and have had communications with him upon them; I think I have means of forming a very accurate judgment of his writing - (looking at letters) I should say these letters are not his; they appear to me to be a better hand than his - than the letters I have treated as his; I should say this is a common ordinary hand - it does not seem to me to be a feigned hand; they are certainly different-to what I have always seen.</p>

            SCARLETT. Q. Have you been concerned for and against him in civil or criminal proceedings? A.Criminal; I was first concerned for him about fifteen years ago, when he had a prosecution against him - I do not know what his firm was then; I was not concerned for him for a long while after that - he has been at my house, and perhaps for an hour together, but I cannot charge my memory.</p>
               <p>Q.He never was in your house for a week? A. Oh, dear, no - never for a day; the letters I have had from him have not been in so good a hand, I should say it was a more illiterate hand; I have seen Smith - I think he has been at my house on Coster's business; I did not know Lewis, the clerk, by name - I have no recollection of seeing a letter written by Coster, but signed in a different name; his letters to me were on professional business, some very long; I think it is four or five years ago since I was last concersed for him; he was then a defendant - I think it was a proceeding about some bills; I do not recollect how it was arranged - I think the bills were given up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think this his hand-writing (producing a book)? A. Yes, I should say it was - some of the writing in this book is his, and I should say some is not; I do not know that he carried on any business five years ago - there was a firm, but I believe he was out of business - I do not recollect what name the firm was; some persons with whom he corresponded have been with me as clients; I do not know whether his business was extensive - he was not a client of mine in a general sense; persons had bills which he obtained from them - he came to me as a client to give them up; I was concerned against him in a prosecution more than once.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Did you say the letters do not appear to you to be written in a constrained hand-writing? A. They do not - they appear to me a natural hand.</p>

            . I am an auctioneer, and live in Church-court, Old Jewry. I have been acquainted with Coster fourteen or fifteen years - I have very often had opportunities of becoming acquainted with his hand-writing - I have seen him write; (looking at the four letters) I think these are not the hand-writing of Coster.</p>
               <p>SIR J. SCARLETT. Q. Did you ever see them before? A.Never; I have sold a very considerable quantity of woollen goods, to him by private contract, as well as at auctions - I have dealt very largely in woollen goods; I am not a general dealer - if linen, or any thing came into my hands, I should sell it; linen and other goods frequently come into my hands - it is only an accidental circumstance which makes me purchase; I have sold goods for Mr. Coster - I sold goods last for him in 1831; that was four bucks; he brought them to me to get an advance of money on them - I lent him money on them, sent them into the market, and they were sold by another person; I think I never sold goods by auction for him in my life - I am not a friend of his; he applied to me - very unfortunately I lent him money before on goods, and have lost money by them; I lent 3l. or 4l. on the bucks, and I lost money before by him - I knew him by living a few hundred yards from him; I live in Church-court, Old Jewry - when I first knew him I lived in Maiden-lane; he lived near me then: I do not know where he removed to; his residence was in Staining-lane; I never knew him by any other firm but Coster and Co.: he very frequently bought woollen goods of me; he always paid me either in cash or perhaps a draft on his banker - I think he has bought goods of me forty or fifty times, sometimes 20l., sometimes 10l., and sometimes 100l. worth; I unfortunately advanced him money on property which did not realise it - it was bills of lading for silks - I have frequently seen him write notes and orders; I certainly do not believe any part of these letters to be like his hand-writing; it does not require to read them to form a judgment of his writing - it is not his hand-writing, nor like it, in my opinion; I do not know Smith - I have been at the counting-house in Staining-lane; Coster told me he had bought the bucks, I do not recollect where; - I think the greater part of this book (looking at it) is in his writing, but here is some which I think is not his writing; here are some names and addresses which I think are not his.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q.Coster is in your debt? A. Yes - I have applied for it, and cannot get it; I never saw these letters before - it is apparent, from a slight inspection, that they are not Coster's writing.</p>
               <p>JAMES MORRIS PHILLIPS. I am a dealer in East India goods. I formerly kept a Manchester warehouse, and live in Sun-street, Bishopsgate. I first knew Coster in 1819 and 1820; I have had repeated dealings with him to small amounts - I have had frequent opportunities of seeing him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110095"/>write, so as to form a judgment of his hand-writing; I should say these letters are decidedly not his hand-writing - I will take a more minute look at them; I am confirmed in what I stated - they are a considerably better hand - his is a stiff, illiterate hand; this is the hand of a tolerable good penman - I have not seen these letters before.</p>
               <p>SIR JAMES SCARLETT. Q. Have you any letters of his hand-writing with you? A. No; I think I have seen him write within these three months: he was giving me an account of some goods which he had for sale, and was transcribing the particulars and numbers - I have had frequent dealings with him from the year 1829 to 1832, and then there was a cessation; my first transaction with him was purchasing goods, chiefly British goods, linen, woollen and cotton; I have lately bought hats of him - I never bought hardware - I have sold him, within the last eight months, the materials with which hats are manufactured, and he has paid me for them - I never sold him goods; until the last eight months our transactions have been very frequent - I have not been intimate with him except on business; I did not visit his house - I dealt with him in the firm of Lyall, Phillips &amp; Son; I never dealt with him in any other name than Coster - I have taken a great number of bills from him; I have discounted bills for him at most of the London bankers that have country connections - he has never discounted for me: I began to discount bills for him about six years since - they have always been on London bankers, but I have not done any within these last six or eight months - they were always small amounts; I do not think any exceeded 80l. - I seldom did more than one at a time; he used to send them to me in a note, and that is the way I became acquainted with his hand-writing - I should think I have discounted 1000l. for him altogether, from 1000l. to 1500l. would be the extent - it is not part of my business to discount bills; I did it as a matter of favour - I did it running no risk; I did not discount bills for any body else - I may have done it, or procured them to be done as an accommodation; I never discounted any other bills but those drawn by country bankers, either on London bankers or the Bank of England - I never held any of his acceptances; I never knew the firm of Gibbons and Co. - I had no transactions with that firm; I have seen the name of Gibbons written on an office which Mr. Coster used to transact business at; I think it was in Great St. Helen's- I do not recollect the Christian name; I do not think it was written over the door; I think it was under a general list of parties who had offices there - I do not know the firm of Benvolio and Co., nor Hamilton and Co. - I have known him for many years in Staining-lane; the firm there was

Mr. Garnett, of the late firm of Gates and Garnett - Mr. Coster was Mr. Gates' client in money transactions; he drew bills, and got Coster to get money on them - I do not know who introduced Coster to Gates - I did not; the acquaintance commenced when I was a clerk in an agent's office, who did business in the Sheriffs' Court - Coster used to come there to take out actions and bring clients; Coster's connection with Gates was to discount bills, not to very large amounts, perhaps 300l. or 400l.; my acquaintance with him ceased when I left Gates, which was in March, 1831 - Gates was a bankrupt then; I never knew Coster accept bills for Gates - he used to get bills drawn, and send me for the money; I do not know what firm Coster dealt in - I have seen the name of Gibbons and Co. on his door, in Great St. Helen's; I have seen Smith in the office, but had no conversation with him; some of this book, I think, is in Coster's hand-writing - I do not believe the whole of the page on the left hand to be his; I think the last entry is not - I believe the rest to be his hand-writing, except some parts of the names; I do not think this, "Parker, London-dock," is his - on the other side, I think "

            . I am a poulterer, in Newgate-market. I have known Coster about twelve years - I have had frequent opportunities of seeing his hand-writing, and I think I can form a judgment of the characters of it; I should say his hand is a perfect scrawl, that of a man that could not write a good hand (looking at the letters) - most decidedly these are not his hand-writing; there is not a single character like it.</p>
               <p>SIR JAMES SCARLETT. Q. He dealt in your business? A. He has sent me dead poultry to sell - not in very large quantities; he has sent me 10 or 15 geese, and 20 to 30 ducks - I do not remember any fowls, and never had any game; I do not know where he got them - I saw his hand-writing in a note, containing an advice of goods to sell, and in adjusting accounts, and have his letters requesting to know how the market went, and how it was likely to go; I have seen him write - he has given me an acknowledgment that he has had his different accounts from day to day; I have none of them with me - I have had a letter from him since he has been in prison, and have that in my pocket - (looking at the book) here is one entry of Coster's which takes my eye immediately, "Captain

               <p>Q. The letters are written at one time, and in one manner? A. Yes - I have received more than one hundred letters from him; I have not a doubt of a single character in them being his hand-writing - I think that the difference of writing before and after dinner in the book would make the difference, but there is not a single letter in the whole four letters a bit like his - I never knew a man disguise his hand-writing by writing a better hand than he ever wrote before - I have never seen these letters before.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. You did not know him us Gibbons? A. No, I always knew him as Coster.</p>
               <p>GEORGE TURNER. I am clerk to Mr. Taylor, an attorney, of Stanhops-street, Strand. I have known Smith about ten years; I have seen him write repeatedly, and can form a judgment of his writing - (looking at two letters) I am sure these are not the hand-writing of Smith.</p>
               <p>SIR J. SCARLETT. Q. What was the nature of your connection with Smith? A. I knew him first when he failed in business - he was a commission-agent; I know Coster very well, but not so long as Smith - a person of the name of Green, who is dead, introduced me to Coster; Smith has since that been an accountant, and I have had business with him, in making up bankrupts' accounts - I do not know that he has been clerk to Coster, but he used to be in Coster's counting-house - he used to sell for Coster by commission; I understood so from Smith himself - I corresponded with him a great deal on bankrupts' business; I have employed him, and he me, to attend under different commissions, and to defend actions which have been brought against him - he has had many actions brought against him; I have been concerned for Coster too - he has not had many actions; I was never employed to negociate with Walker - I was never in the Golden Cross tap, Charing-cross, in my life - I swear that positively; since Coster's imprisonment I have seen Lewis, his clerk - I met him in Playhouse-yard, Whitecross-street; I have never been in a room with him since his master's imprisonment; I saw him at the Mansion-house, at the examination - I do not see him here; I should think I have known Lewis about two years - he was clerk to Coster; Coster had another clerk - his name was Nicholson; he had been clerk to Coster about six months - I have seen him writing in the counting-house six months before Coster's imprisonment; I know the Seven Stars, Carey-street - I have not been there within the last two years; I have not been there with Lewis since Coster's imprisonment; Smith was a friend of mine - I have lent him money; he owes me money now - a few pounds, I cannot exactly tell you how many exactly.</p>
               <p>Mr. BARRY. Q.As you had business with Smith, was it necessary you should call on him at times? A. Yes, and that took me to Coster's.</p>

I have known Smith about two years; I was with him on the 16th of March, in Whitechapel-road - I saw a person who called himself William Jackson; I joined that person and the prisoner, about twelve o'clock - we walked down as far as Whitechapel-church, and went into a public-house opposite; I think it was the Two Bells, and drank out of a pint of porter or half-and-half - after that Jackson wrote a slip of paper for Smith to go for a parcel; he was to call at Bishopsgate-street and leave the paper - he said the parcel was expected from the country somewhere; Jackson said he could not go for them, as there was a writ or two out against him - I saw some money pass from Jackson to Smith; I cannot be sure, but I think he said from 7s. to 8s. - Smith undertook to go.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who gave the 7s. or 8s.? A.Jackson gave it to Smith; he left Jackson just by the church, by Whitechapel-church.</p>

               <p>SIR JAMES SCARLETT. Q. Is Smith married to your mother? A. No, my mother is housekeeper there; she has lived there about two years - I am twenty-two years old; I am not married - my sister keeps my house for me; I hawk eggs about to shops and families - I have only seen Jackson twice before I met him with Smith; I saw him at Smith's house - he called to see Smith while I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110097"/>was there to see my mother; it was a fortnight before this happened - I have frequently heard Smith talk about him; and I know he left his name with my mother as William Jackson - but when I was with Smith in Whitechapel-road, he met us; they had a conversation about the parcel - I walked behind at first, till they got to the public-house, and then I went in, as they went in; I was going to see a friend at the Pavilion, and met Smith in Houndsditch, and we walked down Whitechapel-road together - I did not go to see my friend, but I came back with Smith to the Two Bells; I had no particular reason for seeing my friend; we stopped at the Two Bells for a quarter of an hour, and had a pint of half-and-half - I think the landlord was present; I believe he was - it was a man who served us; Jackson asked Smith if he would have any objection to fetch a parcel for him, and Smith said No, if it would do him any good he would - Jackson wrote a slip of paper to leave it there for him, and gave him the money to pay what expence there might be; he said he would place that in his hands to pay for the parcel - he said it was 7s. or 8s.; I cannot exactly say how much it was - I left Smith at the corner of Houndsditch: I did not go to my friends - I have seen Smith write; I cannot tell his hand-writing - I have heard of Coster, I do not know him; I have not seen Jackson since - I was at the Mansion-house when the prisoners were brought up, but not on the first day - I came to see Smith the day after he was brought there; I was there on the Wednesday - I was not there on the Tuesday; I am positive of that - I did not offer myself as a witness; I went merely to see Mr. Smith, to know what had become of him - my mother did not know where he was, being out all night.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On Saturday morning, the 6th of March, at twenty minutes after six o'clock, I saw the prisoner going along Paternoster-row, with a flat of butter on his back - I asked where he was going to take it to; he said he was going to take it to a cart in St. Paul's church-yard - it was directed to Mr. Fuller, Newgate-market; I followed him towards St. Paul's church-yard - instead of going in there, he turned down Creed-lane; I then took him to Fuller's, who said it had not been delivered to him - I left it there, and took the prisoner to the Compter; and in Rose-street, we met the pro<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110098"/>secutor, who said, "You stole the flat of butter;" he made no answer - It contained 40 lbs. of butter.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that Slade had told him he could not pay him any thing for his trouble - in consequence of which he strayed into St. Paul's church-yard, intending shortly to return with the butter.</p>

            . I live in Jewry-street, Aldgate. I was going home one afternoon, about the 21st of March, between four and five o'clock, and had a handkerchief in my outside coat pocket; my attention was drawn by the footsteps of a person very close - I walked rather slow, thinking as the pavement was narrow that the person wanted to pass me - I stood on one side to allow him to pass, but he did not, and I walked on; the same footsteps again followed me very close, and I stood a second time to allow him to pass me, but he did not - I turned round to see who it was, and found the prisoner close behind me; he instantly jumped off the pavement from behind me - he was then in the act of stuffing a pocket-handkerchief up his back, under his jacket; part of it still hung down behind, not out of sight - it appeared the same pattern as my handkerchief; I immediately felt and found it was gone, and accused him of taking my handkerchief, which he denied - I asked what he had done with the handkerchief I saw him put behind his back; he denied having done so - I kept hold of him, and walked a little way to find an officer, and gave him in charge; he was searched, but no handkerchief was found - but while we were talking to him a witness came up with it; he had picked it up on the spot where I had seized him - he still denied it.</p>
               <p>WALTER BEATONSON. I am a labouring man. On the 21st of March I and my wife were standing at my door, and saw the prosecutor pass by, and two boys following him close; in a few moments after the gentleman had gone down the passage, I heard a cry that the gentleman's pocket was picked; I went off the step of my door, and picked the handkerchief off the grating at my door - I went down the alley, and asked the prosecutor if it was his; he had hold of the prisoner - he immediately claimed it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were there not two lads following the prosecutor? A. Yes; the other walked away when he came by my door.</p>

             (Police-constable G 33). I lodge at No. 23, Helen-place, Clerkenwell. About one o'clock that morning I met Mailey, Carvey, and Barnes, on Saffron-hill - they spoke to me; I then went up West-street, and through Sharpe's-alley - I then met them again, running down Sharpe's-alley, and Mailey had a great coat; Barnes had a hat and an umbrella - one of them dropped a book- they cried out, "There is Smith, spill it," and they all ran off; I told them I knew them - I had not seen Colliss then, but I came up Sharpe's-alley, and found him at the prosecutor's shop; he told me what he had seen, and I said I knew them all - I saw Nash at the house, as it appeared, in a fit; in about half an hour I took Mailey at his house, in West-street - his coat had some flour on it; I said,"You have been with the baker's;" he said he had been in all night; "Yes, (said his landlady) about twenty minutes;" it appeared that if Nash had let them in they would have taken more than they did - there was a watch and other things there.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER WOOLCOCK (Police-constable G 149.) I lodge in Greenhill's-rents, Cowcross. I came up to the house, and found Nash against the door; I raised him up several times, and he fell again - he seemed quite stupid.</p>

               <p>ROBERT SKINNER. I lodge in the house. I returned home at twelve o'clock that night; Nash let me in - I bolted the door, and went to bed; at half-past one I was called up by Lee - I came down, and saw Nash apparently intoxicated, but I thought it could not be, as he appeared sober when I came in; I have always found him strictly honest.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS FELTHAM. I was in the City Police, but have left it. I was present at the trial of Mailey in September last- I have a certificate of his conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's; (read) I know he is the man.</p>

               <persName id="t18330411-182-person1332">MR. PHILLIPS</persName>
            . Q. You told him to let him go? A. Yes, because the fourth day had not elapsed; the officer let him go, and he was taken again on the Thursday, I think; he had Wednesday to have escaped - the parcel was rather more than a foot long, six or seven inches broad, and five or six inches deep - it was an object of considerable consequence to me, but I totally forgot it; it went out of my sight and out of my memory at the same time - I had been thinking of it a second before, because I had it in my hand to remove it; I had been in the house three or four minutes to deposit the other things - I had four parcels in all; the first was a parcel of silver, which the servant took in; the second was plated goods, the third was the dish and stand, which I took in, thinking it was the last parcel: and when I came out to pay the prisoner, to the best of my recollection he was standing by the coach-wheel - the servant who took the parcels in is not here, but another servant is; it was the hall-porter who carried them in; he was the only servant who came out of the door - the other servant did not come to the door, he was looking through the window; I noticed the number of the coach when I went out to pay the fare, because as I walked down the steps it was just before me - my employers were very angry at the loss of their property; I believe the Orchard-street stand is the last coach-stand in Oxford-street - there was no coach to be seen; it is a great thoroughfare - I thought the prisoner had robbed me when Shackell brought him to me; but I desired him to let him go, as I had been advised at the station, to give him the four days to return the property - I mentioned to the prisoner what the reward was, which was 20l. - he never denied that he had driven the coach; I shall have to make the property good to my master.</p>

             (Police-constable A 10). I was applied to by Mr. Morris, and on the Saturday I went with him to Grey Coat-yard - we inquired for the prisoner, but were unable to find him - I inquired where he lived, and in consequence of what I heard, I went to No. 17, Moon-street, Bryanstone-square, and they sent for the prisoner; this was on Sunday, about five or six o'clock in the afternoon - I said to him, "Is your name 
               <persName id="t18330411-182-person1336">Griffin</persName>
            ?" he said Yes - I said, "Do you recollect driving a fare from the Haymarket stand, to No. 12, Portman-square? it is of no use your hesitating, I am sure you do;" he said, "Well, I know I did;" I said, "I want a brown paper parcel that was left in your coach;" he said, "I know nothing of the parcel;" I then said,"What was the next job you took up;" he said he did not know - I said, "You can't have forgotten it in so short a time;" he then told me he left a gentleman at No. 12, Portman-square, and then drove to the stand, at the corner of Orchard-street, and he had hardly got on the rank, before a lady and two children called him, and he had driven them to the Black Lion-gate, Bayswater; I asked him if he knew who the lady was - he said he did not, but the ostler at the Black Lion would no doubt know, and if I would allow him, he would go down to Bayswater-gate, see the ostler, and come to me the next morning - I said very well, and appointed to meet him the next morning at nine o'clock, at a coffee-shop, at the corner of Charles-street, in the Haymarket, where he was to let me know who this lady was - I agreed to his going, because I thought he seemed to wish to go by himself, and I thought by doing so the parcel might be forthcoming; I went to the coffee-room the next morning - he came at twenty minutes past nine o'clock, and said he had been to Bayswater and seen the ostler, and that it was a lady, who kept a tobacconist's shop at Kensington Gravel-pits - I asked him why he did not go to the lady and get the parcel; he said he thought I could get it back better than he could - if I would go down with him, he said he would take me down to the ostler; we went there, and he told me to go into the parlour, and he would go and see the ostler; he brought Wheatley into the parlour to me and said, "This is the ostler;" I said to Wheatley."Who is this lady?" he said, "From the description, I think it is Mrs. Ince, No. 69, Westbourne-terrace;" I asked the prisoner how he came to tell me it was a tobacconist, at Kensington Gravel-pits; he said that was a mistake - he had been gone about five minutes before he came back with the ostler; I then went with the prisoner to Mrs. Ince - the ostler said from the description the prisoner had given him it was Mrs. Ince - Mrs. Ince is not here, but she denied it before the prisoner's face - she said she had not been in his coach, she had come down that day, but it was in an omnibus - there was a young lady coming out of the parlour at the time, and the prisoner said, "That is just the size of a young lady who came down with you;" 
               <persName id="t18330411-182-person1337">Mrs. Ince</persName>
             said she had not been in town at all that day, that she had come down with one of her daughters, but not her - I then said to the prisoner,"Can you swear to Mrs. Ince as coming down in your coach?" he said, "No, I can't;" we then made every inquiry to find a person who had come down, and the next day we distributed 1500 hand-bills to every house, and also some other bills, offering 10l. reward - the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110101"/>said he could take me to the spot from where he brought the lady; he went with me, and waited at every door while I went in and inquired - he said he thought they came out of a shop near the clock, a few doors from Orchard-street; I asked him where the waterman was who put the parties into the coach - he said there was no one nigh him; I said, "Then it is of no use my asking the question;" he said, "No, it is not - I got off my coach-box, let them in, shut the door, and drove off;" I then let him go, and the next day I saw him again; I told him to make every possible inquiry - that we had distributed 1500 bills and 500 small ones, and if he knew any thing about it he had better take it to Somerset-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What day did you go to Bayswater? A. On Monday, the robbery was on Friday; he did not affect to point out the precise house out of which the lady came - he said it was a lady and two children, and he put them down at the turnpike-gate; it was the ostler who said, from the description, he thought Mrs. Ince must be the lady - the prisoner did not assert that she was - he said he could not swear to her; I did not take the prisoner into custody till the following Thursday, when he was on the stand near Portman-square, talking to some watermen.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you the prisoner's master here? A. No, he said he did not employ him as a hackneyman, and he should not attend; I was obliged to go twice to get him to the office.</p>

            . I have been ostler at the Black Lion, at Bayswater, for fourteen years; I have known the prisoner, by sight, about twelve months. On Friday, the 22nd of March, I had leave of absence from my master - I left home about ten o'clock in the morning, and did not return till between three and four - I did not see the prisoner nor his coach that day; on Monday morning, the 25th, he came down with the officer - the officer went into the parlour - I was on the opposite side, washing a coach; the prisoner came to me (I had not seen him for three or four weeks before), and he said there had been a parcel lost in his coach, and there was a shilling or two, or a pound or two, to be got - he said he had brought a short stout lady, dressed in black, and two children, down to Bayswater, and he mentioned the day; I said I was not at home at all that day - I then went into the parlour, and told him I did not know any one of the description he had given, except Mrs. Ince, No. 69, Westbourne-terrace; he said he had been accused for the parcel lost in his coach; I went into the parlour, because he said a gentleman there wanted to see me - he told me to say that the lady kept a tobacconist's shop, or something of that sort, and I told him I could not say any thing of the kind, as I was not at home; he then told me to come into the parlour and have a glass of beer - he told me to say I was at home, and watered the horses and fed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Of course, when you went into the parlour, and found the officer, he confirmed what the coachman had told you, that there was a valuable parcel lost? A. He did not say it was valuable - he said there was a parcel lost; the officer had not his uniform on, but he told me at last that he was an officer - I did not tell him what the prisoner had desired me to say, but I told him of it one night afterwards - I think it was a week after, or it might be more - it was on a Monday night; I did not like to say any thing to him at the time - I was in a hurry, and wanted to get my coach done; I was in the parlour about five minutes - I had time to have told him; I told him the rest that the prisoner had said about the stout lady and two children.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, if you told him about the short lady and two children, why did you not at the same time tell him that the prisoner wanted you to say you were at home, and you were not? A. I did not like to say any thing to him - that was my reason; I wanted to get my coach done, because my master had been blowing me up about it - that was my reason; I told the officer afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. In the mean time had there not been a reward offered about the neighbourhood? A. Yes, I think 10l. was the first reward and 20l. the second; I think they brought the bills down on the Tuesday, the day after I had been in the parlour with the officer; I did not mention to any one that the prisoner wanted me to say I was at home till after the rewards were offered - I do not expect a reward - it is for getting the parcel; I told the gentleman to clear myself, because the prisoner said I was at home, and my master knew that I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was not what the prisoner said to you, that a parcel was alleged to have been lost out of his coach, that it would be a shilling or two, or perhaps a pound in any man's way, that could discover the parcel, and did he not beg of you to do your best to assist him. A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.If the horses were not galloping, only trotting, how did it happen that the wheels went over Hancock? A.He was crossing the road, and the wheels went over him; I hallooed out, his wife sereamed, and the prisoner stopped - I assisted in getting Hancock into the coach.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Are you a coachman? A. Yes, and have been so for twenty-six years; the prisoner's omnibus was not galloping at all - I did not see him whip the horses; I know, by experience, that when horses get to a piece of fresh gravel, they make an additional exertion to get over it - there was some fresh gravel at this place; the prisoner did his utmost to stop his horses - I did not hear him use the expressions which have been stated; I did not hear a sancy word out of his mouth - Mr. Kid got down and gave what assistance he could; I have no notion of seeing either of these witnesses there at all, but I spoke to Randall after the accident; I knew the deceased - he was a very old man, and I think he was rather deaf.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know Mr. Kid before this accident? A. No; when I assisted in taking up the deceased, he said, "Wild, this has done me - I am done;" I said, "Bill, I hope not" - he did not mention a word about the driving so quick; I do not suppose the omnibus had got half a dozen yards from where the man laid before it stopped - I did not see the man knocked down - I did not see him till the hind wheel was going over him; he was rather on this side of the middle of the road, I suppose sixty yards from the side; I suppose the prisoner's omnibus was six or seven yards from the other; I do not know the prisoner's attorney - I have never been examined by him; I believe I have never given an account of this to him - I do not see any body in Court to whom I gave the account.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, have you not been examined by the attorney for the prisoner? A. I have seen this gentleman, and told him what I had to say; Gook, the officer, sent me word to attend, but I believe the attorney for the defendant sent for me to attend the Coroner.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's master; he has been three or four months in my employ - I was on the steps of the omnibus at the time; one of the horses was not galloping, I could not see the other - the prisoner stopped instantly, got down and ordered a coach, and said he would pay for it; he was in tears the moment he got off the box- both the prisoner and I called the coach; I have a horse-keeper, whose business it is to put curbs on the horses, but he had not done so that day, which made them require more strength to pull them in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What deodand was put upon the omnibus? A.20l.; I attended at the hospital, and saw the deceased several times - I did not see him when dead; the prisoner was not crossing to pass the omnibus which was in front of him, but there was some loose granite on the road, which was a little worn in the centre, and I conjecture he went there for that reason - we were between forty and fifty yards behind the other omnibus at the time.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's employ; I live at No. 20, Oxford-street, Whitechapel. On the 4th of April, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, I went to the warehouse; I put the key into the lock, and it turned round - I felt some obstruction against it - I pushed it away, and got in; while I was getting some timber, which I wanted, I heard some footsteps - I looked up, and saw a man going towards the gate; I called out; "Who are you? and what do you want?" he went out - I went into the yard, and on returning to the premises again, I saw the two prisoners; I called for assistance, and they were taken; there is only one gate to the premises, which is the one I went in at; some of these articles were taken from below, and some were up stairs; the lock of the gate was not broken, but the staple was broken off; I saw eleven springs on the ground, which had been taken from carriages; I had seen them on the Monday before, and this was on the Thursday; we found thirty-two or thirty-three cushions in different parts, and the linings of four of the carriages appeared to have been cut; I saw a quantity of japan in an iron pot, which had been put there from a stone bottle and a carboy - this screw-wrench was found in the yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How must they have got in? A. I did not see them get in, but they must have got over a wall, or the gate, twelve or fourteen feet high; the prisoners were taken on the spot - two men came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Stubbs. Q. Where did you find the holdfast of the door? A. It was hanging down on one screw; I did not tell you the door had been forced, and show you the holdfast on the post.</p>

Yes - I believe he did not intend to prosecute her, if she had produced the watches; she never charged him with making any advances to her - she had only been a fortnight there when she was taken ill; I had not seen the watches for some time - there was a charwoman, but she had no access to the property; I believe a young woman whom the prisoner recommended, attended to my sister, but I was there, the first night I went I had to do some work - I looked for this thimble, and it could not be found; this led to a search for the other things, and they were missed.</p>

About the end of October the prisoner introduced himself to me by a letter of introduction; he came to my counting-house one day, about the end of November, and asked me if I could negociate bills on his father's house for 150l.; he said his father carried on business at Rotterdam - while he was there stamps were sent out for, to draw the bills on, and they were drawn in my presence - these are the bills which he drew; after they were drawn he asked me if I would be kind enough to negociate them, and give him the money for them - I said, I did not know his father's house; - I made inquiry, and could hear nothing of that house, and refused to advance him money on them - he came again on the 13th (the next day), and asked me to let him have 20l. on the bills, and I gave him a cheque on my bankers for that amount; this is the cheque - he said he wanted the 20l. to go down to Brighton, with a friend; I drew the cheque in his presence, and he wrote his name on the back - I went with him and showed him the banking-house, and left him there; on the 15th he called again, between twelve and one o'clock, and asked me to allow him a sheet of paper to write a letter - I gave him one, and he wrote a letter at the same table as I sat at; he sat opposite to me - my cheque-book laid on the table, at my side; after he had written the letter I had occasion to leave the room, leaving my cheque-book in the place I have stated - I went up stairs, leaving the cheque-book within his reach; this is the cheque-book - my clerk sat with his back to him; I returned in a few minutes - I found him there, and the cheque-book where I had left it; I then showed the prisoner the Bank and Lloyd's, and other places, and, on parting with him, I promised to get him a ticket for the Lord Mayor's ball, which was that night or the next night; there was not the slightest intimation from him that he was going to leave the country - I received information the same day from Messrs. Williams, and, in consequence of a description given me by the clerk, I gave directions that the prisoner should be given into custody; inquires were made after him without  effect - the ticket for the ball was to be sent to him at the Royal-hotel, St. James'; application was made for him there, but we could hear nothing of him - this cheque -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110108"/>(looking at it) is not in my hand-writing; I believe the body of it to be the hand-writing of the prisoner - I believe the whole to be his hand-writing; it says 55 pound, leaving out the s; the word pound is spelt in the bills also without the s - the forged cheque is in the same hand as the letter he wrote, which was addressed to Mr. Reading.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. At what time on the 15th did we separate in the Poultry? A. I should think about two o'clock - I should think it impossible that the cheque could have been abstracted from my book before that day - I usually left it on my table.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Robinson and Co.; there is only one partner besides Mr. Robinson - the prisoner was in the habit of coming backwards and forwards, I remember his coming on the 15th of November - Mr. Robinson was not at home when he first came; I asked him to sit down, and gave him the newspaper - I sit with my back to Mr. Robinson's table, and cannot see any thing that takes place at the table; Mr. Robinson came in, in about half an hour - I do not recollect the prisoner writing a letter; he was sitting at the table with Mr. Robinson - Mr. Robinson left the office for a few minutes, leaving nobody but me and the prisoner there; he was sitting at the table at the time - I could not see any thing he might do at the table; the cheque-book generally lays on the table - Mr. Atkins does business in our office; nobody else has an opportunity of touching the cheque-book - it is locked in Mr. Robinson's drawer after business hours; I do not interfere with the cheque-book at any time - the prisoner and Mr. Robinson afterwards went out together, about one o'clock; I understood he lodged at St. James' hotel - I lost sight of the prisoner after that entirely; I think I met him once in Coleman-street, but I was not certain it was him, and did not stop him - in February I saw him in Regent-street, I went up to him, and said, "How do you do, Mr. Peppers?" he said, "Very well" - I asked if he had heard from his friends; he said No - I then asked if he was walking about Regent-street; he said No, he was waiting for a friend - I kept him in conversation, and saw an officer in a few minutes; I then ran and met the officer, and brought him to the prisoner - I ran forward and laid hold of him by the arm; he said, "For God Almighty's sake, do not take me!" - he saw the officer, in his uniform, with me; I had told him before, that Mr. Robinson wanted to see him, and asked him to call on him - he said he would next day; I think he was going down Warwick-street when I took him - I did not intimate that I was going for an officer.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the banking-house of Meesrs. Williams and Co.; they have an account with Robinson and Co., Old Jewry - the cheques we use have one number through the whole book; each customer has a distinct number - this cheque-book is No. 403; that number was on all the cheques in that book - it contained exactly two hundred cheques; this 20l. cheque was paid in course, on the 15th of November, about four o'clock in the afternoon - this 55l. cheque was brought to our house; it was presented by a man whose general appearance was like the prisoner, but he was in a very different dress - he had a dark frock-coat, buttoned close up; it was in rather a dark part of the office - the person's height and general appearance was like the prisoner; on the cheque being presented I had some doubt of the signature, and went to the back part of the office to compare the signature, and when I returned to the counter the person who presented it was gone - it is an imitation of Robinson and Co.'s signature; the s was omitted in the word pounds - I wrote on it."Differs from the usual signature," and returned it to Mr. Robinson.</p>

            . I am a stationer, and prepare the cheque-books for Messrs. Williams and Co. I made this cheque-book - I have not the least doubt but the cheque in question formed part of that book; I can point out the part of the book from which a cheque has been taken; there were two hundred cheques in it when it was made, and all bore the No. 403; here is the rough edge left from which the cheque has been torn - the margin has since been cut off the cheque, but I can tell from the appearance of the cheque in length and breadth; that it has been in that book, and I speak more positively because only one book was numbered 403; I am certain that cheque has been in that book.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Has the cheque been torn or cut out? A. Torn; the others are cut off at the margin.</p>
               <p>The bills referred to being produced had the letter s omitted in the word pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am a foreigner, but a consciousness of my innocence has induced me to come to this bar unprotected by counsel or professional advice; I cannot but avail myself of the opportunity of pointing out the very loose evidence to fix the crime on me - it amounts to nothing but that the cheque is drawn in the name of a gentleman to whom I happened to write a letter - and will you consign me to slavery for life for this? can such a coincidence warrant such an act? - conceive the impossibility of my tearing the cheque out, in the presence of the clerk, and that I should be such a madman as to draw it in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110109"/>name of a gentleman, and leave the letter in the prosecutor's possession.</p>

            . I am niece to Mr. Cummins, at the White Lion, James-street, Bedford-row. On the 3rd of February (Sunday evening) the prisoner came to the house for four bottles of port wine - my uncle asked who it was for; he said it was for Mr. Holmes, No. 25, Great James-street - the wine was delivered to him; he gave a 10l. note for it - my uncle gave him six sovereigns and 6s. change; he was at the bar about five minutes - I asked him into the bar - I am certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You took particular notice of him? A. Yes, more than I did of the note - he was dressed in a shabby-genteel black coat; I did not notice his breeches - I know him by his features.</p>

            . I keep a public-house in St. James'. On Sunday evening, the 3rd of February, I believe the prisoner to be the man who came to the bar door, and asked if we sold wine - it was 3s. 6d. a bottle; he said he did not care what the price was so that it was good; when he tendered the 10l. note, I said, "Where is it going to;" he said, "No. 25, Little James-street;" I said,"There is no such number in the street, you must mean No. 25, Great James-street, Mr. Holmes';" he said,"That is the very name;" I wrote on the note, "Mr. Holmes;" this is the note - I wrote it not above ten minutes after I took it; I gave him change - he tied the wine up in his handkerchief and went away; I offered to send my boy with it - he refused; he said I could have the bottles in the morning if I sent to Mr. Holmes' - I sent to Mr. Holmes' next morning for the bottles, and did not get them; Holmes had been a customer of mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You mentioned Holmes to him? A. Yes, my niece was present - she invited him into the bar, and stood facing him at the time, taking a full view of him; I put the note into my pocket, where I had other notes, but I had marked it before I took it off the counter.</p>

The prisoner came to my place of business, about half-past six o'clock in the evening of the 28th of September, he showed me the invoice of fifteen pockets of hops, which he said he had purchased on the morning of that day; he produced a cheque for 250l. which I have here - he did not tell me what his name was; he said, "I have come to pay for these hops - here is a cheque of my friend's Mr. Strong, of the Globe Insurance Company, of course you will not object to give me the difference - your cheque will do for the balance, and to-morrow morning, I will send an Exciseman to weigh the hops, and procure the drawback;" I gave him a cheque for the difference on Messrs. Weston, my bankers; I went to Messrs. Weston's next morning, and after I had been there a minute or two, I saw the prisoner there - I think he saw me; I was in the back room, and saw him through the casement - he made his appearance at the outer door, and the moment I saw him, he moved on one side, and disappeared - it was about ten minutes before nine o'clock in the morning; my cheque was afterwards presented at Messrs.

            . I am in the employ of the Gaslight Company, and was employed in the brewing. I saw the prisoner near the clock; he had the clock door open - one of his hands was up at the clock, and his other hand had the hands of the clock in it; I asked him if I should put the hands on, and he said No, he would put them on himself; I went into the beer cellar soon after, and ran against something in the dark - I felt it, and it was the prisoner; he asked which way he should go out - I said not through the kitchen, as Mrs. Richardson was there, and he went another way.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not ask you for some beer? A. Yes, and you asked which way you should go out not to be seen.</p>

You was in the act of putting them out of the prison-window, and telling some children to destroy them: I took them up, and asked him if they were the things his wife gave to him - I showed them to him, he said they were what his wife gave him, he had not stolen them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It would not be a great deal out of the way? A. No; sheep sometimes take a wrong turning, and drovers have sometimes a great deal of trouble with them - it was another man who struck the sheep.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. On the next evening did you take charge of some lambs at Whitchurch's? A.

On the 13th of March I saw Smith in Brick-lane, Goswell-street, at about a quarter or twenty minutes past eight o'clock; I do not know where Mr. Kimber lives, but it is somewhere in the New North-road, more than a mile from Brick-lane; Smith had sixteen or seventeen Down sheep with him - I do not know where they had come from, but he said they had come from Southall-market, and he was going to take them to Mr. Kimber's, in the New North-road; I saw him at the same place again in two or three minutes - he could not have gone to Mr. Kimber's in that time; he had no sheep with him then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ask him how he came to go that way? A. Yes, and he said to save turnpikes; I spoke to him when I came back, but I did not ask what he had done with the sheep - I think there was a person walking with him at first; I did not count the sheep, there might be twenty-two or thirty-three.</p>

On Thursday, the 14th of March, I was in Mr. Richards' yard at work, and I saw two lambs come down Seward-street, between six and seven o'clock in the morning; they stopped there about ten minutes, and at last set off up Goswell-street-road; I sent my lad after them - he brought them back, and I put them into Mr. Richards' yard; the Police took them away - they were black-legged ones.</p>

            . I am a drover, and live in Eccleston-buildings. On the 13th of March I was at Southall-market; I saw Smith there, attending for his masters, Mr. Venables and Mr. Kimber - I saw him marking some sheep, he asked me to go home with them, which I did, as he had some beasts to drive home - I left the market before he did, and he overtook me on the road, and passed me about three miles beyond Tyburu-gate; I afterwards saw him near Gray's Inn-lane, Holborn, the same night; I joined him, and we drove the sheep to Cock-lane, where we parted them - Smith drove off seventy-seven, and left me with twenty-three, about a quarter past seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You were left in charge of twenty-three sheep while Venables' sheep were taken to Newgate-market? A. Yes; these twenty-three sheep were for Mr. Kimber in the New North-road, but I do not know the place.</p>

Not without examining it internally; the friends would not allow the body to be opened, and the Coroner did not see any particular reason for it - the prisoner was brought before the Inquest to give an account.</p>
               <p>Q. The two terms contracted are very much alike, and a boy making up a prescription might mistake one for the other? A. It is possible.</p>

            . I am an apothecary, and live in Tottenham-court-road. I saw the deceased on Sunday, the 31st of March, at No. 28, University-street; she had a nervous fever, and the tooth-ache; I prescribed for her - the prescription was written in the book, on the 1st of April; I prescribed among other things tinct. hydrosiamus; there had been a prescription immediately preceeding for hydrocianic acid for a patient - there was no prussic acid in what I prescribed for her; I saw her again directly her husband came for me on the Monday, after the prescription had been taken; I found the bottle with the label on it, for a table-spoonful to be taken every four hours - it had been prepared from my shop, and had been prepared by the prisoner; on smelling it, I believe prussic acid to form part of the contents of the bottle; she was hardly in existence when I saw her, the nerves were prostrate; I should suppose she died from the effect of the prussic acid, combined with the state she was in; there appeared to have been prussic acid in the bottle- I cannot say how it came there; the lable was in the hand-writing of the prisoner - she died within a few minutes after I saw her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Were you there when the medicine was sent out of the shop? A. I was not - I had but one assistant - the prisoner is eighteen years old.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he understand Latin? A. As far as I examined him; I did not examine him all through the pharmacopiae; I believe he understands Latin quite sufficiently to make up prescriptions - I never tried him to translate a page of Virgil; I should think I could do it myself; I certainly did not inquire whether he had learned his Latin Grammar - it is a question never asked - I say it ought not to be asked; I gave him no salary - he was to come to me on trial, and 3s. a week was to be given to him to pay the expences of washing until we made an agreement; there is a spaee of six or seven inches between the two prescriptions - Mrs. Latter's follows the other; the prisoner had been nearly a month with me; any one who had vision sufficiently to tell light from darkness, could tell which was which; he has made up prescriptions with prussic acid in them scores of times, and made them correctly; one or two drops is the commonest medicine in the world; I have taken as much pains as any body has ever done; the Coroner's Jury said I had not used due caution in taking his character; I mean to prove to the contrary - I had his character from Mr. Broughton, No. 44, Leather-lane.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Leather-lane. The prisoner was in my service between two and three years - he left two or three months back; I gave Mr. Clapham such a character as I considered he was justified in having - he was not a very well informed young man when he came to me, but being a relation of my wife's I paid particular attention to him; he knew the properties and character of prussic acid.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long ought a person to serve his apprenticeship before he dispenses medicines? A. In two or three months a person may make up prescriptions; it would take six or eight months, or perhaps twelve months to make up every prescription - I think it may be learned in that time by a person who did not know Latin; he came to me as shop-boy - I do not know what he had been before; I do not know that he is in any employ before he was with me; he was my wife's nephew - he did not know a syllable of Latin when he came to me; I considered the instruction I gave him quite a sufficient remuneration for his services - I consider when he left my shop his services would be worth 8s. or 9s. a week; he was not apprenticed to me at all - I dismissed him for his impertinence; I never had the least fault to find with him except for that, he acted as servant in my shop and cleaned my shoes, he was not entrusted to make up prussic acid or any thing of the sort - I never had a prescription come into my shop of that sort while he was with me; I am in a considerable business, and did not, in the two or three years, have a single prescription of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had, should you have thought him competent to mix it? A. I should have been very cautious in what I suffered him to do, if I had been there - I took him from the country.</p>

            . I am a Policeman, and live in University-street. The deceased was my wife - Mr. Curtis saw her; the four bottles produced are the medicine given her by direction of Mr. Clapham - Mr. Clapham saw her on Monday, the 1st of April, after she had taken this medicine; I ran for him in consequence of the symptoms she exhibited - he came directly; she was dying quite fast, and did not live ten minutes - her name was Mary Rocher Latter - I saw three table spoonfuls administered to her out of that bottle; she exhibited no symptoms of dying till after she took that medicine.</p>
               <p>MR. CURTIS. This is the bottle which contained the prussic acid - it now smells very decidedly of prussic acid- in my judgment she died from taking the prussic acid contained in the mixture; the dose supposed to have been given was sufficient to cause death, but I would not swear that much less would have done it.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see either Murray or Evans? A. Not till we were at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by PRENDERGAST. Q.Prothero was a Policeman, was he not? A. He was in a Police dress - I do not know whether he was employed in that very part; the Magistrate ordered me to be sent to gaol on a charge of being in possession of bad money; I was there five weeks, and I think I was discharged eight weeks ago to-day, I was discharged at Guildhall by Mr. Alderman Wood; I have been a labouring man all my life - I do not follow birdcatching regularly, only when I have nothing else to do; I have been in regular work - I used to work for Mr. Fenderman while he was alive - I used to work in the brick way - I never was a groom; I have lived about that neighbourhood all my life; when Perkins gave me the parcel, he told me it was money, but I did not know what it was - it was in a bit of paper - I could tell by feeling that it was money, but I did not look at it; I have stated all that he said to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not say before the Magistrate, that Perkins said, when he gave you the paper, that he would show you how to make these things? A. Yes; I forgot that - he said "some things," he did not say what; he told me that, not when he gave me the paper, but at the top of Fleet-market.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You have said some things, was not the expression such things? A. He said some things.</p>

               <p>MR PRENDERGAST. Q. Then he did say that to you? A. Yes; I did not ask him what sort of things he meant;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110120"/>I was not anxious to know - I did not ask him any thing; I have now told all that passed, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember saying before the Magistrate, that Perkins produced to you a bad half-crown? A. No, Sir, he did not produce one to me, nor I did not say so; my wife was in doors the night he came about the bird - I was not there till I was called; my wife was before the Magistrate - there was another person present with Prothero and Scott when I was taken, but I do not know who it was, I was so confused; I have seen Rose to-day - I have heard him say he was there when I was taken, but I do not know; I knew nothing of Rose till this business; we have seen one another every day since this business has been on in this Court, and we have drank on the road; I saw him one evening last week, as I was at work, just by Kennington-turnpike - I was loading a cart; we did not speak to one another for two minutes, as I could not stop - he called once at my house to let me know about coming up to the Session; he did not stop a minute; that was the same night as I saw him on the road - I had seen him at my house once before; I cannot tell when that was - he came down out of the road to my door, and stopped about two minutes; he came inside the door, but the door was not shut - he went into my room; I did not call him, he came of his own accord - he did not bring any message then.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear, that on that occasion, when Rose called on you, and came into your house, he did not stop more than two minutes? A. It might be two or three minutes - I will not swear it was not ten minutes; we had a pot of beer; we did not talk about this matter - he only asked me how I was, and I said, "I am very well, thank you, I hope you are the same;" he said he only called to see me - I had never seen him till we were up at Guildhall; I did not have any thing to say to him - when he called that day he took a drink of beer, and was off directly; the beer was fetched before he came in at the door - my wife fetched and paid for it; she had taken the money for fruit - I cannot say how long he stopped; I am certain he did not stop half an hour - I do not think it was a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear solemnly he did not stop half an hour? A. I cannot swear what time he did stop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.When he told you he would teach you to make some things, what answer did you make? A. I made him no answer at all, for he walked on as fast as he could, to meet his friend, but I was close behind him when he said that; I said, "I don't want to learn to make no things of no kind."</p>
               <p>Q. How came you tell me this instant that he walked on so fast you could not make him an answer? A. I did make him that answer - he walked on fast; I had no notion what things he meant, not the slightest - I have been in the brick way, gardening, and the like, and in digging.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever dig in church-yards? A. No; I was never taken up for any thing of that kind - I was never accused of doing any thing in a church-yard, only they give me the nick-name about our place of a body-snatcher - I have heard they call them recollection men; I do not know no more than what I have heard them talk about.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know what is meant by a body-snatcher? A. I really do not know what you mean by a body-snatcher, but what I have heard them say it is body stealing; they give me that nick-name - it is not the name I am known by; they do not say when I go about, "There goes Bill, the body-snatcher."</p>
               <p>Q. You have told my friend that Perkins gave you the money, and desired you not to put it into your pocket, for fear you should be robbed - did you ever say that when he gave you the money, he gave it you as security for the bird, and told you to take care of it till he had sold the bird? A. That is what he told me - he gave me that money to hold till he had sold the bird, and I was to take care of it till he came back with the money for the bird - I told the gentleman before what he said; I have given no different account of it to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I do not object to give you the very words - did you ever say any thing to this effect, that Perkins told you most people knew he was a regular smasher, and he did not wish to have the money about him? A. Not to me - he did not say so to me, nor did I say that he did, to my knowledge; I never said so in the presence of Martin, the City officer, nor to any body else. [Martin was here brought in.]</p>
               <p>Q. Did you to this man? A. No, Sir, I really think I did not; I cannot give you an answer, Sir, it is a thing that I know nothing at all about.</p>
               <p>COURT (reading the deposition)."He said he was well known." Q. Did he say he was a regular smasher? A. No, Sir, I never said so.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You say he said he was well known - was that the reason he gave you the money? A. No; he said when he was going into the public-house, that he was well known there, when he was going to have a pint of porter just at the top of Fleet-market; when he gave me the money he told me to keep it till he had sold the bird.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever say, "Perkins asked me to carry the money, because he was well known?" A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this your mark? (handing him his deposition) A. I cannot read; I cannot say, I do not think I made my mark before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Now he cautious, you were examined before the Magistrate, do you recollect being sworn to what you said, and do you recollect its being taken down in writing? A. Yes, and it was read over to me, but I do not think I put my mark to the paper.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Then you now say that neither before the Magistrate, nor elsewhere, you never said that Perkins begged you to keep the money, as he was well known? A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. (reads) "He (Perkins) asked me to carry the money, because he was well known" Witness Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not say to-day, that the reason he gave you for giving you the money was, to keep it till he sold the bird? A. Yes, that is very good.</p>
               <p>Q.Because he was well known? A. He said that when he went into the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. You first said he gave it you to hold until he sold the bird? A. Yes, that is the reason I say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say that he told you he was well known? A. No Sir, I never said that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you not tell me just now, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110121"/>before the Magistrate, you used these words, "Perkins asked me to carry the money, because he was well known?" A. No, I never said no such word.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were before the Magistrate - did you say "Just as we were coming out of my own door at Kennington, he gave me something in a paper that felt like money?" A. Yes, Sir - I also said, he said, "Put it somewhere where it will he safe;" I said, I had no where to put it but my pocket - he said, "Can't you put it into your hat."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say "I put it in my hat, and he shoved it under the lining?" A. Yes, Sir; I said he placed it after I put it into my hat; I said he said it was to pay bill.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had so said, did you not add, "He asked me to carry the money, because he was well known?" A. No, I did not make that answer - Perkins said that when he was going into the public-house - he said he was well known.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say "We came on together, and on the other side of Blackfriar's-bridge, he said he could tell me how to make such things?" A. Yes; I said I did not want to make such things, and he walked on as fast as he could.</p>
               <p>MR. BULLOCK. Q. He did say he was well known? A. Yes, that was at the public-house; there is no foundation for my nick-name - people have no right to call me a body-snatcher.</p>
               <p>Perkins. Q. You stated that the first drink we had together, I paid for? A. You paid for the first two pennyworth of rum; that was on the other side of the bridge from, here, on the left hand side in coming to the bridge - we had no rum in Farringdon-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were before Mr. Alderman Wood, did you not say that I told you I would learn you to make these things; that I showed you a shilling, and that I took some soot and salt, and rubbed it with? A. No; I never said no such word about it; I swore I had seen you three or four times before, and no more.</p>
               <p>Murray. Q. On Friday night last, between seven and eight o'clock, were you not in a public-house kept by Parker, close by Rose's, with your wife and Rose? A. No, not between seven and eight; we parted with Rose at the corner, just by where he lives - we went to a public-house, and had something to drink going home, but it was not at night, it was in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go to the fire-place, pull your hat off, fling it about, and say, "Here is the innocent man, and Rose well knows it?" A. I did not; I was not drunk - I have not been tipsy since this happened; I did not call at the Elephant and Castle.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. I know none of the prisoners but Perkins; I had seen him once or twice before the 17th of January, and on that evening he came about six o'clock - my husband was up stairs with the lodgers; I called my husband down to him - he had not said any thing to me, but he asked my husband if he had any birds; my husband said Yes - Perkins said "Put one in a bag or in a cage, and come along with me, for I know where to sell it for you for 2s. or half a crown;" my husband said he had no bag, but he had a small cage, and Perkins said that would do - (he mentioned that he wanted a cock linnet) the bird was then put into the cage - while my husband was gone to get the cage, Perkins took half a crown out of his pocket, gave it to me, and said, "Do you think this is a good half-crown;" I said, "Yes, it is good as far as I can see, but my eyes are bad" - he then said, "Should you take it?" I said Yes; my husband was then coming back with the cage - Perkins snatched the half-crown out of my hand, turned round, and laughed; when my husband and he were going out of the door, Perkins said to him, "I shall get you to carry this for me, as I am well known and you are not" - I did not hear my husband make any answer whatever; they then went out at the door - I did not see any thing produced when Perkins said this to my husband.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Was the word Perkins used this or these? A.This; and he said he had some more silver in his pocket, which he should give my husband to carry for him.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Do you know whether he did any thing with the half-crown? A. No - he had not been in my house before, that I know of; he had been to my stall where I sell fruit and a few birds - I have seen Rose to-day, but have not been talking to him - and I saw him when we were at Guildhall on this trial; I have seen him at this Court and at Guildhall, but no where else.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see him at a public-house last Friday? A. Yes, Sir, at the Rose.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Have you ever seen him at any other public-house? A.Never in my life: I do not know where Rose lives - I never was at his house but once; the Rose public-house is over the way, opposite this Court - we went in there, and had a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear you have not been in any other public-house with Rose, except at the Rose over the way? A. Yes, Sir, I have been in one very near Rose's house; I do not know the sign - I do not know the name of the street; Rose lives in the Westminster-road, but I could not find his house again - we were never in any other places together than I have named, to my knowledge; I have never been in any private house with him, nor seen him in any private house.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, upon your oath, has not Rose been at your own house in company with you and your husband? A. No, Sir, he came to the door, but did not hardly stop one moment; that was the last Wednesday that ever was - he came to tell us that we had been ordered to attend the Old Bailey on Friday, which was a mistake; we were to attend on Thursday instead; he did not come in at the door - it rained very hard, and he said he was out on business; my husband was not at home - he was out loading some road-dirt for a gentleman; he came home a few moments after Rose was gone - I never saw Rose at our house on any other occasion; I am well assured he was not - I cannot recollect whether he did, he is such a total stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that he did not come to your house, and remain in the house with your husband and you, and that you fetched beer for him? A. I think I recollect his coming one evening, and we sent for a pot of beer, as he said he was dry; I now recollect it very well indeed,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110122"/>but I did not give it a thought before - I think it is a month ago; I think it is since the last Session - I remember his calling, and I was going home with my stall at the time; he sat down a few moments with me and my husband - we did not finish all the beer; I paid for the beer with my own money.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were these at the public-house near Rose's? A. I am sure I cannot tell; there was my husband and me. Rose and his wife, and I believe his daughter - we all went over the bridge together after we were ordered away from here; they said they were going to have a pot of beer - we had one or two pots.</p>

            . I am clerk to the Magistrates at Guildhall. On the 18th of January I took a deposition against Lowe for having bad money in his possession; it was read to Scott and Prothero, and they signed it - there were afterwards two or three examinations, in which Lowe and Rose were made witnesses; what they said is in the depositions.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. After the depositions, were made did you hear the prisoners say any thing? A. I have two or three different statements at different times; on the 2nd of February, after the deposition was read over, Prothero and

             both said they had been led into it by Rose - Evans then said "I know nothing of it; I never had any dealings with the man in my life" - Perkins was there, but he did not say any thing; on the 28th of January Murray only was in custody, and Scott made a deposition against him - Scott said, "I know the prisoner, he came to fetch me to take Lowe into custody; he said, there were two men on Holborn-hill that he suspected had bad money in their possession - I went with him, and he pointed out Lowe, who was standing against the lamp-post; I took him to the station, searched him, and found the bad money in his hat - I have seen Prothero the officer and Murray frequently together; he went with us to Kennington the same evening, when we went to try to find out what sort of a character Lowe was - I never saw the prisoner and Perkins together" - on the 30th of January Perkins was in custody, and Mr. and Mrs. Lowe gave their evidence against him; after the evidence Perkins said -</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Has there been any statement of Perkins' which has been reduced to writing, and signed by him? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you, by looking at that paper, so far refresh your memory as to state that was what he said? A. Yes, my Lord, he said at first he had no question to ask of the witnesses; he then said, that on Saturday Lowe had been tutoring his wife - he said they had been employed by Mr. Powell in several cases, and had received about 30l. from him - he said that

            . I am a butcher, and live at No. 6, Charles-street, Westminster-road. I recollect when Lowe was taken on this charge - I had seen Evans about two months, or nine weeks before Lowe's business - Evans came to my house one afternoon, and said,"Are you doing any business now for the Mint" - I said, No, I was not - he said, "Have you any objection to doing business along with two or three friends of mine over the water, who are two City officers?"- I consented, and said, "When can I see them?" - he said, "If you will be in the way to-morrow evening, from six to seven o'clock, I will call for you" - he called the next evening, and I accompanied him to the Horse and Groom, in Blackfriars-road - he had told me that his friends over the water had plenty of money to go to work with - we got to the Horse and Groom between seven and eight at night, and he introduced me to Scott, Prothero, and Murray - after sitting a little while, he said to Scott, "This is my friend," (meaning me) - Scott said to me, "You have done business for the Mint before, I understand?" - I said, Yes - he then said, "Have you any objection to go into business along with us?" - I said not - he said, "Can you get me a man or two over the water for possession (I understood he meant to have counterfeit money on their persons) - I said I could not get them, I did not know where to find them; but I told him I knew two or three informers on our side the water whom I would introduce to him - that was all that passed then on that subject - I afterwards went to the Horse and Groom again, and I introduced

I was employed at No. 8, Pavement; I do not know the day - I had been there at work for three or four days before the things were stopped; the prisoner employed me to take down some fixtures there - I took down an iron safe, some partitions, and other things; I took down a cistern, and the prisoner assisted me - I took down some lead pipes, but the prisoner was not there then; I took that down by direction of young Mr. Poole.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not all this done in open day? A. Yes, there was no disguise about the prisoner; there were four persons at work there; these things were put into a van in the open day - there was no attempt to cover them. I remember the officer coming, and the prisoner demanded to know by what authority he came there - the prisoner said he had a right to the fixtures; he did not give me directions not to hurt the house, but I understood that was what he intended - I acted as I would in any case between landlord and tenant.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You took down two cisterns? A. Yes, on account of Mr. Richards; and they were taken to my father's - one was taken from the yard, and the other from over the water-closet; there were three cisterns in all, and they were all taken to my father's.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you take down any thing but what was in your inventory? A. Yes, some partition, which Herdsfield said he found in the cart; we took down the window-sash, because Lowe said it would tumble - and some doors were taken down by mistake, to remove some of the articles, and they were put into the van, but not by my order.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. They were taken by mistake, and returned? A. We should have returned them if we could have got into the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What were the partitions you mentioned? A.Partitions in the shop, which I understand were put up by Mr. Adams - I think we were about an hour taking them down; they were wedged up from the floor - there was a sort of leg for them to stand on distinct from the fabric of the house - I understood Mr. Adams was attending there on account of his sisters Eliza and Anna Maria; I did not remove any articles but what I understood were claimed by the tenant - I superintended the removal of every thing; some three-quarter pipe was removed - it was such as would be put up by the tenant, and I have understood since that Mr. Adams put it up; we did not remove the large pipe which carried the water from the roof - Herdsfield came on the Saturday night, turned us all out, and took the names of the persons who were there, he pushed me off the step, locked the doors, and left a man in possession; he said he did not care, he had good backers, and Mr. Adams might do as he liked.</p>

            . I am a copperamith, and live in Golden-lane. I had seen the prisoner before he brought the lead to my house, which was on the 23rd of February; he had come before to inquire what price I gave - I said 9s. a cwt.; he said, he would send some, and he came with the cart - I asked where he came from; he said he was a dealer, and said, "We are pulling down some houses in the Old Bailey;" there were some lead cisterns cut in two, and some lead pipe - I paid him 5l. for it; he called on me again about three weeks ago, and said, "I understand you want to see me about this lead;" I said, "You have given me a great deal of trouble about it;" he said, "You have mentioned that I told you I brought it from the Old Bailey;" I do not think I made him any answer - he said, "Well, all I want is for a man to speak the truth, for I am sure no Jury can convict me for what I have done;" after I had settled with him for the lead, he said he had another wooden cistern lined with lead, which he thought he should take to the sale-room, as it would fetch more money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Was any one present when this observation took place about his pulling down houses at the Old Bailey? A. No; I did not deny to Herdsfield that I had bought any lead - I buy lead every day.</p>
               <p>Q.You say the prisoner said "You said that I told you I brought the lead from the Old Bailey," why did you not make him an answer? A. I did; I said, "So you did."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell my Lord distinctly, that you made no answer? A. I did not understand the question; when he said all he wanted was for a man to speak the truth, I said certainly, I should do it; my daughter was there - I do not know that she heard it.</p>

            . I am an appraiser. I was employed by Mr. Pitt to make an inventory of the goods which had been seized for King's taxes, at No. 8, Pavement - I made an inventory of all that was liable to be seized as tenant's fixtures; there were three leaden cisterns in the house, but only one belonged to the tenant as I considered - we wanted more money, I should have taken more if we could - we wanted 44l., and what we took fetched but 16l. 3s. - I left my inventory with Mr. Pitt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you leave Poole there? A. I think he was; there were three cisterns on the premises - I think we left two behind; we took only one, there certainly are not two in my inventory - I do not know when the house was shut up; we condemned on the 18th, and the things were removed before the 23rd, I should think.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. There was a water-closet - was that a tenant's fixture? A. To all intents and purposes a landlord's fixture.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could you at all judge, from the mode in which that water-closet was put up, whether it had originally been put up with the house, or put up afterwards by the tenant? A. No, I cannot tell; it might have been put up by the tenant, but it belonged to the landlord - some fifteen years ago I saw the same water-closet there, because I was then about taking the premises; the ground floor was then adapted for a private residence, and was in Mr. Selig's occupation - it has since been converted into three shops, by putting up partitions, which was most likely done by the tenant; the original front had been taken out, and a court-yard had been inclosed, since I saw it fifteen years ago - I cannot tell how many cisterns were there then.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not the front sash cut to make a place for a fishmonger? A. It appeared to he cut for the purpose of taking out the glass with more facility - it might have answered for a fishmonger.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was not the frame and glass removed in one piece? A. No, part of it was evidently broken, part of the broken sash remained on the premises - the frame part was left, but that which holds the panes of glass in was removed; the shutters were up; if they had not been up, the whole would have been open - the manner in which it was done led me to the impression that it was done for the purpose of taking the glass away.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q.Was this a part of the house? A. Most unquestionably.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. That shop front could not have been let with the premises? A.Certainly not.</p>

            . I am an attorney. I produce the commission of bankruptcy against the prisoner's brother.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My brother purchased the lease of Selig in 1822 - the premises then consisted of a private dwelling-house, and he contracted with a carpenter in Cullum-street, to alter it into three shops - the centre one he occupied himself; he paid the carpenter 300l., and he laid out about 200l. more, and Mr. Selig had expended 1500l. or 2000l. on it; in 1824 my brother became a bankrupt, but he had previously mortgaged the lease for 300l., and the assignees would have nothing to do with it; my sisters were partners with him in his trade, but he was a bankrupt on his own separate account; the trade paid in full, and my sisters purchased of the assignees his one-third interest in these premises - of course I need not say that, when my brother laid out this money, he had no idea that the City would take them down; but when the City took it in their heads to take these premises down, they gave notice (on the 12th or 13th of February) to the tenants to remove; the object of the tenants then was to dispose of the fixtures, and my sisters employed me to take them down, to sell them to the best advantage; I said, "There are King's taxes due, and the King has power to come in, and, as you are going away, the best way would be for

             to put Poole in possession" - but the King's tax-gatherer came in, and distrained; I saw my brother, and said, "It is not worth while to stand out - let them take the things;" he agreed not to act; Poole however remained by desire of my sisters; the fixtures were appraised, and my sisters purchased them, and the whole of the property again became my sisters'; we were proceeding to remove them, when, on the Saturday evening, one of the men came to me and told me to go down - I went, and saw Herdsfield; I said, "What is all this about?" he said, "I act under the orders of the City Comptroller - I have orders to stop every thing coming from the premises, and I shall take possession of the house;" he said, "I understand you have stripped the lead off the roof," and he went up to see, but he was afraid to get out on the roof; he said a great many things had been taken away - I said,"We have taken the things we have paid for;" he said he had nothing to do with it, that he was employed by Mr. Hookey; he then asked the men their names, and said, observe, "I do not insist upon their giving their names and address, but I advise them to do it" - I gave mine, and he put it down; he them said, "It is very well you gave your names, or I should have locked you up;" he then said,"The next thing is, you must walk out," and he pushed us out, and left a man in possession - I went to Mr. Poole and was telling him the facts, and in a few minutes Herdsfield came in; he called for a light, which brought out Mr. Poole, who said, "What is all this about?" Herdsfield said, "I am a City officer, I came to see what you have got" - he said his name was Herdsfield; Mr. Poole said,"I desire you to show your authority or warrant;" he said he had none, but he came by order of Mr. Hookey - Mr. Poole desired him to walk out, but I said "We have done nothing that we are ashamed of, let him see what we have;" he then said he was not a judge, but Mr. Montague would come on Monday - on the Monday I was there; the patrol came, and said he came from Mr. Newman, who gave his compliments, and desired that nothing should be removed; I said it should not - the articles were then in the yard; on the Tuesday Mr. Poole was summoned to show cause why he detained certain property; and on the next day he was summoned before Alderman Wilson, to know why these things were removed - on the Saturday I went to the Justice-room, where the witnesses for the prosecution were present; I was ordered to stand before Mr. Ald. Wilson, who read over the evidence of Lowe and another, who had been examined - I said if any charge<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110126"/>existed, it should be made against myself, as they had been employed by me; he discharged them, and ordered me to find bail, and I was detained till four o'clock. when my friends arrived, and bail was given of two house-keepers, in 20l. each; on the Tuesday I went again before Alderman Wilson, and was examined in a private room; no clerk was present, but the deposition was taken by Mr. Newman, and I was committed for trial - when my brother took the house it was the private residence of Mr. Selig: he divided it into three shops and three separate dwellings, and was obliged to erect water-closets in each of them, and to take water from the yard to supply them, and also a sink and a cistern for domestic purposes - the one which was for himself was on the third story; he made one attic his own kitchen, and carried the pipe from the street to it - there was also a kitchen in the further part of the premises, but no cistern to that; with respect to the cistern in the yard, weighing five or six cwt., it was purchased by my brother when he went into the place - the real fact of the case is, that I was too much of an Englishman to put up with this City possession; and I told Herdsfield I would bring an action against him, and thus they have instituted this charge of felony. But I am here to abide your verdict, and all I ask for is justice at your hands - I ask for no mercy, I have committed no offence.</p>

            . I am a labouring man, and live in Castle-ride, Castle-place, near Castle-alley. On the 23rd of June last, I was in Joseph Smith's premises, who then lived in Castle-alley; there is no number on the door - I was at work on his premises all that day; he had a taxed cart there and harness - I was cleaning the harness that afternoon, inside the gates, in his warehouse or shed; Smith was not at home that afternoon, but there was a cartand a van belonging to him, both at home that afternoon - they never were absent from the premises; there is no entrance for a cart or horse but through the gates, and they were not open all that afternoon - I was on the premises all the afternoon, but at dinner time; if any goods had come and a cart had been backed into these premises, I must have heard it; there was no cart came near the premises in my hearing - there was no room for any cart to have come into these premises for the cart and van which were there; I know Allum - he lived in Castle-place; I cannot tell the number - I know the house; it is up in the corner, in a narrow part.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Where do you live now? A. At No. 10, New Market, Finsbury. In October last, I lodged in Castle-ride, Whitechapel; I made an affidavit for Mr. Smith to get him bailed, by desire of Mr. Harmer's clerk - Mr. Smithers went down with me; this was in October last - the trial did not come on here till November; I was here, but was not called as a witness - I came by my own wish, to see my friend done justice by.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you stated in your affidavit that you were there all day, that Smith was not at home, and that it was impossible he should have received the goods? A. Yes, I stated it at Mr. Harmer's; I know the premises very well, and no cart came near the premises that afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever taken into custody on these pre- premises? A. Yes, I was; I cannot tell the day - it might be on the 25th of June; I was charged with letting a cart out - the man who hired it came as I was going to bed, and wanted a cart to bring a box to the Bull-inn, Aldgate; I do not know whether there was a cart let out, for driving of which, I was charged with stealing goods.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You made this affidavit - was it for the purpose of Smith being let out on hail? A. Oh no, quite different - it was not to procure bail for him, it was to tell the whole truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not that Smith might, by your telling the truth, he let out on bail? A. No, to tell the real truth - I know no other reason.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I will give you five minutes before you go into the dock; look at that paper - upon the oath you have taken, was not that affidavit made by you for the purpose of getting Smith let out on bail? - answer that question. A.What question, Sir? I mean to speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not trifle, or I will commit you to Newgate - Did you make that affidavit in order that he might get out on bail? A. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I will ask you one more question - When you were stating the facts in favour of Mr. Smith, in order that he might go out on bail, did you mention a word that he was not at home on the 23rd of June? A. I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Read it - Now, when you were sworn for the purpose of Smith being let out on bail, did you mention one word about his not being at home on the 23rd of June? A. I said as that represents, and no more.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined By MR. BODKIN. Q. All this you saw very distinctly? A. Yes, I was at the window when the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110127"/>cart first came down Castle-street - there were two or three men with it; I did not notice whether one bad a whip - there was one man had hold of the horse's head, and two were at the tail, taking out the goods; one of the men took out the bag, and carried it into Allum's - I cannot say whether they knocked at the door; I did not see Allum - I did not see the other packages taken out. I went away from the window - I have lived a year and three months there; I know Smith by sight - I was not at his trial; I did not want to have any thing to say in this business, but I was subpoenaed about a fortnight ago.</p>

            . I am landlady of the last witness. I was at home that afternoon - I saw a large cart from five to six o'clock - I was in my front room on the ground floor- I saw the cart turn the corner of Castle-place, and go up Castle-alley as far as Smith's gates - it remained there a few minutes, but the gates were never opened - the cart then backed down Castle-alley, and up Castle-place - Allum lived at No. 4, Castle-place - I did not see what was done with the contents of the cart, but it passed my window in ten minutes empty - I had seen two large boxes and a sort of canvas bag in it - I never saw the officer - I saw him bring a man afterwards to measure Smith's gates.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time of day did you see the cart? A.Between five and six o'clock - I was at my own window - Mrs. Warner made a remark about it - I saw some men with the cart, but I cannot say how many; there might be two or three; there was one at the horse's head to back it - the cart made a great noise, the stones are very rough there - I do not know whether any one on Smith's premises must have heard it, I never was there - I told what I saw to Mr. Frost, a neighbour, but I was not called on the trial.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Which way did it pass when empty? A. The same way as it came, down Castle-place, and I suppose down Castle-street, but I did not see it - I had seen it go up Castle-alley as far as Smith's, and then back into Castle-place - I did not tell this before Smith was tried; it might be a week, a fortnight, or a month after he was tried - when I was in at Mr. Frost's, and several neighbours were there talking about it; Mrs. Warner called to me, and said, "Mrs. Gray, do you see that large cart going up the alley?" I looked, and said Yes - I heard of Smith being taken up, but I did not state what I had seen, and I should not have come now if I had not been subpoenaed.</p>

            , my master, in Castle-alley, on the 23rd of June - Smith, the man who was convicted, had premises nearly opposite; I saw a cart about half-past five o'clock that day - it had two boxes and a sort of bale in it; it was standing at the bottom of Castle-alley when I saw it - and I heard it go away when I went to my work; Smith's gates were not open when I went by - I did not see what became of the goods in the cart; but I saw a man in the act of unloading it at the bottom of Castle-alley, fifteen or twenty yards from Smith's.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw it unloading in Castle-alley? A. Yes - it stood parallel with Castle-place, in Castle-alley; the back of the cart was towards Castle-place; I never saw it move at all - I was coming from my tea at half-past five o'clock, and saw it stand there - they were unloading it; I am now in business for myself; I heard it go away - it made sufficient noise at the distance of twenty yards for me to hear it.</p>

            . On the 23rd of January I drove a cart for him; after I had finished that job, I met Ellis, and I drove to Dent's, in Friday-street, where I took three packages, which I took to Castle-alley - I do not know what goods they were - Ellis desired me to take them; I did not know that they were stolen - when I got to Castle-alley, they were taken out by Ellis, Wall, and Pedley - the cart stood in Castle-alley; I stood in the cart and delivered the goods to them - no one stood at the horse's head that I know of - I did not back my cart into Smith's premises.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How near were you to Smith's? A.About ten yards to where the cart was unloaded - I did not see Smith that day; I do not know where the goods went - they went up Castle-place - my cart was No. 152, 884; I have taken it to Smith's premises, and tried to back it in, but could not, there was not room; I saw Groves on the subject of giving evidence; she said to me, when I was in the Pitt's Head, public-house, that I had better say as she did, as I had a large family.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you remember the officer taking you on this business? A. Yes - I told him I knew nothing about the transaction, which I did not, at that time, as I have so many goods in the course of a day; I was taken up three or four months after; I was told what it was for, and I said I knew nothing about it; I told the officer I would tell him all I knew about it; I was taken on a Friday, and on the Saturday I went to Worship-street, and as I said I was willing to tell what I knew, I was allowed to be a witness; I was directed to go to Smith's in Castle-alley, by the man who put the goods into the cart; I received 10s. for my fare.</p>
