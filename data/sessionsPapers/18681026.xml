I think; I have a memorandum with me, I don't know the exact amount—I have not received any money from Goodman &amp; Co., we have received altogether about 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was not at all aware that the prisoner was trading on his own account, or consigning goods abroad—I saw the prisoner in the presence of Mr. Bailey, Mr. Stead's solicitor, I think about the 7th or 8th, after Mr. Stead had come up from Cumberland—the prisoner made a general statement as to the manner in which he had disposed of the money he had embezzled: he simply went over the letter that he had handed to me, and endorsed it—I think he gave Mr. Bailey some bills at that time: he was not represented by a solicitor, and Mr. Bailey advised him to get one, and he told him that whatever he might say or do would not alter the case, at all, that he was still crimi<lb/>nally responsible—I think he replied that he knew it, or something to that effect; he did not dispute it: he said he was quite content to allow the matter to remain in Mr. Bailey's hands, he wished to do all he could to recoup Stead &amp; Co.</p>

               <p>in December—the prisoner was given into custody in July—we gave him into custody because we found insult was being added to injury, bad was being made worse, we were simply being trifled with—I do not know that there is an agreement in existence as to the terms upon which the prisoner was engaged; as far as I know, there was none—I will not swear that I have not seen one, I don't remember it—the prisoner handed over other securities besides those mentioned in this list, they are in Mr. Bailey's possession—it did not turn out that in the account the prisoner gave he had overstated the amount due by him to the firm by 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or any amount—he allowed a servant who was in our employ 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, supposed to be from his own private income, and afterwards he debited it to the firm—there was a sum overcharged—I am not prepared to say how much, but a great portion of it was not legitimate; some portion I have no doubt was, I am not prepared to say how much—I found that he had given a most ample account of every single halfpenny that he had misapplied—I said to him, "The amount you set forth which you can hand over does not amount to the sum you are deficient, have you not anything more?"—this was before I knew Mr. Bailey—I told Mr. Bailey everything I had done, and left the matter in his hands—the prisoner afterwards handed me this paper, it contains these items: "H. Burgees &amp; Co., 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; Gillard &amp; Co., 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>; Austin, 139<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; my bond, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he gave me 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think, in January or February—that was not after the accountant had reported—I think at the time he gave me the list he gave me a promissory note, a bill, or something for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been paid over to me; I gave it over to the firm—the prisoner told me it was raised by a bill of sale on his furniture—I knew at that time that he had committed a felony—I knew nothing about com<lb/>promising it, I thought my duty was to get as much of the firm's money as possible; it was simply to get back the firm's own money—I did not intend to get the money and also to prosecute—the matter was not in my hands—my intention was to get as much money as I possibly could—I had no right to do anything—I did not do it with the authority of Mr. Stead; he did not know I was doing it—he got the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he refused it at the time I took the bond—when I handed over the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he knew it came from the prisoner, and he took it—I have seen the prisoner's wife about half a dozen times—I think she came, to see me, I don't remember exactly what about—I went on one occasion to get some information respecting some accounts which we had presented, and which were said to have been paid, and we found no record of them—I did not go to obtain information that would enable us to realize the amount, it was about a matter referring to our books—I wanted to know where Mr. Ewin was, so that I might get the information—I think that was about February or January—it was after he had absented himself from Mr. Harper's, that was in February, I think—Mrs. Ewin did not tell me where her husband was, she said she would communicate with him—I think I went to her once again with Sergeant Haydon—he had a warrant at that time—he was not told not to execute it, or to hold it over, or to abstain from using it for any time, that I aware of—I am not aware of any arrangement that it should not be served for four months, or two months—I have not heard that such an arrangement was discussed—I applied at the Mansion House for a warrant—I am not aware that I told the officers there anything about the arrangement for giving up the securities—I won't swear that I did not—it is so long ago I don't remember—I may or may not, I have no idea.</p>

                  </hi>. I am solicitor to Mr. Stead, and have been for some time—on the 9th or 10th December, Mr. Stead, Mr. Hodson, and the prisoner came to my office—an explanation was given by Mr. Stead of the purport of that visit, and I said to the prisoner, "This a very serious case, and I think you ought to have some solicitor representing you here"—he said, "I don't want one, I have well thought over what it is my duty now to do. I feel the seriousness of my position, and I am prepared to give you, without any solicitor being present, the fullest information, to enable Stead &amp; Co. to recover back the monies which I have defrauded them of"—I said that before my clients could determine what course to adopt, they must have a full investigation made into their books, and the course I had advised them to adopt was to place the books in the hands of an accountant; that if he was disposed to give every information and assistance to that accountant to make up the books, he could do so, but he must plainly under-stand that that course would not prevent, in any shape or way, the adoption of criminal proceedings if they determined upon investigation to adopt them—he said he was willing to assign all his property over to Messrs, Stead—I asked him whether he owed anything to anybody else—he said nothing but a few trifling debts to his tradesmen—I declined to listen to any assignment, and said, "I only want to know what are the assets in your hands belonging to Messrs. Stead"—I went through the list of assets seriatim, and he stated that each of them was the produce of monies belonging to Messrs. Stead—I mean the list appended to the letter which he produced on the first occasion—he said as to one of them, the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from himself, he would give a bill or a bond for it, which I pooh-poohed, and said it was nonsense his proposing to give security to my clients—as to the others, he said they were all the produce of Stead &amp; Co.'s money—I said I would appoint an accountant, and make an appointment for him to go into the matter, and if he chose to attend, I would give him notice, so that he might do so—I appointed Mr. Harper, and gave notice to the prisoner to attend—I believe he did attend at Mr. Harper's, according to Mr. Harper's report, that I received from him on 10th February—I have it here—substantially it amounted to what the prisoner stated originally, with some trifling difference—it has been sub<lb/>sequently mentioned by Mr. Harper that there was some discrepancy which arose on a question of discount being allowed, that would reduce the sum</p>

               <p>with which the prisoner debited himself some 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think with that exception the list of defalcations he had furnished was substantially correct—no doubt as to sums debited to any particular firm it could on inquiry have been ascertained whether they owed it or not, but I did not examine the books myself—the prisoner offered on that occasion three bills of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, accepted by a person of the name of Gillard, that he said he had discounted with Messrs. Stead's money—I made inquiries about Gilard, found they were worthless, and refused to take them—500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been received from one of the sureties, and Mr. Hodson received some 340<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, altogether about 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been realized—I subsequently put the matter into the hands of Mr. Humphreys, and about the 24th February, by his advice, a warrant was applied for and obtained—that was after I had received a communication with regard to Mr. Tabet, and after I had entered into correspondence with Mr. Benham.</p>

               <p>certain letters, and they are here—I will refer to my letter-book—here is a letter that was written by a clerk of mine—Mrs. Ewin called on me, and I read to her extracts from a letter from Mr. Stead—I may hare read words to the effect: "Mr. Hodson will be in London shortly, and if he has any interview with Mrs. Ewin, an arrangement may be effected, and the matter must stand over till then"—I have no doubt that was about the 22nd July—I acted in two actions as the prisoner's attorney under these circum<lb/>stances, he stated he had applied some of Stead &amp; Co.'s monies to dis<lb/>counting a bill for a man named Austin, and he brought an action against him—the proceeds of that action were Stead &amp; Co.'s, and he himself sug<lb/>gested that I should be changed as the attorney, so that I might carry on the action that was virtually Stead &amp; Co.'s action—I acted in his name, but it was an action simply brought by him as trustee for Stead &amp; Co.—there was another case in which I acted in that same manner; that was an interpleader summons under precisely similar circumstances—I got 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I paid to Stead &amp; Co.—I did not get my own costs, not a farthing—it was an interpleader summons, and the money was in Court—the pri<lb/>soner told me he had made an advance of Stead &amp; Co.'s monies to Benham, exceeding 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which Benham had agreed to give him a mortgage—upon that I gave Benham notice that the advances were made out of my client's monies, and that, in point of law and equity, they were entitled to the charge—Benham proceeded to give me evidence of his title—the other letter appeared long after the prisoner had absconded—I stated that I refused to enter into the title until I had received 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for doing so—Mrs. Ewin told me her husband was in France or Spain, and out of our reach—I did not entertain some proposals by which he should give information—I told her I would not put my clients to any-further expense, because I believed it was all moonshine about Benham't security, unless she deposited 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with me—I may possibly have said, "I won't open the papers unless you give me 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that was at a very late period, when he was in Spain, or Pimlico—I had opened the papers, and considered them—I did not hear from Haydon that he could serve the warrant when it was obtained—I did not instruct him, Mr. Humphreys did—I learnt from Haydon that he could not find the prisoner anywhere until three or four days before his arrest—I did not tell Haydon not to serve the warrant, or hold it over; I swear that—Haydon asked me if the reward was still in existence—we had offered 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in February, and advertised for the prisoner continually—Haydon said that persons came and volunteered to give information if they could get the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I would communicate with Mr. Stead, and see whether he was tired out of the matter, or whether he would still insist upon prosecuting—I did communicate with him, and in the meantime the man was arrested—I did not tell Haydon not to execute the warrant, or to delay it—he told me the parties would not give information without know<lb/>ing that the reward would be paid—I did not convey to him that I wished it delayed, not in any way—I told Mrs. Ewin that we were willing to keep the warrant back for two or four months—she did not say that if we did so he would be able to clear the whole debt, nothing of the kind—I offered to hold over the warrant because she told me he was in Spain, and we were unable to arrest him—I wanted information about these various securities—I suppose there is a firm of Tabet abroad—I don't know it of my own knowledge; I have no doubt of it—I presume they are merchants at Beyrout—I don't know whether they are Greeks; the name is more like</p>

Tabet Brothers in which they stated the account had been settled long since—no doubt there was an account two or three years ago—the transaction as to Goodman &amp; Co. was this: the prisoner stated that he had advanced money to Baker, trading as Goodman, Baker &amp; Co., and that, to cover him, he had taken the house and business of an auctioneer carried on under that name—the sum of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was offered for that, under the guarantee of possible possession by Mr. Stead; that I advised him not to give, as there were rival claims to the property—there was an assignment of a debt due from Warry &amp; Burgess for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not get a farthing from that—I did not demand 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mrs. Ewin in reference to that transaction; I swear that; nor any other sum.</p>

I am in the service of Stephen Sadler, of Brick Lane, a sweetstuff shopkeeper—on 18th September, the prisoner came in for one pennyworth of sweets, and gave me a shilling, which I put in the till, where there was no other shilling—about an hour afterwards, Mary Ann Sadler found two bad shillings in the till in my presence, one was nailed down to the counter, the other was broken to pieces, and thrown away—the prisoner came again next day for a halfpenny worth of biscuits, and gave me a shilling, I tried it in the detector, and told her it was bad—she said she did not know it—I gave it to Mrs. Sadler, who asked the prisoner where she got it—she said she had been cleaning steps—she was given into custody.</p>

Q.</hi> How long have you lived at 29, Stockwell Park Crescent? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The last twelve months, but in the parish at least ten years—I was asked at the Police-Court whether I had had only two transactions with Harris, and I said "Yes"—I now say that I never had any other transaction with him—when I made that statement at the Police-Court, I was under the firm belief that the only two transactions I mentioned, the diamond ring and the watch, were the only two I have had; but since that, it came to my recollection that about eighteen months ago I had a parcel of watches, on which I raised some money, and out of those watches Harris bought several, I think twelve or fifteen—he paid the money to the other party—that transaction quite slipped my memory—the woollen cloth trans<lb/>action was seven years ago—I have heard Harris examined at the Police-Court—I heard him say he had had several transactions with me within the last three or four years—I did not say I did not know Harris—I did not know him intimately at all—I never had him at my private residence—he would know nothing of my private affairs—I never saw Frankle in my life, till the day I was arrested—my only motive for writing the address on the envelope was good nature—I am positive I never saw it again until I was at the Police-Court—Inspector Thomson did not show it to me; that I am sure about—I swear, to the best of my belief, that he did not show it to me—I will swear my attention was not called to it by Thomson—as far as I know about the matter, I will swear positively it was not—I will not swear to that point positively—I could only have been shown it at the police-station, and what happened there I don't know—I did not say to Thomson that I had never seen it in my life, certainly not; I swear that positively, nothing of the kind—I never said so to anybody—on my solemn oath I did not know anything about these Russian forgeries—I say, most distinctly, I was not acquainted with the system of Russian forgery that was going on; I knew nothing at all about it—there never was anything against me before this charge; I swear to that, no charge of any kind in this country—I am a Prussian—there was a charge against me, in Prussia, for forging a bill of exchange—I did not run away; I went away—I did not keep out of the way—no reward was offered for my apprehension—I never heard of it; I swear that most distinctly—I was not convicted, or found guilty, or sentence passed on me—it is utterly false that a sentence of three yean was passed upon me in my absence; no sentence of any kind was passed, it is utterly false—I was not advertised for in the Belgian papers; I never heard of it—I was charged with forging several bills of exchange, which were accepted by my brother-in-law and drawn by myself—I never have forged a bill in my life, and I will tell you how it was—the case was not tried—on my solemn oath, there was no trial upon it, nor any legal investigation, to my knowledge—this was in Berlin—I left there on 24th December, 1857; I remained away to the present moment—(<hi rend="italic">Looking at a paper</hi>) this is quite correct; I was advertised for—you asked me if I was advertised for in Belgium; I was advertised for in my own country—I absconded from justice, through advice I had on very high</p>

Burningham, of Throgmorton Street, and they sold them to Mr. Louis Cohen, the broker of Rothschild's—it is not the fact that I took a good deal of interest in these Russian forgeries; none whatever, except interest in what is in the papers, when there are speeches made by Mr. Serjeant Ballantine, they are always interesting—I took no interest in, and knew nothing about these matters—I have been lucky and unlucky in my acquaintances—I knew Hol<lb/>chester, I made his acquaintance at a German coffee-house—I know that he was sentenced to twelve years' penal servitude for forging Russian notes—I never had any business with the man in my life—I had seen him, but never bad any transaction with him—I had known him some months before he was taken into custody—I used to see him very often, meeting him in the coffee-house in the afternoon—he was of my persuasion—he was not from Germany, and I don't know where from—he was not an English Jew—I used to see him pretty constantly at the coffee-house—to my astonishment he was taken of for forging Russian rouble notes—I should think that is three or four years ago—I did know that such things were going on—the knowledge of forged rouble notes did not come upon me entirely by surprise—I have read of a great many cases—I was not in communication with Holchester's wife while he was in prison—I will swear I was not—I did not call upon her by his desire while he was in prison—I did not see him while he was in prison—I say most distinctly that I did not see anything of Mrs. Holchester during the time he was in prison—I swear most distinctly I was not at the house—</p>

                  </hi>. I was one of the crew of the <hi rend="italic">Hatfield Brothers</hi>—I joined her on her last voyage—she sailed from Philadelphia—she belonged to Yarmouth, Nova Scotia—she carried the English flag—William Hatfield was the master, the same person that I saw before the English Consul at Bordeaux—on 17th September the vessel was in the Garonne, on the 18th she anchored about half way up the river towards Bordeaux, near Panillac—she was afloat about 300 yards from the shore, on the nearest side—the river is about half a mile wide at that point—the tide flows there—the prisoner was one of the crew, also John Williams, the deceased—the crew consisted of four seamen, two mates, and the captain—the four seamen were myself, Wellesley, the prisoner, and Williams, the deceased—he was a bigger man than the prisoner—previous to this occurrence, on the 18th, the prisoner and the deceased were on good terms—up to that time the prisoner was well-behaved, and a quiet, orderly fellow—the deceased was in good health previous to this occurrence, doing his duty on board as usual—I did not see the commencement of the dispute between the prisoner and deceased on the 18th—Wellesley called me and said there was a row in the forecastle and to go in—I ran from the fore part of the ship to the forecastle, where they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186810260041"/>
               <p>were, and saw the two men in a struggle together—the prisoner had only just come on board, we had been ashore, I went forward, and he went into the forecastle—when I went in they were struggling together—Anderson had Williams by the whiskers, and Williams had Anderson by the throat—they were on their feet at that time, they were standing about the middle of the forecastle—Williams said, "Take the knife, he has cut me; I did not think he had a knife"—I went between them and took the knife from them—they were both holding the knife—I held it in my hand, and opened the man's palms and had a look at the cut—I kept the knife in my hand about a minute before I hove it overboard—I thought it was the prisoner's knife, I did not know of my own knowledge—I took it out of both their hands—I afterwards found another knife on the forecastle; it was not in its proper place, it was in a place where we keep our pots and pans, a kind of shelf—it was naked—it is not here—it was put in Williams's bag among his clothes, it was his knife—we put it with his other things and sent them altogether to the Consul—it was a sheath knife—I found it about two or three feet from where the struggle took place—I did not look at it, to know whether it had been used recently—after separating them, I turned to Anderson, and said, "You have done it now"—Anderson said, "Why did he not let me alone?"—I went for a doctor—I saw a wound in Williams above the groin—I could not say on which side, I think it was on the right side, but I am not certain—it was about two inches long—I could not say whether it was a serious wound—when we opened his clothes it was all blood—I could see the mark of the cut, but I could not say how serious it was; blood was flowing from it—the prisoner was very excited at the time—I saw marks on him—his eye seemed a kind of swelling and blood underneath it—it appeared to be a recent injury—the doctor attended to Williams's wound, it was a doctor we got from Panillac—we went ashore and brought him on board—the ship was towed up to Bordeaux that night, and I saw Williams taken ashore there—I helped to take him—we only took him ashore, and there was a party there to take him to the hospital—I don't know the day of the month that we got to Bordeaux, it was the same day the accident happened—we put him ashore about 2 o'clock in the morning—the struggle occurred about 12 o'clock—I never saw him again alive—he seemed quiet when we left him—I did not think he would die—we were obliged to carry him—I afterwards attended before the Consul, at Bordeaux, twice—the captain was there on both occasions—the vessel was going to Bordeaux with staves—I don't know where she was going to from there—I left Bordeaux on 25th September—I saw the captain the day before—I left him at Bordeaux, in charge of the vessel—I came to this country in a steamer.</p>

If the offence had been committed when the ship was on the high seas, he would dearly be answerable to the law of this country, because the flag carried with it a territorial jurisdic<lb/>tion, and for the purposes of criminal procedure, he would be a subject of Her Majesty. The question was, whether he ceased so to be when the ship entered this river, where the tide ebbs and flows. He contended that as the man served under the protection of the English flag, and acted as a seaman in as English ship, he owed allegiance to Her Majesty, and was, for that purpose, a British subject.

I got an order from the Islington Workhouse, for the parish doctor, Mr. Turner; he attended it for several weeks. The child was very much reduced by the diarrhoea, because it would not keep anything, even the milk from the breast, on its stomach. It was getting a little better, and then the other children had measles, and the baby took it, and never retired afterwards. On 1st September, I left it on the bed for a few minutes, and while I was away, Mrs. Scope took it to the workhouse. No doubt the baby was fatigued and exhausted, and caught cold. I was locked up for an assault on Mrs. Scope, and I never saw the child afterwards. I was very much ill-used by my husband, both by blows and kicks, while I was pregnant with this child; and it was never well from its birth.</p>

I am sergeant-instructor of musketry to the 28th Middlesex—it is the practice of the volunteers of that regiment to keep their rifles at their lodgings—on reference to this book I find that the man who had rifle No. 84, was a person named O'Brien—the entry was initialed by me—the books are kept jointly by two of us, and sometimes the entries are in my writing, and sometimes not—O'Brien is still on the books of the corps—speaking from memory, I should say he had not attended drill for eighteen months—at the end of last year I made inquiries for him at his lodgings, but could not find him—we have the address of every member—I know O'Brien has not resigned—the man who had rifle No. 555 was Edward Haydon—the entry in this book was initialed by me when the rifle was issued, on 20th May, 1867—he last attended drill some time last year—he has not returned his rifle—it is the duty of every man to bring back his rifle when he resigns—I cannot find out anything about him—rifle No. 201 was issued to a man named John Madden—he attended drill last some time last year—he has not returned his rifle—I cannot tell what has become of him—rifle No. 903 was issued to a man named Kennedy; he last attended drill some time last year—he has not returned his rifle, and I do not know what has become of him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many men have you in this corps? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Pretty near 1000—I cannot tell the last time every man came to drill, without reference to the book—the book is not here—I have memoranda extracted from the book, which I thought would do as well—it was an oversight my not bringing the book—all the men I have named are on the strength of the corps now.</p>

                  </hi>. About nine months ago, I was lodging at the Sussex Hotel—the prisoner was also lodging there, and I became ac<lb/>quaintd with him, and also with Evans—the prisoner was not carrying on any business, that I know of—in July last, he spoke to me about some stamps—there was another gentleman with him, when he first spoke to me in the coffee-room of the hotel—they were counting some stamps on the table—he said they were part of a remittance of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that a friend of his had remitted him, in part payment of goods delivered—he asked me whether they were much used, or something to that effect—and I said if the stamps were genuine and all right, there would be no difficulty with them, as they were used in commercial houses daily—they were foreign bill stamps—the other gentleman then went away—I saw the prisoner again next evening, about 7 o'clock—he said, that the gentleman that the stamps belonged to was rather short of money, and wished to pay some bill, and he asked me if I would pawn the stamps that I had seen the previous day—after some hesi<lb/>tation, I agreed to pawn them—he told me to take them to Shoe Lane—he said, that I was likely to get more money on them than he could—he gave me 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of stamps—they were foreign bill stamps, of different values—I took them to Cartland, the pawnbroker, in Shoe Lane, and there pledged them for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner said I was to get is much as I could on them—I left the stamps with the pawnbroker, and took the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the prisoner—he met me as I came away from the shop—he told me that I had better keep the ticket, as it would be safer with me, he might lose it—he gave me some silver for doing it—I don't know the exact amount—I saw him four or five days afterwards-—from time to time he gave me similar stamps—in August, I took some stamps to a Mr. Wolf, at 105, Houndsditch—I sold them to him, and gave the money to the prisoner—I afterwards got some more from the prisoner, and took them to Mr. Wolf—the prisoner said that was the last lot—with that lot I Bold Mr. Wolf the pawn ticket for the stamps I had taken to Cartland—after that, the prisoner said he had a small lot remaining yet; I was to go to Mr. Wolf, to get rid of them—he was to wait for me at the Blue Last—that was some-time at the end of August—I took the stamps to Mr. Wolf, and he found they were fraudulent—he took part of the head off a 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. stamp, and showed it to me, and I found that the Queen's head underneath was obliterated—I went with Mr. Wolf to the Blue Last, and found the prisoner there—Mr.</p>

I was in plain clothes at the Inland Revenue Office on the day in question—I received a description of Bennett from Mr. Walker, and went to the Strand entrance, where I found Bennett standing under the archway—I asked him if he was waiting for anyone—he said, "Yes, I am"—I then said I was a police officer, and I asked him if he had sent anyone into Somerset House with any stamps—he said, "No, I have not"—I said, "Will you come with me?" and he did—as we were going in, he said, "I did send a man in with four 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. stamps"—I said, "Where did you get them from"—he said, "From a man who was lodging with me, in part payment of rent that he owed me"—he did not say who the man was, or give any description of him—I took him into the room where Shipley was—I found on him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 31/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and two pawn tickets—I found nothing on Shipley.</p>

I was at Somerset House on this day, and saw Shipley there—he gave his address, 33, Ampton Street, Somer's Town—his mother resides there, but he does not—when Bennett was brought in I asked Shipley if that was the man who gave him the stamps, and he said it was—Bennett said his name was George Bennett, and he lived at 4. Fifteen-foot Lane, King's Cross, and was a costermonger—I asked him if he could account for the possession of the stamps—he said "I got them from a cattle dealer, who lodged with me, in part payment of rent"—I asked him if he knew the cattle dealer's name and address—he said he lid not—he said he did not know where he could find him, unless it was up at the cattle market next Thursday—I took thorn both to the static:—I found on Shipley a letter addressed "4, Fifteen-foot Lane, King's Cross"—that was the address that Bennett had given—I went there, and found that Bennett lived there—I did not find any cattle dealer there.</p>

I live at 2, Edward Street, Barnsbury Road—on the 5th September, I was with the last witness and Franklin—I saw the prisoner and his brother come out of the public-house, just below—I did not know them before—there were some persons there selling whelks—we went up to get some—the prisoner and his brother came up—the potato-can was broken, I believe by his brother—the woman asked the prisoner to pay for it—he pushed her down—Franklin said, "If they were anything like gentlemen, they would pay for the can"—Franklin was then knocked down by the prisoner—a struggle took place—Franklin ran down Edward Street, and the prisoner after him—I ran after them both—when they got to the corner of the street, the prisoner fell—he got up, and by that time I was within a dozen yards of him—he came to me and said, "You are one of them;" or, "You are him;" I don't know which—he struck me a severe blow behind the left ear, with his fist—I was squaring up when I felt two sharp terriffic blows—one on the arm, and the other on the left breast—just over the heart—I did not know for a minute that I was stabbed, till my mother caught hold of my arm, and said it was bleeding—I looked down, and saw the blood coming from my arm—I then felt a pain on my breast—I had my coat off and my shirt sleeves tucked up—the knife went through my waistcoat—I did not see anything in the prisoner's hand, but I put up my left hand, and felt a hard substance in his hand, what it was I can't say—I went into a greengrocer's shop, and then to the doctor's—there were plenty of persons round at the time.</p>

I am clerk to my father, a licensed carman, of 2, Tower Hill—we employ the prisoner casually to do jobs—on 7th October we had to case a quantity of tea that was to be sent by the Great Northern Railway to Liverpool—it was brought in vans to the Great Northern depot, Royal Mint Street—we employed the prisoners, with three other men, to case it—they had to sew canvas over the chests—they began the job between 7 and 8 o'clock, and I gave them instructions to take one chest at a time off the van as they wanted to canvas it—I superintended it at times, but at other times I had to leave, to go after my father's business and to get them canvas—at 8 p.m. I left for a short time, and all the cases were then apparently sound and on two vans—case 132 was amongst them—our errand boy, Jones, was left to assist to fetch canvas—I returned in about three quarters of an hour and found a quantity of cases piled up, which was contrary to my orders—Donaldson and Earwaker were there, and they had the chest in question in their possession—they appeared to be covering it up—I examined the case—the lid had been broken open—the lead bad been torn—the weight is marked on each chest—I weighed it, and found 31/2 lbs. missing—I asked them what they were doing with that chest—they said they were doing nothing—I asked if they had broken it open, and they said "No "—I turned round and saw a coat, which had some tea in the pocket, which I weighed, and there was just 31/2 lbs.—when I took the coat up Earwaker went away, and two others went out—not two of the prisoners—</p>

               <p>Earwaker and Donaldson were the only men I saw near the chest—I asked who the coat belonged to, and Stone claimed it—I then took it to my father—Stone said he knew nothing about the tea, he did not know how it came there—Earwaker then came back, and I asked him where he had been—he said "To have some refreshment"—when I found the coat, Stone was on the other side of the bench—soon after Mr. Cox came back, and then the prisoners were given in custody—the tea found in the coat was similar to that in the chest.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Robert Holdsworth Carew Hunt, and another, who carry on business under the name of Joseph Barber &amp; Co., at Brewer's Quay, as wharfingers—up to 28th September, Thomas Henry Bennett was in their employ as book-keeper—it was part of his duty, occa<lb/>sionally, to collect money, and he ought to hand it over to the cashier, and I should see it passed into the cash book—supposing he got a cheque in the name of Barber &amp; Co., it was not any part of his duty to sign it—on 28th September, I found out something, and spoke to him about it, and in the evening he left, and did not return—he was told to come next morning—his salary was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—his father has been with us nearly forty years, and is a very respectable man—in July, previously, we had discovered a loss, and I spoke to the prisoner about it, but in consequence of his father having been with us so many years, we allowed him to go on—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I received in the forenoon of 2nd October—it is from the prisoner John—he was in our employment about eight years ago—he knew our mode of doing business, and was down at our place almost every day, on business—the Foreign Vineyard Association, trade a great deal through our firm, and John was their dock clerk—(<hi rend="italic">The letter was dated 2nd October</hi>, 1868, <hi rend="italic">from John Bennett to Messrs. Barbery and stated that his brother had gone when they could not touch him, and that he, John, would call on them</hi>)—John called on the afternoon of the 3rd—Mr. Hunt refused to see him, and told me I had better see him, which I did, in the presence of Mr. Hunt, junior—he said, his intention was to have come to arrange about our loss, but when he found it was so great, he said he would have nothing to do with it—when he wrote that letter, the loss was 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I discovered 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. since—I had disco<lb/>vered at that time that two cheques drawn upon Faulkner, Dear &amp; Co., had been paid in to John's account—they were payable to Messrs. Barber &amp; Co.—I produced the two cheques, and said, "These have been paid into your account at your bank, and surely you must know something about them"—he said, "I could not know, because Tom paid them in, as the credit-slip will show"—and he produced the credit-slip, which is in Thomas's writing—he said, "Of course, you will see I can know nothing about it"—I said, "Have you had any cheques of Barber's in your hands, besides these?"—he was very indignant, and asked me if I thought he was a thief; and said he had not—I asked him where his brother was—he said, "I know, but through his wife, and I shall not tell you where he is; but he is where you cannot touch him"—I told him he could not have any objec<lb/>tion to tell us if we could not touch him, but he would not—I asked him if he had any money—he said, "He was not such a fool to go away without money; he had plenty"—I asked him in whose name the bill of sale was on Thomas Henry's furniture—he said, "I know, through his wife, but I cannot tell you"—I said, "There will be no objection to your telling me,"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186810260075"/>
               <p>but he still refused—he afterwards said he would let me know in whose hinds it was on the following morning—this diary (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in John Bennett's writing—my attention has been called to the entries respecting this matter; they are in his writing—this letter, marked "B," is John's, and this letter, marked "C," is Thomas Henry's—this letter, marked "E," is John's—this promissory note for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not marked; the body of it is in John Bennett's writing, and the signature is Thomas Henry Bennett's—the endorsement on this cheque for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which is drawn to order, is not genuine; it is Thomas Henry's writing—the counterfoil of the cheque, dated 29th September, for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., is, I should say, in John's writing—it is payable to Thomas Bennett or order—we cannot tell what the total amount of our loss is—at present we have found out nearly 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I believe it is consider<lb/>ably over that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a banker, of the firm of Guinness, Mahon, &amp; Co., of College Green, Dublin—we have a client in London named Foxall—our firm received from him this bill of exchange for 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) before we agreed to discount it we wrote to Mr. Foxall for an explanation about the transaction, and he then sent us this agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), to show us the bond fides of the transaction—we got the agreement on 14th August, and remitted the proceeds of the bill the same day, amounting to 778<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we sent it by draft on the London and County Bank, our London bankers—this is is it—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on 7th September I happened to be passing through London, from Germany, and in consequence of information, I went to the office of Mr. Newton—whilst I was there the prisoner Farrar came in—I said to him I was surprised to find that Lord Dudley had repudiated any knowledge of Mr. Hullett, who was the drawer of the bill that had passed through his hands—he said that was very strange, as he knew it to be his lordship's bill—I said, "What do you know about the trans<lb/>action?"—he said, "I know it is payment for an opera that the drawer, Mr. Hullett, was to write for Lord Dudley"—I said, "Do you speak of your own knowledge, or is it what Mr. Hullett told you"—he said he spoke of his own knowledge, and that he knew the opera to be nearly finished, on the point of completion, and I think he said that he had seen it, but I would not like to speak positively to that—I said, "It is very strange, under these circumstances, that Lord Dudley should not know Mr. Hullett, if he is writing an opera for him"—he said Lord Dudley was a very strange man, and he was not surprised at his disowning Mr. Hullett—I then said, "I suppose you were the solicitor who prepared the agreement"—I don't think this agreement was before me at that time; the agreement had been referred to, and he had spoken of a previous agreement—he said the arrangement was made by deed, there was a written agreement, and that was substituted for a previous agreement which was made between Mr. Hullett and Mr. Mapleson for the opera, but after it had been so pre<lb/>pared, Mr. Hullett considered he should have the security of Lord Dudley for writing the opera, and that a new agreement was prepared which was exe<lb/>cuted by Lord Dudley—I then said, "I suppose it was you prepared this agreement—he said, "No, it was prepared by solicitors in the Temple" or Lincoln's-Inn Fields, "I think the Temple, "a most respectable firm of solicitors—I said, "Who are they; what is the name of the firm?”—he said he would rather not mention their name, as the matter seemed to be a little unplea<lb/>sant—I said I did not see why he should object, and that I would wish to know the name—he said he must declince to mention it—he then said, "But would it not be much better to end all this business, by taking up the bill?"—I said, "Very well, I should much prefer it—what is it you propose?"—he said, "Well, I will give you half the sum in two days (this was on a Monday; it was to be given on Wednesday) and Mr. Eversfield's bill for the other half, Mr. Eversfield, of Denne Park, Horsham, I think he said; I wrote it down at the instant (<hi rend="italic">referring</hi>) it is "Charles Gilbert Eversfield, of Denne Park, Horsham"—I made that memorandum at the time, in Farrar's</p>

Guinness, Mahon &amp; Co., bankers, Dablin. September 7, 1868. I acknowledge to have in hand the sum of 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,</p>

                  </hi>. I have heard nearly all Mr. Guinness' examination; what he has stated of the conversation is substantially correct—I am engaged at the South Sea House, Threadneedle Street as an accountant—I have some connection with financial parties who discount—late in April last Mr. Farrar called on me—I had known him previously—he asked if I knew any channel through which Mr. Mapleson's promissory notes, endorsed by Lord Dudley, could be discounted, and he mentioned an amount of 26, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as the sum likely to be brought forward, as the amount of the bills—I told him that through a channel at the West End I had no doubt such an amount could be discounted—I made a communication to a party at the West End, and subsequently bad another interview with Mr. Farrar—the matter extended from late in April till early in May before it was finally brought to a close—the second interview with Farrar was a few days after the first—I then told him that the bills could be dis<lb/>counted—he said he had not got them, he expected to get them, and he would see me again—I saw him again in the course of four or five days, to</p>

               <p>the best of my belief—he called upon me—he then said that the bills were not likely to come forward, he understood that the Earl of Dudley's bankers had heard of the proposition, and that they were willing to advance him any reasonable amount upon fair terms, and that the transaction could not be carried through—I saw him again in June, but it is quite possible he may have called previously—at a subsequent period he brought me a bill of exchange for 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., purporting to be drawn by Hullett on Lord Dudley—to the best of my belief this is the bill (<hi rend="italic">the one produced</hi>)—at the same time he handed me this letter—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "July 25. Dear Mr. Farrar, I enclose you the bill of Earl Dudley, which I named to you before, and should be extremely obliged if you could let me have the cash for it, what you think fair. I ought to add the reason it was not made payable at Dudley's banker's, is that his lordship seems to have a wish it should not be, probably because he did not wish it to be in their hands, being a private one to me on account. It will be met at the bank made payable at, without fail—yours, J. Hullett")—I have since ascertained that the date of this inter<lb/>view was 31st July—under a misapprehension I have said it was in the beginning of August—It was at the South Sea House, where I am engaged—Mr. Farrar asked if the bill could be discounted, and having been informed previously that bills of Lord Dudley's could be discounted, I said I would place it in the same channel, with a view to its being done—I took it up to the same quarter, at the West End, and left it were with that object—the gentleman with whom I left it in the first instance was Mr. Gisborne—Mr. Foxall is in the same office, it is in the Strand—I saw Mr. Farrar again in the course of a few days, four or five, probably: it was understood that the bill was going to be offered out of town, and it would take two or three days to get the answer; therefore it was arranged that he should call again in a few days—he did call, and I told him the terms upon which it could be discounted out of town appeared to be so high that I had not been able to accede to them, and that the bill would be sent to a different quarter, to try it there—on 6th August it was placed with Mr. Foxall—on 15th August I obtained the proceeds of the bill, in a draft from Mr. Foxall for 777<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—between the 6th and 15th August I had an interview with Mr. Farrar—it was about the 10th or 12th—I then told him that further evidence was required in reference to the transaction—on the 15th I saw him again—I told him on that day that Mr. Foxall had received the proceeds from Dublin, but that conditions were attached to the transaction, which, without his (Mr. Farrar's) authority, I could not proceed—the conditions were that the agreement should be retained—he said he was going out of town, and knowing that I had only to go up to Mr. Foxall to receive the proceeds, I gave Mr. Farrar these two cheques on account of the transaction, one for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 155<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they have been subsequently returned to me in the ordinary course as having been paid—Mr. Farrar's endorsement is upon them—on the 21st I saw him again, and on that occasion gave him these two cheques for 225<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated 21st and 29th August—they have been returned in the ordinary course as paid—I did not give him the 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque on the 21st, I gave him the 225<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then—that makes 705<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—he owed me between 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. previously—the balance of the 777<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was made up of that sum and the commission and discount—I know Farrar's handwriting—the endorse<lb/>ment on these different cheques are his writing—they are all endorsed by him—three of them appear to have passed through Williams, Deacon &amp; Co.</p>

I have also taken hampers to the Great Eastern cloak room—there was writing on the labels, which I could not read—I was in the habit of carrying these hampers to Carr up to the time Bishop was taken—they were not empty hampers, by the weight of them—Bishop was taken on 11th September—I had taken a hamper that evening to the cloak-room, by his direction—I do not know the Patricks.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector A</hi>). I am employed at the Great Eastern Station—on 11th September, about 8.30 p.m., I saw Bishop leave the station in a Hansom's cab—he had a hamper with him—I did not know him before—I followed him in another cab, to 3, Selby Street, Waterloo New Town, Bethnal Green, where the cab stopped—it is a dark corner—Patrick lives there—Bishop got out there—as I got to the door, I heard a female say, "Mr. Patrick has just gone out"—I remained at the tail of the cab till Bishop returned—he had got the hamper between his legs—I went up and put my foot upon it, and he jumped out of the cab—I had a conversation with him, and took possession of the hamper, and took him in custody—the hamper was labelled "G. E. R., Mr. Bishop, Lea Bridge"—he lived down the line—it was opened, and contained two tin cases, labelled "Quinine," which are in it now—in consequence of what Bishop said, I made inquiries about John Patrick on Sunday, but could hear nothing about him—I left someone to watch his house, and went there myself on Monday, but could not find him—it is a private house, a six-roomed cottage; there is no trade carried on there—I searched, and found this large bottle, and this brown paper bag in a small shed at the back of his house—on the Tuesday morning, I found this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in my letter box at the Great Eastern Railway, in consequence of which I went to John Patrick's house, but could not find him—I found James Patrick at his father's stables—he keeps a light cart and a van—I said, "Patrick, I want you for being concerned with a man named Bishop, in receiving a quantity of drugs—you took the drugs away from the Ship public-house, Wheeler Street, Spital<lb/>fields, in hampers"—he turned very pale, and was unable to speak for a</p>

               <p>minute, and then he said, "I never was at the Ship in my life"—I took him in custody; the charge was read over to him, and he made no reply—between 2 and 3 on the same afternoon, I saw John Patrick coming out of Worship Street Police Court, I said "Halloa, Patrick,"—he stopped, as if startled—I knew him well by sight, and by name, and he knew me—I said, "I want you for being concerned with a man named Bishop, and another, in stealing a very large quantity of drugs; you must consider yourself in my custody, and go with me to the police station"—he said, "I never had any dealings with Bishop in my life"—on the way to the station, he said, "You have got my son"—I said, "Yes, I have"—he said, "What he <hi rend="italic">done</hi> was by my instructions"—on the way to Guildhall, he asked me what I had done with his son—I told him he was remanded till Thursday next—he said "What did you take him for, poor little fellow; what he <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, he was obliged to do; he knew nothing at all about it"—I showed him the letter—he said that he left it in the letter box last night for me—that would be Monday night—it is in pencil—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Mr. Russell Sir. When I came to-night, I am imformed you have been to see me respecting Mr. Bishop coming to my house on Friday night. I can explain what he came for, and will be home to morrow morning at 10 o'clock, or will call. Yours respectfully, J. Patrick. It was respecting, I believe, a horse I had for sale; anything else I know nothing about")—I afterwards got this empty hamper from the Ship—this brown paper was wrapped round the cases of quinine.</p>

I am a member of the firm of Hearon, Squire &amp; Co., wholesale druggists—Bishop has been in our service about fourteen years, and had our entire confidence until this occurred; we had not the slightest suspicion of him—I knew he was living at the Lea Bridge Station, Great Eastern Railway—the boys were under his orders—I never saw the Patricks—I was not aware that Bishop was sending away hampers once or twice a week from our premises, to public-houses or to the railway cloak room, to be called for—I have examined the hampers taken from Bishop by Russell—they contain two cases of quinine, which are worth 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is one of our hampers, which are made for us—I cannot swear to this bottle, but it is a drug bottle, and is exactly similar to ours—the bag found at Patrick's is exactly similar to ours—I have no doubt of it—the empty hamper left at the Ship is one of ours—I know it because it has been used before, and here is the place where it has been lifted up, and a paper placed underneath for the direction, which has since been torn off, and here is a little piece of the paper left; besides that, the hamper is similar in every respect to ours—since the prisoners were taken in custody, we have taken stock, and miss between 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of drugs, and that is only since June—we miss quinine, opium, saffron, and other things.</p>

I am chief officer of the <hi rend="italic">Alice Graham</hi>—I was on board that ship on the 29th June last—the prisoner was a seaman on board—I was in the cabin between 12 and 1 on the 29th June—the captain called the prisoner for the purpose of having the official log read over to him—the prisoner came into the cabin—I told him to take his cap off and stand outside the door; he did so—the master then came out—I did not see anything in his hand at that time—the prisoner and the master had some high words between them; the master pushed him into the fore cabin—I then saw that he had a stick in his hand—I saw a knife in the prisoner's hand, and he made two thrusts at the captain with it—I was at the table, writing; I said, "Look out, sir; he has got a knife"—the captain then rushed away from him—I went to get the knife from the prisoner—he thrust it at me, and it went through the fleshy part of my arm—I can't say what became of the knife afterwards; I believe it was pitched overboard—I saw the knife—I had not said anything to him before—I struck him after.</p>

I had instructions to watch the premises of Ball, who occupies a stable in Lambeth Mews—on 30th September, about 8.30, I saw a van, belonging to Ball, being loaded with drain pipes—it was backed up to his stable—Ball and a man named Savage were loading—after it was loaded it was carefully covered over with sacks and tarpaulin, and the canvas fastened down—I could not then see what was in the van—the van was then driven along Lambeth Walk to the premises of Elson, in Park Place—Elson put his head out of window, and said something I could not hear—the van was then backed up to his yard—Elson came down to the door, and joined Ball and Savage, and I went away for assistance—Elson is a small jobbing builder, and occupies a small yard with two or three sheds in it—in about half an hour I returned with another constable, and then we found Ball had gone away with the horse—I went into Elson's premises, and saw Savage standing there—I told him I should take him into custody for being concerned in stealing a load of pipes that stood outside—he said he had been employed to do a day's work by Ball, and that he knew nothing about the pipes—this was in Elson's presence—he further said that on the previous evening he had accompanied Ball to Astley's Theatre, and while there he saw Elson, and Ball and Elson went away together, and had some conversation—on going home, Ball told him he had a job he wanted to do in the morning, and he (Savage) might just as well come and help him—he also said that Ball had then gone away to get a van to do a moving job—I then said to Elson, "It is very strange that these pipes should be backed up to your yard; how do you account for it?"—he said, "They are not for me; he has left them here while he goes to get another van; you know me, Mr. Greenfield, I have got no money to buy pipes"—I said, "It seems strange that they should be on your premises"—he then said, "I will give you the straight <hi rend="italic">tip</hi>; Ball has always been bothering me to buy pipes and jars, and to sell them for him; I took two jars to Munn's, in Carlisle Lane, and he said he had got a lot more; he never gave me the list of how many, or what</p>

               <p>price they were to be"—I said, "We will go and we"—I left Savage in charge of the other constables, and went with Elson to Munn's, and there we found two jars, which Elson had taken for disposal—we then took them to the station—after that I searched Elson's premises, and found portions of two new drain pipes, of Messrs. Doulton's manufac<lb/>ture, which I compared with the drain pipes in the van, and they corre<lb/>sponded—Elson gave me a key of a job he was doing at Russell Street, Brixton—I went there and found a water-closet pan, one 4-inch bend pipe, and three 4-inch straight pipes—this is a memorandum I made at the time of what was in the van, viz:—10 9-inch junction pipes; 5 6-inch; 3 4-inch; 12 4-inch bend; 3 6-inch bend; 3 9-inch; 1 6-inch double junction and 4-inch pipe—they nearly filled the van—after I had taken Elson and Savage to the station I went in search of Ball, and about two hours afterwards I found him at his stables, about five minutes' walk from Elson's, and the same from Messrs. Doulton's—I went to the stable-door, and said, "Is your name Ball?"—he said, "Yes, that is my name"—I said, "I am going to take you into custody for being concerned in stealing a number of drain pipes, and other articles, of Messrs. Doulton's"—he said, I did not steal them, I was going down to fetch the van back"—I said, "What were the pipes taken there for?"—he said, "To get a customer for them"—I said, "How did you come by them?"—he said, "They were left here for stowage; one night a man's van broke down late, and he came to me and asked me to warehouse them, and I did so"—I asked him who he was, and he said he did not know—I said, "I shall take you to the station"—he said, "I suppose I must go"—I said, "Have you got any more?"—he said, "No"—I repeated that question more than once, and he said "No"—at that time Serjeant Wood, who was with me, discovered some—the same evening we went to where Gunnell resides, No. 4, Sala<lb/>manca Place—on the 5th October I received two loads of pipes from Mr. Hinchcliff.</p>

                  </hi>. I am carman to Messrs. Doulton—Gunnell was in their employment as yardman; he had to load the pipes that went away—on the 25th September, I saw Ball coming from the direction of Messrs. Doulton's premises, with a van—I think it was the 26th—he was about two hundred yards from the premises—the wind blew the straw and sacks off the pipes, and I could see what he had got—the van was about level full—he took it to the mews opposite his stables—when I returned from my breakfast, Ball followed mo down to Doulton's—I gave information to the police—I had seen the van loaded, coming from Messrs. Doulton's, three successive days—he generally came between 8 and 8.30; that is, breakfast time.</p>

I am an estate agent, at 58, Lower Marsh, Lam<lb/>beth—I have known Elson nine or ten years—on 5th September he came to me and said he had a quantity of pipes for sale, that he had bought of Mr. Doulton—he said that he had bought them to do a job at Camberwell, and that he had about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—he also said that the man for whom he was doing the job at Camberwell owed him 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and as he could not get the money he had carted these pipes to his place, and he asked me to go and look at them—I told him I did not want them particularly, but I went to his yard and looked at them, and agreed to give him a price for them, and he engaged a carman and sent them to my place—I paid him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he gave me this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have since given those pipes to the police—on the 23rd September he came to me again, and said he had brought all the pipes away from the job, would I take them—I told him I thought I had got as many as I wanted—he said he had not got money to pay his men, and I took them—I had another van load, and paid 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for which he gave me a receipt—I have given those to the police also—they were of the first quality.</p>
