On the 7th of July I was in my stables, and just as the watchman called three o'clock, I went to the door, I found my stable door locked; a man before I went in the stable told me that if I went in at the door I never should find the man out; I got in through the tiles; about a quarter after three I saw the prisoner come to the door, he put in a key and unlocked my padlock; he then came in and laid the padlock on a lidge of some brick work, then he bolted himself in and came up to the corn and chaff; at that time I was standing at the side of one of my horses, and as near as I could guess he went to the chaff, he had a sack under his arm; he took out four baskets of chaff, two out of each tub; he then removed the sack to the bean tub and then took out from three to four sauce pans full of beans; he put them into the sack with the chaff; the things that he first took off the beans he laid them on again in the same manner as he found them; then he twisted the sack and lifted it on the bean tub; when I saw him turn his back I walked past him with my soldier's piece and fixed bayonet; I called to my son William, I said pray is that a man; I said to the prisoner if you do not put that off your shoulder I'll shoot you dead; he threw the sack down, he saw a water pipe lay; he thought it was a pole, I suppose, he went to take it up to defend himself; I then declared with an oath, I believe, that if he touched any thing I would shoot him dead; then he saw I had a gun; he jumped into an empty tub and prayed for God's sake that I would not shoot him; my son was hard by, I told him to call the watchman; the watchman came and took him in my shed.</p>

               <p>Q. Your father is an attorney, you keep his house - A. Yes, I do. On the 13th of May, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I had occasion to go to my sideboard drawer in the dining room up stairs where I keep my laces: I took up my card of lace, I found it had been cut - three yards of this broad lace, two of this narrow lace, and one yard from a third card.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this drawer kept locked - A. Yes, and the key in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what number of yards was on each card - A. On the Sunday before I had seven yards of one piece of lace, seven yards of the other, and nine yards of another.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon which did you find the greater number of yards taken away - A. From the broad lace - that was nine yards; it was all Valenciennes lace. I am sure I never left the key in my drawer, and I am quite sure I saw them there on the Sunday; I had measured it shortly before the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that on the Friday there were three yards deficient of the broad lace - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. On your thinking they were something deficient on the Friday, did you take the trouble to measure them and see how much they were deficient - A. I did; and I found that quantity I have mentioned deficient: I came down and said, Mary I have been robbed of my lace and by you; she was very insolent and offered a great deal of abuse; she asked me if I meant to make her a thief; I said she undoubtedly was the thief, there was nobody in the house to go to it but her. After denying it repeatedly, she said Miss Combe I have stole the lace, if you will not tell your father I will bring it every bit back again, it is at my aunt Murray's, it is safe. I had never seen her aunt Murray then. I said run Mary and fetch me back my lace, and I will not tell my father.</p>
               <p>Q. Nobody else was by but yourself and her - A. No; she went out as if to go to her aunt's to fetch me back my lace; of course I exported it; she returned with her aunt, they both came in together, and said they had sold it to two strange men.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed before that - something must have been said - A. The prisoner said this is my aunt Muray, she has something to say to you. I said, May have you brought back my lace that you promised me, she said no, I have not; then I says, if you have not I must go and tell my father, and immediately I went and made him acquainted how I had been robbed; my father said, Mary if you have pawned the lace give me the duplicates, and there is the door for you, and he would have paid her her wages; she said, and her aunt also, that they had not the duplicates, they had sold the lace to two strange men; they did not know how much for; at last they said they had burnt the lace; she told two or three stories at that time; she first of all said, that she had sold the lace to two strange men; then she said that Mary brought it to her on Wednesday morning; that she said in the hearing of the prisoner, and told her to take care of it till she called for it; that she never saw the prisoner afterwards till the Friday; on that day the prisoner came to her and said aunt I want the lace, for Miss Combe has missed it. and for fear you should be in trouble and the lace should be produced against me, here goes, and crammed it in the fire, and her aunt saw her burn it. My father not believing it, sent for an officer to take charge of her; Mr. Perry came, he took charge of her. I asked the prisoner how she came to rob me; she said she took the key slily out of my my pocket, cut the lace, and put the key slily in my pocket again. I never missed the key out of my pocket. I believe she said that in the presence of the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you used to leave your bed room door open - A. She used to call me of a morning; she might have had an opportunity of taking the key out of my pocket; she did not say how she took them out, only that she took them out unbeknown to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you give a yard for this lace - A. Thirty shillings a yard for the broad lace, and eight shillings a yard for the other lace.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any person here that knows what lace you had - A. No; the lace has not been found; if she had returned the duplicates I should not have come here. I missed the lace about five o'clock; the prisoner was taken up the same evening about five o'clock; she had her hearing the next day. I always looked upon her as a very honest girl before this, and I hope mercy will be extended to her; I took her from the recommendation of a friend who knew her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How long has this girl lived in your family - A. About six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you had the lace - A. I suppose these four years; I bought eleven yards and a half of the broad lace; I have used two yards and a half of the broad lace.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Murray is not here - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. When did you cut the two yards and a half from the broad lace - A. About four years ago.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. After your supposed loss - did you ascertain by measure whether any was taken off - A. Yes, it has been taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you cannot misunderstand the question, I will repeat it again lest you should - you say you saw the lace on the Sunday before the Friday, then it contained nine yards - we are correct about that - A. You are.</p>
               <p>Q. And shortly before that Sunday you had measured it, it contained nine yards then - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on the Friday, when you found it deficient<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180807130005"/>measure it again - A. I did; in my father's presence; I did not measure it in the prisoner's presence. I said how many yards I had been robbed of before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to tell her how many yards you had lost - A. Because I did not know till I had measured it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to measure the lace behind the girl's back - A. My father charged her in custody immediately and I measured the laces the next day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did it neither occur to you nor your father to measure the lace before you took the prisoner in custody - A. No. I told the constable it was about two or three yards of the Valenciennes lace; and that I missed lace to the value of five pound; I did not say how many yards, nor did he ask me.</p>
               <p>- PERRY. I am an officer of the Thame police. The prisoner was given into my charge; Miss Combe charged her with stealing four or five yards of lace, of different sorts; the prisoner and her aunt were present, they seemed to be very much alarmed. No lace has been found. Mrs. Murray was bound over; she is not here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. She told you there were four or five yards missing; that was all she said - A. Yes; she did not say of the value of four or five pounds.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her counsel, called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner or any other man in company - A.

We walked on till we came between two gardens; there was pales on the left hand side and a bank on the other; the man on my left side was a soldier, and the prisoner was on my right; the prisoner gave me a bit of a jostle and pushed me against the other; the prisoner snatched at my watch; he hit his hand against my hat; he snatched the watch out with such force the chain broke, and the watch fell on the ground; I said that is mine; I went to stoop for it; he picked it up and ran away; the soldier ran towards Brick lane and the prisoner towards the City road; I ran after the prisoner; I lost sight of him; he was taken.

            . I was watchman this night on the City road; about ten minutes after eleven o'clock I heard the cry of stop thief; I saw the prisoner runing, he was the first man that came up; I laid hold of him; when Robinson came up, he charged him with having robbed him of his watch; the prisoner denied it; said there were more in company than him; I took him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>- TURTEL. I am a watchman in Goswell place; I was calling the hour of eleven; I heard the cry of stop thief; I ran and I saw the prisoner running; I endeavoured to stop him but he passed me; I sprang my rattle; he was stopped by Montgomery; I went up to him and Robinson came up almost immediately; he said he had robbed him of his watch; the watch was picked up and given to me; the watch had no chain to it and the outside case was open; I took it to the watchhouse and Robinson owned it.</p>

            . I was officer of the night; the prisoner was brought to the watchhouse, and the last witness gave me the watch with the case open; I have had it ever since. The prosecutor described the name and the number of the watch before he saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time how was Robinson, was he in liquor - A. He had been drinking, but he knew perfectly well what he was about.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at the City Arms that night playing at skittles; the prosecutor came in; he took hold of the pot and asked if he might drink; he tossed up with a young woman that was with me for some gin; when we went in the house, he followed us; he kept company with the young woman before I did; we all went out together; the young woman had hold of my arm not two minutes before the rattle sprung; I never saw the young man before; but what I have heard he is jealous with me of the young woman.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

In Holywell Street the prisoner at the bar came to me as I was going the hour ten o'clock on the 29th of May; he ask me where my box was, I ask him what he wanted with my box, he said he should like to sit down and eat his supper in the box, he had some victuals in his hand; I asked him the reason he did not go home, he said his master and he had some words, his master had discharged him, he said that his relations lived at a distance from town, he would not wish to go till it was light; I told him it was very seldom I went in the box and sat this hot weather, he might sit in the box and eat his supper; when he went in the box he asked me what I would drink, I told him I had had my usual allowance I wanted no more; he said he had a crown piece, and somebody told him they would not give more than four shillings and three-pence for it; I looked at it, it was a very good one; I told him if he wanted a pint of beer to go to the public house, the landlord would take it; he went in the public house, and brought a pint of ale and a glass; I blamed him for spending so much of his money. After he had ate his supper, he asked me if I could find a bottle; a bottle was procur'd, he went and bought three half quarterns of peppermint, when he had ate his supper, he said he should sit at the bottom of the box and have a sleep. I left him in the bottom of the box apparently asleep, when I was going the hour of eleven he followed me, he said he could not sleep contentedly, he would rather walk by the side of me; in walking along he said he had got a very good find, he had got some yellow boys, he could not tell how many, he had not counted them; he put them out of the nutmeg grater and counted over fourteen guineas, he said he had no pockets. I told him it was not safe to carry them about without a pocket. I begged him to put it into my hands, I would take care of it till the morning for him; he said he had some pieces of paper, he could not tell the value of them, or whether they were good for any thing or not. When I came to the box I was short of candle, I asked him to get me a candle and a halfpennyworth of snuff; when he returned he shewed me the notes; I found them to be two five pound notes he said he had another, it was put up in two squares, but by some means or other he had lost it; he and I went in pursuit of this note; we could not find it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he suppose he had lost it - A. He could not tell where.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any more money about him - A. Two dollars and a shilling he shewed me; he told me he found them in one of Mr. Rhodes's fields, the notes the money, and the knife that he ate his supper with, he found them altogether in a rag; this is all the money he produced to me, he went to the public house to get some more liquor; the landlord came and asked me whether I sent him I said No, I desired the landlord to detain him while I went for the officer of the night. I delivered up the boy to the officer of the night.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday the 30th of May the boy was put into my custody; I and Bishop went into the brick fields to see if we could find any money that he had throwed there; there appeared under an archway a dent as if something had been thrown there, but whether it was a brick, stone, or the money, we could not tell - we found nothing.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This bracelet is my own, it was locked up in the chest; that knife is my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you distinguish the notes - A. No farther than one of the notes is tore in the middle, and one is ragged at each corner; this nutmeg grater is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you receive these notes - A. From farmers who deal with me for soot.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear a noise - A. No, nothing particular. The first thing I observed was the street door wide open: ours is a little habitation, two rooms on the ground floor; the bed room door stood a little open; I could see the street door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Your bed room door was left partly open when you went to bed - A. Yes, we always leave it ajar; it was between three and four o'clock when I awoke, it was quite light; I jumped out of bed and went into the front room; I said to my husband, oh, my God! we have been robbed. I missed my things immediately; the street door was standing wide open.</p>
               <p>Q. What things did you miss from that room - A. Seven shirts; they were laying on the top of the table wringing wet in that room, I had washed them the day before; the shirts I had to wash and the shift; I missed my husband's coat, a pocket handkerchief, and a black linen apron; I had seen all these things in the room when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the windows of that room - A. One was shut and the other half open; the window case was close.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen the things safe the night before - A. I saw them lying, and my coat I pulled off the evening before, and my apron; they laid in the chair. I wore them the day before.</p>

When I went home to my breakfast I was told of the robbery. On the Saturday following I saw the two men at the Mansion house, they were dressed the same as I described to the officer.</p>

I had another shirt brought me by the female prisoner and another woman, between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>

            . I am a constable; I was sent for by Mr. Sadler to take charge of the two women; I searched the apartment where they lived, in Reeves court, Angel alley, Bishopsgate street; I understood this was Frindall's apartment, knowing she had lived in the alley some time. I found one shirt in the room, one coat, and a pocket handkerchief, they laid on the bed; I then went to an empty house just by, there was no person living there. On the stair case I found two shirts and a pillow case; I asked the prisoner Frindall how she came in possession of them, she told me that she received them from the prisoners, that they brought them in about three o'clock in the morning, and told her to dry them. This black apron I took from the prisoner Whittingham, before the magistrate on Thursday.</p>

            . After I received information of the robbery I went to George street, Wentworth street; I saw the two prisoners, I knew them well; that was on the 2nd of June about six o'clock in the afternoon; knowing the place to be a dangerous situation I went for another officer, and placed him at one end of the street, I went to the other, I saw the two prisoners, I took one in my hand; Lyons made resistance, but Whittingham did not; being surrounded by a parcel of girls, one had a large knife in her hand, Lyon got away before the other officer came to my assistance; I took Lyon the same evening in Essex street. I received information from the brewer's servant of the description of the prisoners. I found the lock to be a spring lock, it goes with a catch and a stiff hasp; there is a bit of wood nailed against it, it is im- impossible when shut to force it open; I saw the mark of a chisel I tried a knife and it opened it.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mrs. Hatton. Look at these shirts, there are three of them produced by the pawnbroker - A. They are all mine, they were all in my house, I know them by the mark, the make, and the cloth, and those found in the empty house are part of them which were taken away. The coat, pocket handkerchief and apron, are my husband's; the shirts are worth seven shillings each, the coat half a crown, the new holland shift, fourteen shillings; this pillow case is mine.</p>

               <p>Lyon's Defence. I get my living buying and selling old clothes. On the 2nd of June a young man asked me if I would buy two shirts; I gave him six shillings and sixpence for them; I went and pledged them for five shillings. I do not think it is my place if any body brings things to me to ask them whether they stole them or not.</p>
               <p>Whittingham's Defence. That apron is my own, I bought it; on Wednesday the 1st of June, I got up from my lodgings in Wentworth street; I went to this woman, I told her I was going to my diseased mother at Deptford; I had a bundle, I took it away with me, which was a waistcoat in a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Frindall's Defence. I am an unfortunate girl; a man came to me on that morning and left me the things; this room is not my own; I went to that room that one night.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 26th of May was there a sale in Mr. Eddis's rooms - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Among the articles was there a watch with a chain and seal - A. There was, in a place that was partitioned off.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they afterwards produced - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A. I do, he was in that quarter of the room where these articles were; I missed them on the day of the sale, about three quarters of an hour after I saw the prisoner in the room. About ten days after the loss of these goods, I went to Newgate street to pay an account; on my way to Newgate street I called in at Mr. Abbott's who were selling off their China; immediately on my entering the room, I saw the prisoner Fazakerly, I accosted him with how do you do; on my going into the room he was coming out, so that we soon met each other, I the moment I entered the room, saw the seals, I kept my eye on the two seals that I saw suspended to a watch chain; on my going near him to identify these seals; I observed him put them under his waistcoat. I immediately made a snatch at them, observing that he had some pretty seals there; upon my seizing the seals the prisoner said something, but however what was said by him was unintelligible; he made his way to the door quickly, I following of him; when he got into Fleet street (this house is the corner of Bride's passage); he attempted to make the best of his way, he was just upon the point of running, I seized him by the collar, he asked me if I meaned to tear his shirt, I told him no, but he must go along with me; he said he only meaned to go the back way; I entwined my arms around him, and he walked peaceable with me to the Strand, towards where the property was taken from, to Mr. Eddis's; Mr. Eddis being out I sent for him, upon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180807130011"/>on Mr. Eddis's return he came into the parlour where the prisoner and I were; I then delivered to Mr. Eddis the two seals and part of the chain that I snatched from the prisoner; when I snatched at them they came off the chain being very slight. Mr. Eddis then said where is the watch sir; he pulled it out of his pocket, together with the remainder of the chain; Mr. Eddis then said where is the gold neck chain besides; the prisoner pulled out a pocket book and produced the duplicate of a chain. He was then taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. I observe, Mr. Smith, at the time you saw the prisoner, after you saw him at your rooms, ten days had elapsed - A. I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. So his possession of this property was after he had been ten days in your room - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your's is a public room and of course open to any body - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there many persons there that day - A. No; very few; there was none of the plate dealers there that day.</p>
               <p>Q. My purpose is answered if there were other persons there; how many persons were there - A. I will say to the amount of eight persons where this watch was deposited.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you missed the articles had you taken an account of the things in the sale room - They were all there about an hour and half before the plate sale; the plate sale does not commence immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Then for what you know there may have been twenty people passing and repassing in that room; it any person had been so disposed as to take them they might; it was an open room for any body - A. I should not have let a chimney sweeper or a dustman in there: we admit none in that room but persons of genteel appearance, Mr. Fazakerly is a of a very respectable appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before had you taken stock - A. I believe that does not apply to sales every morning; an hour and a half before the sale commences we call over the sale; this was a metal watch, lot one; we had it two clear days in our possession; I know of the watch coming to us; I know it was in our sale room.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has Mr. Eddis had this sale room in the Strand - A. About two years. I am a clerk to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not partner to him - A. I am not.</p>

               <p>Q. Relate to his lordship and the jury what brought you to your house - A. I was sent for; I was introduced into the parlour; I asked the prisoner what he had done with the watch; he produced it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that watch sent to you for sale - A. It was, by Mr. Patmore on Ludgate hill; I then enquired what he had done with the gold neck chain; he told me he pawned it at Mr. Milton's, Westminster road; he produced me the duplicate and supplicated for mercy.</p>
               <p>Q. The watch having been lost I believe you paid for it - A. I paid two pound seven shillings; the duplicate of the gold neck chain I have in my pocket book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Do you know whether it is an unredeemed pledge - A. I should presum not.</p>
               <p>Q. Unredeemed pledges, I believe, when the time is out. then they are to be sold - A. They are compelled to sell them.</p>
               <p>Q. These pledges when they get into your hands they are to fetch what they can, and according to the sale and the quantity of bidders they are sold. - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore this article when it came to the hammer it might not have fetched more than thirty eight shillings - A. I will save you a great deal of trouble; it was not to be sold under two pound ten shillings; I as agent am to take my commission out of it.</p>

            . I am a constable; I was sent for to take charge of this man, July 12th, between eight and nine o'clock; when I came to the shop; we took him backwards into a little room; I unbuttoned his waistcoat and put my hand into the bosom of his shirt; I found the handkerchief concealed under his arm between the shirt and the flesh; I searched his pocket book; I found a five pound note, which I have got in my possession; it is a bad one.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the handkerchief any mark on it - A. Yes; it has now.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He pulled the shirt over my shoulders; can he look at me as an honest man and say that he took the handkerchief from me; when he found the five pound note in my pocket, I said it is a bad one. I said I was ordered to keep it in my pocket book till. I found the owner that gave it me.</p>
               <p>Pinner. I took it from under your arm. I am sure he was not intoxicated; after I had got charge of him I took hold of his right arm; going along, about twenty yards from the prosecutor's house, he hit me on the face and knocked me down; at the same time I twisted my leg and entangled it in his; he was secured; I used him directly.</p>

On the 8th of June, about eleven o'clock, I was going along Houndsditch, I saw the prisoner about ten yards from Mr. Smith's shop, he was going from the shop with a child's jacket and trowsers; I saw him take the dress from the door, it was outside the door; he perceived me; I followed him; then he run, I overtook him in Cutler street; I brought him back to the shop, then he was charged with a constable.</p>

               <p>Q. Had she left the counter at the time these things dropped - A. No, a person detected her and told me; I went to her; directly she saw me she turned round and dropped the shawl; then the constable was sent for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Yours is a very crowded shop and what you call a cheap shop, where people crowd to buy what you call bargains - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people were there in the shop at the time - A. There might be five or six at the counter where she stood; I do not know how many there were at the other part of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men had you serving in the shop - A. About sixteen or seventeen of us; the young man that was serving her is not here.</p>

Yes, she asked for some calico; the young man shewed her some and the person with her; the young man is not here; she did not like the calico, she asked to see some shawls; he shewed her some. I saw her take the shawl and put it under her gown; I went and told Mr. Ashford; he came to her and took hold of her arm; at that instant she dropped the shawl.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Did Mr. Harvey and and Lamming ever accuse you of taking things from them - A. They have once.</p>

               <p>Q. So, then when this prosecution was going on, you were let out - how long were you in custody - A. Two days.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have not you said that you would not have charged the prisoner with stealing this shawl but so save yourself - A. I have.</p>
               <p>COURT. What did they charge you with having taken from them - A. A bit of muslin. I was twice before the alderman; the alderman discharged me the second time; my master did not come to maintain the charge against me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to any body that you would not have charged the girl unless they had promised to forgive you - A. Yes, I said it to the young woman myself when I was in prison; she called me all manner of names and frightened me; I said so to her because she frightened me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Harvey or Mr. Lamming ever promise to forgive you if you appeared against the prisoner - - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did you stay in the public house before the prisoner came in - A. We sat about a quarter of an hour; he promised to meet us at the Punch Bowl, he did; then he took us up to <placeName id="t18080713-15-crimeloc92">the St. Andrew, Holborn</placeName>

When he came in he winked at me to go out; he took me opposite of the tap room window; the window was a little open, it was contrived for the purpose that Richardson might be looking at him; he gave me forty sixpences, they were in a bit of paper; I took them in my fist: I said now step in doors, I have not the money about me; he said nobody must see him deliver this money; I said to Richardson, pay this man ten shillings, I have got what I wanted; he gave him a seven shilling piece and three shillings for this money.</p>
               <p>Q. Who settled the price of ten shillings - A. The prisoner did; ten shillings was the price that he asked for them; I brought the forty sixpences home in the paper and gave them to Mr. Rogers in the paper; I keep them by themselves; I counted them when he went to the bar and got a quartern of gin and treated us.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me receive any money for them - A. Yes, I saw Richardson put it into your fist.</p>

               <p>Q. Now this having been found upon the prisoner, did you make diligent search after him - A. I did; I was not able to find him till the 6th of July, then Mr. Brown and I apprehended the prisoner; before we searched the prisoner he dropt money, I found sixty or seventy sixpences at his foot.

            . Q. You are also an officer of Shadwell office - A. Yes; I went in along with Bryan to the Punch Bowl; Mrs. Brown spoke to him and went out, and while Mrs. Bryant was going out he took a paper of money out of his pocket and put it down on the seat, and several of them fell down; I said to Mr. Rogers you look down, there is a plant. Mr. Rogers took up the money; we secured the man; the woman said that was the man; he said there is no money found on me; you have done your duty officers. We told him we took him in custody for selling this woman bad money.</p>

               <p>MR. PARKER. Q. You are a silversmith, and you have been acquainted prosecutions for the mint - A. Yes, I am acquainted with silver; these forty sixpences are all counterfeited, they have never been in circulation; the other parcel are also counterfeits; there is fifty or sixty of them.</p>

I know myself innocent; I went to lodge with Mrs. Lowry in September last when I left her lodging I told her where I was going to at Walthamstow; the very first time I came to town I went to her house. On the 28th of June she accosted me, I said do what you please; I went up to the magistrate; Mr. Moser saw it was a slight case he would not trouble a jury with it. Afterwards I was taken up; the tippet I found in my box at Walthamstow; I gave it to the girl, not with any intention to rob Mrs. Lowry. The prosecutrix swore to the shirt I had got on; I delivered the key of my box, and persuaded them to bring my box up to the office.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp In what state of mind was Main at that time - A. He seemed to be grieved about the dispute that he had with the woman Dean; I continued with him three hours at the White Hart; after I left the White Hart I went down to the sand house, where I had slept all the summer.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a building are these sand houses - A. They are about twelve feet one way and nineteen the other; they are built with brick, sticks laid on the top of them and covered with straw; there were six sand houses in a row; I slept in the third and the prisoner slept in the second.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you reached home did the prisoner come home - A. In about twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the child come home with them - A. I do not know. Main said, Bob are you here; I said, yes; he said I thought you had not come away; I said, yes, I said I have come from the house this quarter of an hour; he said if he had known when I came away he would have come with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any light with him - A. No light as I thought. I went to bed and went to sleep; within the course of two hours I was alarmed by my shirt sleeve being on fire; I pulled off my shirt and came out naked; Hollingsworth lent me a blanket to put round me; I went to the prisoners at the bar, they were standing about twenty yards from me; I said how, in the name of God, could these sand houses be set on fire. The man was dressed and the woman had a gown and petticoat on; whether she had a cap or bonnet on I cannot say; I said, Reuben, sure you was not so foolish as to bring a lighted pipe in; he said no, by God, I had no light at all; I then went and alarmed the three other people that were in the sand houses; then I heard him crying out the child, saying my child is burnt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the child crying at all - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for him to have got the child out - A. The child might have been got out when I got out; but whether it was dead then I cannot say; we could not have gone in the sand house, but we had hoes and rakes that we could have reached him and dragged him out; the next morning I went in the sand house, the child was in a lump of straw laying within a yard of the sand house door; I took a hoe and found out the child; the straw blazed up; there was a jug of water brought and throwed on the straw and on the child; I carried the body out.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any time previous to this that the child might be saved - A. Yes; if I had known it when I first came out of my sand house the child might have been saved; at that time the prisoners were standing a little way from the sand house, and if I had known I could have gone in and taken the child out myself without either hoe or rake; the back part of the prisoner's sand house was on fire.

I asked Main what cause he had to ask Mrs. Wilson for a match; his answer was to light his pipe when he went by the kiln that was then burning; he signified also that instead of lighting his pipe as he first intended, when he came to the kiln, he altered his mind and carried the pipe in the sand house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you apply to the prisoner first, or she to you - A. I enquired for a lodging, she offered to be my companion; and I being a single man had no objection. We went to the house and she called to this man to light us into the room; he brought the light, unlocked the door and let me in the room, he padlocked it after I was in; then I thought I was safe; I pulled my clothes off and went to bed and she along with me; I fell asleep; when I awoke I missed her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after you went to bed - A. About half an hour; I put my hand out for my clothes, they were gone; I rushed to the door and the door was locked; in about ten minutes this man brought me a light and let me out of the room; I then found my clothes at the foot of the bed, they were removed from the upper part end of the bed to the foot; my silver watch was taken away, two shillings and my pocket handkerchief; I dressed myself, went out, and got a constable and took the young woman to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the young woman before you went out of the house - A. Yes, she was stopped in the gallery of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the watch since - A. No, nor none of my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all that you know of the man is that he unlocked the door to let you in - and locked you in - and when you gave the alarm he unlocked it - A. Yes.</p>

            . I live in Angel alley, Bishopsgate street; I have known the prisoner some time. On the last day of June, at half after nine o'clock at night, I was putting up my shutters, she came to me, she had a piece of print under her arm for a gown; she asked me if I would take it in for her, I told her I could not take it in without asking my husband's leave; he gave her leave to leave it; she came in and sat down; she pulled four pound notes out of her bosom, she also took out a pocket book from her bosom, containing a pair of earrings and a seven shilling piece, she said her husband had sent for her to come down and see him; she had a husband at sea; she fell asleep and sat in the chair all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she sober - A. I do not think that she was much in liquor; she was fast asleep, we could not awake her. The next morning she asked me if I would go with her to buy a few things to wear with this gown. I went with her; she came back to my house, and the officer came with this woman and took her. My husband delivered up all the things to the officer. The woman said to the officer this was the woman that had robbed her.</p>
               <p>- SHEPHARD. Q. You went to the last witnesses house to enquire for Dolling - A. Yes, I went in and found the prisoner sitting in a chair behind the door; the prosecutrix came in and charged her with the robbery, she denied knowing any thing of it; I then proceeded to search her; I found nothing on her person. Down by the side of the chair where she sat, I picked up a one pound note. The last witness's husband delivered me this pocket book, he fetched it down stairs, he said the prisoner had given it him to take care of for her. I shewed the pocket book to the prosecutrix, she said it was her property. In a chair, on the left hand side where the prisoner sat, I took this linen, a piece for a gown, a petticoat, and a pair of stockings; the next day, before the magistrate, the last witness delivered me a pair of gold ear rings.</p>

            . Q. Do you recollect the prisoner coming to your house and asking leave to leave a gown there - A. Yes, and I saw a pocket book containing a pair of gold earrings, four one pound notes, a seven shilling piece, and two shillings; the pocket book she had in her hand that night. The next day she gave me the pocket book to take care of for her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the constable coming to your house - A. Yes. He said this woman had lost a pocket book, mentioning the things that were in it; I said the woman in my house has such things.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the pocket book you gave to Shephard was the same that you received from the prisoner - A. Yes; the earrings she had put in the box where the rest of the things had been; the next day I gave them to the constable.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met this body by Crispin street, she asked me to go with her to buy a bundle of calico; I went with her; from there she asked me to go with her to take a gown to a mantua makers; I said Sophia I have got no money to treat you; I took her to a house where I was known in Fashion street, there we had two pints of beer and a quartern of gin; from there we went into another public house, she wanted to vomit, she went backwards, she was gone some time; I was standing talking to a person in the public house; she not coming back I went to her; going along the yard I picked up the pocket book in the yard; I took no notice of it; she was vomiting down the privy, I held her head; I perceived three caps fall down the privy, I took them up and doubled them up as well as I could; she told me to put them in her pocket; as I came along with her she asked me to see her to her mother's, she being in liquor. I had not power to lead her along and carry the child. I saw her safe to her mother's; what was in the pocket book I did not know. I had two glasses more of liquor. I met a person, I said I had a find; I saw this person shutting up her shutters; being in liquor I stopped there as they said all night; I found it, not knowing it was hers; I do not think it is her's, any more than it is any other person's here.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember paying a draft of Mr. Page, for two hundred and fifty pound - A. I do; it was paid on the 20th day of June.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other memory when it was paid except from reference to your books - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you your books here - A. No; I copied it out from the book.</p>
               <p>Q. That will not do. Do you know in what manner it was paid - A. One fifty, one one-hundred, and five twenties.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you from memory recollect that they were the notes that you paid - A. I cannot; it is impossible, from the number of notes that we pay away in a day.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you swear upon inspection of the book this morning, there was an entry of a fifty pound bank note, and that part of the money was so paid - A. I think I can swear that a fifty pound was paid on that day for that check.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to prosecutor. You have had the boy some time, how has he behaved himself - A. He had behaved himself remarkably well; I can give him a good character; I compute it partly to my own carelessness; I am sure he would have returned it when he came home on the evening when I gave him a ticket to go to the theatre.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. On the night of the 22nd of June, what time did you go to bed - A. At eleven o'clock. I secured the shop the last thing before I went to bed; I saw the bolts of the door fast, top and bottom, and the screws of the windows were all fast.</p>
               <p>COURT. Is your shop the lower part of your house - A. Yes; I occupy the whole house; I got up a little after seven in the morning, and I went down to the shop a quarter before eight o'clock. I went to the shutters; in taking down the second shutter I perceived it drop into my hands; the screw of that shutter which was fastened in the shop remained in; it was cut in the wood; after I took down the shutters, I saw a pane of glass broke quite out; I then returned into the shop to see what I had lost; I discovered seventeen pieces of Irish linen gone; there were a great many pieces of prints taken down and very much disfigured by some person's feet; there were the print of feet upon the prints as if there had been more persons than one.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is the value of these seventeen pieces of Irish linen - the whole amount - A. The cost price is about fifty pound. I found the shop door was left open; upon discovering my loss I went to the Foundling watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. There you got some information that led you up to St. Giles's watchhouse - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of your property did you see - A. I saw six pieces of Irish linen; I looked at them; I knew them to be mine; they have my wife's marks upon them; the prisoner was there in custody; the goods were kept and produced before the magistrate by them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. I think you said you had been about a month in that business - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a very short time, you had not an opportunity of being acquainted with one thing any more than another, how do you know it was Irish linen - A. I know it by the invoice.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you know Irish linen when you see it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. From the appearance of the things that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180807130019"/>were thrown about, must it not take up a great deal of time - A. Yes, and to take out the glass in the manner it was done.</p>
               <p>COURT. What parish is your house in - A. In St. George, Bloomsbury.</p>
               <p>- COOK. Q. You are a patrol - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your beat - A. Down Russel square. On this night, just before three o'clock, I was going my round from Southampton row, I was going to Woburn place, about two hundred yards off; I saw the prisoner and another man, he had the bag on his shoulder; I stood up against the pillar of Bolton house, where I could have command of them and they could not see me. When they came abreast of me; I sprang out and seized the other man, I said what have you got here; the prisoner faced round and struck me upon the head as hard as he could; the blows rather stagnated me for a bit; the other threw the bundle upon my toes, and took towards Bedford place; I alarmed the constable; the rattles sprung in all directions; the prisoner got within two yards of Bedford place, by that time I had sufficiently recovered myself to pursue him; the prisoner at the bar seeing a watchman coming out of the box, run from him; I then thought to cross him; he being of lighter heels got away; the watchman in Guildford street stopped him; I am sure it was the prisoner at the bar, and he was the same person that struck me with a knotted stick, it was like a black thorn stick. When I saw the watchman in Guildford street stop him, I went towards the property which lay at Bolton house door, captain Blackhall's door; I heard him say when he was locked up in Marlborough street, D - n my eyes, we have made a crack, but we are spoiled; he was going on further in the discourse, but he saw me; then he stopped.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. You saw him very distinctly - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure that you saw him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was the 22nd of June - A. It was the 23d of June in the morning; it was break of day. When I stopped the other man, the property was tied up in two separate parcels, it was in a bag.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was not the prisoner that had the bag - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. It was just before three o'clock when you stopped him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did day break - A. It became light about a quarter after two o'clock, it was a dark rainy morning; you might pick up any thing down on the pavement that one saw, about ten minutes or a quarter past two.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you miss your property - A. On Tuesday the 12th of January, when I came home about nine o'clock in the morning, I found my bureau was unlocked; the bureau was in the parlour next the street; upon finding it open I naturally looked at the drawer where I keep cash. I missed about twenty five pounds in gold and silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was above twenty pounds - A. Yes; - about two days after I missed my watch, a double casee silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that kept in the same drawer where the money was - A. Yes; it was a thing that I did not make use of; I did not miss it when I missed the money.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen the money and the watch in the bureau - A. The day before, I had seen the money.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know how long before you had seen the watch - A. No, I suppose about a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in January - how long was it afterwards that you got any intelligence of the money or the watch - A. I heard nothing of it till the last day of June; I rode out in the morning; when I returned my servant told me he had taken William. I got a constable, and when the constable came I went in to him, I said how could you be such a cursed fool for coming here you knew you would be taken in custody and I would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180807130020"/>rather you had been any where else; I did not want the trouble of prosecuting of him; he said he had a good birth on board a ship, his conscience troubled him, he came to ask my pardon; I told him I could not compound felony, I could not compromise the matter any how; he said the watch was at a pawnbrokers in Whitecross street; before the magistrate he named the pawnbroker; I went to the pawnbrokers with one of the officers to identify the watch; we took the prisoner with us in a coach, to point out the pawnbrokers; he willingly gave every information he could, he did not wish to deny any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to Mr. Salmons did you find any watch there - A. Yes, I saw the watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. How did he behave while in your service - A. He was very attentive to his business, never went out of a night; and I was very much surprized when my man told me he had done it. In the hackney coach, going to Whitecross street, he said he had got in liquor and the money was all stole from him.</p>

In the manufacturing of feathers there is a large quantity of waste; Gaskin was employed by me in selling the waste. We cut open the bag and found five pounds and three quarters of the best feathers. After the discovery of the robbery Gaskin said they were some loose feathers that were laying loose about the floor; I observed to him that he knew better, as well as I, that there were none loose, that they were all in bags. I examined the bags and found some gone.</p>

             spoke to me for twenty eight pound of waste for an acquaintance of his, he said she was coming on Saturday morning about eight o'clock. About nine o'clock Grey came in with the woman, he told me there was the woman that came after the feathers; I weighed them. Knowing that she wanted waste, I took a bag which had at the bottom some swan, with some sweepings of the house; I saw they were swan feathers under when I put the waste in; I could not then unmix them when I had shot them down in the bag; the bag was to be brought back on Saturday night.</p>

I saw a great deal of dirt in the window, and I saw the print of a man's foot upon the dresser under the window. I went up stairs about my business. The porter said I heard the door go a second time after your husband went out; I was alarmed; that was about an hour afterwards. I ran down stairs and said, sir, the thieves have been. There were four table spoons of Mr. Hanson's gone, four tea spoons, a salt spoon, three table cloths, and a ham, all Mr. Hanson's. Then I went to look at my own; there was a pair of tea tongs, a table spoon, tea spoon, and an apron, gone of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these things, the table cloth and the spoons, the night before when you went to bed - A. The spoons were in the closet, the table cloth in the drawer, the ham in the passage over the back area, my spoons in the dark closet, going the into back area.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are dressed like a quaker, have you been sworn - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Other people in the house had been up and out before you - A. Only my husband; there was a piece of coat found the same morning; I saw it as soon as I came down stairs, between the window and the cill.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Between the window and the cill there was a piece of a coat found - the window had no pulley - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore if any body threw up the sash and attempted to come in it would fall down upon them - A. Yes; I left the piece of coat there.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you discover by the information that you received from the servant in the morning that the house had been robbed - A. Yes. The servant on seeing this piece of cloth came up to me; in consequence of the information I came down, the servant had not taken away the piece of cloth; the first thing they mentioned to me was the window; there was all dirt there, it had the appearance of a person's foot; it rained very hard in the night, it was impossible any body could come in without making it dirty: the cloth laid inside of the window, and the buttons on the outside; in consequence of that I was perfectly convinced that somebody had broke in; I found upon enquiry that several things had been missing, that have been described; we had a suspicion who the person was certainly; a week or ten days elapsed; I was going across Lincoln's inn I observed West, he was coming across Lincoln's inn; having no reason to ask him any question, I walked along; at the time I came to Carey street, I heard somebody running, it was this man; he said, I beg your pardon, Mr. Hanson, I was the man that robbed your house on such a night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did you make him any promise - A. None at all. I replied, did you, I will not stop here and talk about it, come home and have an explanation about it; he and I went home and he explained it, he said that between twelve and one o'clock that night, he broke into the house by this means, he got over the area gate and got into the area, he stopped, there a short time till the watchman had gone bye, he turned the pin of the window about a good deal, it was fastened by a feather, he turned the pin about a good deal; after which the feather fell down in consequence of which he immediately took out this pin; then the shutter was immediately loose; he opened the shutter and entered the window, and got over the dresser; in getting through the window, in consequence of there being no pulley to it, it cut his coat getting through and tore part of it off; he then fastened the shutter again, as it was the former part of the night, indeed faster, for if they had been properly done nobody could do it; he then remained in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180807130024"/>kitchen and collected all these things together, as before stated, the ham, and table cloth, &amp;c. and waited in the kitchen, in the back area, and in the coal hole, till Mr. Clapham went out in the morning, through at the street door, as he always does every morning; the prisoner about five minutes after followed him, that was all he said; in consequence of that information I sent for Mr. Blundell the constable, and de livered him over to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you afterwards go to Robinson's apartment - A. I did; I went to the watchhouse with Mr. Blundell; at the watchhouse Mr. Blundell asked where these things were; he replied that they were in Fisher street, No. 22, at Mr. Robinson's. In consequence of that information Mr. Blundell and I went there to see if it was true, leaving the prisoner in the watchhouse; I saw Mr. Robinson at No. 22, Fisher street; he appeared to me to be in lodgings; Mr. Blundell asked him if he knew a person of the name of West, and if he knew Mr. Hanson's servant, if he knew any thing of him, or had seen him; he said I do not know any thing of him, nor have I seen any thing of him; Mr. Blundell said are you sure of that; I think the words were quite, or no; after that Mr. Blundell asked him if he had any bundle containing the table cloths or the ham; he replied no; immediately Robinson turned to his wife and asked her if she knew any thing of them, or had seen any thing of him or these things; she said no; Mr. Blundell said he was sure the things were there, and he would have a search warrant; the prisoner after pausing a little turned round to his wife, and said well, I believe, we may as well confess it as not; Robinson immediately crawled under the bed and got the bundle containing the table cloth and the ham; then Mr. Blundell said you must come along with me and the bundle; we all came together to the watchhouse, he carried the bundle; he was secured in the watchhouse. The things were delivered to Mr. Blundell; they are my father's property, but I do not know so much about them as the cook.</p>
               <p>MR. BLUNDELL. Q. You are a constable of the Liberty of the Rolls - A. Yes. On the 16th of June, between the hours of eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I apprehended the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the information that you received from the prisoner West, did you afterwards go to Robinson's house - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the account that was given by Mr. Hanson - A. Yes, it is true; Robinson took the bundle from under the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take Robinson and the bundle to the watchhouse - A. Yes; I did not take him in custody then, he willingly went with me; when I came to the watchhouse I said he was in custody; I have had the bundle ever since; I produce it, and a piece of coat; on the 1st of June, at night, that piece of coat was delivered by Mr. Hanson to the watchman.</p>

Yes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180807130025"/>there on the 24th of June; the prisoner and I were at the Dolphin in Long alley. About three o'clock in the afternoon I had occasion to go to the privy; I put my watch on the seat, I came away and forgot it; about one hour after that I missed it. I returned to the privy, the prisoner was in the privy; I asked the prisoner if he had seen a watch on the seat, he said no; I called the workmen together; by that time the prisoner came out; they all denied it together; the prisoner denied it a second time. About six o'clock in the evening the prisoner left work. I believe the man was intoxicated, or else he would not have done it. I have seen the watch since.</p>

            . Q. You are a pawnbroker - A. Yes, I live at No. 6, Aldersgate street. On the 24th of June, between five and six o'clock, the prisoner pledged this watch with me for fifteen shillings</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at work at the building for the prosecutor's father; we drank freely; I had occasion to go to the privy, he came and accused me of the watch; I denied that I had it. On my getting up, stupid as I was, I took and pawned it for fifteen shillings. I came back and left the duplicate and a seven shilling piece for the prosecutor; I confessed that I had pawned the watch; he received the ticket of the watch on the following morning and the seven shilling piece; it was all agreed on in part of payment, and that the remainder part of the money should be paid by me in a fortnight, but the constable would not permit it.</p>

I then went down to her, and told her I wished to see the inside of her box, as I had found a table cloth, I suspected she had other things; she said she would not permit me to look in the box without a search warrant. Immediately I went up to Marlborough street, it being Saturday evening the magistrate would not grant a search warrant; I came home, I ordered the porter to take the box out of the room and place them in the adjoining room; he did so. I got two padlocks and staples, and put them on this door to prevent any body going in. On Saturday evening I asked her to let me see the inside of her box; on Sunday morning I asked her the same.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, he lodged in my house better than two months before this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you keep your watch - A. In the bed room where we sleep; the watch was not locked up, but the money was.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the situation of the window - A. I suppose ten or eleven feet from the ground; there is only one window in that room; the roof of the washhouse runs up sloping about two foot and a half from the window, and there are two beds in the room; the room is too small for two bedsteads; the children's bed is on the floor under the window.</p>

               <p>Q. Then any person getting in that window, must they pass over the bed - A. Yes. My watch was in one of the drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss your watch - A. On the 30th of May. Before I missed the watch I had him taken; the watch was missed at the time I went up to Queen square with him; I had missed a good many halfpence and penny pieces out of the drawer. On the 30th of May I saw the mark of a man's shoe on the bed quilt, I thought it appeared to be his size. Finding all the copper gone, I went down stairs and took him by the collar and took his shoe off; I compared it with the mark on the bed quilt, I found it corresponded with the mark on the quilt.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180807130026"/>Q. This washhouse or shed, where was that - A. That was in the back yard belonging to the premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any difficulty in getting up that shed to the window - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Any body belonging to the house might get into the yard - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner sleep at home - A. Generally, for the first month or six weeks he did, and after that he seldom slept at home. I have seen the watch since.</p>
               <p>MRS. HARDEN. Q. You are the wife of the last witness - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner lodged, we understand, with your husband and you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at any time in May at any part of the house with him alone - A. Yes, about a week before he was taken up I was in the tap room with him; he went out, I did not see which way he went; I heard a noise in the bed room almost immediately after he went; I thought I heard somebody walking in the room; I went up stairs; finding the door locked and my husband had got the key, I went into the yard, I could see nobody. In a few minutes afterwards the young man came in from the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of the bed room that day - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the marks on the bed - A. On the 30th of May I saw three of the drawers open; I looked round, I saw somebody had been in at the window; a great many halfpence and penny pieces were taken out of the drawer. I saw the foot mark on the bed. I immediately called my husband up; the window was a little way open.</p>

About four o'clock in the afternoon I was putting a clean shirt on; I heard a cry out that the prosecutor had lost some halfpence; I came down, the gentleman pulled my shoe off, he put it to the quilt; he came out for an officer; he told me to go out of the way; I told him I should not go out of the way.

               <p>Q. Had you any occasion to get change for a ten pound note - A. Yes, I got it changed at Mrs. Rolls at the Coach and Horses, Chelsea, on the first day of this month about eleven o'clock she gave me seven one pound notes, a two pound note, half a guinea, a seven shilling piece and half a crown. The landlord and his wife were present at the time, Robinson was in the tap room, I received it in the kitchen. Robinson saw the notes when I was wrapping them up; he came with me to <placeName id="t18080713-35-crimeloc219">Charing Cross</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did the coach go from that house - A. No, he offered to carry it, and I was thankful, I was weak and poorly, I was not able myself; after I received my money he offered to carry it for me. We got to the Anchor and Vine a little before twelve o'clock, I called for a pot of beer and a slice of bread and cheese, I was not able to make use of it myself, I was very bad; I took a seven shilling piece out of my pocket and paid for the beer and bread and cheese. I wrapped up the notes and the money and put it in my left hand pocket; I fastened my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner at that time - A. He was on one side of the box and I of the other, there was nobody in the box besides us; I ask'd him about the coach; he said he would get one presently; I clapped my hand to my head, I fell in a bit of a dose, I had no rest for three nights; he came and sat of the left hand side of me where the money was; when I awoke I found the flap of my coat pocket turned down and the money all gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think you might be in that dozing situation - A. Not long, because I have a bad complaint in my inside.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel any body at your pocket - A. Yes; I felt something, but I did not think any thing of that kind; I kept my doze on for a small time afterwards, and then I found the prisoner was gone and nine pound in notes and half a guinea in gold was gone; I returned back to Chelsea; he was not there; he was missing from his quarters all night; I waited there till Sunday morning; he came home about nine or ten 'o'clock in the morning; I took hold of him; I enquired for my money; he said he knew nothing about it; the serjeant major put him under confinement; he confessed afterwards that he stole three pounds from me; I heard him say it, and he confessed before the magistrate, the next day, that he had three pound from me.</p>
               <p>Q. You got none of the money back again - A. No; I am upon sufferance now; I have only what the landlord supplies me with.</p>
               <p>- Q. What age are you - A. Fifteen; I am servant at the Anchor and Vine, Charing Cross.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the person that was examined just now - A. I only saw him once when he was along with the prisoner; the prisoner and prosecutor came together; I know the prisoner very well; when they came in the prosecutor called for a pot of beer, which I brought in; they both sat down in one box opposite of one another; then the prosecutor called for a slice of bread and cheese; the prisoner said bring two; then the prosecutor fell asleep; after the pot of beer was out the prisoner called for a pint, and when Robinson found the prosecutor had fell asleep, he went and sat on his left hand side.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the prisoner had changed sides had any change been given to the prosecutor - A. Yes; he changed a seven shilling piece; as soon as he came in the prosecutor dropped half a guinea; when he took out the seven shilling piece I picked it up and gave it him, he put it into something like a bit of a rag, and put into his left hand breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner see all this - A. Yes; the prisoner continued to sit of the opposite side of Brockinshaw till he saw he was asleep, then he went to the left hand side of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him do any thing with Brockinshaw's pocket - A. No; I only saw him move and sit by it; he sat there about a quarter of an hour and then he moved again.</p>
               <p>Q. When he moved to his own side was Brockinshaw awake - A. No; the prisoner sat about ten minutes and then he said to me, you see this man on the coach; I said to him you are the fittest person, as you brought him in; the prisoner and a woman went out together; the prosecutor when he awoke went below and said to the servant maid that rascal has stolen my money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. That woman that I went out with sat with the man before I did.</p>
               <p>Witness. No, she did not come in till you was just going out.</p>

            . About three o'clock this day fortnight I went into the Cock; the prisoner was there, he knew me, he asked me to have a glass of liquor; I did, I sat in the house, he paid several pots of ale; he said he had a uncle that died in the Indies, he had left<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180807130028"/>him a large fortune; I saw two one pound notes and about fourteen or sixteen shillings in his possession; he said when that was done he knew were to get more, he had got an order to draw upon a gentleman in London whenever he wanted; I asked him to lend me half a crown, he did.</p>
               <p>MR. ROLLS. I keep the Coach and Horses, Chelsea; the prisoner and the prosecutor lodged in my house, they both slept in one bed, the prisoner was quartered on me. On the 1st of this month Brockinshaw took his pension, he brought it to my wife and laid it in her hands; on Saturday he said he would go away; he had nothing more to take at Chelsea; he got change for the ten pound note, seven one pound notes, a two pound note, half a guinea, a seven shilling piece and half a crown; he got the change, he put it in a ragged purse; the prisoner was not present when he did that; I saw him go out of the kitchen into the tap room; the prisoner and he went out of the house together, the prisoner carried his pack; about two hours and a half afterwards he came back, and said the prisoner had robbed him; the prisoner never came to his quarters that night; on the Sunday when he came in Brockinshaw accused him of robbing him; the prisoner was going to strike him; we sent to the serjeant major of York hospital, and he was confined.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never had any of his money; this woman that was in the house robbed him, she gave me part of the money; I went from there to Westminster with the woman; the money that she gave me I spent; they searched me, I had no money about me; after that the serjeant major confined me; he asked me whether I had any of his money; I said I had none of his money, but that money I had given to me; he throwed his money about in the public house, the boy picked it up. I have fought for my King and country abroad; I was taken prisoner; I have gone through a great deal of harships, although I am a young man.</p>

On the 1st of July, about eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to my shop, he asked me if my name was Saunders; he said he was going to the East Indies and wanted to take a quantity of watches out with him; he asked for a piece of paper, pen and ink, and he would write down the order; I shewed him watches of various patterns; after which he wrote down the order; then he wished to look at some gold chains and gold seals; while looking at the gold chain and seal, he took notice of the hair broaches; he asked if they could be taken out and any hair put in; I told him yes; he asked me if I knew a gentleman, he mentioned his name; and while I was looking over the book he secreted a gold ring.</p>
               <p>Q. That you could not know - did you see him - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you tell us what he did, that you did not see - he asked the name of a gentleman and you looked at your book to find the name - A. Yes; I looked some time, I could not find the name; he said it did not signify; then he said he wanted a watch for his own wear, he choosed a gold chain, gold key, and a gold seal; he offered me a bill; I told him I did not like to take bills; while I was putting the chain on the watch for his own wear, I missed a gold ring out of the box; the box was on the counter with a number of watches by the side of it; I had seen it that morning in the box; I had not seen it when I shewed him the box; I turned to my apprentice and said have you taken a ring from the box, in the hearing of the prisoner; he answered no it was in the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in fact in the box at that time - A. It was not. I asked the prisoner who recommended him; he said a Mr. Cotton; I said I did not know any person of that name; he said the last time he had his goods of Mr. Leplaster, Ratcliffe highway, but he did not use him well, so he came to me. He did not take the watch, he went out; he said he lived at No. 3, Clark's terrace, New road, that his name was John Jameson; I told my apprentice to go after the prisoner to see if he lived at the house he said he did, as I suspected that he had got the ring; I looked for the ring after the prisoner was gone among the watches, I did not find it; I saw no more of him till I took him in custody; the next morning I went into a street in the New road to a pawnbrokers to stop it if in case it should be brought there; when I came to the shop, turning by the corner of Chapman street, I met the prisoner turning the corner; I immediately collared him, and asked him how he came to rob me; he said if I would come home to his mother's he would tell me all about it; I told him he must go with me to the office; a soldier coming up I desired him to assist me in taking him to the office; he did; going along he said if I would go into a public house, he would send for his father, and would satisfy me; I told him it was too late, it was not in my power to settle it; I took him to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the ring again - A. I never saw it again; it was a broad gold ring, with a hair plat, and with a gold cypher, A T set round with pearl.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of it - A. Two pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in your shop for sale - A. No, a lady had it of me some months before; and the cypher had come loose; I had to tighten the cypher; it was an article that I had sold, it was brought back to be altered.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was in your shop at the time - A. My apprentice, nobody else.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Alley. I dare say you had many valuable things in that case - A. Yes, there were a great many more valuable things than that.</p>
               <p>Q. So that a person who had an opportunity might take a thing more valuable than that - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost nothing else that you know of - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The next morning you met him in the street, you asked him how he could have robbed you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He said if you would go home with him to his house his mother would satisfy you - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear him bargaining with your master<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180807130029"/>and giving orders for watches - A. Yes, I was not above two yards from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen that ring which was in the said glass - A. Yes, I put it in the night before; I put it in the gold box, the gold box was in the window; it was taken out to shew the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether the ring was in the box when it was taken out to shew the prisoner. A. I did not; the box had not been out to any body else but the prisoner, since the night before; I had been in the shop the whole time.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you had other customers in the shop between the evening before and this time - A. There might have been, but not above one or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe this box lay between the prisoner and your master - A. It laid on the counter before the prisoner, open.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him take any thing out I suppose - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember your master speaking to you about the ring - A. My master asked me where the ring was; I said in the gold box on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see it there at that time - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you look - A. No, the prisoner turned it off, he asked for something else. When the prisoner went out of the shop my master ordered me to follow him; he turned to the right towards Mile End.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that towards the place where he said he lived - A. Yes; when he had got some way I saw him look at something in his right hand; he turned the corner of the new road, and my being the other side of the way I saw there was a boy waiting for him; the boy was standing still, they walked down the New road together, the prisoner turned back, he saw me as I suppose; he went on to the second turning of the New road, and then the boy and he parted; the prisoner went on till he came to the place, then I pursued him, he got up by Cannon street turnpike, he turned the corner; it was not above a minute before I was up there; I lost him, I went home and dined; my master told me to go out to the pawnbrokers; the first place I came to was Mr. Sowerby's, a pawnbroker's in the New road, while I was giving Mr. Sowerby a description, the prisoner was in one of the private boxes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him - A. No, the servant said there was a man came and offered a ring to pledge, he was in one of the private boxes; I ran out and the servant with me, we saw the prisoner in the back streets; the prisoner looked back, saw us, and we saw no more of him.</p>

               <p>Q. While that young man was there did any body come to your shop to pledge any thing - A. Yes, the prisoner, he came in one of the private boxes, he put a hair ring down on the counter.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a ring was it - A. A ring with hair plat and two cyphers; I saw the ring, he said he wanted seven shillings on it. I did not take up the ring, I was serving another customer; he as I suppose heard Hodges giving the description, took up the ring and ran away; I went out with Hodges, I saw the prisoner in a street about forty yards from our shop, he was walking along very fast; when I got within twenty yards of him he turned round saw me, he walked as fast as he could to the corner of the street and ran away; then I lost sight of him; on the next day as I was coming down Cannon street road, I saw Mr. Sanders had got hold of the prisoner; I went up to him and said that is the young man that offered the ring to pledge at our shop, and then ran away. I have known his face these four or five years.</p>

As we were going to the Mansion house he mentioned that he gave eighteen pounds for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards enquire whether he knew a ribbon dresser of the name of Dean - A. Yes, he said he did not. I asked him if he knew Bell square, he said no; after denying it two or three times, he confessed he did.</p>

On the 18th of June, between ten and eleven o'clock, the prisoner came with three pieces of ribbon to get them dressed, he asked me to get them dressed in the course of an hour; I told him it was impossible, the fires were not alight, in consequence they could not be dressed: he opened the goods, I knew them to be four pieces of Mr. Smith's in Gutter lane; I told him with his leave I would take the goods and ask my husband; he gave them me; I took them up stairs and asked him if they were not Mr. Smith's goods.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what passed between you and your husband the goods were kept - A. Exactly so. When I came down stairs I said they would be done in an hour and a half; he said that would do, and went away; he promised to return in an hour and an half. After he was gone my husband took the goods to Mr. Smith.</p>

On the 18th of June I accompanied the prisoner to his house, he said he had a quantity more ribbons that he bought at the same time with those produced before the lord mayor by the dressers, but what number of pieces he could not tell, nor of whom he bought them. We had this conversation in his house. Going along he said he bought them of a man that came into his shop, but he did not know where he lived nor his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that he had received them in a parcel from the country - A. He did not When we came to his house he went to a drawer on the left hand side of the shop, he produced thirty one pieces first; this single half piece of white was found afterwards in a drawer on the right hand side of the shop; he said he bought that of Mr. Abbot or Mr. Evans; Mr. Smith claimed it as his pattern, and he believed it came with the others. Mrs. Smith asked him if he had a bill of parcels with it, he said he dare say he had; his wife went to a file to see if she could find it; she could not; he said he gave eighteen pounds for them - two pieces of Irish linen in part, and the rest in money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. He told you he himself did not understand ribbons in an undressed state - A. He did.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your asking him where they were, he shewed you where they were - A. Yes; he asked his wife where they were, and brought them forward to us before we made any search.</p>

I saw it safe in the morning about seven o'clock; in the afternoon I was looking out of the chamber window, I saw the prisoner coming out of the door with a large bulk in the tail of her gown, of the left side; I went down as quick as possible; I had a large salt fish in the washhouse; I perceived the fish was gone; I followed the prisoner, she was about twenty yards off, turning an alley, she was shifting the property from the left arm to the right; I called out to the prisoner, good woman come back, you have got that which does not belong to you; in shuffling to get away from me she dropped the property at the corner of Wheeler street; I caught her, I brought the prisoner back; I applied the lead she had dropped to the washhouse; it fitted exactly the place, and the part it was missing from.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your fish - A. Yes; I brought her and the property all back; I delivered her to Mr. Hart the watchhouse keeper; this is the lead and the cock I took from her, it was fastened to the wall, she had twisted it off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was very much in liquor, I did not know any thing about it till I was in the watchhouse; I beg his pardon.</p>

            . I am a labouring man; my house is about an hundred yards from Wheatley's. On Monday morning me and my wife had staid late at a friend's; I was walking up Oxford street towards Bayswater with my wife, and just before I came to Park lane, I saw a sow and seven pigs, and the prisoner and another man driving them; they turned them down Park lane.</p>
               <p>Q. They were driving them in a contrary direction to Bayswater - A. Yes. I asked the prisoner how he came by them pigs; he said he was going to Smithfield the back way; that gave me suspicion the pigs were stolen; I told the prisoner they were Wheatley's pigs; he answered they was not; he said there were eight or nine in the drove, and Wheatley had but seven; I told him I was not satisfied.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the other man from him at the time this conversation past - A. Fifty yards or better; he was going on with the pigs; I ran after the other man; he followed me; when I came up I saw they were Wheatley's sow and pigs, I knew the sow and pigs; I said to the man where did you get the sow and pigs from; he lifted up his whip with both his hands and said what is that to you; the prisoner was by at the time; I drew back, else he would have struck me; I said it was nothing to me; I then went to the head of the pigs and walked before them; I thought if I could get him as far as the watch box the watchman and I would be able to take him; then the man ran away; I followed him and halloaed out watch.</p>
               <p>Q. That man made his escape - A. Yes. When I came back I found the prisoner along with the sow and pigs, standing in Park-lane; I asked him how he came to be so bad as to take the poor man's sow and pigs; he said he did not know the sow and pigs; he came to look for his onions, some men had stole his onions. He came on very quietly to Bayswater; we could have took the other man if he would have assisted, instead of which he run in between my wife and the other man. The prisoner said when he came back to Bayswater, to Wheatley, that he would never have found his pigs again if it had not been for him; for me and my wife had them.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Walford. The prisoner was walking with the other man, did not you ask the prisoner who the pigs belonged to - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say they belonged to the other man - A. No; he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. This man had no whip or stick. How long had they been walking together - A. That I cannot say. The other man had a whip, the prisoner had none.</p>
               <p>Q. That moment you came up you saw them talking together - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner near enough to see this man lift up the whip against you - A. I think he was.</p>
               <p>Q. When you asked him how he could take this poor man's sow and pigs, the first word he said was that he was come after a man that had stole his onions - A. He did not say that till we got back to Bayswater. Me and my wife drove the sow and pigs to Bayswater; he followed us quietly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did the prisoner run up to your assistance when he saw the man aim at you - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>MRS. HAINES. Q. How far is the prosecutor's house from the turnpike - A. About half mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you and your husband been in London on the 10th of July - A. Yes; we had been to see some friends in Camel's buildings, Orchard street. On returning home we saw the pigs opposite of Park lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the sow and pigs - A. I told my husband they were Wheatley's sow and pigs.</p>
               <p>Q. What direction were they then in when you first saw them - A. They were coming up Oxford street; they turned down Park lane when we first saw them; they were going into London. My husband went up to the prisoner and said Charles, how comes this; he said the man was going to drive the pigs to Smithfield the back way; my husband said they were Wheatley's sow and pigs; he said, no, because Wheatley had seven, and here was eight or nine in that drove; my husband was not satisfied; he ran after the pigs, as the man had drove them on; he got up to the man, tapped him on the arm, and said my friend where did you get these pigs from.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you and the prisoner from them - A. The prisoner was close by me; I could see him lift up the handle part of the whip; my husband went on rather before, thinking to meet with a watchman; when he came to the watch box facing of Wood's Mews, Park lane, this man made off;

             ran between me and him; I said to my husband this man is run away; he told me to call watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner give you any assistance to stop him - A. No. I run down Green street into Norfolk street after the man, till I could run no farther; when I came back into Park lane the prisoner stood in the same spot where I had left him; the sow had got out of the road; she was laying down near the road suckling her pigs; the prisoner abused me; he said it was d - nation odd that me and my husband should know the pigs without being concerned in it, and so he continued till I got very nigh home, and then I went and fetched Mr. Wheatley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at all account how he was out at that time of the night - A. Not till we got home; then he went into his own place; he brought out a handful of onions and said he had followed the man that had stolen his onions.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say who the man was - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When the pigs were discovered and after this man had run away, did he go after the man that stole the onions - A. No; he never said any thing about it till he got to his own premises. The sow and pigs were delivered over to Wheatley; we have got a witness here that saw him gather the onions.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What was the value of this sow and pigs - A. Six pound altogether.</p>

            . I am a coachmaker's sawyer when I can get it to do. Upon this alarm I went out in the road; I heard the prisoner abuse this man and woman with language that is not fit to be used; he went into the garden and pulled up the onions himself by handfulls; he brought them out and trembled like an aspen leaf; he said that this man wanted to take the onions.</p>

Q. Were you coming to London on the night these pigs were stole - A. No, I was going home; I met the prisoner alone, just through Bayswater turnpike, it was about half past two o'clock in the morning; I saw no pigs at all. I said to him is that you, he made me no answer; I am a lamp lighter.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner on the Edgeware road - A. There was a man came down the road, I do not think it was the prisoner; I saw but one man; I challenged the man, I asked him where he brought the pigs from; I called the turnpike man out, he gave me a rough answer; so I did not stop talking with him; the turnpike man said there was another man on the other side. It was a small white sow, with five or six pigs; they were coming towards London.</p>

               <p>Q. You say that this man was one that sat by you, did the man in the smock frock get away - A I cannot say; I was so far gone.</p>

I can; I took it out of my pocket to pay the reckoning at the Angel; and then I am quite sure I had the dollar and some silver, as to gold I cannot say; the officer has the money; I saw the dollar before the magistrate, and half a crown and two shillings; I had no mark on the dollar, or any of the money.</p>

               <p>Q. How were these two men dressed - A. One a light coloured coat, and the prisoner in a smock frock.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prosecutor.) How was the man dressed who cut your breeches - A. He had a smock frock on.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you said the other man had a smock frock on - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. He did say so.</p>
               <p>Patrol. I took him in custody, I had only hold of the man in the smock frock, he called the other man Bob; I told the prisoner I had a suspicion of his robbing Pardon, he denied it; I took him into the watchhouse, then I fetched in the other man into the watchhouse, they were both searched by the officer of the night; I saw the dollar, half crown, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180807130035"/>two shillings, found upon the prisoner, and the bottom part of the pocket, he had a large knife in his pocket: the other man had a small knife; the other man was discharged, there was nothing found against him.</p>
               <p>Q. From any thing that the prisoner said, or from any enquiry you made, you do not know that ever the prisoner was in the Angel - A. No.</p>

            . I am a headborough; I searched the prisoner and the other man in the watchhouse; upon the prisoner I found a dollar, a French half crown, two shillings in silver, two knives, and the bottom part of a pocket. I found upon the other man, five penny worth of halfpence, no knife at all. The prosecutor could not tell what house he had been in; I found it out afterwards; the prosecutor said he had lost a seven shilling piece, a dollar, and some silver; the bottom of the pocket matches exactly the place where it was cut from.</p>

I was going through Covent Garden, this woman accosted me, she pleaded a great deal of distress, and asked me to give her a glass of gin; I took her over to a public house and gave her a glass of gin; I drank nothing at all. We returned from there; she said she had something particular to say to me; we went down <placeName id="t18080713-44-crimeloc270">Southampton street in Maiden lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. Do you know the notes to be yours - A. I cannot swear to the numbers; from the appearance of them they are my notes; the notes I had were chiefly new.</p>

            . About three o'clock the prosecutor brought this woman to me and said she had robbed him of three one pound notes. I told the woman to empty her pockets; she produced a silk handkerchief on the table; these two one pound notes dropped from the pocket; she said that the prosecutor had given her the two notes in lieu of a half guinea he promised her; the prosecutor insisted upon it he had three, but he gave her none; I searched her; nothing was found.</p>


               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the night this happened I met with a gentleman I had known before; he gave me two one pound note and a seven shilling piece; I met with a young woman, I asked her to have something to drink, I was rather intoxicated; I went home with intention to leave the notes, I forgot it; - does it stand to reason if I had taken the money from that man that I would insist upon being searched.</p>

            . Q. Do you live in this house - A. Yes, on the ground floor; a young woman of the name of Hamilton lives up stairs; there are but two rooms in the house. This gentleman came in about eleven o'clock and went up stairs to Mrs. Hamilton.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stay there - A. I saw him again in the afternoon, he was enquiring for somebody; the young woman came down and he went up again; I hardly knew him; I saw the woman while he was there, coming down backwards and forwards of her errands.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she was not laying in bed - A I do not know, I was not in the room, I mind my own affairs, I do not mind what any body does in the house or in the court. When Mr. Kemp came down he asked us to drink three times before the porter was finished, then he asked us to have a drop of rum; he gave me a shilling, he told me to get it good, because what he had been drinking all day was shocking stuff.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober - A. I do not know. When I came in with the rum, the prisoner said this gentleman has got only sixpence in his pocket; she said she was sick, and went out; the gentleman as he was going out, said what am I to do, if I give you something, I must change a note; I said, sir, I can get you change; he put his hand in his pocket and said I am robbed; I said put your watch in your pocket and your hat on; I locked my door and ran after her; I said this gentleman says he has been robbed; she ran down the steps and I after her, she said you heard me say he had got but sixpence; she said she had no money, she would not come back for any body; a person came up to me and said you must go home, your door is broke open. I then returned home.</p>
               <p>- FOX. I am a constable. I was told that a gentleman was robbed of forty pounds at a house in Bell court; I went there, I found Mr. Kemp standing at the door, he said, I was robbed in that room; he begged me to break the door open; I examined the room, I found nothing; Bet Hamilton stood on the foot of the stairs; when I moved her she went out.

On the 11th of June I found the prisoner at her lodgings in York street, Westminster; when she opened the door to me she had the gown in her hand; I asked her what she was going to do with that gown, she said she was going to wash it; I took her and the gown to the public house and sent for the constable.

I met the prisoner, he was coming down stairs; I asked him what he had, he said Pearey's tools, the bag on his shoulder was bulky; I took it down and found the contents of it was lead; I asked him where he was going with it; he said to Pearey's lodgings in Drury lane. I told him I could not put up with such a daring felony; I took him before the magistrate directly at Bow street.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had taken him to Bow street did you examine to see whether lead had been taken away from any part of the house - A. I did, it was taken from a small gutter behind the chimney; I measured the place, I found the lead corresponded exactly.</p>

Mr. Jones brought the man into the garret between eleven and twelve o'clock, with with the lead in my bag; Mr. Jones enquired of me what I knew of the lead in that bag; I said that I did not know that there was any lead in the bag, my tools were in the bag a few minutes before, the prisoner said that I told him to take my tools out and put the lead in and take it to where I lived; I told him I lived with Mr. King, carpenter, No. 3, little Essex street, Strand. I never gave him any direction to carry the lead, nor had any suspicion of it being taken away; that I am willing to testify was it at the peril of my soul.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes, on Saturday six weeks ago the came about eleven o'clock in the morning; I told her the people was gone and she should have the room, she had spoke before for the room; she had been four times before about these lodgings; she said she took in ladies linen to wash, and her husband was a gentleman's servant at Hackney.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house did you agree to let her have - A. The lower back parlour on the ground floor furnished; about five o'clock in the afternoon, I agreed with her to have the room; she brought two small bundles with her, and asked my leave to put them into the drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she stay in the house - A. Not above an hour or three quarter's in the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. After having made the bargain at five occlock, are you sure there was any bed linen - A. Yes, she took the dirty sheets off the bed, and I brought her down clean linen.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180807130040"/>Q. Did she come to sleep there that night - A. No, I gave her the key of the street door, and shewed her how to come in, in case I might be out of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her again the next day - A. No, last Saturday week was the next time I saw her after that I examined the room finding she did not come home, and missed the sheets.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the sheets again - A. Never, I saw her in Spitalfields watchhouse, she was not taken up on my charge. The two bundles she brought in was hay in one bundle and grass in the other; she emptied the contents of the handkerchiefs in the room, and took the handkerchiefs with her, and the key of the street door.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the sheets - A. Four shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I gave her the dirty sheets, I had no clean sheets at all; the bed was very dirty, and there was no lock to the door.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I am very sure I put down a pair of clean sheets, she said she liked the room very well, and I am sure there were neither hay or grass in the room before she came in.</p>

             present - A. I believe not; she is very unwell; she knows the prisoner Worboys brought a trunk in but she cannot swear to the trunk. On the 4th of June last I received information that Worboys was a <rs id="t18080713-56-deflabel349" type="occupation">deserter</rs>

The officer gave him up; I told him what I had found at his lodgings; he admitted the trunk might be found there, because he found the trunk in Aldersgate street before Christmas, he said it was open, he hardly knew what was in it; I said you have had it repaired since, have not you; he said no; I found the old hasp in one of the drawers; here is another hasp had been put on; he said he had not broke it open, it was open before. I took Seton on the 13th of June; I found him at a public house door in Nightingale lane. I told him the occasion of my taking him; he said he was quite innocent, he knew nothing of it. I have known him for some time; I believe he has something coming in.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not find this man with Worboys - A. No.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Smith, when I was taken to your shop, you told me you would transport me if it cost you one hundred pounds, and when I came to the office you told me you would let me off if I would go on board a ship.</p>

            . I work for Messrs Smith and Holton. I took the prisoner in Queen Ann street, he was walking along with the whip; he told me he was going with the whip to a gentleman in the Strand or Fleet street; the prisoner came very quietly to the shop. I know the whip to be my master's it was not finished. I remember the workman making it.</p>
               <p>- BUDGELL. I am an officer, I searched the prisoner; I found the ticket of a rule and a screw wrench upon him; he said he found all the tickets.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 20th of May at night what time did you leave the accompting house - A I left it at eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time what money was there in the desk - A. Twenty six pounds in bank notes, and about thirty three pounds in cash; seven shilling pieces, half guineas, two guineas, and eight pounds in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. In the iron chest was there any quantity of copper - A. Yes; they were tied up in five shillings and half crown papers, halfpence and penny pieces; they were in blue and brown paper. I shut the outer accounting house door at ten o'clock, which is for the accommodation of the officers. I left the inner accounting house secured. The accounting house and dwelling house is all under one roof, it is a continuation of my house. The clerk sleeps over the accounting house; it is inclosed within my gates.</p>
               <p>Q. At what hour the next morning were you alarmed - A. A little before five o'clock. When I came down I found the second door of the inner accounting house forced open; the first accounting house door they had not touched; a man can come to the second door without going to the first, there is a passage to it; the second accounting house door had been forced open, the staple broke, and the lock wrenched; it had the appearance as if done with an iron crow. I found the door that goes to the desk forced open, my desk and my partners throwed back and broken open. The money and the bank notes that I have spoken of, were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the iron chest broken open - A. I cannot say; the copper was kept in the iron chest; the iron chest has been opened, and the money was gone; the key was in my desk; the papers were throwed about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180807130042"/>and by the side of the iron chest was a dark lanthorn. The lock of the wicket gate was forced; it must have been a violent wrench to break it open. The prisoner came to work that day a little after six o'clock; he took no notice of the accounting house being broke open; I said nothing to him; he went to his work, I did not cause him to be apprehended till the Monday following, then I went to his lodgings; I found penny pieces and half crowns, with some blue paper along with the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him by what means he became possessed of that money - A. I did; he said it was what he and his wife had saved from their hard earnings.</p>
               <p>Q. How much a week did this man have settled wages - A. Eighteen shillings a week.</p>
               <p>Court. Persons employed in a brewer's service if they had a mind to save copper, would save it in that manner - A. Yes. He told me he had no more money than that which he had taken from him; he was released on the Saturday following. On the Thursday following he was apprehended again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. How much money had he about him then - A. I think between seven and eight pounds in gold, seven shilling pieces, half guineas, two or three half crowns, and two shillings; I cannot speak positively to the sum.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then find at his lodging any new articles that you did not find at the first time - A. Several, there were sheeting, tablecloth, a new coat and waistcoat, and small clothes, to the value of between four and five pounds.</p>

I searched his lodgings on the Monday; I found there seventy six penny pieces, thirty two halfpence, a dollar, ten half crowns, and seventeen shillings; this was the first search; one half guinea, and four seven shilling piecet, and some blue paper, it had been apparently cut as if to put halfpence in. He was set at liberty on the Saturday following, and he was apprehended on the 3d. of June; I then secured him; I asked him what he had got about him; he said a little silver he believed in this purse; I found it in his left hand breeches pocket, three half crowns, and two shillings, he seemed very restless; I said let us see what you have got in your watch pocket; I found these five half guineas, and ten seven shilling pieces; I secured him, and the prosecutor and I went to the prisoner's lodgings again; on searching I found three small pieces of linen for shirting, a tablecloth, a new pocket handkerchief, three pair of cotton stockings, and a new coat, waistcoat, and breeches, which was not there on the first search.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ask him how he came by this money you found on the second search - A. He said he had saved it by his hard work.</p>

Going on towards three o'clock, it was not day light when I first saw the muskets, it was twilight, I saw three men coming down Aylesbury street, making towards where them things stood, then it was light; when they got down Aylesbury street they turned down St. James' walk, as though they were going towards the prison; when they came to the corner of School house yard they stopped there; that was where the fire arms were; I was about fifty yards from them; the other watchman was in the rear. My companion sprang out and went after them; two of them ran through School house yard, and one of them went down Aylesbury street; he that came towards Aylesbury street escaped entirely; Smith and I assisted in securing him in the passage leading to St. John's square. Simpson was the first man that laid hold of Smith, I came up and assisted; he went down to the watchhouse very quietly, he made very little resistance; when I returned from the watchhouse I saw Meyrick in my two partners hands, he tried to kick and throw them up if he could. I helped in bringing him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q Did you then go back to where the fire arms was - A. Yes, they had been moved; then I found that bottle, about twenty yards off from where the things had been concealed in School house yard, it was lying down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. When you first saw the muskets it was twilight - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was so light you could see muskets - A. Yes; it was not very light, the day was breaking.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got these persons you had got your cutlass - A. I had not; the superintendant had it drawn.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that Smith, when he was taken, he went very quietly with you to the watchhouse, but Meyrick he was very resolute - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he desire you to tell him what he was taken for - A. He did say he had done nothing; he asked why he was taken, I said for running away; we did not know at that time where the robbery had been committed.</p>

            . Q. I believe you are superintendant of the watch - A. I am, of St. James's, Clerkenwell. In consequence of Parker's information I went to the spot and looked at the arms; the blunderbuss was laid behind a post, and the musket was laid behind the board of a rail.</p>

               <p>Q. What time was this that you saw the watchman - A. I think it might be ten minutes past two o'clock, it was twilight, the day had not completely broke.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe after this you and the watchman concealed yourselves to watch for the persons that came after these things - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did any person come - A. The chimes had just gone a quarter before three; there were three men came, they came off Clerkenwell green.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the way from Aylesbury street - A. Yes. The two prisoners were two of the men, I could plainly see them; when they came to the spot they made a dead halt and looked round them, as if to see if any person was watching them; after they had looked round, the prisoner Smith stooped and picked up the blunderbuss, he had it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of the others do any thing - A. Two of them were stooping behind the post; Meyrick was further in School house yard, just by the musket. When he stooped down I sprang out; the other watchman followed the two prisoners down School house yard, and the other turned round; Meyrick let fall a bottle, it broke, I have got the neck of the bottle with the cork<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180807130044"/>in; the liquor was spilled; I tasted it, it was wine.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the blunderbuss that Smith picked up - A. He threw down the blunderbuss before he run down School house yard; I pursued Smith and overtook him at Jerusalem passage; I apprehended him. Parker came up in a minute afterwards; we brought him to the watchhouse, with the assistance of a third man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing - A. I put the point of the hanger to his breast and told him if he resisted I would run him through. After I had taken Smith to the watchhouse I immediately ran back, and just by the church rails Meyrick was in the custody of Burns and others; he was tearing about in a dreadful way; I told him if he did not submit I would cut his head off; he was quieter after that.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took him into Smith, did you ask Smith and him any questions - A. They were put in separate places; we took Smith out; the fire arms were upon the table; we asked him if he knew any thing of these fire arms, he said he never saw them in his life.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that you saw him throw the blunderbuss down - A. I am positive; I searched him, he had nothing upon him but a snuff box with some snuff in it; I asked Smith what his name was, he would not tell; we entered it in the charge book name unknown. Meyrick had given me another name at another time, that of Foster.</p>

               <p>Q. Then at the time when you first saw them, there was not light enough to see their features - A. Not when I first saw them; at three o'clock there was.</p>

               <p>Smith's Defence. In the morning I passed by the place; I was coming from No. 63, Brick lane, Old street; I was going to the Black Horse, Rathbone place, to borrow a horse for a friend of mine to go to Fairlop fair; as I was going by this place, that man sprang upon me like a tyger, he swore he would cut my leg or arm off; I ran, not with any fear fear for what I had done, I thought the man would run the sword in me; him and the watchman took me to the watchhouse, there they locked me up in a little hole, they called me out to know if I would own to either of these pieces; I told them I never saw either of these pieces in my life; I knew nothing at all about them; in the morning they took me to Hatton garden, from there down to the House of Correction; Mr. Trott and Mr. Hunt went to my place of residence, they secured my wife and young child sucking at the breast, and left two children to the mercy of the street for five days, without bread and meat, or any body to give them any thing; they took the landlord of the house away and shut him up in prison the same length of time.</p>
               <p>Meyrick's Defence. Since the landlord of the house wife has been dead, I have lodged in the same house with Smith in the one pair of stairs. On that morning I got up, I believe about three o'clock, to go to a friend of mine, his name was Sims, he had promised me various times he would indulge me with the use of a horse to go to Fairlop fair; when I had got there I had got to go to Whitechapel, to my harness and chaise cart; when I came to this place they sprung upon Smith. I am a younger man than he; I ran swifter; I had no arms in my hand; I certainly did resist a little when I was taken. I acknowledged to being present to where this property was, but I never stooped to it.</p>
               <p>Meyrick's Q. (to Simpson.) You say that I threw a bottle out of my hand, in what place might I be when I chucked the bottle out of my hand - A. You were running across the road.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance were you from me - A. About seven yards.</p>
               <p>Meyrick. I never had any bottle in my hand.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. to Simpson. How far distant was he from you when you saw him throw the bottle away - A. About five or six or seven yards; he was in a light coloured coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that you are able to say that he was the person that threw away that bottle - A. Most assuredly.</p>
               <p>Meyrick. I had a handkerchief on, they pulled it tight had I not made resistance I must have been choaked.</p>

            . I live on the same floor. Coming down stairs I met Mr. Bly; he took a key, from a comrade of the prisoner's; looking round the room I saw a handkerchief; Mr. Bly took the handkerchief; he never said to me what was in it.</p>
               <p>MR. BLY. On Sunday morning the 3d of July, about ten o'clock, the prosecutor came to me and said the prisoner had robbed him of his watch. I went to search the room. Between the tiling I found a handkerchief; in the handkerchief this watch was hid; I brought it to the prosecutor, he said it was his watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the money - A. No.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I got up in the morning and went into the public house; this gentleman came and took me up. I asked him five shillings to sleep with me; he said he had no more than three shillings. I saw no watch; if I had known where the watch was, from eight o'clock till ten, I should have known where to have made away with it.</p>
