            . I employed Mr. Pain, a master Carpenter, last March it was two years ago, to do up my house: he had several journeymen employed at it: I lost two oil-stones, at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the use of oil-stones? </p>
               <p>Parker. They are to set a keen edge upon tools after they are ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get them again?</p>
               <p>Parker. I have one of them again the prisoner brought it and delivered it to my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other?</p>
               <p>Parker. He has since confessed he threw that away in the fields. An oil-stone produced. This is that which he brought again, it is my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him at any time say any thing as to these oil-stones; did he acknowledge or deny taking them?</p>
               <p>Parker. I took him up with a warrant; he said he took them, but thought them to be of no value.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them?</p>
               <p>Parker. I do not imagine them to be worth any thing like what they are valued at in the indictment, they are not the things I imagined them to be.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you often declared, that the stones were of so little value, that you was sorry you had brought on this thing?</p>
               <p>Parker. I have; I did it with intent to find out other things that I lost about the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. What opinion had you of the prisoner when he work'd at your house?</p>
               <p>Parker. I had a very good opinion of him 'till I lost many things; and by the discovery of one, thought I should find out the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. From that good opinion you had of him whether you have not supported him since he has been in goal?</p>
               <p>Parker. I have in some measure.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you imagine he only took these stones as considering them to be trifling things?</p>

               <p>Mr. Pain. I was doing the jobb for Mr. Parker, at his house in <placeName id="t17590425-2-crimeloc9">Totenham-Court Road</placeName>

I knowing the use of these stones, and that some of them are very valuable, I made inquiry about them, and suspected the prisoner. I asked him to see his oil-stone; he said, he had never an oil-stone in the world but one; I asked him to produce that, then he said, it was at his lodgings in Shoe-lane; I bid him fetch it; he came and brought me a stone, but not this that is here produced, it was one of mine which I had lost: by catching him in that lie, I said, I believe you are guilty of taking Mr. Parker's. So if you do not tell me the truth I'll send for a constable, and send you away; upon that he cried, and said, he had one piece of Mr. Parker's, and he would go and fetch it, which he did (this is the same) I asked him if he had never another; he said no, that was all he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where he had this stone?</p>
               <p>Mr. Pain. He said, he had it from Mr Parker's house; I perswaded him to carry it again; accordingly he said he would, and went from me with it; and I find since he did carry it. As soon as he came back again, I paid him what was due to him, and turned him away.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he worked for you?</p>
               <p>Pain. He had worked for me about eighteen months.</p>
               <p>Q. How had he behaved in that time?</p>
               <p>Pain. He had behaved honestly as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the value of this stone?</p>
               <p>Pain. He takes it in his hand. (It was broke in two pieces.) This is an out-side slabb, and he having broke it in flitting of it, it is but of little use.</p>
               <p>Q. Wouldy on employ him again was he at liberty?</p>
               <p>Pain. No, I would not: I have great reason not to employ him.</p>

On the 13th of March last I was at work near my own house at three or four little houses; there were the prisoner and others at work also; my watch was hanging by the mantlepiece; it was missing, and at the same time the prisoner was absconded, on which I suspected he must be the person that took it, and I pursued and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you missed it was it that you had seen it?</p>
               <p>Wells. I had seen it about two hours before.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he got before you took him?</p>
               <p>Wells. He was got to London; I found him in East-Smithfield; I taxed him with taking it; he told me he had pawn'd it to a person next door to the red-cross in East-Smithfield; I went with him there for it, and found it was pawn'd for a guinea; he had a little money left out of the guinea, which we offered to the pawnbroker for it, I not having enough about me to make it a guinea, the pawnbroker would not let me have it; I took the prisoner before the justice, and he was committed; and the justice granted me a warrant to fetch the pawnbroker.</p>

               <p>John Jukes. On the 7th of May, either that night or next morning, I lost a cow calf out of my coop, where were three others.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see this calf last?</p>
               <p>Jukes. I saw it over night and suckled it, and missed it at five the next morning: it was worth 45 s. that I was bid for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you found it again?</p>
               <p>Jukes. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Jukes. I went and got a warrant, and searched about the parish, and after that, a woman that is here, came to me about seven months after, and said, she saw me as I was going by the prisoner's house, and she went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175904250007"/> backwards to him, and said, we shall be all hanged, here is Jukes searching about for his calf; she said, the prisoner had just mopped up the blood, and covered the calf up under some wood; I took up the prisoner and charged him with stealing my calf; he told me himself how he took it, and led it away; he said it was in the morning, when the larks were singing as he led it to his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any others hear this confession?</p>

               <p>Q. What goods did you let her with the room?</p>
               <p>Vaughan. The things mentioned in the indictment, with others; she having been absent from the room for nine days, I began to inquire after her, and found her in Turnmill-street; she said, she would come in the afternoon; but she did not come; then I looked into the room, and found the things mentioned in the indictment were missing; I took her up and charged her with taking them away; she confessed she had taken them, and pawned some and sold others.</p>

               <p>Q. What was her business?</p>
               <p>Masters. She used to make pens for booksellers to rule their streight lines in their books: she pledged a sheet, a pottage pot, and a curtain, to me at three different times. Produced in court.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Masters. About the middle of February last.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What time did the prisoner lodge at your house?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. We know she had pledged them all before the 20th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Was her lodging-room door locked when she was absent?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. She had locked it, and had the key with her.</p>
               <p>Magdalen Lawrence. The prisoner came one morning to me, and asked me if I would buy some things out of pawn, her property, and seemed to cry. I asked her what they were, and what they would fetch; she said, they were worth about a crown. I went with her to the Pawnbroker's; she called for the things, which came to three shillings and eight pence; I paid the money, and brought them home; she agreed to take five shillings and two pence in the whole, so I gave her eighteen-pence, and had them about ten days before the officers came and took them away. I had made the check curtain into aprons. Producing them. A pottage pot produced by the Constable.</p>
               <p>Masters. The prisoner pledged such a pot as this to me; but it has been out of my hands some time, I cannot swear to it.</p>

               <p>Mathew Reay. On Monday the 9th of April about 7 in the evening, it might be five or six minutes after; I was going to Kentish-town from London, I observed the prisoner at the bar as I was going along in <placeName id="t17590425-10-crimeloc54">the second field from Totenham-court turnpike</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was he going your way, or did you meet him?</p>
               <p>Reay. I met him: he was coming towards London, I bid him a good night, and the moment he past me he knock'd me down, and put his hand to my pocket; I said, I hope you will not kill me; he said, he would not strike me any more if I would not be any worse, it was my money he wanted; he ask'd me, if I had a watch; I said, no; he put his hand in my pocket and took out what money I had, which was a guinea in gold and some silver, between seven and ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you down when he took it out?</p>
               <p>Reay. I was: after that he went over the field; as I lay on the ground, I observed him to go to the hedge, and I believe he either went over it, or lay down in the ditch, there I lost sight of him, I did not follow him.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner and be sure.</p>
               <p>Reay. I am very sure he is the man; after I recovered I got up upon my feet, and met a man that was going to Highgate, and told him what had happend; he took me back to the Adam and Eve, by Totenham-Court turnpike; I was hardly sensible when that man met with me; but after some time, being at the Adam and Eve, I came to my perfect senses, and desired to be bleeded; they sent for a surgeon, and I was bleeded.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any pursuit made after the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Reay. No, there was not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175904250009"/>Q. How came he to be taken up?</p>
               <p>Reay. I gave a description of him to every one that asked me about the affair, both at the Adam and Eve, and also when I went home to Kentish Town that evening, and the next morning; after which Mr Maplethorp and Mr Pantin sent for me to Mother-Red-Cap's, they having seen the prisoner go in there; when I came there, he was gone from thence over the fields towards London, in the way that he knocked me down; so we set out after him. They ask'd me if I thought he was the man; I said he look'd like him, but I could not tell 'till I saw his face; then I went up and spoke to the prisoner, and then said I was sure that was the man that knock'd me down and robb'd me; so we seized him, and brought him to the Adam and Eve.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way was he walking when you took him.</p>
               <p>Reay. He was walking towards London.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him, when you say you spoke to him?</p>
               <p>Reay. I asked him if he did not frequent that road pretty often; he said, yes, sometimes. I said I had seen him about that place the last evening, near about that same place, and that he gave me a handsome salute with that stick he then had in his hand, or such another; the other gentleman were behind me, and we said hold of him directly; then I said to him, if you can clear yourself, now is your time to send for your friends, for I'll swear you are the man that robbed me; we staid at the Adam and Eve near two hours, then we took him before Justice Fielding.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your guinea and silver in one pocket?</p>
               <p>Reay. They were.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the person that robb'd you knock you down with?</p>
               <p>Reay. With a stick which he had in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him before?</p>
               <p>Reay. No, not as I remember.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you apprehend you may mistake one man for another?</p>
               <p>Reay. I do not apprehend I have here.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was in the second field beyond the turnpike, Which way did he go from you?</p>
               <p>Reay. He went into the corner of the field near the stile.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way is that towards?</p>
               <p>Reay. It is towards Marybone.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always been certain as to the man, or have you ever mentioned it as matter of belief?</p>
               <p>Reay. No; never as matter of belief, I always said he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing found upon him?</p>
               <p>Reay. No, nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever confess it?</p>
               <p>Reay. No, never; he said I was mistaken, he was not the man, one man might be like another.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he at that time did work over-against Mother-Red-Cap's?</p>
               <p>Reay. Yes, I believe he did; he told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his business ?</p>

            . I spent the Monday evening, being the ninth of this instant, with Mr Maplethorp, the curate of Kentish Town; the prosecutor's maid told me her master had been knock'd down and robb'd, coming to Kentish Town from London. Upon which I went up stairs to see him; he was in bed; I ask'd him how he did; he said his head ach'd a good deal; that he had had a good blow, having been knock'd down on the road. I ask'd him what kind of a man it was that knock'd him down; he described him to me with a loose<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175904250010"/> white coat on, and an apron tuck'd round his middle; and that he look'd like a labouring bricklayer or a mason. The next morning he gave me the same account very punctually. That day, being the tenth, just before church, I went to Mr Maplethorp and told him what an accident Mr Reay had met with, and described the man, as he had described him to me, that had committed the fact. We went to church together; after which I went with him part of the way to town; he said he should be glad if I would come and meet him, when he came back, between five and six o'clock; accordingly, after business was over, I went to meet him.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Pantin. I am a clergyman. I met him between five and six. This was on Tuesday the tenth. Just as I came upon the road, we saw each other; he beckon'd with his hand and ran towards me; when I came up to him, he said, here is a man that answers the description you gave me of the man that robb'd Mr Reay last night; I should be glad if you would step back and call him; the man is gone in at Mother-Red-Cap's, and I'll watch him. I ran back to Kentish Town, and told Mr Reay; he came with me. Mr Maplethorp told us the man was gone out of the house about five minutes; we made haste after him. Mr Maplethorp ask'd Mr Reay, as we came near him, if he thought that look'd like the man; he said he believed he did, but he should know that presently when he saw his face. When we came pretty near him, Mr Reay said I'll go and look in his face, and speak to him, and you will take notice what I say to him, and by that means you will secure him. Mr Reay told the man (which was the prisoner at the bar) he had met him the night before about that place. Mr Reay seized him by his right hand, and I seized the stick, and got it out of his hand; the same which the constable produced, Then we tied his arms back, and carried him back to the Adam and Eve. Mr Reay said positively that was the man, and he would swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say?</p>
               <p>Pantin. He said, he little thought of this. As soon as we laid hold of him I said I thought he little did. He said I am innocent; and persisted in it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How did Mr Reay describe the man as to his size?</p>
               <p>Pantin. He said he was a lusty man.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner; is he a lusty man?</p>
               <p>Pantin. Yes, he appears so to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he describe his features?</p>
               <p>Pantin. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the prisoner said, I little thought of this. If you or I, innocent of an offence, should be charg'd, do not you imagine we should make use of the same expression?</p>
               <p>Pantin. We might. I do not mean that by way of aggravation; the man all along persisted in his innocency.</p>

            . I met Mr Reay going to Kentish Town on Monday the 9th of this instant April, in the bottom field; he was very much stunn'd and stagger'd a little.</p>

               <p>Edwards. It might be a little better than a quarter after seven o'clock. He said to me, if you are an honest man, I hope you will not hurt me, and told me what had happened. I asked him, if he would go with me to Kentish Town ? he said, he had rather go back to the Adam and Eve. He described the man that had robb'd him: that he had on a whitish frock, and was a tallish man, with his apron tuck'd round him. He was blooded at the Adam and Eve, and came pretty well to himself. After that I went back with him to Kentish Town.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was at work at the half-way houses for Mr Harding, on the 9th and 10th of this instant April, As I was going home to London on the 9th, being Monday night, I was got over all the fields, and met a woman that lives on the same estate that I had been at work upon. At about half an hour after six o'clock I got<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175904250011"/> home to my landlady's. Soon after, my supper was not quite ready, I said to her, as my supper is not quite ready, I'll go to Mr. Hardings, which I did about seven o'clock. I returned to my landlady, and sat down to supper, and she fetch'd me some beer, and I never went out of the house that night afterwards.</p>
               <p>The Witnesses for the Prisoner were examined apart.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Hickey. I live on Mr Harding's estate, opposite to Mother-Red-Cap's, I take care of his house there. The prisoner is a Bricklayer, he used to work there; I remember his going away from our house that night that this robbery was committed. He went away about six o'clock, to the best of my knowledge, and at his going away he said, he believed he should have a very wet night of it (it rain'd then).</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him with a stick?</p>
               <p>Hickey. No, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this stick (that is the broomstick).</p>
               <p>Hickey. I know nothing of it. I saw no stick in his hand that night, when he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does he live?</p>
               <p>Hickey. I do not know. He went over the fields towards the Turnpike for London.</p>
               <p>Q. How does he dress?</p>
               <p>Hickey. Always like a labouring man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come to his work on the Tuesday?</p>
               <p>Hickey. He did at six in the morning. Then he work'd in the summer-house. On the Monday he was making of arches before the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any signs of suspicion in him on the Tuesday?</p>
               <p>Hickey. No, I did not, on the Thursday night following (the prisoner being then in prison), I met a man seemingly perfectly like him, when I was within three yards of him I thought it was this bricklayer got out of Newgate. It affrighted me a good deal. He had a stick in his hand about a yard long. He said to me, a good night, and I the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you then?</p>
               <p>Hickey. I was coming from Mr Whitfield's tabernacle.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner a diligent man?</p>

            . I live at the half-way house going to Hampstead, in one of Mr Harding's houses. My mother keeps a chandler's shop there; I met the prisoner as he was going to London from his work, on Monday the 9th of this instant April, at about half an hour after six at night, as near as I can tell, just by Totenham-Court turnpike, that is in the fields joining to the turnpike beyond it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you going?</p>
               <p>Thomas. I was going home. I had been to London, near the New Church in the Strand, to carry home a nurse-child to Mrs Leeson a Haberdasher there; it was six o'clock when I left the New Church in the Strand; the clock struck just as I was coming away, so I guess I was about half an hour in coming there.</p>

               <p>Q. What time was it when you got home?</p>
               <p>Thomas. It wanted about ten or fifteen minutes of seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the clock strike?</p>
               <p>Thomas. No; but after I heard that the man was taken up, I knowing I had met him the night before, I asked Mrs King, a neighbour, what time I came home, and she said, she could tell the time, which she said was about that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you hear of the robbery?</p>
               <p>Thomas. I heard of it on the Tuesday, being the day after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner speak to you when you met him?</p>
               <p>Thomas. He asked me if I would turn back and drink with him; this was just by the Adam and Eve, where we met.</p>

               <p>Lawrence. I looked at the clock at six o'clock that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the clock at seven?</p>
               <p>Lawrence. No, I could not, then it was candle-light, I heard it strike seven; he was then coming from the Hay-market.</p>

            . I live with Mr Harding: the prisoner worked for him; the prisoner came for a pail and a riddle  much about seven o'clock, I can't say, but that it was a little after.</p>
               <p>
             A sieve with large holes in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does your master live?</p>
               <p>Boyde. In the Hay-market.</p>
               <p>Q. What night was this?</p>
               <p>Boyde. It was the night before he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of weather was it?</p>
               <p>Boyde. It was a rainy night; it was darker at seven that night than it is at eight now, being cloudy and raining, my mistress desired me to go and give him the things, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you think it was that time?</p>
               <p>Boyde. I had been out, and coming by Covent-Garden the clock struck six, I told it; I made what haste I could, being wet to the skin; when I came home my mistress bid me go to the fire and put off my cloaths, and after that he came.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is Mr Harding?</p>
               <p>Boyde. He is a Cabinet-maker.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harding. I have an estate over against Mother-Red-Cap's: I have employed the prisoner there several times; he was at work there for me on the 9th and 10th of April instant.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he behave?</p>
               <p>Harding. He is a very constant worker when he is at work; that very Monday night he had finished a piece of work for me; I went down to him the next day, and left him working; he had told me on that Monday when I was there with him, that he would come to my house in London for a pail. I always looked upon him to be an industrious pains taking man; I have trusted him where I have had goods of value; I can't charge him with taking any thing; I always looked upon him to be an honest man.</p>
               <p>Mr Price. I used to employ the prisoner at the bar; I believe I employed him about eight months last summer, while there was business to be done our way.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he behave ?</p>
               <p>Price. Very well, industrious and honest: he never was drunk during the whole time to my knowledge, I looked upon him to be a very honest man.</p>
               <p>Mr Wild. I have known the prisoner ten or twelve years; he has been an industrious man when he had work to do, he had not always work.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he an extravagant or frugal man?</p>
               <p>Wild. I never saw any extravagancy in him; he always bore a good character, that of a good-natured honest working man; and I really believe he deserves that character.</p>
               <p>Mr Watts. I live in Fetter-lane: I have known the prisoner thirty years; I never knew nor heard any harm of him in my life; I believe he deserves the character of an honest man.</p>
               <p>Mr Branson. I live at Hampstead: I have known him three years, he has worked for me twice, the first time about six months; he behaved exceeding well; I have trusted him in a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175904250013"/> great many gentlemens houses; he has worked for me at my Lord Mansfield's; he was always very industrious, and always carried money in his pocket and paid his way; if he was clear of this affair, if he wanted a jobb, I would employ him.</p>
               <p>Mr Buckhurst. I have known the prisoner about three years: he worked for me about a year of that time; he was always very industrious, and never lost any time when he had business; I have trusted him in the best houses in Hampstead; I believe him to be as honest a man as any in the world; if he was discharged from this I would employ him to-morrow.</p>

Amsynk and Drusina, merchants; to be put on board a Hamburgh ship. About ten at night I went down near the lighter, and saw the prisoner in a part of it which I thought was not proper; so I went up into the crane and watched him, and saw him come out of my lighter with a parcel of sugar in his hat; he was got up Bear-Key-Gateway before I could get out of the crane; I went and told the constable of it, and had not been in the house I believe above ten minutes before the prisoner came in; I pulled off his hat, and there was sugar all round the inside of it; then I gave Mr Carter the constable charge of him; I found a bill and a large hammer in the lighter; I do not know whose property they were; I found a vessel in the lighter with the head out of it, and some sugar was littered about the lighter; I am charged with thirty pounds weight, at eight pence a pound for what was missing.

               <p>Forgerson. To the best of my knowledge he never work'd on the Key but one day, then Middleton work'd there that day also; and they begg'd leave to be paid off before they had done, pretending they were going upon duty; which, I believe, was only going to steal sugar.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say where he had the sugar from?</p>

               <p>Mr Lacksham. I have known the Prisoner a year and a half; ever since he has been in town.</p>

               <p>Mr Previn. I have known the prisoner ever since I can remember. He and I both came from one town, Cheltenham in Gloucestershire. He went to the same school, a Latin school, as I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his general character?</p>
               <p>Mr Previn. He always bore an exceeding good character.</p>
               <p>Mr Lawson. I have known the prisoner ever since he was quartered at the Swan in Fuller's Rents.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his character ?</p>
               <p>Mr Lawson. He has a very good character, I have trusted him with ten pounds at a time to carry to Kentish Town.</p>
               <p>Mr Willson. I have known him about two years; he was recommended to me by a person at Cheltenham: he served me as a porter. I trusted him to receive, and very often to pay, considerable sums of money: he always discharged his trust with credit.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Willson. I am a Grocer.</p>
               <p>Mr Nettleship. I have known the prisoner as long as I can remember. I have heard he was a soldier, but have not seen him since he was a soldier 'till now. He has behaved, as I have heard, with honesty.</p>
               <p>Mr Pryer. I know the prisoner extreamly well, and have done this eight months. He was quartered at my house. I always trusted him with any thing I had, except the scrutoire; he never wrong'd me of any thing; he always had the key of the street door, to go out when he thought proper. I never knew him to do any harm in my life.</p>
               <p>Serjeant Denman. I inlisted him on the 20th of February was twelve months.</p>
               <p>Q. What regiment is he in?</p>
               <p>Serjeant Denman. He is in the first regiment; he has always behaved in a very honest manner, and was accounted honest by all his comrades: when we were in the Tower, he never lay out of it.</p>
               <p>Serjeant Hindmarsh. I have known him ever since he inlisted. He lay in the same barracks that I lay in, in the Tower. I have trusted him with my lac'd cloaths, and all I had, and never found any thing deficient.</p>

               <p>Q. At what time of the day?</p>
               <p>Middleton. This was about two o'clock in the day; I stay'd in the gateway. He did not stay in the warehouse above a quarter of an hour, before he threw some sugar out from a warehouse one story high.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see what he was doing where you stood?</p>
               <p>Middleton. No, I could not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with that sugar?</p>
               <p>Middleton. I carried it in a handkerchief. Pope went along with me with the first handkerchief to Mrs Harrison's; he stay'd there while I went and fetch'd two more handkerchiefs full: there were upwards of forty pounds in the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. Who received this sugar?</p>
               <p>Middleton. Mrs Harrison did.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is Mr Harrison of?</p>
               <p>Middleton. I cannot tell what business he follows; I have seen him sometimes upon the Keys among the tobacco, and he has tobacco rolls hung up over his door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body at work in the warehouse where the prisoner went into?</p>
               <p>Middleton. I did not see any body there.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he open the door?</p>
               <p>Middleton. That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Were he or you paid for that sugar?</p>
               <p>Middleton. I saw Mrs Harrison pay him ten shillings and six pence for it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you apprehend he came by it?</p>
               <p>Middleton. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he was going to steal it?</p>

On the 13th of March I went to the Vineyard-house, and got a pint of beer and some bread and cheese; then I went to go to bed. About ten, when I was pulling off my cloaths, I heard a noise in my master's room above. I went round; his door is on the side of a mount on the backside, and that door goes in off the mount one story above mine. There I found the prisoner in the room; the door was open; I ask'd who was there; he seem'd to be trying to get out at the window. When he found he could not, then he came at me; I took him by the collar, and never let go of him 'till I got into a publick house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ask him how he got in?</p>
               <p>Ball. He said he got in at the window; but I found the door broke, and open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say at what time he got in?</p>
               <p>Ball. No, he did not; after I had confin'd him in prison, I went to see how he had got into the garden, and found a door that opens into the vineyard was broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you secure him?</p>
               <p>Ball. In Clerkenwell Bridewell for that night; the next morning I took him to Justice Keeling, who committed him to New-Prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any things found upon him?</p>
               <p>Ball. There were five stocks and a razor, and two or three odd matters.</p>

            . I live near the Vineyard house; it is the next adjoining house, though at some little distance; at ten o'clock that evening I was going to bed; I was half undress'd, and heard a sort of scuffle between two men. I came down, and found the first evidence had got the prisoner at the bar, leading him up to the Vineyard-house (a publick house ). I ask'd the woman of the house if she knew the prisosoner; she said he had had a pint of beer there a little before. I took care of him, while the witness went for a constable. Then he ask'd me to let him go, and said he would never do so any more. After the constable came, he ask'd me to go with Mr Ball to see what damage was done; I went, and saw the door was broke open; also we found three of the buroe locks were broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the house.</p>
               <p>Larser. This is a house in the vineyard; not the house call'd the Vineyard-house, which is a publick house; there is a door opens to the upper room from off a mount; there are several surprizing high hills in the ground, and there is a door on the other side that opens into the lower room, where the gardener lies; one side of the house is finish'd out of a high mount, and the other side quite in a bottom. I saw also a larum-clock taken down from the wainscot; the brass-work was taken out of the case; and several pictures, which used to hang round the room, were taken down and laid in a chair; and a large looking-glass lay in another chair; and a coat, waistcoat, and breeches, lay on the threshold of the door. When I returned back, I saw the constable search the prisoner, and take five linnen stocks, a lock, and a razor, out of his pocket. He was carried to Bridewell that night, it being too late to go before a magistrate. The next day, betwixt ten and eleven, he was committed to New-Prison. In the morning before we went to Mr Keeling. I went to see the situation of the place, and found the coat, waistcoat, and breeches, were gone from where I saw them, but no other things were removed from the places where I saw them before.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was going up the road to Hampstead, and I found these stocks lying in the road; I pick'd them up over-against the lane that goes to the Vineyard-house; I put them in my pocket; I went from thence, and going along to go home, in the lane past this house there was a man call'd out thieves, stop thieves. I stopp'd; he laid hold on my collar, and said, if you offer to make any resistance. I'll knock your brains out. He took me to a publick house. It being in the night, I can't say which man it was; I know he had a great thick stick in his hand. I said I have done you no harm, my friend; then he left me there in custody, and went for a constable and watch to charge me. This was, I believe, between ten and eleven at night; these things were found upon me; so from thence I was taken to Clerkenwell Bridewell, and remained there 'till next morning; then I was taken before Justice Keeling, who committed me back again. The man that took me said to me, You must have some confederate, for the house was stripp'd and robb'd after you was taken. I said I know nothing about it; I had no considerates. What they swore against me I did not deny; neither did I discover it. This is the first time I have spoke against it, now before all the gentlemen in the court.</p>

               <p>Walker. Yes: I cloath'd her but about a fortnight before she took these gowns; I took off my own petticoats from my back and gave to her, and a gown too.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever put her to school?</p>
               <p>Walker. Yes I did: but she would keep to nothing; sometimes she would be gone for two or three years and never let us hear from her; then she would come again all rags, and keep wicked company. Three gowns produc'd and depos'd to by prosecutrix.</p>

She had left a bag and some things behind her, my wife fetch'd them down, and shew'd them, and ask'd her if they were all right; she said they were; then she took her things, and went away about her business.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was that young woman?</p>
               <p>Shadbolt. By all circumstances it was the prisoner at the bar; I never saw her before, and I cannot swear to her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it ago?</p>
               <p>Shadbolt. It is about seven weeks ago; I bought the gown of her for seven shillings; she came in with it on her back, and said she wanted to sell it to fetch a pair of ear-rings out of pawn; she had a gown of me that I valued at three shillings and six-pence, and I paid her the rest of the money (she looks upon one of the gowns). This is it, to the best of my knowledge; but they came and took it from me; and after that, before the justice, they gave it to me, and charg'd me to keep it in my possession 'till this sessions, which I did.</p>

               <p>Q. At what town did you miss these goods?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I do not remember the name of the town; I was looking for a lodging, and I left the prisoner to look after my three children, which I had with me at a door, and when I came back again she was gone, and took the bundle, and left my children there. I asked my children where she was, they said she was gone, but they knew not where. I pursu'd her to London.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this that she left you?</p>
               <p>Taylor. It was on the twenty-fifth of February, being on a sunday. On the twenty-seventh I saw her at the Windmill near Hick's Hall: she had been taken up by the directions of my daughter, who had seen her at Islington.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to find them there?</p>

               <p>Q. What is the person's name where you found them ?</p>

            . I am constable; the prosecutrix's girl followed the prisoner, as she said, from Islington, and call'd out stop thief, and she was stopped just at my door. After she was in my charge, she confessed to me the taking the several things mentioned in the indictment. She told me, she had sold the bible and common-prayer-book, and these other things, at a house near the sign of the sun; I can't justly remember the particular things she mentioned. There were several small things belonging to the children; a bed-gown, and other things. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175904250023"/> prosecutrix and I went to Hampstead, and saw the things lying in a window, and she swore to them, before she went into the shop.

               <p>Q. Did he live with you?</p>
               <p>Hutson. He lodg'd at the next door to me (a publick house). I had got discharg'd from him last January. He was not my apprentice at this time. He knew my house very well: he lay in the garret at his lodgings, and I imagine he got from thence into my garret, from his window.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you found the goods again?</p>
               <p>Hutson. I have, all but two pair of breeches; a man that is now in court bought them after I advertised them: Mr Coleman went to Justice Fielding and he sent for me; he told me he believed they had been offered to him; I asked Mr Coleman what sort of a man it was that offered them to him; he said, it was a young man like a Taylor's apprentice, but he asked more money for them than he chose to give; by the description he gave I found it was the prisoner. I took him up and carried him to Justice Fielding; Mr Fielding examined him; I charged him with taking these things; he denied it, and said, he knew nothing of the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by them that you have got again?</p>
               <p>Hutson. One Mr Steff delivered them to me, he deals in old cloaths.</p>

               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Mac'gray. I am a Taylor: the prisoner at the bar and a woman about forty or fifty years of age, came to my shop with these goods; my wife told me she had seen them before; I asked them what money she had bid for them when they came, they said, five guineas, but seven guineas was the price if they sold them.</p>
               <p>Q. Which said this?</p>
               <p>Mac'gray. The woman that was with him did. Produced in Court and deposed to by prosecutor. These are the same, I bought them for five pounds fourteen shillings of them, and sold them again to Mr Steff for five pounds seventeen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. In what part of the house were these goods taken from?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They were taken out of a press in my cutting room.</p>

            'gray. I am wife to Terence: on the 16th of March I was going along crying old cloaths; the prisoner at the bar asked me if I bought old cloaths; I said, yes; he said, he could help me to a bargain; I asked him what they were; he said, they were two suits of cloaths, and he described them as in the indictment; and said, that he had the selling of them, but they belonged to a friend of his; he brought me into an Alehouse called the six Canns, Holborne; from thence to the Castle about six doors higher up; he bid the woman that was with him bring the cloaths to the Faulcon and Castle in order to sell them; there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175904250024"/> I looked at them, and asked what he demanded for them; he asked eight guineas; I offered him five; that he refused; from that place they were carried to my apartment, and my husband bought them.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these cloaths, are these the same?</p>
               <p>C. Mac'gray. I am sure they are: I was present with my husband when he sold them afterwards to Mr Steff.</p>
               <p>Q. What did your husband sell them for?</p>
               <p>C. Mac'gray. He sold them for five pounds seventeen shillings and six-pence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Palliss. About the middle of March, an old woman came to my shop with a lad; he told me he had a bargain to sell.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Palliss. I keep a sale shop in the Minories: they brought these cloaths that are here produced with them, which were two suits, I know them again very well; I asked them the price, they said twelve guineas; I said, I would not buy them; about a week after Mr Steff (he and I deal together) came to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does he live?</p>
               <p>Palliss. He lives in Grace-Church-street: he wanted some cloaths to be dy'd, which upon his describing them, I thought to be the cloaths I had seen; I went to his house and saw them, and knew them to be the same that the lad and a woman had brought to my house; he said, he had bought them of one of the business; I told him they were Mr Hutson's cloaths, which I had found by an advertisement; he and I went to Mr Hutson's, and from thence to Justice Fielding.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner examined there?</p>
               <p>Palliss. I did: but he always denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that young lad was the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Palliss. I would sooner swear it was the prisoner, than I would swear it was not; but I will not be sure.</p>

               <p>Parnell. No, he entirely denied it; he has altered his dress now, he was in a red coat; I went to New-Prison to him in order to relieve him, believing him to be very poor, but he behaved so ill that I would not relieve him.</p>

            . I am apprentice to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you?</p>
               <p>Cooper. I am fifteen years of age to-day: on the first of March I was standing on the shop stool putting some goods in our bays-case; I saw a person go out of the shop in a red coat; I ran out into the street and saw the prisoner at the bar and another person, both dressed in red coats; they were shuffling together; I immediately seized the prisoner, and instantly a bundle dropp'd to the ground from between them; I took the prisoner by the collar and brought him back into the shop as well as I could; the other boy ran over the way imediately into Skinners-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any assistance?</p>
               <p>Cooper. No, none, only a Stone-Mason that lives in Kingsland-Road; he took up the bundle and brought it into the shop after me.</p>
               <p>Q. How far distance from your shop door was it that you took hold of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Cooper. To the best of my knowledge it was about two or three posts from the door, that is about eight or nine yards distance.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the bundle?</p>
               <p>Cooper. These are girls pink hose.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose property are they?</p>
               <p>Cooper. They are my master's; I am certain of it, because here is my own hand-writing on the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge the prisoner with taking that bundle of stockings ?</p>
               <p>Cooper. I did: he said he knew nothing of the bundle, nor nothing of the boy that ran away; then he said, he felt the bundle at his back; and afterwards he said, he kicked it with his foot as he was going along.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with him before the Alderman?</p>
               <p>Cooper. I was: he denied it there; he said his name was Nelson when he was in our shop, and before the Alderman he said his name was Bates.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I did not take the stockings, nor knew of them any more than this piece of wood. I am very willing to go on board one of his Majesty's ships again; I was on board a Collier, and had taken 35 s. and was going on board again to go to the northward.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cooper. Can you say that the prisoner took the stockings out of your shop?</p>
               <p>Cooper. I am certain that it was either the prisoner, or the other boy that ran away.</p>

When the prisoner was before Mr Alderman Cokayne, he desired her to take it off her finger, and give it to me; saying, there was reason to believe it to be the prosecutor's ring; she took it off her finger, and deliver'd it to me. When I was sent for to her, I ask'd her how she came by that ring; she said it was not Mr Salter's, her brother gave it her five months ago, and that he was on board the Alexander privateer. After that, she said she had just fetch'd it out of pawn; I ask'd her where; she told me; I went to the pawnbroker, where she said she had been and fetch'd it from; the pawnbroker told me she had not been there for two or three months; it appears to be a new ring, and the burnish is not gone off.</p>

               <p>Benjamin Rackstrow. On the 21st of April I was gone out upon business; when I return'd, I was told a person had stolen a little figure of Shakespeare, which I sell for about twelve shillings, and that the man was taken and committed. I went to Guildhall; there I saw part of the figure; I know it to be mine, by the manner of it's being repair'd; I know nothing of the prisoner, but by seeing him at Guildhall.</p>

            . On Saturday the 21st of April I saw the prisoner at the bar come out of Mr Rackstrow's shop, with a figure in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What figure was it?</p>
               <p>Hoskins. It was a figure of Shakespeare, about twelve inches high. As I did not know but that he had bought the figure, I did not stop him; I went in and ask'd if that man had bought a figure; they said, no; then I went to pursue him; he went up Flower-de-Luce-court with it in his hand; then I follow'd him, and took him almost at the bottom of Fetter-lane; I did not see him sling the figure away; I brought him back; then the people said there was a figure in an entry belonging to a Corn-chandler's shop; I went and found it, and brought the prisoner and that to Mr Rackstrow's shop; the figure being made of plaster, was broke by the fall; but I knew it again to be the same, and that it was in his shop when I went to dinner that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is his shop?</p>
               <p>Hoskins. In Fleetstreet.</p>

We took him before the sitting alderman. He ask'd him, what he did with those cocks, and where he design'd to sell them? the prisoner said, he did not know where to sell them. He said, it was the first time he did it, and if he would forgive him he would never do so again.</p>

            . The goods mentioned in the indictment, mentioning them all by name, were all taken out of our house, my mother's property, all but two linnen handkerchiefs and a petticoat, which are my property. My mother is ill, and unable to stir out of her room.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hinkle. The prisoner was my mother's servant for between fourteen and fifteen months; in the last two months I missed several things, especially at washing times; when I have asked the prisoner after such or such things, she would make several pretences, they might be mislaid, or the like. At last I said to her, if you are honest yourself, you may keep bad company. On Wednesday the eleventh of this instant April, she was to get up to wash at four in the morning. I call'd her up. I went to bed and slept again. At seven in the morning she came to me, and said, Pray, madam, get up; for God's sake, madam, get up. What is the matter, said I? - there has been thieves, they have broke the house open; the kitchen window is broke, and the pewter is taken from the shelves, but I have not power to look farther to see what is lost. I said, it is strange you should see this at four, and stay till seven before you come to tell me of it. Said she, I sat down and cry'd. I went down stairs, and said, I suppose the plate is gone. She said, she supposed so to. I told over the pewter, and missed eight pewter plates. We had a pretty large quantity of pewter stood by in a closet, which she had access to. She said, they had taken a gown of her's, and several other things; and that they had been in the parlour, and taken the tea spoons from off the table. I said, I was awake from three to four and heard nothing. They must be extreamly still in what they did. The following night we could not get the window mended, we were forced to get two men to sit up to watch the house. The Apothecary that came to see my mother said, have you not some suspicion of your maid being a little concerned in the thing. I said no; she has lost things of her own. Said he, I would not raise a suspicion on an innocent girl; but I am informed, she lets in a man every night into your house. The next morning, a man that serves us with fish, came and asked me, what gown it was that my maid had lost? I said, a red and white flower'd gown; said he, I know that to have been carried to pawn, with a white petticoat, that I believe was none of her own; and I believe three pewter plates, by a woman that has been seen to come to your house on nights; and that person had been concealed many weeks in the house unknown to me; and that at that time she was in our house in the kitchen. I went down, but could see nothing; I heard a rustling in the coal-hole, but I had not courage to go into it. I went up stairs again; as soon as I got up, the person that told me of it, said, he saw the woman run out of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175904250029"/> house. My maid was gone out. As soon as she return'd I taxed her with letting a woman be privately in my house. She said, whoever said so, she would make them prove their words, and denied it. In about a quarter of an hour's time, the fish-man came again, and brought the woman with him, that had been concealed in the house. He said, Madam, this is the woman, she will declare the truth herself. Then the woman said, Madam, I have been concealed in your house for some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner by at the time?</p>
               <p>Hinkle. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say?</p>
               <p>Hinkle. She was quite silent; but afterwards she own'd it, and own'd also that she sent that woman with her gown to pawn; the other woman said to me, she had carried out things to pawn for the prisoner, but had never wrong'd us of any thing; and was sorry she had been so unhappy as to have been guilty of what she had; I let her go, and turn'd the prisoner out of the house immediately; after that several of my neighbours told me the prisoner must certainly have a hand in the robbery; I was advised by a relation to go to Justice Fielding about it; I went there, and related the case; he granted me a warrant to apprehend the prisoner and the other woman, and a warrant to search. Mr Waters was with me at the time, we had two officers from Justice Fielding's to go with us to take up the two women; when we came to the house where they were, the people deny'd them; the door being open'd they were both in the room; the other woman being dress'd different from what she was when I saw her before, I did not know her; by the neglect of the officer she made her escape; the prisoner was concealed in a closet; when I came to ask her what she had done with the things; she answer'd, that my petticoat was under the bed she had laid in that night in the same room; I desired her to give it me; she took it from under the bed with two pewter mazareens my mother's property, and delivered them to me: there was nothing else found upon her; she declared, the other person, that had made her escape, had a silver salt and a large silver spoon, and some other things, my mother's property, at the time she had escaped.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did she say took them ?</p>
               <p>Hinkle. She said the other woman took them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say by whose directions?</p>
               <p>Hinkle. No, she did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention all these goods to her?</p>
               <p>Hinkle. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did she say took the petticoat and mazareens?</p>
               <p>Hinkle. She would not own that she did.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she say that other woman came to the house?</p>
               <p>Hinkle. She own'd that she maintain'd her there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she own that the other woman took the goods with her knowledge and consent?</p>
               <p>Hinkle. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend at Justice Fielding's upon the prisoner's examination?</p>
               <p>Hinkle. I did: she would make no confession; she was committed to Clerkenwell New-Prison and from thence to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive all those things were under her charge in the house ?</p>
               <p>Hinkle. No, some of them were not; some of them were lock'd up, and the others were in common use about the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What were lock'd up?</p>
               <p>Hinkle. Five of the pewter dishes, the two mazareens, and some of the pewter plates were lock'd up, but she had found a key that would open the lock that belong'd to another closet. After she had been examined, Justice Fielding advis'd me to have the other things advertis'd; upon which a silver salt, five silver tea-spoons, a pair of silver tea tongs, were brought from Mrs Bebby's, a Pawnbroker, to Justice Fielding's, and I swore to them. The quilted petticoat and mazareens produc'd in court and deposed to.</p>

            . The prosecutor is my uncle, he resides in the country; he came up to receive some money at the Custom-house, which he receives yearly. It is a donation left him. He had been there, and came home to my house about half an hour after seven at night, as nigh as I can well remember. I saw him a little in liquor; I said to him, I am sorry to see you in liquor, for you are hardly capable to take care of yourself in a dark night, when sober, your infirmity is such. (He had the palsey, and was lame on one side.) He said it is something worse than that, for I have been robb'd by a soldier that I met with at Mrs King's, at the Blackamore's Head in Brooks-Market. I went to her house, and ask'd her, where she saw the prosecutor? She said, he had been at her house with a soldier; and also told me where to find the soldier, and his name. She said, he had about him a moidore and three half guineas, which she desir'd he would leave with her, but he did not leave it. From thence I went to the Turk's-Head, Holbourn, and inquired, if a soldier and a lame old man had been there together? The people said there had. I asked them, if they knew whose regiment he belong'd to? they said to Colonel Thomas's company in the Tower. I went to the Tower, and ask'd if

             was there? they said no; he was out all night. I found where he work'd, which was in Trinity Minories; I made the best of my way there, and found he was drinking at the sign of the sieve, very fuddled. I took him before the justice, but he was so fuddled that he could not utter a word without a deal of blasphemy. The landlord said he came to his house in a hackney coach, and he paid the coachman 2 s. for carrying him. That justice being a good deal indisposed, he ordered me to carry the prisoner to justice Fielding, which I did; he was search'd, and only 4 s. and four pennyworth of half pence were found upon him.</p>
               <p>Mr Potter. Yesterday fortnight about ten o'clock the soldier came in with a coachman to my house, he ask'd the coachman to drink a little hot; he said, he had rather drink a pint of beer. He paid him some money for the coach-hire.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Potter. I live at the Sieve in the Little-Minories; the prisoner presently call'd for change for half a guinea; but I did not see the half-guinea. He came the next morning with two or three people with him, about nine or ten o'clock; they had four twelve-penny full-pots of hot; the prisoner paid for three of them; and at the drinking the last pot, this last evidence came in and laid hold of him.</p>

               <p>Potter. Yes, I heard him say it was the prisoner that robb'd him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what he robb'd him of?</p>
               <p>Potter. He said of three half-guineas and a moidore.</p>

            . I keep the Turk's-Head, Holborne; the prosecutor and prisoner came together into my house, I believe about six o'clock in the evening; they wanted change for half a guinea; I did not see the money; the prisoner said to the other, You need not change your money, I'll pay for the pot of beer; I said I'll draw you no more liquor; the soldier gave me six-pence, and I gave him three-pence out of it; they were both in liquor.

               <p>I am a smith; I came to take a forge, and went to buy tools to set myself up; I went in at Mrs King's, where I have us'd for several years; I was a little elevated in liquor; I was singing a song, and the prosecutor would force himself into company; I said to him, Sir, you are a little in liquor, I don't want to drink with you. He set himself down, and then we drank together. Then seeing him in liquor, I said I would see him safe home. We went from there to the Turk's-head; it rain'd hard. There he went to pay for the beer, and my landlord would not change; so I paid for it. I said I would not dilly-dally for no body in the wet, if you'll have a coach I'll go with you; I went out to call a coach; in the mean time he went out; when I return'd I found he was gone; I went out to see after him, but saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did not you at the time he took your money tell any body of it?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I did not; I told him of it several times, and he said he would see me safe home.</p>

            . On the 16th of this instant April, between the hours of 12 and 1 at night being Easter-Monday, I was coming home.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Ireland. I live in Wild-street, at the Black-Lyon; I am a lodger.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been?</p>
               <p>Ireland. I had been at the White-Horse in White-Horse-Yard: it being holyday time I staid out longer than I lik'd to do. As I came by the <placeName id="t17590425-24-crimeloc137">corner of Russel-court into Drury-lane</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17590425-24-crimeloc137" type="placeName"

               <p>Q. What did she say to you?</p>
               <p>Ireland. She bid me stop, and asked me where I was going; I said, what is that to you; she took hold on the skirt of my coat, and catch'd hold of my watch and pull'd it from my pocket; I made a struggle with her; then up came a man and said, You scoundrel dog, what business have you with my wife, and down he knock'd me; I was sensible and got up directly and pursued her.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that person?</p>
               <p>Ireland. The man I will not swear too, I know the prisoner is the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she is the same person?</p>
               <p>Ireland. Because I had seen her several times before this time.</p>
               <p>Q. Where?</p>
               <p>Ireland. In Drury-lane, and at several courts there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her that night so as to be sure?</p>
               <p>Ireland. I saw her particularly that night, and was sure she was the same person that I had formerly seen; I held her 'till I certainly knew her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Ireland. It was not dark, it was near lamps, and to the best of my knowledge and judgment the Moon shone that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of her before?</p>
               <p>Ireland. I never drank with her, or was in a house with her before; I have heard say she kept men company, and the like.</p>
               <p>Q. What condition was you in?</p>
               <p>Ireland. I cannot deny but that I had been drinking, but not so, but that I knew any thing that was sufficient to know; I was not in liquor any more than I am now; I had not drank enough to hurt myself in my senses.</p>
               <p>Q. When was she taken up?</p>
               <p>Ireland. I took her up on the next morning; she and a man were in bed together; I would not swear to the man, so he was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where her lodgings were?</p>
               <p>Ireland. I did not: but by searching with the constable I found her.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>

               <p>Q. Was you so much in liquor that you could not distinguish one person from another?</p>
               <p>Ireland. I could distinguish persons very well.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of this affair?</p>
               <p>Cannon. I do: I was coming home on Monday night pretty late, I went into Mrs Riley's and call'd for a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mrs Riley?</p>
               <p>Cannon. She keeps the Plough in Drury-lane; as soon as I sat down, there was a woman brought in by two soldiers, and accus'd by them for a watch; when I heard that, I drank my beer and went out; and went to a Night-Cellar to get another pint of beer, and then this gentleman came in with his face all scratched, and three patches upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Came in where?</p>
               <p>Cannon. Into that Night-House.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Cannon. I was very sober.</p>
               <p>Q. What business had you out at that time of the night?</p>
               <p>Cannon. My wife was in Brownlow-street, at a Lying-in Hospital, and if she had been at home perhaps I should have come home sooner; but as she did not, I had not so great a call to come home that night as another.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go there for?</p>
               <p>Cannon. Because I saw a woman was charg'd with a watch by two soldiers; I was willing to get out of the other house.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you go into the cellar?</p>
               <p>Cannon. Why to please your lordship to get another pint of beer.</p>

               <p>Cannon. I know him very well.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him?</p>
               <p>Cannon. I never saw him since that night; he told me and all the people in the cellar, he had lost his hat, and his watch, and his money; his face was bloody, scratched, and patched.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he charge any body there ?</p>
               <p>Cannon. No.</p>

They were put on the landing-place at my chamber door; I saw them open, they were full of cloaths. She return'd in about a month or five weeks, and then all her cloaths were gone. I was in the prisoners room, when the cups were found, which the prosecutrix swore to. We found a key of the prisoners that would unlock the boxes.</p>

            , that lodges at the same Inn. I show'd him the place where it was broke; he said, He was very sorry for it; it was very hard men did not know their own. There were several other people looking at it at the time. He was going out, I asked him where he was going? he said, he was going of an errand for his master to St James's-Street. His master advised<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175904250037"/> me when he was gone to take him up upon suspicion; he said he had had no money from him for a fortnight, and he had changed two or three guineas with me a little before; I went to get a warrant and went to Justice Fielding to have it back'd, in order to go and take him up in Westminster, but he came soon back; then his master sent me word he was return'd and they had detected him, and he had deliver'd the money up to his master; and when I came back, the prisoner own'd to the robbing of me of forty-two pounds five shillings upon my charging him with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say in what manner he did it?</p>
               <p>Gray. He told me he broke in at the casement in the tap-room, and came in at the little room door, and broke the lock of the buroe open, where my money was in a drawer; the buroe stood in the corner of that room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the drawer lock'd over night?</p>
               <p>Gray. It was: and the prisoner own'd he broke the lock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what time it was that he did it?</p>
               <p>Gray. He said it was between the hours of three and four in the morning?</p>
               <p>Q. Was the casement shut the night before?</p>

            . The prisoner was my servant; I had a suspicion that he was guilty, he having more money than I thought he could come honestly by; when Mr Gray was gone out in order to take the prisoner, he came in and ask'd for me; I met him at the door and took him by the collar, and shew'd him the place that was broke, and ask'd him if he was guilty of breaking that; he at first deny'd it, and afterwards owned he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed him to have much money about him?</p>
               <p>Long. He had two guineas and an half in his pocket then and some silver, besides a purse of thirty-eight guineas and an half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him wages sufficient to supply him with so much money?</p>
               <p>Long. No. I ask'd him whether that money belong'd to Mr Gray or not; his answer was, yes; and he said, he broke the drawer open?</p>

               <p>Q. Was you with him before my Lord-Mayor ?</p>
               <p>Long. I was; but I was not near enough to hear what was said there.</p>
               <p>Q. What use had you for him?</p>
               <p>Long. I was a Publican, but out of business then; and I took lodgings there for my family, and he was one of my family.</p>

            . I am an officer. I had a warrant to search for linnen about the 4th of April, in the house of Mr Smith in Little Hermitage-Street, I found a box that had a crack in it; it was lock'd and corded up. Captain Jackson look'd in, and saw part of his cloth.</p>
               <p>Jackson. I went with the constable to the house of Smith, I saw a box lock'd and corded; I found some linnen, two of them marked, that is, a Bear. There has been none come this year with that mark upon it, there was last year. We broke the box open before the justice; there I found the four pieces of linnen I beforementioned: to the best of my knowledge they are part of the bale that I lost. After that we took up Serjeant Andrews at Mr Smith's. Four pieces of linnen produc'd.</p>
               <p>Hadwin. This box was opened before justice Bury, and these four pieces of linnen taken out. I found in a handkerchief seven guineas and a thirty-six shillings piece. There was also in the box a pair or two of spatterdashes, and a scabbard to a bayonett, and about half a pound of indico, in a paper in the box.</p>

             came to my house, and ask'd me, if he could not lodge there? I said he might; then he said, he'd go and fetch his box, which he did, a little square box, with part of the lid broke, it is the same box that was taken away by the constable on the fourth of April; but Peavor never came to lodge with me; Serjeant Andrews came to my house on the third of April, and drank two pots of beer in the tap-room; he call'd me out, and said, Mr Smith, you seem to be a good-natur'd man, you know what I come upon; that he said, was on account of a box that was left here by a soldier, and it is pity he should be kept out of the way; he has left seven guineas and a thirty-six shilling piece in that box, and it is in the left hand side of the box, please to let me have it. I said I know nothing of it, I would go to the justice about it; when I return'd he was taken up. When he came before the justice, then he said, he wanted to see if there were any regimentals in the box, but he had mentioned nothing of that to me before. I stopp'd the box on the thirty-first, because a woman came and told me they had robb'd a ship; so I went to the justice and got an order to stop it.</p>

            . I lodg'd with Mrs Ballard; Murray lodg'd there. On the Thursday morning that Captain Jackson's ship was robb'd, being the 29th of March; I went out into the high street, and met Mr Grimes; he ask'd me if I had seen two drunken soldiers that work'd on board Captain Jackson's ship along with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he name their names?</p>
               <p>Hayworth. No, he did not; he told me there were search-warrants out for them, and desired if I saw any thing of them, that I would tell them to get out of the way, for they might speak words that might do them hurt, because they were drunk, and it might hurt them all. Mrs. Beck, Mrs Beaton, and I, went last Saturday was three weeks to Serjeant Andrews's house; she told him she had been to see for her husband the former part of the day, and could not find him; but in every publick house she heard there was a robbery committed, and therefore she fear'd he was gone aside; and if he was out of the way a little while, she hoped he would not be deemed a deserter. Mr Andrews said it was a very sad thing people could not live by their labour, and not by thieving. The captain of the ship had been with him, and informed him of the robbery; he said if he was not taken up for thieving, he'd take care they should not for desertion. She, I, and another acquaintance, went to him the Monday following; then she told him her husband would go a journey, if he was pleas'd to let her have a furlow; he said he could not do it himself at present, but he would acquaint his commanding officer with it; and if he could get him one, it should be ready by five in the afternoon on the Tuesday; and if he could get one before, he would send it after him, and took an account of her in writing where he was to go; that was to Aldeburgh in Suffolk. The next day Mrs Beaton went again; Andrews was not present then.</p>
               <p>Grimes, in his defence, said, he did not know there was such a bale in the ship. Murray said, he knew nothing of the matter, and accounted for his coming home wet, by getting drunk, and in a quarrel was thrown into a kennel. Andrews said, Beaton and Peavor having deserted, he went to Smith's house, and was waiting there 'till Justice Scott came home, to get an order to have the box opened, to see if there were any cloaths or accoutrements belonging to the King; and after he had staid there seven hours, he was taken into custody by Mr Jackson, on a warrant from Justice Bury.</p>

             deposed as on the trial of Steward*. The substance of which was, that on the 31st of March 1757, Steward and the prisoner came together to him at the George, Leather-lane; and Steward agreed to give him 6 l. for his horse, and desired him to bring him to the Bell-Savage-Inn; then they took him to go to the Temple Exchange-Coffee House for his money; that Green went part of the way and disappeared. Steward took him from that Coffee-House to Symond's-Inn-Cellar, Chancery-lane, then to a place near Fetter-lane; still no money produced: they returned back to the Bell-Savage-Inn, were informed Green had took the horse away; that six days after, Green sent him word he should have his horse again, on giving him a note to indemnify him; that he ordered him to be brought to the Horse and Groom in Eagle-street, by Red-Lyon-Square, where he found him accordingly.</p>
