               <p>What do you know of the losing of beer? - Only I went to examine a stair-case of the dwelling-house of the prisoner, and I found the first stair would take up and down, which was very evident, because it caused a friction; at the other end there was a piece of a ledge lay, and this stair used to draw away, and two new nails were put in which had been lately done to take in and out, the first raiser and first step would come up together; somebody had frequently been down, therefore the edge of the butt, and the very hoop was polished bright, by rubbing upon the edge of the cask, which was under that part of the stair-case.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there room for a man to go down after the step that was loose was taken out? - Yes, a man bigger than me went down after it was taken out.</p>
               <p>What does the family of the prisoner consist of? - I know nothing of his family, I saw him at the house when I went to examine the stair, that was the first time, I said nothing to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You know nothing at all of the beer in the cellar? - I know there was beer there.</p>

               <p>It might have been eight or nine months? - No, Sir, not as long as that, there had been two fresh nails in.</p>
               <p>You mean there had been nails put in since the stairs had been first built? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But how long they had been there you cannot say? - No.</p>
               <p>They might have been there eight or nine months? - No, not two months.</p>

               <p>What quantity of beer was taken from each? - From some a barrel, some more and some less.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole how much? - Two hundred gallons, there had been water put in, but it did not incorporate with the beer. (A vial of water produced.) This is the top of the butt; (another vial produced with water and beer, and a third with porter.)</p>

               <p>Court. You carry beer out from your brew-house to particular cellars, and appropriate that to particular customers, suppose it is not sent into their house, are they liable to pay for it? - I believe they are.</p>
               <p>Why do you believe that, did you ever know an instance of it? - No.</p>
               <p>The customer assents to that charge? - Yes, and it is entered in his books, as well as ours.</p>

               <p>You was saying that if the beer had been started and put in that cellar with the water in it, it would have all mixed together, how do you prove that, will not the heaviest body sink to the bottom, is it not a general<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300004"/> rule without exception for bodies of the greatest gravity to sink to the bottom?</p>
               <p>Council for the Prosecution. Do you think the beer is heavier than the water? - Water is the heaviest a considerable deal.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Jackson. Do you happen to know from any experiment with respect to beer in particular whether water is the heaviest or beer? - Water.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. Have you ever tried the difference? - I have, every but that this beer was in was bored.</p>
               <p>Do you know by your own knowledge that this cellar door was open or not? - I was informed by one of our people, that it was once open.</p>
               <p>Court. How long had this beer been in that store cellar? - About ten or eleven months.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner lived in the house all that time? - Yes, he had.</p>
               <p>How do you happen to know what his family consists of? - When I went to search the house, I found nobody in the house but his wife and child, every room in the house was empty except the ground floor.</p>
               <p>Had you ever any conversation with the prisoner himself, about this step or stair? - No.</p>
               <p>I think you said that you observed the step moveable, so as to make a communication between the house, and the cellar? - The chain hoop of the butt that stood under the stairs was polished very bright, and between the cellar door, and the place where the cellar was locked, there was a girder that run under the cellar, and it was impossible for any man to get into the cellar without rubbing against it, and all the cobwebs were brushed off from the stair-case.</p>
               <p>From drawing off the water at the top of the casks, could you form any judgment of the quantity of beer that had been drawn off? - When we came to the beer that had been separated from the water, we estimated it about two butts, or two hundred gallons.</p>
               <p>What may the value of that be? - About six or eight pounds.</p>
               <p>Did you try the tops of those butts, that stood nearest the cellar door? - All of them.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner, I never observed a cellar door in his house but one next the street; I have observed that open several times, I cannot say when it was open the first time, but I have seen it open before Christmas.</p>
               <p>Do you live in that neighbourhood? - I do not, I serve the prisoner with meat and butter, I was frequently at the house, his child was very bad, and out of gratitude, I sat up with the child, and I have seen the cellar door open night and day, when sent out at a eleven o'clock at night to get a bit of stake for our supper, and to fetch beer.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prosecution. How many times have you seen it open? - Many times.</p>
               <p>Did you ever go down? - I did not look down.</p>
               <p>Not even look down? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not tell Mr. Whitbread? - No, Sir, I did not know him.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the watchman? - I did not know any thing of any watchman.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you saw this often open both night and day, for weeks together? - I saw a hasp on it, but I never saw a lock to it.</p>
               <p>I think you was describing it as open? - It was flapping to and again.</p>
               <p>Both night and day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>As far as you saw it, it was always open, you never found it shut? - I never looked to see whether it was shut.</p>
               <p>But you looked to see whether it was not shut? - I pushed by it, then it must be open.</p>
               <p>As far as you observed, it was always open? - I shoved by it, but I did not know whether it was open or shut, but when I shoved by it, it must be open.</p>
               <p>Did it open outwards or inwards? - Towards the street.</p>
               <p>It stood open night and day? - I have seen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300005"/> it open every time, I have gone by with my load several times.</p>
               <p>As far as you observed it, it was always open? - It was not my business to see, but when it was open I shunned by it.</p>
               <p>Court. What you was afraid to push it to? - I had no right to shut it.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Jackson. What sort of a door is this? - There is a flap and a door, the same as a house door, it opens outwards.</p>
               <p>Was it open night and day? - The lock was off, but no great while; and during that time there was a nail put in it, as soon as I heard it was open, and that there was no lock upon it, I sent a lock.</p>
               <p>Do you know how long that was the case? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there no way down from the door to get at these things, but where this was moved? - There is a wall all round the cellar, there was no other way to come to it but where the step was moved, and from the street door.</p>

               <p>Could it have been taken up without the mark of a chissel? - Not that I know of. I have known the prisoner two years, a very honest sober just man as ever I knew, he is a bricklayer and plaisterer, and works hard for his living.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Poole. When did you see this step? - Just after these gentlemen had knocked it up, it was fresh broke by their knocking it up.</p>

               <p>I am second coachman to Lord Amherst, I missed two great coats, a box coat, and a surtout coat, in the evening of the 15th of April, when I went to bed; one was my fellow servant's coat, and the other was mine, one hung up in the room on a peg, and the other laid on the bed; there are two beds in the room, I sleep over the stable, I cannot say who stole the coats, I went to bed at eleven, I had been in the room at three in the afternoon and the coats were there then.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose the room in the day time is not locked? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many keys are there? - Two keys.</p>
               <p>Who keeps these two keys? - My fellow servant's key is hung up in the stable, and the other I had in my pocket.</p>
               <p>What other servants sleep in the same room? - My other fellow servant, the first coachman.</p>
               <p>Any body else? - Only we two.</p>
               <p>Are there any helpers in the stables? - No, sir, all done by us two.</p>
               <p>Where was your fellow servant that day? - He was in the country with my Lord.</p>
               <p>Was your stable door locked or not locked? - Locked to the best of my knowledge, I had usually locked it.</p>
               <p>Can you say whether the door was locked when you came home at night? - To the best of my knowledge it was locked, I put in the key as usual, my room door was not locked.</p>
               <p>Do you know who stole these coats? - I am innocent of the affair, I was discharged from the Compter but was turned away partly through this affair, though I was going to leave his Lordship's service.</p>

               <p>Court. When you came down in the morning, how were the doors and windows of the shop? - They were all fast.</p>
               <p>On the ninth instant had you on the over night reckoned the money? - I could not rightly tell the quantity.</p>
               <p>How much do you suppose was lost? - About twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know there was any lost, if you did not know what there was? - I am sure there was 50 s. by the quantity, I put 40 s. in out of the desk, and there was some in before; but I cannot tell how much exactly; the next morning I found about 30 s. it was about six when I opened the shop, the till was left open, the desk was left open, and the key dropped into the till, but not locked; of this I did not tell my master, as the money was lost before, I did not mention to him, as it could be laid to nobody but myself.</p>
               <p>Had he accused you before, or expressed any suspicion? - Not to me as I knew of; on the 31st at night, I put 25 s. in the desk, there was not above one or two; I locked it as before, and put the key into the same place; the next morning we found about 6 s. of it, and a quantity of half-pence was lost out of the till, the desk was unlocked, and the key thrown in the same way as before.</p>
               <p>Court. How were the fastenings that morning; - The shop front, my lord, was all fast; on examining the premises; the back part, I found the door that leads out of the cellar into the shop had been open.</p>
               <p>Was it locked the night before? - No, it was made fast with a stick with a pike at the end of it, that stick was forced away; the force had tore the door very much, a piece was split off, the door opened inwards; on going into the the yard I found the two fastenings of the window which leads into the cellar, it was a flap shut down, and two casks stood on the top of it, that was the usual way of fastening it, in the morning the two casks were off, and the flap was down, on lifting up the flap, I perceived by the dirt and rubbish a person had been down, I made these examinations first myself, after that I alarmed my master, I called him up, this was about half after seven, it was about six when I opened the shop; I informed him that the house had been broke open, and robbed as before, I shewed him where the person had gone down, and in what manner the door was from that time; my master and me sat up every night, till Saturday the 5th of April; on the Sunday morning a little after two, I sat up in the parlour just over the cellar; my master was in the adjoining yard with his neighbour, I heard a person coming down the yard, I heard him lift the two casks off that stood upon the window, and lift the flap up, and go into the cellar; after I thought he was down, I heard something make a noise, similar to the falling of a trap, which we had set for him in the cellar: In about a minute after he entered the cellar, I heard my master halloo out, I have got him; I opened the door, and I saw the prisoner with him, when I went in the yard my master said to the prisoner, John, how can ou use me in the manner you have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300010"/> done, you have robbed me three times within a month, of money, soap, starch and blue; the prisoner said he never robbed him of any starch and blue, only of money and soap; more of money than of soap.</p>
               <p>Court. The second time that you missed the silver, you did not tell your master? - No.</p>
               <p>The third time did you tell your master of that? - Yes, that was the time we perceived how we were robbed.</p>
               <p>Now not telling your master the second time, till then how did you make up the account? - I had not given in the account.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. The prisoner had been your master's servant a long time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long? - Two years.</p>
               <p>Perhaps as long as you? - No, Sir, I served my time there.</p>
               <p>The first time the money was missing was on the first of March? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was three guineas, and some silver? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not tell your master of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>No, but not till he asked you for the money? - No.</p>
               <p>You rose at six, and at nine your master asked you for the money, then you told him of the robbery? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You lodged in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There was no appearance then of any body getting in? - No.</p>
               <p>The keys were all found on the spot where you left them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The next time you did not tell him of it at all? - No.</p>
               <p>That time there was about twenty shillings lost, I think you say? - Yes.</p>
               <p>None of this money was marked at all? - No.</p>
               <p>No suspicion of the prisoner? - No, nothing but that, for the course of two months past, sometimes he would work a day or two, and sometimes play.</p>
               <p>How came it that the money was not marked that was in the till? - We had no suspicion at all, at that time.</p>
               <p>The third time it was half after seven, before you told your master? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you perceived somebody had got into the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was the only person that found that out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who fastened that door backwards? - Myself.</p>
               <p>And put the casks over yourself? - The maid of the house did.</p>
               <p>You yourself did not see the prisoner in the cellar? - No, Sir, I heard him.</p>
               <p>That is, you heard a noise? - Yes, when I came into the yard, I found the prisoner in the yard.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner appear to be drunk at that time? - No, Sir, very sober.</p>
               <p>Is your master's the corner of the passage, or is it the middle of a row? - The middle of a row.</p>
               <p>Council for Prosecution. Must the prisoner come over more places than one? - He came over four walls.</p>
               <p>Was no money found on him? - Nothing Sir, we did not search him.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you examine his leg? - I did not; I hardly knew how to contain myself.</p>
               <p>Has his leg never been examined? - He has had medicines from an apothecary's to dress himself with, but his leg has never been examined, I took him prisoner myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. When you saw him, he was in the yard, five yards from the cellar window with his face to you? - Yes, as near as I can judge.</p>
               <p>His leg never was examined? - No.</p>
               <p>Supposing a man to have got into that window, must not he have been a considerable length of time in getting out again? - By repeatedly going in, he had cut away a piece of ground that made it not so intricate as it was at first, there was a matter of eighteen inches broke away, at first it must have taken up several minutes for a man to get out again.</p>

               <p>Court. As soon as you thought you heard the trap you came, did you make the prisoner any promises? - No, none in the least.</p>

               <p>When you missed the things out of the chest, was it locked then? - The lock was broke.</p>
               <p>What is your reason for charging the prisoner? - I heard that he had some things, and I went to him, and I found the shirt in his custody, which was in my chest when the lock was broke; he went along with me, and got the shirt from his washerwoman's.</p>
               <p>How do you know she was washing for him? - He told me.</p>
               <p>How came you to talk with him about it? - I went away and got a constable to take him up, and then I asked him for the shirt, and he said he had it from the woman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300013"/> that lived with him at that time, (the shirt produced) there is a G. at the breast of it, and the No. is picked out.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it is your shirt? - Yes, I am very sure, and there was a regimental mark, and that is cut out, and a piece of cloth put into it, I never found my pistols.</p>
               <p>How long did you continue to lodge at this man's house after you missed your pistols and shirt? - I did not continue a night; I thought I was too long in one place, and went away for fear I should lose any thing more.</p>
               <p>You had no reason then to suspect him? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you at last to charge him? - Because this woman saw the prisoner have the pistols, six weeks after, and he went out, and he brought in three half crowns for the pistols, so she told me, that was my reason.</p>

               <p>Then you saw the prisoner's pistols in another man's hand? - No, no other man's hand.</p>
               <p>Who had the pistols you saw? - The prisoner had them, but whether it was these pistols I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do you know how that shirt came into the hands of that woman where it was found? - Yes, I do, the man hearing that this man was to pursue after him, removed it to this woman.</p>
               <p>Can you tell whether this is the same shirt that the prisoner borrowed of the young man? - This is the same shirt that was at the washerwoman's, I have washed it with my own hands many a time, the prisoner always told me, that was the shirt he borrowed from this young man, to put on upon guard; this young man knows he left two; I think it is a spiteful thing, and all done in spite.</p>
               <p>Why do you think it spite? - Because it is an old quarrel between the prisoner and this man that came both from one place, more to their shame.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am very sure that this shirt was in my box at the time it was broke.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. After the account given by this woman, gentlemen, we can make nothing at all of this.</p>

I had a brass ring put on my finger by somebody, I examined my pockets, I found I had lost eleven guineas, and two handkerchiefs, and the buckles out of my shoes; and they had put another pair of buckles, just loose in the straps; I know nothing of the persons that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Court. You do not seem to have a very clear recollection, whether you was robbed by men or women? - I recollect I was assaulted by women, and therefore conjecture I was robbed by women.</p>
               <p>Court. The state you was in at that time, Sir, perhaps made it difficult for you to say how long it was before that you had these things safe; what was the place you came from? - I came last from the playhouse, it was a little after nine.</p>
               <p>Drury Lane play-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The condition you was in, I suppose you did know whether you was not robbed of these before you came into the play-house? - I was in the Lobby, I suppose, half an hour or more.</p>
               <p>Was you sufficiently master of yourself, to be sure, that you was in the lobby, or is that, what other people told you? - That is what I have been told since.</p>
               <p>What is the last place you recollect yourself to be in? - The last place I recollect to be in, was in company, where I dined, and spent the afternoon, which was Duke's-Court, near Bow-street, coming into the air, the effects of intoxcation came on, and deprived me of recollection.</p>
               <p>Can you tell whether, when you left this place, you had your money and your buckles and ring? - Yes, my Lord, ten guineas of it was in a paper, which I received of a gentleman then in company, which I just looked at, and screwed it up in the same paper, and put it into my pocket, and I did not spend a shilling there.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable; I apprehended the prisoner Littlepage, Mrs. Warrickshall, and her son; on the 11th of March, I was called up at five in the morning, to go and take possession of two thieves that were taken in the night for stealing yarn, and carried to Mr. Lowe's on Poplar Causeway; accordingly I went there and took them both in charge, and as I was going to handcuff them, one of them, whose name was Lane desired me to let him alone, and he would discover the whole transaction, I told him; if he would do that, we would clear the room and get a sheet of paper, and I would take his examination, which I accordingly did; after I had taken his examination, I read it to him, and he signed it in my presence, and one Mr. Tindall.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. That totally lies out of this case.</p>
               <p>Carpenter. Previous to my going to Mrs. Warrickshall's house, I charged Lowe to assist me to go there, to search for more yarn.</p>
               <p>Court. What is Mrs. Warrickshall? - She <rs id="t17830430-9-viclabel42" type="occupation">keeps a private house</rs>, and is a <rs id="t17830430-9-viclabel43" type="occupation">waterman's widow</rs>; while I was searching the premises, Mr. Hankey and Mr. Blackmore the King's surveyor came and asked me, whether I had found any copper pintles belonging to a ship's rudder and desired me to search for some, which I promised I would.</p>
               <p>Court. What is a pintle? - It is what is fastened to the rudder, for the rudder to swing backwards and forwards. (The pintle produced.)</p>
               <p>Court. What is it made of? - It is made of base metal; I told them I had not, I searched further, and Mr. Hankey and Blackmore assisted me, we found none; after they were gone, I begged of Mrs. Warrickshall, if she had any copper pintles to deliver them to me, for it would be better to throw herself on the mercy of the gentlemen, Hankey and Blackmore; she told me then, to fetch Mr. Hankey to her, that she might first hear what he said; I went and told Mr. Hankey, and he came and asked her what she wanted with him, she said, she wanted him to shew her mercy in this affair; Mr. Hankey told her, it was not in his power to grant her any lenity, but the law must take place.</p>

               <p>Court. What did she say to that? - Mr. Hankey then went away, and then she asked me what she should do, I told her she had better deliver them up, for I had not done rummaging, she then said she had but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300017"/> one the other was disposed of; I then told her she had better give that up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Did you say what you should do, if she did not give it up, I told her I had not half done rummaging, she then begged that a sack might be brought to put it in, that it might not be exposed in the streets; this was in the bed chamber she begged me to take hold of one part of the bed, and she took hold of the other part, and there lay the pintle, between the sacking of the bed and the bed itself.</p>
               <p>Was there any appearance of it under the bed, did the sacking sway down? - I had not looked under that bed, this was the 11th of March, in the morning, I afterwards went to take Littlepage; he got from me, but I took him afterwards at Lambeth; he told me that every thing that Stannard, who was admitted an evidence had discovered was true, and that he would speak the same words before the court.</p>
               <p>Did he mention any of the particulars to you? - No, not to me, he said he would tell the Justice every thing that was transacted.</p>
               <p>Did you take Bell? - I took him with them, he said nothing to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you read that examination to Littlepage? - It was read before the magistrate, in the presence of Littlepage and me, I heard it read, and there was hardly a word of alteration.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. The examination that you talked of first of all, was not relating at all to this business of the pintle? - That was concerning the ropes.</p>
               <p>You had made your unsuccessful search in this woman's house, and found nothing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What had Mr. Hankey to do there, he does not belong to the King's yard I believe, only Mr. Blackmore? - No.</p>
               <p>They having been gone, and nothing yet found, you say you and the woman were together, and you told her, it would be better for her, if she would discover where the pintle was what did you mean by that, or what did you she meant? - To give it with herself.</p>
               <p>You thought at that time, that she thought she should save herself by making this discovery? - I think she did.</p>
               <p>I think you said it would be better for her to discover this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After that I believe she shewed you where the pintle was? - She found by Mr. Hankey that he would shew her no mercy.</p>
               <p>Council for Prosecution. He was gone before the pintle was found; then you had some conversation? - I told her she had better give it up, and throw herself upon the mercy of the prosecutor, for I had not done rummaging.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Then she still thought she should have favour? - She could not after Mr. Hankey was gone, because he told her, she could have no favour; I told her she had better give it up, it would save us a great deal of trouble, I do not know whether she would have delivered it up, but she saw I had not done rummaging.</p>
               <p>Well, but the fact is, she did deliver it up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. She asked you what you would advise her to do? - Yes.</p>
               <p>First you told her, if I understand you, that she had better throw herself upon the mercy of those two persons, one was an officer in the yard, and the other a merchant.</p>
               <p>And she then desired to see Mr. Hankey, and hear what he said? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then he came? - I fetched him myself.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A ship carpenter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys. My Lord, I am council for the prisoner Bell, and I submit that the accomplice cannot be examined, unless there was some evidence to affect Bell.</p>
               <p>Court. What has been said cannot have any affect as to him.</p>

            . My Lord, I beg have to ask whether upon the evidence of Mr. Carpenter, your Lordship should think this confession of Mrs. Warrickshall's, was a confession made in expectation of that favor offered, and held out to her, by the constable, that it would be better for her, if she would discover where the pintle was; he himself says, he apprehended she thought so, and my Lord, I humbly apprehend wheresoever a confession is made by a prisoner, and promises of favor are held out to them, these courts have always held that the public faith should not be broken, therefore I hope that that promise made by the constable, shall be considered as the cause of this confession, and that a confession made under such influence, will not be received by the court.</p>
               <p>Mr. J. Nares. In this case the prisoner applies particularly to Mr. Hankey, and when the man says you had better throw yourself on the mercy of Hankey, and the other person now Hankey does not appear to be an immediate officer under the King, but a person immediately concerned as a Merchant; he was a person then enquiring into that fact, and who could prosecute, as any body can for a felony, and he give her no hopes in the world; says he, it is no in my power, and he adds besides, the law shall take its course; then afterwards away he went, and the prisoner advises with this man, not as considering him in the quality or office of constable, but as a friend, and adviser; says he, you had better deliver it up; now she had heard what the other person Hankey had said before, and this man adds, I have not done rummaging yet; she must know at that time that he certainly meant farther to go on, with respect to his rummaging, and that these goods must be found; therefore I think under the circumstances of this case, this is such a confession as should be laid aside; and I think it is proper evidence to be received; I should be glad to hear what my brother says.</p>
               <p>Mr. 
               <persName id="t17830430-9-person180">
                  Baron
                   Eyre

            . It has been stated at the bar by Mr. Chetwood, as if it was the constant practice and rule of law, that both confessions and goods produced, in consequence of promises held out to the party, were to be rejected, from a regard to public faith: The rule however is this, that confessions or declarations by prisoners; are, or are not credible, and as such are or are not to be left to the Jury, as they appear to obtained with or without promises, or other inducements; if they are frank and voluntary, there is then no impeachment of their credit, and upon that ground<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300023"/> of their being credible; they are left to the Jury to prove the fact, to which they are adduced, if they are obtained improperly, they deserve no credit, and because they deserve no credit, they are not to be left to the Jury. But this rule with respect to confessions has no application from principles and has never received any application in my practice, with respect to goods produced; because where goods are produced whatever was the inducement, by which the party is prevailed upon, their being found there does not depend upon the mere confession or parole declaration of the party, because the evidence that results from it is, that they are actually found in such custody; if they cannot make out that, they are found in the custody of the prisoner, if they cannot be brought home to the prisoner, without taking in the evidence of the prisoner, then so much of the evidence as depends upon the parole testimony of the prisoner must be rejected. It is novel in law, and extremly dangerous, and not consonant to the general principles of criminal law, for courts of that juridiction, to be holding out support of this sort of public faith; it is to say in other words, that felony may be compounded; if the party is promised encouragement, and upon the strength of that, the evidence of the goods that are found, is not to be produced against them; so far is the law from having this idea, with respect to public faith in promises, that the law goes great lengths against criminals; for instance in a civil case, the law would not allow a constable to put his hand into the pocket of the prisoner; whereas prisoners, and their lodgings are searched, and their pockets even rifled; all which, upon the principle of law is extremely different; and tho' I agree with my brother, whatever should be thought, to be the law on this subject, that this case does not fall within it; still I would not hear the council at the bar, assert that it has been the universal practice; without stating what has occurred to me, as to the practice, from the experience that I have had here.</p>

               <p>Mr. Justice Nares. I perfectly noticed that in this particular instance, that case does not come within the rule laid down by Mr. Chetwood; yet I think no man should be bound to accuse himself, nor should any man, when lulled into a fatal security, with promises of being free, if he makes a confession, have that confession afterwards turned against him; I do not give my opinion here particularly, but I speak my own sentiments; suppose the crime to be ever so great, if a man having authority or power, a prosecutor or constable, says, let me know where these things are you shall go free, his life is concerned; and he relying on that promise, does make a confession, or does tell where the goods are, he ought to have the benefit of that promise; and so far I will venture to say, that in the little experience I have had, wherever confessions have been made; the people have been always asked whether it was voluntary; nay farther, whether the party was not apprized, that his life was at stake; if what my brother has mentioned is the opinion of the majority of the Judges, as he thinks it is, however I am bound by it, yet at the same time, I think it would be an exceeding hard case, that a man whose life is at stake, is to be lulled into security, and then because goods are found, which he has confessed, that confession is to operate against him. I only speak this as my opinion, as I think it a great hardship: We have read in other histories of other nations, that it is one of the particular species of fortune to tell the wretched; they shall be free if they confess, and immediately to turn that confession against them, I do not say, but my brother's law may be exceeding right, and he seems to mention it as the received opinion of the Judges; I do not contradict it, I only cannot help speaking the feelings of my own heart.</p>

               <persName id="t17830430-9-person181">

            . There is no doubt, but that other Judges have thought on this subject, in this same manner, that my learned brother does: This subject has more than once, undergone solemn consideration,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300024"/> and according to my recollection not having my papers here; (I do not mean to speak with absolute certainty, and the case before us, does not require, that I should;) but according to my best recollection, upon a solemn decision of the subject by the Judges, a majority of the Judges were of that opinion, of which I have now professed myself to be; and I do know extremely well, that very able men did at one time think otherwise, and that was the occasion of the subject brought under decision.</p>
               <p>Mr. Judge Nares. I believe something was mentioned, at the meeting of all Judges, but I did not understand, it is the separate opinion of all the Judges.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council to Mr. Blackmore. Tell us exactly what was said?</p>
               <p>Mr. Blackmore. I was, my Lord, at Mrs. Warrickshall's, at the delivery of the pintle, I went in with Carpenter, I took Mrs. Warrickshall aside, on the landing place of the stairs, I said, Mrs. Warrickshall this matter differs from the yarn; she said, will you speak for me? Says I, I can do no such thing believe I said with the navy-board; there were no considerations of favor or mercy, offered her by me, and I was particularly careful not to give any idea favor or mercy, because I knew to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. My Lord, there is no evidence against young Warrickshall, but his going with the boat, and he is an apprentice to his mother, and he staid with the boat after he had landed his fare.</p>

               <p>The learned Judge then summed up the evidence to the Jury, and added as follows.</p>
               <p>You know gentlemen, if the two principals are not guilty, the accomplices cannot: With respect to Bell, who is one of the principals, there is nothing affects him, for what the other man says, who is a mere accomplice, without something confirm it, cannot affect him; because it is a certain rule, where one man thinks proper to take the guilt off himself, to put it on another, the law never credits that declaration: With respect to the other principal Littlepage, although the evidence of the accomplice, is very circumstantial, yet that would not do, without something to confirm it; but here is the strongest conformation in the world by Littlepage himself, for he says, that every word of this information was true: So, that there is a direct evidence by this Stannard, confirmed in the strongest manner by the prisoner, reduced into writing, and which cannot deceive: I cannot therefore see any thing that can be said in his favor, if you believe the evidence; supposing then, that Littlepage is guilty, then the question is, with respect to the other prisoners, who are indicted as receivers; and they you will observe, must know these things were stolen at the time they received them in order to be guilty: Now with respect to

            , there seems to be the strongest evidence in the world that can be given against her: Here are two shipwrights apprentices, come and tell her, they had got such a thing, she never asked them how they came by it, lends them a boat, orders her son to go with them, she weighs it, and pays these two lads for it: how she came to, were how to put any value upon it, is not material; for it is that sort of value, that is one of the strongest evidences in the world to prove, that she must know that they did not come honestly by it, because it is not half the real value of it, considered even in the light of an old pintle, but here it is as good as a new one: You see gentlemen, these circumstances of her bidding her boy go with her boat at one time, at another telling where her boat was, afterwards putting this pintle in the cellar, and its being found between the bed and the sacking;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300025"/> and another thing, her wanting to see Mr. Hankey, and when he says, what do you want with me? she says, I want to apply for your mercy; if she had been doing what she thought an honest thing, what mercy did she want: And therefore this confession she had made at all hazards, and all events, knowing she was guilty, and knowing there was a man in the house, that if she had denied it would have proved what she said to be false: Therefore, it stands for you to decide upon it, whether under all these circumstances, you think she received it, knowing it to be stolen: But I must make one observation more, and that is with respect to the little boy, her son, and apprentice; he might hear what was said, but he had nothing to do with it, he had nothing to do with the contract, between his mother and these men, he goes with the boat, is to bring what is mother agreed, they should fetch, but he know nothing particular of it, and therefore, I own for my part these are circumstances in his favor, and as many a lad acting under the conduct of his mother, I think it would be two hard to make him partake of the consequences of guilt, in an equal degree with the mother herself, however, gentlemen, you have the whole before you, you will take the whole into your consideration, and you will give your verdict accordingly; you will find Littlepage guilty, if you think he is guilty, and then with regard to the other two, the two Warrickshall's, you will find one or both guilty, as you think in point of conscience you ought to do.</p>

               <p>Court. How much did she ask? - One shilling.</p>
               <p>Who was the other woman? - I do not know her name, I had not been in bed above twenty minutes, before there came a knock at the door, this prisoner at the bar and a man threw me across the bed, and threatened to take my life away if I made any resistance, they laid hold of me, they put their hands in my mouth, which tore my mouth very much, my breeches were on the pillow, I held them as hard as I could, and I halloo'd murder two or three times, but I durst not halloo any more, and nobody came to my assistance, till after they had got off.</p>
               <p>What did they do to you, when they threw you down on the bed? - They robbed me of my watch, and eighteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Who robbed you? - The prisoner at the bar one, and the man I did not know.</p>
               <p>Who took the money from you? - They all helped to aid and assist in taking it.</p>
               <p>What, not the woman that you agreed to sleep with all night? - Yes, she was one.</p>
               <p>Who was the woman that you agreed to sleep with? - I cannot tell her name, she was one of her companions at the bar, I took the constable, and took her the Monday night following, we found her at the opposite door, at the public house, up two pair of stairs, the watchman heard me when I cried out murder, they made their escape backwards, over a wall.</p>
               <p>How did you describe this woman to have her taken? - I knew her very well,</p>
               <p>Why you was with her but a little while? - I was with her an hour or two, I took more particular notice of her than the rest; I had not time to see the man; it was about ten or eleven o'clock, the 22d of March.</p>
               <p>You immediately agreed with the other woman as soon as she came in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why, she was the woman that brought you the gin? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you go to bed with the other woman? - Yes, about the space of twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Was you drunk or sober? - Why I was not drunk at all.</p>
               <p>What quantity of gin did you drink? - Only three half quarterns among three.</p>
               <p>So you do not recollect any thing of the other woman, or of the man, nor of their persons? - No, not of the man particularly, because I had not time to see him.</p>
               <p>Court. The woman brought the gin up, as soon as you went to this girl's lodging, that was before you went to bed with her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there a candle in the room all the time? - Yes, there was a candle, but it was put out when they all went out.</p>
               <p>Was there a candle in the room, when you went to bed with the second woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So you did not know this woman before that night? - No.</p>
               <p>Then this woman came up, and gave you the gin, and drank a part of it, before you went to bed with this woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do not you recollect her at all, you seem to have been so struck with her, as to quit this woman? - I could not recollect her person at all, the man is a weaver, he is known very well, but they could not find him, he escaped.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find your watch again? - I never made any enquiry after it, for I thought it was all in vain.</p>
               <p>Nor the money, I take it for granted? - No.</p>
               <p>Where had you been before you came home with this woman? - I had been along with two or three of my partners at work<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300027"/> at Somerset house, I was no ways in liquor at all.</p>
               <p>What did the other woman immediately assist upon the others coming in? - Yes, she let them in.</p>

               <p>Where did you see the prisoner? - Returning from Deptford, I saw the prisoner and another woman sitting at a public house door near Iron-gate.</p>
               <p>How came you to know her again? - Very well, I put my hand upon her, and said, oh! Jenny how could you rob me so, and she struck me twice, till she stunned me, and then she ran over Tower-hill, I called after her as well as I could, and this man took her.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that that gown that was upon her when she was taken, was your gown? - Yes, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>What did you know it by? - When it was almost new there was a spark of wood struck it, and I strove to match the colour, and there is a piece put in, and I have a piece of that colour at home.</p>
               <p>You have no doubt at all but that is the same gown you lost? - No, my Lord, and here is a piece the fellow of it.</p>
               <p>Did you ever get any of the other things that you lost? - No, my Lord, she made me no answer, but struck me twice, she was gone above a twelvemonth before she was taken.</p>

               <p>As I was going over Tower-hill, just by Iron-gate, I saw this Mrs. Perry stop the prisoner, and she struck her twice, and she run away, and I caught her, and brought her to the officer, and had her secured, and I had a bit of the gown cut out at the Justices to be sure of it.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I bought the gown about six months ago of a woman, that might be a Jew woman, I gave eight shillings for it.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you the woman here that you bought it of? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>How came you to leave your place? - My master and mistress fell out and had very great words, and I really thought there would be murder, and they both fell a fighting, and I was rung up before I had been in bed a quarter of an hour, and then they sent for me up again, and there was my mistress all undressed and her mouth all bleeding, my master was in his shirt, and my mistress had the poker in her hand, and they had broke some glasses, and I went down stairs again, and I had not been in bed long, you know, madam, you was at the top of the stairs, and you said my master was gone to fetch a watchman, and I was so frightened I did not know what to do.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. and Mrs. Perry. Is there any truth in this story? - None at all, it is totally false what she says.</p>
               <p>Did not the watchman come in? - No such thing.</p>
               <p>Court. You had no quarrel that night? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please you my Lord, they did not go to bed till past three o'clock, and you know, madam, you came down and struck a light to take into the parlour; and as soon as the washerwoman came, I went my ways, you know the watchman came in, do not you remember you came down, and you asked me particular where the tinder box was? I have no witnesses.</p>
               <p>Mrs. FORESHALL sworn.</p>
               <p>Are you the person that went to the house of Mr. Perry to wash, at the time the young woman left her place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time did you come? - A little after four.</p>
               <p>Who let you in? - The maid.</p>
               <p>How often did you see her after? - Not above two or three times, she went backwards and forwards to bring the things, she said she was going into the yard, she said that my master and mistress had had a few words, she told me that when I first came, she said that they were just gone to bed.</p>
               <p>Did she complain of it and express any inclination to leave her place? - None at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300031"/>Had you known the family before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is Mr. Perry? - A bricklayer.</p>
               <p>Did you tell them what this young woman said? - Yes, Sir, I told them, that how I thought she was gone into the yard, for she told me she was going; and I think she answered me out of the parlour, when first I came, but I am not sure; my mistress got up directly when I called her.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Perry. Why did you deny this disturbance that happened at your house? - I think my word is to be taken, we had no disturbance in the house; I generally pack up every bit of linen, and set it down, and look it over, I am very particular to see there is not a stitch out, or a wristband, or any thing at all.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Perry. What were those things worth that you lost? - I have not set half a quarter the value on them.</p>
               <p>What might they be worth at a low valuation altogether? - About fourteen pounds, they are not laid above the value of four pounds in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. What might the gown be worth? - It cost me thirty five shillings without the making, the gown and coat together.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>I am shopman to Mr. Gwynne, on the 26th of March, the prisoner came to me, and desired I would shew her some fine muslins, either striped, spotted, or corded, she did not care which it was, but it must be fine and curious; I shewed her some spotted muslin, and some streaked, she bought a quarter of a yard of the spotted, and gave me four shillings and sixpence for it, in the mean time she stole a quantity.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by one quantity? - It might be two yards and a half.</p>
               <p>How do you know she stole it? - I did not see her take it, but immediately after she was gone I missed this muslin.</p>
               <p>What did you miss? - Fine streaked muslin.</p>
               <p>A piece or what? - I fancy there might be about three yards.</p>
               <p>Was it a separate piece? - Yes, the piece had been in paper amongst the rest that I shewed her, and she asked me the price of it, I am sure of that, I cannot exactly say what it contained, but last Christmas when we took our stock, I measured three yards and a half, and no one in the shop can recollect cutting it since; but I cannot positively swear that any of it was not sold since.</p>
               <p>Was it off that piece that she had bought? - It was part of another.</p>
               <p>What might that piece that you missed be worth at prime cost? - It cost us seventeen shillings and six-pence a yard.</p>
               <p>You cannot speak to the quantity there was then of it? - I cannot, she was got out of the shop, clear off before I missed it two minutes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300032"/>When did yo u see her again? - The next day she walked by the shop, I knew her again, and followed her directly, and charged her with it, she denied ever seeing it, she said she had been a very good customer and was very sorry such a thing should be supposed of her, as she had laid out a great deal of money; she told me she lived in Peter-street, Westminster, but afterwards we found she lived over Westminster-bridge; she continued to deny it for some time, but going to Justice Hyde's she caught hold of my hand and said, my dear sir, if you will forgive me, I will tell you where you may see the muslin; I told her it was out of my power to forgive her, she must apply to Mr. Gwynne; when we got to Justice Hyde's she denyed saying any such thing, she said it was the muslin she bought that she meant, upon that Mr. Justice Hyde granted a search warrant, and I went to her lodging and found part of the muslin, which was of the same piece that she took the day before, there was about a yard and three nails; after that she confessed where the remainder of that piece was; it was at the pawnbroker's in St. Margaret's church yard, I got it; there was about a yard and a half which she pledged for eight shillings.</p>

               <p>Court. What character did this woman bear? - A very good one, I never knew any blemish in her character, she never had but one place, and she lived in it ten years.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know if her family is in any distress? - Yes, my Lord, they kept a chandler's shop and ran out a good deal of money, they were very much imposed on, and lost all they had, and I believe they are in very great distress; they owe me a great deal of money for rent, and I am sure they would have paid me if they could.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner called four other witnesses who all gave her an exceeding good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. The defence of the prisoner is rather addressed to your compassion than your justice, for she does not deny the fact but pleads for mercy; therefore if you think her guilty, you are bound by your oaths to find her so, however painful it may be.</p>

             Esq;</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Now, Sir, this is the time for you to make your defence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Does pawning the property with intention to steal it, or to replace it again lessen the crime, my Lord, if the intention is proved.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. How far, it may mitigate the complection of the offence, so as to make you the subject of mercy or not, is one thing; but the question is, whether the replacing it will reduce it from a felony, to a misdemeanor of any other kind, and I say no; it is felony for a servant to pawn<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300036"/> his master's property without his consent; I am not bound to give you his answer, at this time, but as you have put the question, I do it.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>When I went to hire myself as a servant to Mr. Newnham, which was about the 6th or 7th of Dec. he said, I should have so much per year, and a livery, and that, as it would be some time before his other servants came, I should wear my own cloaths till then; and he would allow me something for wearing them; and as I was to go out with the carriage with my lady; he expected me to go very genteel; I told him I had sufficient cloathing, to appear as genteel as any gentleman in the city; I served him near three months before I had my livery, in the course of that time Mr. Newnham and his Lady, had frequently complained, that they were ashamed to go out with me, because I could not keep myself clean enough; I had things in pawn, which I wanted to redeem, as soon as I could get money; and I pawned these things to redeem those: I acknowledge the pawning of them: My master gave me orders to buy a sack of oats, and desired me to pay for it, I was loath to expose my poverty to my master, and those things, which were given under my care, under my own lock and key by his desire, and which, if I had lost any, I must have been answerable for them, I pawned: I put in one of his table spoons, to pay for the sack of oats, he shortly after paid me for those oats; then I got it out again; and I found my livery did not come so soon as I could have wished, and as I had put them in and got them out again to pay his expences, I thought I could do them again for myself; when the quarter was due, there was about three pounds due to me then, and with what money I had in my pocket, I could have redeemed them, I was very urgent for the money, he said he would pay me the next morning, but he did not; he was generally very busy in the morning, and if he was troubled by a servant carrying in a message, he used to be in a passion; and I did not like to trouble him; he paid me I believe about three weeks after my quarter was due; he gave me two guineas, in part of my quarter's wages; at the time the horse cloths were missing, he asked me for them, I told him, I believed they were in the manger, and I pretended to look about for them; but knowing they were not there, he called me into the parlour, and said, William you know where they are, and if you will not get them, I will charge a constable with you directly; I told him I had a wife and a child at home, and had taken an unfurnished lodging, and that they were at home; I told him that a friend had lent me some things; and he asked me before the constable, if there was any thing else pawned; he said, he had missed a pair of shoes, but he saw they were brought back again, I told him they were pawned the corner of Dove-court, them I fetched home as soon as he paid me my wages; these dozen of white handled knives and forks, were pawned at Mr. Jarvis's, in Fetter-lane, I was going out with my master behind the carriage, before I went out in the morning, I gave my wife a pair of silk stockings, which I had bought to pawn, and says I, fetch that dozen of white handle knives and forks, and when I return I will replace them, two days before I had redeemed four tea spoons from the corner of Dove-court, and carried them home in the country, and there left them; this portmanteau he desired me to lapsup a couple of young pigs, and bring them to town, one I was to leave at my master's, and it is a portmanteau that I generally buckle behind my saddle; I had two or three pair of shoes, stockings, &amp;c. I brought th em from the country; and carried them, and the pigs, all the things in this portmantua, left it at my lodgings, with the things in it; and not with intent to steal it: And was he to speak like a gentleman, he would signify to your Lordship, that he does not believe, I meant to defraud him of any of the things; he promised me before the constable, that provided I should make him an open confession, and he promised the constable, which I doubt not will not deviate from the truth, that he should not hurt me, if he got his things again; he said, he would sooner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300037"/> prosecute the pawnbroker, than he would me, and it is well known, my Lord, by the pawnbroker, that I had put these things in at different times, as I was necessitated for money for his use; and he did not pay me my bills weekly, sometimes it was longer; I have a wife near her time of laying in, and four small children besides, destitute of every thing in the world; another thing I wish to represent, Mr. Lowe, when I offered the knives and forks, he asked me to sell them, I said, no; if I had meant to defraud my master, I certainly should make the most of them; I pawned nothing, but what was under my own care, if I had a mind to have robbed him, I could have robbed him of seventy or eighty hundred pounds worth of plate; I am now at the mercy of your Lordship, and I hope your Lordship, and the Prosecutor, and the Jury, will prove merciful to me. I have not one witness here, I was informed in Newgate by Mr. Pitt, that I should be tried by the London Jury, and there was not one of the trials before the London Jury, was to come, till such times as the country was finished, and Mr. Pitt, the turnkey, told me this morning, I should not be tried to day.</p>
               <p>Court. If that was the case, and if you really could have had witnesses, why did not you when you came up now, state it to the Court, and desire to have your trial put off.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Newnham. He has stated it as a fact, that before he had made any confession to you, you promised him you would not prosecute him? - I deny that, all that I said to him was, from the time, I took him in the stable, till the constable took him with me to Mr. Justice Blackborow, I said to him, William, I will not lose sight of you, I will have all my things, and when he went down on his knees, and made use of horrid words, such as wishing, that God Almighty would never receive him into his favor, if he had taken any thing of mine, I said, I would know; he then said, he had pawned them. I believe I had bespoke some oats, which were not come in; I did send him to buy a sack of oats, I paid him the next day, but I constantly paid him every Wednesday, when he came to me, he appeared to be very poor, and upon his coming to me, I gave him a couple of guineas, and when he asked me for his wages, I gave him a couple of guineas.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Mr. Newnham. Did you give me a couple of guineas at first, it was only one guinea, and that was to lay out for cards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Newnham. Here is the prisoner's receipt.</p>
               <p>The prisoner's receipt produced for four guineas.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to the Constable. Did not you hear Mr. Newnham promise to forgive me, if I would tell where the things were? - The thing was asked by the prisoner, but as to Mr. Newnham ever speaking a word that he would do such a thing, I do not recollect it, and I was in the room all the while.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to the Council. Did not Mr. Newnham promise before you, that he would not hurt me, provided I would tell? - I say no.</p>
               <p>Do not you recollect when we were coming from Clerkenwell Bridewell, one of the constables asked you if Mr. Newnham had shewn me any favour; did not you acknowledge in the coach that you heard him say, that he would not hurt me, or prosecute me if he could any ways help it, and upon my telling him the truth; and did not you say, that you did not believe Mr. Newnham would hurt me? - I did say that I did believe Mr. Newnham would not hurt you if you told the truth.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Ah! Mr. Hotchkins. My Lord, I am entirely at your mercy, and the mercy of the Court, my life is sworn away in a malicious mannner, and I submit myself to my fate; God knows in my conscience I am clear of ever having any intent of robbing my master, had I had a mind to have done it, I could have done it frequently: I am ready to submit to my fate, if it was to go to be hanged, but it is my duty to beg for my poor disconsolate wife and family;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300038"/> if I must be banished my country, I must; but I humbly beg of your Lordship to inflict any imprisonment upon me, even during the remainder of my life, so that I might but see my wife and children, and I should be for ever bound to pray for your Lordship.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. You perceive, Gentlemen, by this indictment not being laid capitally, there could be no intentions against this man's life, however the strictness of publick justice, and the nature of the offence, which is, that of a servant robbing his master, might have called for a capital prosecution: A servant pledging his master's property without his consent, without any regard whether he had any intention in his mind to reinstate them at a future time, I cannot hesitate to state to you as a felonious taking; if it was not so, no man who has servants would be safe in his property; every servant that pawned his master's property might assert, that he he had such a mental reservation. The prisoner has told you a long story, the amount of it is the acknowledging the pledging these things, but endeavouring to give some colour for the pledging; not at all meaning as he asserts, to wrong his master in the end; whether his manner of telling his story was calculated to make a favourable impression or not, is a question not material for me to state to you; but the effect of it is, that his defence amounts to a confession, because it is confessing the having pledged his master's property without his consent: The prisoner has said a great deal of the circumstance of being surprized with regard to his trial coming on; whether he could have had any witnesses to his character, I do not know, but no man in this place is pressed or hurried to his trial, where there is a hope that a little delay will be of any service to him; and the prisoner might have had the same indulgence, if he had mentioned it in time, that prisoners have, and will continue to have whilst the law continues to be administered in this place: the case is therefore, to be taken upon the facts, and upon the facts I do not find a question, on which there can arise a matter of doubt; the matter of fact is, the prisoner has whilst in his master's service, without his master's knowledge or consent, taken his master's property out of the house, and also had part of his master's effects in his possession; there is one single article, that he has given a reasonable account for, which would, I dare say, have been received by you, and that is in the case of the portmanteau, but there are other articles, to which no answer has been given, and therefore, there is sufficient evidence of a felonious taking, which amounts to a proof of this indictment.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I would wish as a favor, that your Lordship will pronounce sentence upon me now at the bar.</p>
               <p>Court. Sir, you have no pretensions to extraordinary favor; I do not think your case nor your manner of conducting yourself at the bar, nor your manner of talking of your master, entitles you to any favor. - Withdraw your prisoner. - (The prisoner taken away, but called back by order of the Court.)</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Sir, you have alledged, that you were surprized by being tried now; expecting to be tried in London; now there is I understand another indictment against you in London, and therefore, if you think it will be of any use to you, and will give you any opportunity of representing your character and conduct in a favorable light, that you should be tried on that second indictment, the Court will go out of its usual course, by trying you a second time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I thought the things I have been tried for now, were from the country house.</p>
               <p>Court. Sir, you have nothing to do, but to answer the question; do you desire to have an opportunity of being tried on that second indictment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What is it an indictment from Mr. Newnham.</p>
               <p>Court. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I do not understand the meaning, of your Lordship's question.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300039"/>Court. Sir, the meaning is this, you complained that you was surprized, that you had not an opportunity of bringing your friends here to speak for you; I now tell you, I will give you an opportunity of bringing your friends here to speak for you, if you wish to be tried on that second indictment, it might alter perhaps, the sentence of the Court, with respect to the degree of punishment you deserve: Do you desire to be tried on the other indictment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I really am surprized in respect to the other things.</p>
               <p>Court. Take him from the bar.</p>

               <p>Court. Had he put them down in any house? - No, in the open court, and a man that was looking out at a window said, no man lived there, it was an empty house; then we seized the prisoner and the goods; he made no resistance, he said he had the pigs from Paddington, and some of the goods were sent out of Hertfordshire.</p>
               <p>Court. How far is Lissen-green from Theobald's-row? - About a mile and a half, or two miles.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, this is a capital offence, now you know extremely well, a burglary must be committed in the night time, it is possible that there was time to have taken these things very early in the morning while it was light, as I believe the sun rises before five in the morning; as to the taking of the goods, they were found upon him, but as for the burglary, I own, I think it is going too far to say he was guilty of that, because he might have taken them in the morning.</p>

               <p>On Friday evening, this girl's mother sent for me to go of an errand, and she asked me to drink; she had an old gentleman a Scotchman with her, she said, this old man has got a watch, and she wished me to take it; on Saturday morning she sent for me again, and asked me to drink; and she told me I had better go and lay down on her bed, she thought I was a little in liquor; and in the afternoon I laid down, and about two I got up, and she was gone out, I asked where she was; I went to get me something to eat; and had two penny worth of pigs face, I went to a pawnbroker's, and took out a red cloak and apron; I came by Mr. Hall's door, and went in and had a pint of beer, the girl came home, and had something lapped up in her apron, she flung it into my lap, I was standing in the middle of the floor, when this gentleman came up stairs, and he found this tankard on the bed, I have nobody here, they were here last night.</p>

               <p>Jury. My Lord, cannot we bring it under forty shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. You are to exercise your own judgment! The Court does not enquire into value, in order that Juries may exercise a degree of liberality; though to besure this is not like the case of grand and petty larceny, because there 12 d. was a rule that was established many, many hundred years ago, and there is a vast disproportion, between the value of 12 d. then, and 12 d. now: But this depends upon the value of money, since King William's time, in which there is not so great a difference: I do not know how many ounces this tankard weighs; the value is not found by evidence before you, to be above forty shillings, therefore upon that you must exercise your Judgment.</p>

               <p>I went to buy a cloak and a petticoat with a gentlewoman, and we could not agree, and coming out I met the master, he advised us to go back, and we bought a bit of mode; I said it was damaged, he shewed me another piece, and he asked three shillings and nine-pence, I said it was too dear, he directly cut me off four yards, and I paid him twelve shillings; I asked him to cut it out for me, which he did, and I picked up a cloak, I did not know whether it was this cloak or not; I was above an hour gone, and I came back again, and if I had had any thing of the gentleman's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300045"/> under my arm, I would not have come back, and the gentleman said to me, says he, I want to speak to you, I understand you have picked up a cloak.</p>
               <p>Court. But that cloak is ready made? - I did not know but it was the same.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Were there any ready made cloaks on the compter, or any ways exposed in your shop, during the time the prisoner was there? - A great many.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner called two witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

Calvert's; the other butt is Mr. Whitbread's by the mark; we took the prisoner on the 16th of April, and he confessed, that he took the butt from a house that we had served.</p>
               <p>Court. What conversation passed that introduced that confession? - After I had seen the butt I returned home, and took a Mr. Vaughan, where we were told he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300046"/> bought it; I got two of the men from Litchfield-street, and the man who bought the butt pitched upon the prisoner; Vaughan is not here, we went back to the office, when we came there, Vaughan was examined, and I believe would have been committed, had not Mr. Barnfathen gone away.</p>
               <p>How was the confession introduced, was it before the Justice or in your compting house? - It was both, he confessed it immediately that he sold them there, as a perquisite to one of our coopers, which was an intire falsehood.</p>
               <p>Was that as soon as he was taken? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then when he was taken, I take it for granted he was charged with this theft? Yes.</p>
               <p>And he said, he sold it as a perquisite? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner attend your brewery at all? - He has been off and on.</p>
               <p>Court. But there is no such perquisite? Not as he reported, there is a perquisite which publicans have frequently, on application to the brewery for water butts.</p>
               <p>There had been no such order in this? Never any such application, these were very good butts, they were fit for use in the brewery.</p>

               <p>I happened to be at home the day the agreement was made for these butts, an agreement with the prisoner at the bar, and two others.</p>
               <p>Who are these others? - I cannot say, but I believe the prisoner at the bar to be one; the agreement was, that the person in the top room should ask Mr. Vaughan, whether he could assist him to get a water butt, and Vaughan said, it did not belong to him, it belonged to the porter brewery; then the prisoner, or one of the others spoke, and said, you are in right time, for our cooper can assist you with one: Now Mr. Vaughan asked the price, and was answered five shillings, I am sure the prisoner was one of the persons, Mr. Vaughan said, give my compliments to Mr. Stockall the cooper, of Mr. Calvert's brewhouse, and desire him to send me two; Mr. Vaughan tuned to me, and said, if I am not in the way Mr. Hall, you be so kind to pay for them; and I made answer yes, that was all that passed.</p>

               <p>Court. Who was it that said that? - I cannot certainly say it was the prisoner; I turned about and said, you help me to one, do you sell water butts? he said no master, I do not deal in them, but our cooper has got some old butts to sell, he mentioned the cooper's name, Stockall, I told him he was an utter stranger to me, nor would I buy a butt of him, I would have no concerns with him; Mr. Vaughan, immediately applies to him, did not you say, Mr. Stockall has got some by him to sell; he said, yes, at five shillings a piece, and Mr.

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, you under stand that stealing privately these sort of articles, which are properly deposited in particular places, if above the value of 5 s. is offence. Now if any man removes from the place where it food, and where it ought to be, any sort of personal property belonging to another, with a design to steal it, he has then com pleated the felonious purpose, and whether he his the good fortune to take it of or no, makes no sort of difference. In the present case, as to whose coach house this was, for it seems to be held in common by two persons; and it is charged in the indictment, to be the coach house of Smalley the prosecutor; and it seems that though not actually divided, yet it was in point of enjoyment divided for occupation; it is a very nice point to be sure, where a man's life is at sta Another thing is, this is a charge of stealing privately, in this coach house; now privately stealing is as opposed to entering by force, burglary, or breaking a house; wheresoever there has been actual force used to get into a place, in which the charge is, that the party has stolen privately, the force used removes that part of the charge; now here, there are circumstances of force, and therefore what was stolen, could not be considered after that, to be stealing privately.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a porter to Mr. Roper, on the 15th of April, I was concealed under a bed, with a carpet before me; I had dreamed the night before, that I should be robbed.</p>
               <p>Court. Whose house was it? - It was Mr. Vale's, a builder, in Rathbone-place; at the same time, that I lay under the bed, I observed the prisoner Bage come into the room, take this counterpane off the bed, fold it up, and lay it down again on the bed; he went up into the garret, and finding the doors locked, came down again, tryed the two pair of stairs door, that was locked, looks into the back room again, and walks down stairs into the dining room; the prisoner Brown came up, takes up her upper petticoat, takes this counterpane, folded up as it was off the bedstead, and bedding, and puts it under her petticoat in the stairs; it was upon a field bedstead in a different part of the room from where I was; it was on the other side, I had a view of her; she put down her petticoat, and brushed down her apron, she put her gown through her pocket holes, and walked down stairs.</p>
               <p>You did not dream all these circumstances, I suppose the preceeding night? - No, I dreamed, I should be robbed; I found her as soon as I could get from under the bed, she was upon one landing place, and I was upon the other; I asked a footman to fetch a constable, he was so frightened he could not stir; I ran out for a constable, and I met the prisoner, I told her I wanted to see her a good while; the prisoner Bage was coming out, and I seized him also; and took them in the back parlour, Mr. Bage<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300049"/> threatened to strike me, I charged her with stealing the counterpane, when I had hold of her, she gave herself a shake, and the counterpane fell down on the floor, I said to Mrs. Brown you have stole a counterpane, she said, she knew nothing of it; I had them apprehended.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. What are you? - I am a porter.</p>
               <p>You know very well you dreamed of this, had you any body to put you in mind of it; you know Mr. Barew? - No.</p>
               <p>Why he was at the sale that day; was any body in the room? - Nobody but Brown and Bage.</p>
               <p>Was any body in the parlour at the time they dropped from her? - Nobody that I know of.</p>

               <p>Cannot you tell? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>Bage attempted to run away? - No, the door was shut.</p>
               <p>Had you never seen Mr. Barew there? I do not know him.</p>
               <p>Do not you remember a gentleman saying, ah! I have done for you now? - Done for me, no.</p>
               <p>No, done for the prisoner? - I cannot say I remember it, I cannot say I ever saw Mr. Barew, I really do not know him: There were people in the house; it was the day before the auction.</p>
               <p>There was another man in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not call for any assistance? - I sent him for a constable.</p>
               <p>Who was there besides? - A great many gentlemen's servants, I do not know their names.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath? - I can say I know one particular gentleman's servant that was in the room, his name is Joseph.</p>
               <p>How could you see if there was a carpet before you? - I had one of the base vallens pinned up on purpose, I had been robbed so often.</p>
               <p>You did not know the people before at all? - I cannot say I knew them particularly.</p>
               <p>Not particularly? - They were at Mr. Roper's sale once before.</p>
               <p>Court. What sale is this? - It was a house hired for the sale of Mr. Vale, by Mr. John and

            , they are auctioneers and brokers; I was there to take care of the goods, that nobody should take any away.</p>
               <p>Court. How long had you been under the bed, before these people came up stairs? - Altogether about three hours.</p>
               <p>What time did you take your post there? - About eleven o'clock, when we opened the house for public view.</p>
               <p>How many rooms were there open? - There were four.</p>
               <p>What room was this you was in? - The two pair of stairs back room.</p>
               <p>Where were the principal effects? - In all those rooms, divided in different rooms.</p>
               <p>Were there beds in the other rooms? - No, there was never a counterpane in either of the rooms that were open.</p>
               <p>Court. Now you are fencing, looking forwards to see what I mean I ask you if there were any beds, in the other rooms that were open? - There was a bedstead, a press bedstead shut up, there was besides my own, one in the dining room, and one in the parlour; the fourth room was left vacant by itself, and there was not so much property in that.</p>
               <p>Where did you station the other two people? - The one was in the dining room at the china table, he was there to see that nobody took any thing away, the other was in the front parlour.</p>
               <p>What time did you begin to open for view that day? - Eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. How came you to make choice of the upper room to put yourself in, perhaps your dream pointed out that particular room? - No, it did not.</p>
               <p>Was you to lose a counterpane in particular, did your dream point out a counterpane in particular.</p>
               <p>No, I did not dream I should lose that counterpane; I did not dream I should lose any thing in particular; I dreamed I should be robbed; and that I must put a carpet under the bed, but how I could not tell.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300050"/>Your dream was a little more particular than that, because you were to put yourself under the bed, as well as the carpet; what was the carpet to do? - I told my master, and he said depend upon it you will be robbed.</p>
               <p>No doubt of it, to be sure if you had dreamed it; which of your masters? - My master

            , he advised me to take as much care as possibly I could.</p>
               <p>I suppose you expected your dream would come true? - I had so often found that it came true.</p>
               <p>Oh! your dreams have often came true? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. You lost things before without dreaming, therefore this was a particular thing, did you see in your dream, the person that was to rob you? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Did you see no large woman? - No, I did not see any large woman.</p>
               <p>Had you no guess who the thief would be? - No, I had no guess.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You seem to have some acquaintance with these people I think? - I never had any acquaintance with them, any further than they put about twenty lots of goods into my master's sale, in Queen Ann's-street, which my master sold out of catalogue.</p>
               <p>How long before? - I cannot say the particular time, I believe it might be in March.</p>
               <p>What did they sell for? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What way had the people been in, do you know Mr. Bage? - When he was before the Justice, my Lord, he called himself a broker.</p>
               <p>But perhaps you can tell? - I cannot say I ever saw him in that line of business, before they were brought to Mr. Williams's room, in White Lyon-yard, Oxford-street, for we removed them to Queen-Ann's-street; I do not know what they sold for.</p>
               <p>Was the money paid? - I fancy it was, the clerk can tell that.</p>
               <p>Was that the only time that you had seen these people? - I did not see them then, not to particularly know them.</p>
               <p>Had there been any disputes arisen about these twenty lots? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Do not you know? - No.</p>
               <p>No dispute or uneasiness? - There was uneasiness at that sale, I lost a counterpane there.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to these people about this counterpane then? - No, my Lord, we had no suspicion.</p>
               <p>Was there any other intercourse and business between these people, and you and the Roper's? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Was there any disputes subsisting between you and them? - No, my Lord, not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Had you any information from any body, that inclined you to watch? - I had no further information but that there was a lusty man and a lusty woman going about thieving things from different sales.</p>
               <p>That was the whole of it was it? - The whole that I know.</p>
               <p>Had you that information from Barew? - No, my Lord, I had that information from several porters that work at sales.</p>
               <p>Had you that information from Barew? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Was Barew there? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>When had you seen him last? - I really cannot say that I know Barew, my Lord.</p>

               <p>I went into this house where Mr. Roper's sale was in, not with Mrs. Brown, but a little after her? - I live at No. 8, Union-street, the back of the Middlesex Hospital, she had a stove, but it did not fit the place, I went up one pair of stairs and stayed with the man, getting a catalogue while this dispute happened; and this man had dragged Mrs. Brown into the parlour, the counterpane was far from her at the time when we went in; Oh! says he, I have been put up to this; I laid hold of him, says I, you rascal what business have you with her, says he I shall charge you too; I said, then drive us to Bow-street; there Mr. Addington committed us both; I never was no higher than one pair of stairs; I have no witnesses, there was nobody there.</p>
               <p>Have you any friends to speak for your character now? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>PRISONER BROWN's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am innocent of the thing that I am charged with, I think the spite is laid to me on account of Mr. Bage, through the Barews; I would be sorry to say an untrue thing, in the condition I am.</p>
               <p>Court. What way of life are you in? - I am a mantua-maker, I suppose I work in the best families in London; I was cleared before Justice Buller two months ago, in two hundred pounds, through the Barews; Sir Sampson Wright took his oath that it was a false thing laid against me, and now they have brought this against me.</p>
               <p>Court. As you work for so many families, undoubtedly you will establish a very good character? - Most of the ladies that I work for are at their country seats.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner called three witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Court. I do not know that, why not? - Because there is no other person about the shop that would take any thing away; the cross garnet hinges were found over a back office in a little cieling.</p>

               <p>As to these bolts and these garnet hinges, were they your property? - Yes, I marked the bolts and the hinges, I missed the bolt, and found it on Mr. Shepherd's premises, I missed a great many things.</p>
               <p>Had you marked these bolts? - Yes, Sir, particularly, there was a notch cut in them, and a flaw in the egde; a particular sort of stuff; this iron was found in a field; the prisoner said they were Captain

               <p>Did you know him before? - No, Sir,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300054"/> I saw him again that day three weeks, then I took him.</p>
               <p>Court. I want to know whether you saw the things, or whether your mother told you that there were such things? - I am upon my oath, I saw him myself, there was an old cloth upon the line, he knocked that down, and I suppose did not think that worth taking; I was so weak, I could not get out to cry Stop thief! before he was gone; he broke three pales and got out.</p>
               <p>Jury. How long time did you see him, at that time? - Not much above two minutes.</p>
               <p>When did you see him again? - I was going out of my door that day three weeks, and saw this man at the very same pales, where he got over before, there is an alley close to the pales, I said nothing to him then, for there were a parcel of men playing at skittles; and he run away as fast as he could after he saw me.</p>
               <p>Court. How came he to run from you, he had not seen you before when he took the things? - I cannot tell, Sir, but before I spoke to him, he ran away.</p>
               <p>Were ever any of your things found? - No, the prisoner denied the fact, I asked him what he ran away for, he made me no answer.</p>

               <p>Court. How came you to run away, when you saw this young woman? - I did not run away from her; there is a common necessary down there, and I went down there: I have not a friend in the world.</p>

               <p>When did you find the prisoner? - On the Friday night, and she had some silver in her pocket, but she had new things on; she gave the man half-a-crown to speak to the Justice for her, she had new shoes on; she said, she was in the room with me, but she never had any of the money.</p>

               <p>Why what had the young one to do in your house? - On the 29th of March, they came to lodge with me.</p>
               <p>I thought you said only Hancock? - Hancock took the lodgings, and when he came to go to bed, my wife gave him the candle, he said, James go up stairs with me a little bit, he said he should want a fire, and my wife carried up a tub of coals, and he asked her to let the young one lay with him, my wife said, she did not care for one night, he lay there all the next day, and Hancock lay in bed all the next day as we was told; the next day it was repeated in the same manner, on the 1st of April, the young one came down and told my wife; mistress, your sacking of your bed is broke,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300056"/> I want to mend it, says he, I am a handy little fellow at these jobs, and will do it myself, I went up stairs to work in the garret, being a shoe-maker, on the 2d of April I was in the lower apartment winding some flax, which is a wheel that makes a noise, and my wife was gone out to Butcher-row, for some cheese for our supper, she returned in about five minutes, says she, has the young men been in for a light? - says she, I saw them a talking together, and presently upon hearing a bustle, I went up one pair of stairs, and saw nobody, a thought struck in my head, I went up higher, and saw Hancock unlocking the door of his own room.</p>
               <p>What time in the evening was this? - about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did you go with a light? - Yes, as soon as Hancock had unlocked the door, he slipped in his candle and asked me for a light, I lighted his candle, and being taller than him, I looked over his head, and missed my looking glass which stood directly opposite the door, I said to him, what have you took the looking glass down, no, says he, says I, I insist upon seeing what else is down, and I rushed in upon him, and took the key out of the outside of the door, and locked it withinside, says I, I will keep you for my property; when I got in, I missed my sheets, pillow cases, kettle, counterpane, and looking glass, and they were all in the room that I left him; he walked about the room, he said it is very high says he, you must ask the other, I know nothing about them, I was not at home all night; says I, where is the other? says he, I have not seen him; I unlocked the door, and called my wife to fetch a constable; the constable began to ask him about the things, he knew nothing at all about them he said, you must ask the other; he believed I had lost them he said, and he was willing to pay for them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's question to Hancock. Did not I call to you for a light before I went into my room? - No.</p>
               <p>Mrs. WALE sworn.</p>
               <p>ent for some cheese in the evening on the 2d of April, about eight, and a few doors from my own, I saw the prisoners whispering together as I passed them, the one that took the room of me, said to the other, now let us go; with that I had some suspicion, and I looked to see if they went into my passage or not, and I saw them both go in to my house, my husband was at work, I asked him if the young men had been in for a light, and I had not been in many minutes, before Hancock came in, he said, so mistress, here is a stranger; I stared at him, stranger said I; yes, says he, you know I did not lay at home last night; yes, says I, so the boy told me, so I made a kind of a smile, and he coloured like any thing; says I, Sir, when would you chuse I should make your bed; says he, the boy told me he made it in the morning; a good evening to you madam, says he, I shall be in, in half an hour, then there was a bustle, and my husband did not get up from work, until I spoke quite sharp twice, and a few minutes after I heard another bustle; my husband went up and caught the prisoner as he told you: I saw the little one and another man on the stairs, I called to the man who lives in the one pair of stairs, he came down and collared him, and brought him down in the passage, the other man that he had brought I suppose wanted to take the bed away, I asked him what he had done with the things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether the whole furniture was not there when I left the lodgings? - I cannot tell, he never would let me have the key.</p>
               <p>Whether I did not call for a light, when I entered the room the second time? - No, my Lord, he did not seem to want to know any body.</p>
               <p>Did he ask for a light? - He did not let any body see him.</p>
               <p>Did he ask for a light? - No, no.</p>
               <p>PRISONER HANCOCK's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>When they came up stairs, I called to this man for a light, I found my door unlocked, my windows open, and my curtains drawn, here is a man that has known me this dozen years, I have been in his Majesty's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300057"/> service five years: he will give a character of me, Mr. Burn; I came up from Portsmouth on Saturday, and arrived in town, and took this lodging about four in the evening: I know nothing of the things.</p>
               <p>PRISONER GREENWOOD's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was coming up stairs to bed, I thought this man was in bed, and the woman turned the key: The inhabitants of London make a property of seafaring people now, my Lord.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner Hancock called one witness, and the Prisoner Greenwood called three witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

               <p>Continuation of the Trial of William Hall.</p>
               <p>They came to stop to tell me, they believed they had taken the person.</p>
               <p>Who shewed him to you? - I saw him at a public room with several more.</p>
               <p>But he was in custody with the officer? - Yes, but they brought several more with him.</p>
               <p>All in custody? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was not this man shewn to you by some of the officers? - I did not take notice of him till I came into the room; when I came in I looked round, and saw him directly, I said, that was the man.</p>
               <p>Did none of the officers shew him to you? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Nor as you was going along? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Was your watch ever found? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. There was one of Mr. Blackborough's men that came to your shop to inform you that they had took a suspicious person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He is one of the runners at Mr. Blackborough's? - I believe he is.</p>
               <p>Was he at the public house when you went? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see him at Clerkenwell? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How often did you see the prisoner before he was committed by Mr. Blackborough? - I saw him twice, but not to be near him.</p>
               <p>How often did you see him with the Justices? - I saw him once at the office.</p>
               <p>No more than once, recollect yourself? - I do not recollect that I saw him any more.</p>
               <p>How often did you go to see him at Clerkenwell? - I never went to see him but that once.</p>
               <p>Were was it that he was charged with the fact he now is, did you go after you had seen him at Mr. Blackborough's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, was there any commitment sent to detain him at your prosecution at that time? - I swore to him at that time.</p>
               <p>When you was at Clerkenwell, did not you say that you did not know him? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself? - I recollect no such thing.</p>
               <p>Was not he brought several times to Mr. Blackborough's, and did not you hesitate till by seeing him often, his face grew familiar to you? - No.</p>
               <p>Who was at that time with you? - I believe this man that took him and another.</p>
               <p>Yes, I fancy so? - They are the only</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300063"/>people who attend here, not the man that took him? - I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. He told you he was going to fetch a man that he suspected had robbed you? - The Justice ordered him and several more to be brought together.</p>
               <p>Had you told the runner that came for him how he was drest? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor of his height? - No.</p>
               <p>If you had never given any sort of description either of his dress or height, how came he to suspect that he was the man that robbed you? - I never knew the man before, he had the information from somebody else I suppose, I had described it to Sir Sampson Wright.</p>
               <p>There was nobody by at this time but the runner was there? - Nobody else.</p>
               <p>Did you publickly Sir, charge this man with having robbed you at Clerkenwell? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was any body by that heard you beside the runner, that is to have the reward? - Nobody else.</p>
               <p>Have you nobody here to prove that you singled him out directly beside the runner? - No.</p>
               <p>You never saw him before that night you was robbed? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you never see him but once at the Justices? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever express any doubt of this being the man, at any of the times that you saw him? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>You are sure you never did? - No, my Lord, I looked very hard at them in the face the night they robbed me.</p>
               <p>You said it was after eight? - Yes, between eight and nine.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing remarkable that night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was not that at the time of the eclipse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can you tell how near it was to eight, or how near it was to nine? - It was nearer nine than eight.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the eclipse was fuller? - I remember myself particularly it was very dark by half past eight.</p>
               <p>When the question was asked you, whether it was moonlight, how came you to tell me it was, without mentioning the circumstance of the eclipse? - The moon was not covered at that time.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A hair-dresser.</p>
               <p>A master or journeyman? - Journeyman.</p>
               <p>You know there is a reward on the conviction of highway robbers? - Yes, but I do not know that I shall recover any thing.</p>
               <p>Did not the runners tell you so? - They did not tell me that I should recover any thing.</p>
               <p>No, but they told you that there was a reward? - Yes.</p>
               <p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Was it you that took up this man? - It was.</p>
               <p>Where and when did you take him? - I was employed at Sadler's Wells to prevent people of suspicious characters from going into the gallery and pit, I found nothing upon him.</p>
               <p>How came you to go to this young man Lander? - Very soon after the robbery was committed, I received information that the prisoner was one that was concerned in it.</p>
               <p>Who did you receive information from that Lander that was robbed? - I received information from the papers, and it was publickly known by several officers of our parish, that the prisoner was one that was suspected of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Was Lander's name in the papers? - I cannot say he was.</p>
               <p>How did you know who it was? - The only account was, it was a hair-dresser or a barber; that lived in Gray's-Inn-lane, and from that I traced him out.</p>
               <p>You told him you had taken up a suspicious person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where was the prisoner when he first saw him? - In Clerkenwell-close.</p>
               <p>Who was with the prisoner? - Ten or twelve people.</p>
               <p>What sort of people? - Neighbours I believe that we desired to come in.</p>
               <p>Then the prisoner was the only man that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300064"/> was in custody, when the prosecutor came to see him? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Were his hands handcuffed? - No.</p>
               <p>How often had Lander seen him before, he said, he knew him? - He saw him twice in all; the first time he saw him, he knew him immediately.</p>
               <p>What before he went into the house? - I believe he did, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Was you with the prisoner, or with Lander? - I took the prisoner to a public house myself.</p>
               <p>Who was with Lander? - I do not recollect any body being with Lander.</p>
               <p>Did Lander come up to you, and the prisoner before he went into the house, and said, that he knew him? - Before he came into the house, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Yes? - No, I believe he did not say, that he knew him before he went into the house.</p>
               <p>What other officers were with the prisoner? - If there was any body it was Dinmore.</p>
               <p>He was entrusted to your care to bring him out of goal? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then it was your business to take care of him? - It was.</p>
               <p>Of course you did not let him go from you? - No.</p>
               <p>Which of your people was with Lander at that time? - It must be Dinmore.</p>
               <p>And you with the prisoner? - I was so, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Had you seen Lander the night before to tell him of the affair? - The day before I and Dinmore went together.</p>
               <p>You was one? - Yes, there is one thing I must beg leave to remark, when I saw the prosecutor in his master's shop, and asked him if he was the person that was robbed, says I, can you remember what was said to you when you was robbed; says he the expression which was made use of was, we have got the barber; says I, then this is the person.</p>
               <p>Was it you or Dinmore that told Lander of the reward, if this man was convicted? - Upon my oath, I never told him of the reward.</p>
               <p>Then it must be Dinmore? - I do not believe he did.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. One of the men said there was a reward, I believe it was this man, not that I should recover any thing; I would not tell him that he should recover a farthing.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing upon the prisoner when you searched him? - No, nothing at all.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have nothing to say, I suppose my friends are gone home, I had people to my character all day, I did not think my trial would come on.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you any other evidence but to character? - No.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My Lord the Justice himself ordered seven or eight more to be brought out with this man.</p>
               <p>Court. The officer has sworn that there was no more.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There certainly was, when he brought him along the Close there was no more, but in the room there were seven or eight more brought in, in custody.</p>
               <p>Court. Which of you are to be believed if you contradict each other upon oath? -</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Of all evidence the most liable to mistake, is the evidence of identity of person, especially that which depends upon the recollection of a single witness, seeing a person by a confused light, and in the hurry of a transaction necessarily attended with some degree of fear and confusion; so that the observations of a person are likely to be less accurate at that time, than at a time when they are more composed; however it is direct and possitive evidence, and that evidence is more or less strong in proportion, as it depends on more or less witnesses; in proportion to the degree of light, the opportunities they have of observing them, and the length or shortness of time that elapsed before they saw them again: In this case the light the prosecutor had to observe the person who robbed him by, was a very bad one; probably the recollection of many of you, many furnished you with that which I perfectly recollect, that at the time the prosecutor has fixed for this robbery, it was then as dark, or very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300065"/> near so, as if there had been no moon at all: I perfectly remember the coming out of the eclipse, and that by half after eight it was quite dark, so as to have the appearance of a very dark night; the person who robbed him was an utter stranger; the transaction was short; five weeks elapsed before he saw any thing of the person; and when he saw him, it was visibly under an impression of mind that he was likely to see the person who had robbed him; therefore supposing him to mean perfectly fair, he certainly went with an impression on his mind, that impression has certainly a very great effect, and under that impression, any degree of similitude or resemblance, will operate very strongly on the mind; Redgrave was the person that went to tell him, they had apprehended the prisoner; Redgrave was with the prisoner when Lander first saw him, and therefore he must necessarily see him immediately with the person, who informed him, he had taken him up; therefore seeing him with Redgrave, would intirely fix him in his belief, that the man he so saw, was the man who robbed him; however the man positively swears to the prisoner, and it is not necessary that you should disbelieve the man's veracity, but you are the proper Judges whether you are sufficiently satisfied with his certainty; if you are clearly satisfied, you are bound to find him guilty, but if you think from the circumstances of the case, and the general fallibility of that kind of evidence, when it is not confirmed by any other circumstances, that there is any doubt, in that case you as clearly ought to acquit him.</p>

               <p>As I was going into the shop, the prisoner was behind the counter, and I asked her what she wanted, and she said, she wanted a halfpenny worth of packthread; I told her I did not believe they sold packthread there; I called out halloo, at last the maid came out, says I, do you sell packthread here, and I said, I believe the prisoner had something about her that was not her own, I will take her backwards and see what she has got, as I was taking her, she undid her apron and threw the brushes down upon the floor; I cannot tell the name of the brushes, there is some of all sorts.</p>

               <p>On Friday in the afternoon about five, I went into the shop for a halfpenny worth of packthread, I knew they sold it, I sell fruit and things in Covent-garden; the door was shut, I pushed the door, and it went back with force; I heard a noise, then I turned my head round, and I saw it was a whole heap of brushes, I was as far off them as I am to one of them candles, I should not have known what to have done with them if I had them; five weeks I have been in gaol. I have no witnesses.</p>
               <p>Court to Leader. Where were the brushes laying? - They laid on a shelf behind the counter, I had just had a counter made the whole length of the shop, and in the middle of the counter a flap made to turn up with hinges, and a little door to shut and bolt, she opened the counter, unbolted the door, and took the brushes off the shelf and shot them down by the yard door.</p>

               <p>Court. How came you to ask if there was any bills out? - I had a suspicion that the horse was stole.</p>
               <p>How came you to suspect that? - From what the man said to me.</p>
               <p>What did he say to you, to give you that suspicion? - Because he would not get upon him himself, and by his wanting me to sell him for him; the book-keeper came and found the bill, and we found it was the same horse, then I rode the horse, and put him in a stable in Craven-street, and then I went to Bow-street, and told the officers to be ready against he came.</p>
               <p>How was the man taken? - When the man came into the house, I called him on one side, and I said, what a silly man you are to offer this horse to me, he is a stolen horse; I shewed him the bill; he lifted up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300067"/> his hands and said, what a damn'd fool I am; then the man came in directly and took him.</p>
               <p>What did the man say when he was taken? - He did not say any thing, we took him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Where is the officer that took the man? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Where is the hostler of the Inn? - I did not know that he was wanted.</p>
               <p>Court. At present you are the person that produce this horse that was stolen, and the whole rests upon your single evidence; why did not you bring the officer to prove that you had made a discovery; the officer ought to have attended.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I had been to see my friends in Kent, and I lay at Gravesend all night, coming next morning over Blackheath, opposite Greenwich park, a man overtook me with two horses, riding one and walking another; I asked him to let me ride, he said he had got to go down to Greenwich or Deptford, and he advised me to take this horse up to London, and he would give me a shilling to bring him up, so I did; he desired me to bring him to the Bull's head, in Dean-street, Soho, and put him up there; and the next day I went up to see if the man was come, and nobody was come; upon that on the Tuesday morning I called up there again, I was going to Oxford-road; I thought I should be brought into trouble about this horse, and I thought of finding out the man that owned the horse, and that man went along with me, and the man rode him as far as Hammersmith; he asked me to let him ride; I never saw the horse again until I was taken into custody; I am a poor man, I could not get any money to subpoena witnesses; I must leave myself to the mercy of the Judge and Jury.</p>
               <p>Court to Savage. The horse you took the owner to see, was the same horse you received of the prisoner? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. If the prisoner had laid before you any case in opposition to this evidence which has been given against him, I should have thought the evidence on the part of the prosecution admitted of a considerable degree of doubt; for this reason it depends on Savage, who by his own account was the man, in whom the possession of the stolen horse was found; that being the case he was called upon to give some account, otherwise it would have been evidence against himself; therefore it seems to me, that Savage ought to have brought to support his testimony, those persons who could support it, by proving from his conduct, that though the horse was found on him, that circumstance had not excited any suspicion in them against himself, for when a person whom stolen property is found on, does not give a satisfactory account of it, but lays a charge against another, on whom the property is not found; the evidence of such a person, should be received with a great deal of caution; this evidence might have been supplied, either by the attendance of the officer at Bow-street, or else the hostler at the Inn; but neither of these are produced; but if the prisoner had set up any defence which deserved attention, I should have thought the charge against him, but slightly supported; but the prisoner's defence removes all doubt and difficulty, because it is admitted by him, that Savage really did get the horse from him; now that is the only fact, on which you might suspect Savage's testimony; and if that is once established that the prisoner had in possession the horse before it came into the possession of Savage; that removes all suspicion from Savage, and leaves his testimony as much unimpeached, as any other creditable witness speaking on his oath; now the prisoner says, a man coming up on the road gave him two horses, and told him where he should take them to, and gave him one shilling, and he brought the horses to the place; that is a very extraordinary circumstance, but passing over that, another part of his case is capable of proof, and he has brought no witnesses to prove it, for he might have proved that he brought two horses to Dean-street, instead of one, and the circumstances under which he brought them to Dean-street; but no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300068"/> account appears of any other horses; you are therefore first to consider, what degree of belief you will give to Savage, confirmed in part by the admission of the prisoner; and next whether you think the admission of the prisoner unconfirmed by oath is entitled to credit.</p>

And he was afraid I suppose the send way, and he jumped over a thorn hedge into a field; I got over the hedge after him directly; he struck at me, I was afraid he had a knife in his hand, and might have ruined me, and I halloo'd out, murder! and after a few strokes I caught him by the breast, and got him down two or three times, and no one came up yet, but the watchmen hearing me halloo murder! and robbery! came to my assistance, and I had him in my custody, and keeping.</p>

               <p>Court. In what manner did you question him, tell us all the conversation? - I enquired where they found the things, I was told in the prisoner's box, the prisoner was by, and he admitted that they were there, and that they were mine, he hoped I would shew him mercy; I spoke thus, how could you have the infamy to treat me so, who knew the size of my family, and know how hard I work; he hoped I would shew him mercy, says I, you may depend upon it, I will make an example of you in future for others; I shall take the necessary course of the law.</p>
               <p>(The Things deposed to.)</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. In order to support this with all the evidence I could, I enquired after some of his acquaintance; this pair of gloves and handkerchief, I found in the possession of a young woman, servant to a gentlewoman at Islington, but I believe her to be a good young woman.</p>
               <p>Court. Is she here? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Very well, then say nothing about her. - He admitted that he had given them to her; some part of the gloves are in the possession of the constable, which he took from his person, out of his pocket, and the pin which we now mention, was found in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the value of all these things? - I had stated them under the prime cost, in the indictment; I beg leave to mention to your Lordship, that I wished not to lay them so as to affect his life, but I could not get information on the subject.</p>
               <p>Court. Were they taken out of your house? - They were not removed out of my house.</p>
               <p>Court. If they were removed from the place where they were left by you, and where you thought proper to keep them, without your order or consent, it is as much a taking away, as if they were carried to York.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Have I now an opportunity my Lord of altering the amount of the sum, I have not a wish to hurt his life: I will value them at thirty-nine shillings and eleven-pence if you will give me leave.</p>

               <p>Court. Was that in the place you left it the over night? - I went backwards in the yard, twelve holes bored with a spike in the pannel of the kitchen door; the back door that goes into the yard; and underneath that door was a hole cut, and four holes of each side, to break the piece out, and from the top of the place where the bolt was, is 2 feet 8 inches high; and from the bottom of the hole to the fill of the door, is eight inches.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the hole large enough to admit a person to get in? - It was but four inches one way and five in the height.</p>
               <p>How was the door got open? - That I cannot tell, it was unbolted.</p>
               <p>Could hand be introduced through that hole, and force the bolt? - Yes, from thence I went backwards into the shop; going into my shop I found my till burst open.</p>
               <p>Court. Tell me the situation of your shop? - It is towards the street.</p>
               <p>And what room does it communicate with backwards? - The kitchen.</p>
               <p>Is there a door from the kitchen to the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What state did you find that door in? - That door was not locked or shut; I did not shut it, as we leave it open that we may hear readily; the key of my till was taken out of my glass-case, there was five pound in silver in it; and twenty-four or twenty-five shillings worth of halfpence, it was all gone every halfpenny? the next thing he saw, was the glass-case in the window had been pushed backwards, and there I found dark with the grease all round it.</p>
               <p>(The Lanthorn produced.)</p>
               <p>So I went to my next door neighbour and told him I was ruined.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you miss any thing besides your money? - Oh Yes! all the plate almost out of the shew glass; out of the window a quantity; I have the inventory of them all.</p>
               <p>You know nothing of your own knowledge how the fact was committed? - No.</p>
               <p>This is all therefore, that you know respecting it? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Was not the hole at a very great distance from the ground? - Eight inches.</p>
               <p>You had the misfortune of being robbed some time before Mr. Delaforce? - Yes, two or three times.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect saying, before the magistrate or at any other time, that it must have been a person perfectly acquainted with your shop to have committed this robbery? - No, I never said any such thing, some of the other people may have said it.</p>
               <p>I believe it is a person nearly connected with yourself that robbed you before? - That is neither here nor there.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Delaforce. What does your consist of? - My wife and three children.</p>

               <p>I am one of the watchmen belonging to Bishopsgate parish, I was standing at the corner of Artillery-lane, and the prisoner happened to come by me on Monday morning about half before four, as near as I can guess; and he had a handkerchief with things in it, he was carrying it rather under his arm under his coat; I stepped up to him, Sir, says I, what have you got there? He muttered something, but I could not tell what he said; says I, I insist on knowing what you have got there, and will know; will you says he; yes says I, I will; I went to catch him, and he drew from me, and took to his heels, and ran up Artillery-lane; and I cried out Stop thief! and he directly threw the handkerchief away with the things in it; and an iron spike at the time he threw away, I desired the other watchman to pick up the things while I pursued the man; I pursued him, and never lost sight of him till he was taken; which was in Petticoat-lane near Widegate alley, there was two men more came to my assistance, and they laid hold of him before I got up; but I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he is the same man that you saw firs t? - I am sure he is the same man, for my eyes were never off him, we took him to the watch-house; there is somethings that I took out of his great coat pocket, a loaded pistol, a picklock key in his waistcoat pocket, and a knife; that pistol and that great gimblet was in his great coat pocket; this small one was picked up in the street where he threw the parcel; one of the watchmen picked up the small gimblet; I took seven watches out of his body coat pocket, and many buckles and buttons, and many things, I do not know what they were, out of every pocket belonging to him; we saw him pull out whole strings of gold rings, out of his breeches pockets, and fling them in the ashes or any where.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. What kind of light had you when you pursued him? - It was not moonlight, it was a brightish sort of a morning, but I was so nigh him that my eyes was never off him.</p>
               <p>You was extremely flurried? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the bundle you picked up the same bundle you saw under his coat? - I am sure of it.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300075"/>How are you sure? - Because I saw him throw it away.</p>
               <p>You saw him throw away a bundle, but how do you know it was that bundle? - I saw it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Did you take notice of it after it was picked up? - No.</p>
               <p>Then how can you positively venture to say it was the bundle that you saw with that man before, was there any other man in the street at the time he was taken? - I do not think there was any but watchmen.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman, I helped to take this man, I came out of Bishopsgate-street; I saw him stopped by Joseph Bateman, and I came to assist.</p>
               <p>You know no more of it I suppose? - Yes, I staid with him in the watch-house; and I saw him put his hand into his pocket, and pull out a handful of silver buckles and spoons, and a second time a bunch of gold rings, and some loose ones, and a third time some more, and another bunch, and threw them down upon the cinders; and I picked some of them up, and threw them into the bundle along with the rest: They were all put into the bundle.</p>
               <p>- MUNDAY sworn.</p>
               <p>I have not the bundle; by order of the Lord Mayor, the things were delivered to Mr. Delaforce; they were first delivered to me in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>You received all the goods at the watch-house? - I carried them to my Lord Mayor.</p>

               <p>And there you delivered them to Mr. Delaforce, and an inventory was taken? - He insisted on his money; he said it was his property, he turned out into my hand four pounds ten shillings in silver, I observed he had three rings on his fingers, I insisted on having them, at last he pulled them off.</p>
               <p>Have you brought any of the rings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(Produces them.)</p>
               <p>This was the handkerchief they were tied up in; I delivered four pounds ten shillings to Mr. Delaforce by order of my Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Repeat to me what things you have? - Here are three bunches of gold rings, two punch ladles, and three rings that were on his fingers, one set with stone, and two plain.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know these three articles came out of that bundle? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Delaforce. Can you swear to any one of these articles? - I swear to them all, there is a poesy on each of the single rings, that I can swear to them by.</p>
               <p>How do you know the bunches? - I can<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300076"/> swear to them by putting them off and on some times.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you swear to plain gold rings by putting on and off? - By the maker's name in them, the maker that I employed.</p>
               <p>Court. Are they all of your own make? - No. Sir.</p>
               <p>Is there any of the rings of the bunch that you can swear to? - This stone ring, this morning ring set with stones, that is in the bunch.</p>
               <p>Court. As to the punch ladles? - I can swear to them, by a sixpence and a shilling of Queen Anne, and King George, that is in them.</p>
               <p>Court. Is not that a common thing for punch ladles? - I had them made myself.</p>
               <p>Is it a part of your business to sell new plate? - New, as well as old.</p>
               <p>Was there any other part of the bundle of goods that were delivered to you, that you knew to be your property? - Yes, there are the watches, because I had all the maker's names put down in a book.</p>
               <p>What else could you swear to, take the inventory in your hand and look over it? - I should not do any injustice, to swear to the whole, but I would be very careful what I did in such a thing as this, the goods have been in my possession so long that I could swear to them all.</p>
               <p>Court. Tell me of the articles that you are sure of? - The watches, the rings, the punch ladles, and the candlesticks.</p>
               <p>Can you swear that you lost out of your shop, as many articles as correspond with those that you found afterwards in the bundle? - Yes, my Lord, and more, I lost seven table spoons and many other things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Were all the articles that you have enumerateed in your possession the preceeding day? - They were at night when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Were they all contained in the bundle that was found? - They were all in the bundle that was found by the watchman, except two plain rings, and one stone one that were on his fingers, all that was in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner's Council. Ask the man who can tell you, I do not want to stop the question.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. My Lord, here is evidence to prove that this man was seen to pick the bundle up, which amounts to nothing, if any of the things that were in the bundle were found on his person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. While you was at the watch-house, was the things that you found on that person, any of them put in the bundle? - The rings in particular, were kept separate in the bundle.</p>
               <p>Yes, but some things that Mr. Delaforce has sworn to? - Yes.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was at Kingsland-road to see a gentleman, a master taylor; I was at dinner with him, we had something to drink, which got into my head, I slept at his house, as I had some money about me; I desired him to call me at three in the morning, which he did, and in coming along in my way home, I picked up a bag with a handkerchief tied to it, and I carried it in my hand; for the distance of twelve or fourteen yards; upon which, finding it too heavy to carry in my hand, I took and swung it over my shoulder; then the handkerchief being undone, the things came out, and I laid down the bag, and put what came out of the handkerchief into my pockets; and so tied the handkerchief up; one of the watchmen came up to me, and asked what I had, I told him I had found something, but did not know what it contained, he run after me again, I was very willing to shun him, for fear he should strike me, and so I dropped the bag; I have seen the gentleman that saw me pick up the bag, he heard that I was in the Poultry Compter, so he came and asked me my name, and how I came by the bag; I asked him his name, and I gave it to my friends: If the laws of England will find a man guilty for picking up a thing in the street, I am guilty, otherwise I am as innocent as the child that is unborn.</p>

               <p>Court. Where do you live? - I live in Houndsditch, I know the prisoner no further only when I saw him pick up the bundle, and when I saw him in the Compter.</p>
               <p>When did you see him pick up the bundle? - On the 7th of April, on Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Where? - It was just close towards the turning down Cock-lane; I was going to turn down Cock-lane.</p>
               <p>From where? - From Hounsditch.</p>
               <p>What time of the day? - To the best of my knowledge half after three in the morning, I saw a bundle before me, and I thought to go to it, and before I could get to it, the prisoner got it, I saw it first, about ten or twelve yards from me, almost close to the curb stone; and before I could get it, the prisoner at the bar had the advantage of me.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by that? - He was coming to meet me, and he laid hold of the bundle; says I to him my friend you have got the start of me, he said, I suppose somebody or other will own this bundle, and if they do not says he, I shall advertise it: I said, to him where do live, says he, I can tell you, my name is Lewis, I lodge at one Mrs. Sheen's in Shakespear's-walk, Shadwell; and if you should hear any body enquire after it, I should be glad; I went about my business towards Cock-lane to call my men up to work; I parted with him, he went towards Bishopsgate-street as far as I could observe, and I went down Cock-lane to call the people, I had several men to call up to do my business.</p>
               <p>What business? - In our Passover cakes.</p>
               <p>Do they work for you? - Yes, I employ many men at that time, eight or ten to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300078"/> make biscuits for my own people, we are obliged to make them early and late, I was telling some of my work folks, says I, if I had been a little sooner I should have found a bundle in the street, but what it was I could not tell, the next day I heard there was a man committed to the Compter; I went there to enquire after him, I told him if I can be of any service I will, for I am the man that saw you pick up the bundle, he sent his friends to me to be so good as to serve a man in his situation, which I would be glad to do, be he Jew or Gentile.</p>
               <p>What kind of a bundle was it you saw him pick up? - I cannot tell whether it was a bag or not, it was a sort of a darkish bundle.</p>
               <p>What size might it be? - I cannot tell, I did not take so much observation, as I was going about my own business, it was a good sizeable bundle; I think it was this length, ( about half a yard,) in a sort of dark thing, a cloath or such like.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you no curiosity to know what was in his bundle? - No, my Lord, I was very late in my business, I could not stay, I had business more material.</p>
               <p>Did not you think you had some little claim? - I thought it might have dropt out of some country cart, something, I could not tell what.</p>
               <p>Is not there a notion among you, that if any thing is found, that all those that are present are to divide it among them? - I know nothing at all about that.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell this man that you was to have half? - No.</p>
               <p>You are a very disinterested man to let this man carry off the bundle? - I was too belated in my own business.</p>
               <p>How long had you known him before? - I never saw the man before he picked up the bundle, and once in the Compter, I never made any enquiry about it, I gave him my directions.</p>
               <p>You have a good memory? - I must, my business require a good memory; it does indeed.</p>
               <p>How was the prisoner dressed that morning? - Not as he is now to be sure, I do not know how he was dressed, he had a sort of a great coat on, that I am pretty positive of.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing of any gimblets or iron crows. - No.</p>
               <p>Do you deal in silver as well as biscuits? - No, never, no man can ever say, I ever bought any silver.</p>
               <p>And did you really never see this man before? - No, my Lord, never.</p>

               <p>Court. Had you a candle? - No, I do not recollect that I had; one of the men told her he had got some stuff, whether it was old or new, I cannot say, and she asked them whereabout it was, and he said hard by, and she bid him work away for she was not afraid, and then the man said some words, which I do not recollect, she said it is not time yet, sit down you can do nothing yet, I will tell you when to go; then they sat down; the man said, there was another, she said, where, he said at the door; she said, call him in, for our watermen are at work, nothing can be done just yet, a pot of beer was standing on the table, which we had for supper, she bid them drink; a chandler's shop being next door, I went out for some snuff, and when I returned I saw three men; she did not much like her neighbours hardly, and she was very angry with me, because I went without her leave, and when I came back, she bid me go to bed: I left the three men sitting there, and saw them no more that night; there was a young woman lodged in the house, I cannot tell her name.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Warrickshall. I deal in the shipping, this woman washed for me five years, she threw herself on our parish, and I took her in out of charity, I deal in the smuggling way; I did not care to trust her; the watermen go to work of a night on board of the ships; I had a property of India goods.</p>
               <p>Witness. You could not trust me because you used to buy so many stolen goods.</p>
               <p>(Looks at Boyle.)</p>
               <p>That is the last man that came in, he came in while I was at the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I kept her for three weeks, she was drunk every night.</p>

               <p>Do you know the prisoner Boyle? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You know Mr. Perry and Hankey's warehouse where the yarn was kept? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Tell us what you and the prisoner have done? - The Monday night, I cannot tell the day of the month, but it was the night before we were taken up, we went there about eight o'clock, and going in we found a parcel of new yarn; there was Boyle and Sulivan, we cut about nine bundles, either eight or nine I cannot say rightly which, when we had made them up, we brought them about half way to her house, and left them in the marshes, all but one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300084"/> parcel, and we took one of the parcels to bring to her house, to get two or three shillings, we was stopped by the way, there were two or three men, I forget their names, they were coming after either, Sulivan or Boyle dropt the bundle, and as the two men were coming after, one of them picked it up, I asked them why they dropped the bundle, they said, they were afraid, says I, you ought to have walked on with it, we came to Mrs. Warrickshall, and I went in, the other staid out, she asked me what it was as I had no parcel, then I told her, I had got some stuff, she asked me where it was, and I told her, it was hard by; and she told me then to work away, I told her that would not do, then I told her what it was, in telling her what it was, she said, it was rather to soon, and bid me set down, and she would tell me when it was time.</p>
               <p>Was any body with her then? - There was her son, and a niece, and her girl, and another young body, and a sailor in a blue jacket, a lodger, I believe I staid there till between eleven and twelve, she desired me to tell them to come in, but they came in without calling, when it was time she told us to go off, and if we did not go off at that time we might be hobbled, because the watermen were going to work at the shipping to smuggle some goods, then we went where the yarn was, and we brought a bundle a piece, and we threw it off our shoulders down into the cellar.</p>
               <p>Who opened the door? - I believe the door was upon the latch or half open, I was the first that went in of the three.</p>
               <p>Did any body come to the door? - I cannot tell, I went right in with the bundle.</p>
               <p>Was either of them stopped at the door? - Never a one.</p>
               <p>Did you bring any more bundles that night? - Yes, Sir, we brought two more, Boyle and I.</p>
               <p>When you brought these two bundles, was any body at the door then? - No one at all.</p>
               <p>Who went in first? - I went in first.</p>
               <p>Did any thing pass about Boyle? - The second time Boyle was stopped in the entry.</p>
               <p>Who stopped him? - As I could find out, he was stopped by one Smith.</p>
               <p>What did you do with these bundles? - Throw them down into Mrs. Warrickshall's cellar, as we went along Boyle says, here is a man following us, upon which I said, come on, and the man laid hold of Boyle at the door and turned him round; we staid there about an hour; we told Mrs. Warrickshall, and she bid us stop a bit, I told her Boyle had told me he was stopped; she asked me if I could shew her the house, and she said, she would go along with me, I shewed her, and she said, it was one Smith; there was no fear, but to go on; she and I came back to the house, and coming back I called Boyle out, and I asked him to come along, and as we passed Smith's, he laid hold of Boyle, and called out to another young fellow named Smith; this young fellow laid hold of Boyle, and the other laid hold of me.</p>

               <p>Do you verily believe this to be the man? - Undoubtedly, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Have you no doubt? - I have no manner of doubt, I perfectly recollect that to be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300085"/> the man, I conversed with him at the door, and seeing him so short a time after I knew him again; I felt the yarn, and saw it by the light of the candle that the girl had in her hand.</p>
               <p>PRISONER WARRICKSHALL's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>In the first place I ask the prosecutor Mr. Hankey, which I look at now, whether it was dark or light, it was half after eleven, I was sitting up for a lodger, every body was in bed in my house; I heard Mr. Hankey and one Mr. Govey, a ship-broker, in the street about half after eleven, and goes to the door hearing their tongues. Hearing Mr. Hankey making mention of an old rope that had been stolen, and that I had it, God bless me, Sir, says I, have you any suspicion Mr. Hankey, are you sure that I keeping an old rope shop, have got it, come in says I; and he turns to Govey, and he says something to Mr. Govey in a high stiled manner, which I cannot rightly tell you the words; but meaning if he came in I should hurt them; I never saw the property, or ever had it from the top of the house to the bottom, Mr. Hankey searched, I had not a bit of new stuff in my house; there is old stuff, about five or six hundred weight.</p>
               <p>Court to Hankey. Was it a dark or light night? - I think it was light enough.</p>
               <p>- HANKEY sworn.</p>
               <p>You was at the prisoner's house that night, was you Sir? - I was.</p>
               <p>Was it so dark that a person could not distinguish perfectly? - I think it was not dark, because I could very well distinguish her, when she stood at the door, she came to me, and asked me several times to come in, and said, I beg Mr. Hankey you will, for you will catch cold; I told her my business was in the street, and there I chose to stand.</p>
               <p>Jury. What time of night was that? - That was about one, I was not called till half after twelve.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Warrickshall. After I came to Newgate, Lane pushed away from the officer, and got up a chimney.</p>
               <p>Lane. There was no commitment.</p>

               <p>I am Bailiff to the Duke of Northumberland, I reside at Sion House; on the morning of the seventh of March, I found some poultry was stolen, there was a ladder found adjoining to the garden wall, I searched some suspicious houses in the neighbourhood, I found nothing there, the next day I procured a search warrant, to search the house of

             M'Doughall, I saw Mrs. Ward his partner; he confessed they were partners upon his examination.</p>
               <p>Where is that house? - In the narrow part of Holborn, I asked for some ducks, the constables went immediately into the house, I remained in the shop till Mr. Newport and the constable called me into the yard, to look at a bird that was in the coop, with three birds; I looked, and I did not think it belonged to his Grace; we went into the cellar to search that, I found nothing of that kind in the cellar; the constable desired Mr. Newport to go up stairs for fear the woman should play some tricks; he called to me to go up stairs, and in the back room of the first floor there was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300086"/> window opened; and this bird standing upon the tiles of a shed, I knew the bird, he has been under my direction these seven years, there is no artificial mark only his natural colour, I am sure of the bird; the prisoner said, she never saw the bird in her life before, and did not know how it came there.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was she when you came into the room? - She was in the room with Mr. Newport, the constable insisted upon it the bird had been in the room, there was a feather in the room, and he picked up a feather that belonged to a pea-fowl.</p>
               <p>Do these birds stray much from their own homes? - They every night go to roost, and as soon as he was set down he went to roost regularly, if he had been a stranger, they would not have permitted him to have remained among them, for we have many.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. There was another fine peacock at this house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You took that away, you thought that was the Duke's? - I said, it might possibly be his, I could not tell, I was desired by the magistrates at Bow-street to take it down, to see whether he would go to roost; I had not seen it for three or four days.</p>
               <p>How or by what means it went away you cannot possibly say? - No, only being told.</p>
               <p>When you came to this house who did you enquire for? - For Mr. M'Doughall.</p>
               <p>Whose house is it? - It is Mr. M'Doughall or Ward's, I cannot tell which.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Did he not say he was servant or partner on board a ship? - She said, he was a servant, he said, he was partner.</p>
               <p>You knew nothing of them before, whether they were partners or what situation they were in, you cannot tell? - I never saw either of them before, I did not see him first.</p>
               <p>You say, you saw the peacock standing upon a shed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not that shed belong to another house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it not a distance from that house? - As far as I am from you.</p>
               <p>And as near to the next house, I take it for granted? - I know nothing of the next house.</p>
               <p>You found the bird sitting upon a shed, and you took it away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you not often declared that you did not think that that man stole the peacock at all? - No positive declaration at all, I have declared I did not think he was guilty of the felony of stealing him, if he had, he must have some other accomplice with him.</p>

            , and told him of his loss, and he did not know whom to suspect; Allen astonished at this communication, and feeling his own situation unfortunate and uneasy, as well as the situation of all the other servants, at last on considering the circumstances, thought that the theft must have been committed by the prisoner; he recollected that the prisoner came to Mr. Harford's house, in company with one

Therefore you can have but little doubt, that these suspicions were properly directed towards him: This key, by which he got into this drawer, he obtained in the following manner; in the year 1781, Mr. Harford had broke this key, and intrusted it to his servant, ordering him to go to the person of the name of Noble to have it mended, or a new one made; he did so, but before that time, he carried it to another locksmith, of the name of Powell, and there had a key made, answering in every particular: Gentlemen, after the prisoner was taken up his box was searched, his lodgings were searched, and there were found some things, which are the subject of another indictment. But in order to prove to charge as it is laid in this, I shall produce before you the evidence of the bankers, who sent these notes to Mr. Harford, and the evidence of Mr. Harford, who will tell you that they were secured in that drawer, and afterwards, it will appear to you, that these very bank notes were deposited in the house of Harris and Co. by the prisoner himself; gentlemen if these notes are fully proved to you, then there will remain, but little doubt as I apprehend, that the prisoner is guilty of the crime, imputed to him, and there will also remain as little doubt of what will be the event of your verdict.</p>

               <p>I live in St. James-street, the prisoner came to me while I was at Oxford, and lived with me six years; in October last, there was some dispute between us, and he was rather impertinent, and I discharged him.</p>
               <p>Do you remember in May last, that you had drawn upon your banker for some money? - I cannot say to the particular time.</p>
               <p>Was it before June? - It was.</p>
               <p>Who were the bankers Messrs. Hanbury and Co. Lombard-street, I drew for 400 l. I gave a draft for 400 l. particularly desiring that it might be in 20 l. bank notes, I never take any account of my bank notes; I put them all into a pocket book, and fling them into an iron chest, which stands in the room, the key of the iron chest I put into a drawer with other things, out of which drawer the money was since taken.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was the drawer? - In a writing table that stands in my dressing room, I did not want the money immediately, and I take it, it was very near a fortnight before I discovered that some of the notes were missing, I had taken some of these bank notes out twice, and the third time taking of some out, I discovered some were missing.</p>
               <p>Did you communicate your loss to any body? - I told Mr. Needham, I spoke of it to nobody else, I lost seven twenty pounds bank notes.</p>
               <p>When you discovered the loss, there were several of the notes remaining? - On Saturday I took out 100 l. and on the Sunday; I put the pocket book in my pocket, and then it was the third time, coming to take money out that there was a deficiency.</p>
               <p>You counted the bank notes, when Mr. Needham delivered them to you? - I counted them then.</p>
               <p>How long after this was it, that your servant staid with you? -

             the October following.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the circumstance of the lock of this drawer being broke? - I recollect it particularly, in was in 1781, I was going to open my drawer, and the key broke, and soon after I turned the table topsy turvy, and cut out the bottom of it, as there were many things in it; I bought the lock myself, and desired the prisoner to take it to the maker, who was Noble at Charing-cross, to have a new key; it was a length of time before the lock was put on, and I believe it laid some time in the drawer.</p>
               <p>In October last, the prisoner was discharged, had he taken away his things? - I supposed he did then, in September last, I took some money in bank post-bills, I paid him with one of them, a ten pound note, and he told me he had lost it, the consequence<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300089"/> was, he was to apply to the bank to get this money, I do not know what difficulty they make in payment of money in this way, but he said, he could never get it, and one morning he came to me, and he said, Sir, I am not able to get this money, I told him, I would apply to the bank, about getting the money for him, that was the only time when I saw him after he left me.</p>
               <p>Can you tell us, whether you drew for such a sum as 400 l. at any time near to that? - certainly drew for that sum only once, therefore, the banker's books will tell you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. If I understand you right, the prisoner was not turned away for any ill behaviour of his own? - It was for a piece of impertinence.</p>
               <p>You did not take the numbers or description of the bank notes? - I never do.</p>
               <p>I suppose you gave him money to pay bills? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you put your hand in the drawer, and gave sometimes notes and sometimes cash? - He kept a book, in which he entered every thing, and I used to pay him at the end of the week, which generally run to five or six pounds, and sometimes more.</p>

               <p>Why, in the same day we have seen notes of the same number? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Will you say, that they have not given them out? - No, it is no business of mine; I should suppose, that they have a number of letters g iven them, for those particular dates, and I suppose the year following, they give them other letters.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any person from the bank here, I want to ask, whether there is any sort of time as a general calculation how long bank notes go in circulation.</p>

               <p>I live in Piccadilly, opposite Bond-street, I am an ironmonger.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - I should not have known him, if I met him in the street, but when he was examined at Bow-street, he said, he lived with Mr. Harford, and he said, he bought a key at my shop, I think he said, it was in November, about the year 1781; he said, a key was bespoke.</p>

               <p>What did he say more relative to the key, at Bow-street? - He said that he bespoke it he believed on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Needham. Did the prisoner after he was taken into custody, deliver any key to you? - When I went into the room as usual, I found the servant Allen, standing between the prisoner and the door, and Mr. Harford was there; he said, this is the gentleman that has robbed my drawers; I asked him, how he could do such a thing against his master, and where the key was, that he made use of, he said it was in his pocket, and he gave it to me immediately; I have the key now; I saw Mr. Harford try it himself, and it opens the drawer as well as his own.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. I thought the drawer was left half open? - Mr. Harford had another key which he made use of, but he tried this key.</p>
               <p>Court. And did it open it very readily and easily? - Yes, my Lord, as easy as his own.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council to Mr. Harford. You did not suspect him before this time? - No, I did not, I had a good opinion of him.</p>

               <p>After the judge had summed up the evidence, the prisoner said, I expected my Council would have spoken for me, otherwise I would have spoken myself; my book of accounts that Mr. Harford has got, will sufficiently shew that I have received at different times, by different bills, sums to the amount of fifty pounds; besides at other times, Mr. Harford has frequently sent me to get change for notes, which I look upon it will fully answer every thing that is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300092"/> alledged against me; another thing, Mr. Harford has frequently left his own key in his drawer, from the time he has dressed; another thing, Mr. Harford's pocket book, has layed for one or two days in a coat, that he has thrown off, frequently, not once or twice; with notes in it; and Mr. Harford has never missed it: I have searched his coat pockets, and brought him his pocket book, with notes in it; his present servant,

               <p>(The Book handed up to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>Court.

               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Harford frequently gave me notes to change, and I changed them for him, therefore, these notes must be in my possession.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, you will take this with you, that Mr. Harford accounts for these twenty 20 l. bank notes.</p>

             I thought wanted a horse, he asked me to go with him, I went with him facing the gentleman's house, I told him, I knew Mr. Weston, says he take the horse, and get what you can for him, I said, I should rather he would go in along with me, he said no, get what you can, but do not take less than a guinea; I went in, Mr. Weston said, he did not know that he wanted such a one, then he said, he would give me a guinea, I went out to the door, and told Wood, and he said, let him have it, I went into Mr. Weston again, and told him of it, when he came out to look at the horse again, the horse was gone, Wood had taken him away, I went round the corner, and there was Wood with him in his hand, I took the money and gave it to him, and told him I was going home, I was to get up in the morning to drive the team; the second day they came to me as I was driving the cart in St. Giles's, and told me about the horse, and I was taken up then, I sent for my wife, and I sent for Wood, and he was not at home, his wife said, he was at Smithfield, and she went again the next morning at twelve o'clock, he did not come home, about a fortnight after he sent for his wife, and took her away: I never was in any confinement before.</p>

               <p>Court to Weston. He has mentioned two circumstances, one is, that upon your biding him a guinea, he went out out to find Wood? - I recollect his going out to the door, but I did not hear him mention any other man at that time.</p>
               <p>What did he go out of the door for? - I cannot tell what it was, I thought it was affecting to go away.</p>
               <p>Court. Another thing, he says, that the horse was at the door, and when he came out he was gone round the corner? - The first time it was at my door, he went out and said, he would not take the money, he came in again and said, I believe you may as well have him; then the horse was out of sight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300094"/> tied to the rails going down Gray's-Inn-lane.</p>

               <p>I met this man between four and five, he asked me to drink, he went first into the King's head, he called for a pint of beer, and then he came to the Falcon's-head, and he had three pints of beer, he said, he had lost some money down in the city, he paid for the three pints of beer, he pulled out his watch, and said, you go and get me half a guinea upon it, and the pawnbrokers was not up, and I gave it to this young woman, and she delivered it up.</p>
               <p>PRISONER BRIDGET's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was in this public house drinking, I had a pint of purl, and was going home, and this young woman called after me, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300095"/> said, will you go to the pawnbroker's with me, I want to pawn something that the man has given me, so she gave me the watch in my hand, I had no pocket on, and I put it in my bosom, and the watchman came and took it out.</p>
               <p>Court to Mitchell. Was you drunk or sober? - Why, Sir, I had been drinking a little, but I was not drunk at that time.</p>
               <p>You said, you came into that house by yourself? - I did.</p>
               <p>Had you been at any other house? - I was in the Hope, by Cheapside, I was not at the King's-head, I was not in company with Margaret but in that house.</p>
               <p>Did you come into that house with her? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. The circumstance of privacy seems to be personal, to the person that commits the fact, and that of the person who is present, aiding, and assisting, is guilty of the felony, yet as it depends very often upon the personal dexterity, it might not be fit perhaps to punish the person who means to be aiding and assisting in the general offence of stealing, with the same severity therefore the rule has been, to confine it to the individual hand tha t commits the fact; therefore, if it cannot be said, that both the prisoners were guilty of the private stealing, it is the safest way to acquit them altogether of the criminal charge.</p>

               <p>Court. What is the authority under which you pay the seamen? - The husbands of the ships make up the accounts, and return them to me; I pay by the ledger.</p>
               <p>Court. Therefore of course you could not pay such an order as this, you would treat it as a mere nullity? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>So then if such an order as this was to come to you, unless it was authenticated by the husband, you would not pay it? - No, not unless I have the husband's permission.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. No, my Lord, I told him, I was just returned from the West Indies: I have been at sea all my life, ever since I was eight years old, in the King's service; I was along with Admiral Rodney, at the siege of Martinique, I have been discharged three times from the King's service; I have my arms broke, legs broke, and skull fractured; I entered on board the Zebra sloop, I was picked out by Sir Robert Bickerton; I was pressed by Lord Howe, and went to Gibraltar with him; I was wounded under Sir Roger Curtis; then I came home the latter end of last year, and that person owed me a great deal of money, and I took the note from him, I knew nothing at all that the note was bad.</p>

             was examined but I think there may be a doubt, whether he was legal witness or not, therefore, I rather wished to see the necessary fact proved, in some other way the he was to prove was, that there was no such man board the Royal Charlotte.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, of this case is such, that I the prisoner by saying to is well for him and the that these two witnesses that he talks as it must have ended in his additional guilt of perjury and their being committed by the Court, as it is impossible from the representation, that the prisoner made to, that such account could be true: I should have been very glad to have heard any witnesses to his character, because it is not for me to say, what might have been the consequence of the strong recommendation of character: As to the prisoner uttering the note knowing it to be forged, you see it is an order to him personally according to his representation to Luffnan: The component parts of this charge, seem to be all very directly proved, and therefore, is a bill of exchange or an order for payment of money, (and one of them is certainly is,) there is every circumstance necessary, to constitute this charge sufficiently established before you in evidence; and so established, that if he had attempted to give that kind of evidence to you, that he talked off, it would only have ended in aggravating his crime.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who had known him, one for twenty and the other for thirty years, and each gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen the crime of burglary which is here charged upon the prisoner, consists, either in breaking into a house and actually stealing or breaking into a house with intention to steal; and whether the party has that intention or not is to be collected from the circumstances given before you in evidence, the entering by a false key is as much a breaking, as if he had broke the door all to pieces; this offence must be made out in all its circumstances, in order to constitute a crime at all, being burglary, with intent to steal; the question is, whether he broke into this room in the night time, and it will be a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300099"/> burglary, or not, acording to the intention and view, with which he did it, if he did it with an intention to steal, then it is burglary; it is a case which certainly borders very much upon the point where the offence of burglary begins, and were it one step within, it would not be burglary: It is an offence of a serious nature to the master of this house, for perhaps these kind of burglaries are more serious than those that are more violent; and the extent of the mischief of those more violent ones, is very often much less considerable.</p>

               <p>I am Captain of that part of the patrol, one of the men came to me, and told me they had stopt a suspicious person, when I came they were begining to search him: I searched h im, and in his pockets I found this silver, and that half sixpence; that seal, the knife, the gimblet, and all these halfpence and farthings, they have been in my custody ever since, he said, they weresent his by friends out of the country, I found a letter in his pocket, which was dated the 21st of April, and that was but the 27th, and if they sent them, I thought they would have mentioned them in the letter, and it is impossible for two waggons to come up from Burton upon Trent, where he said, they came from in that time: he said, they were sent to him to make use of: he said, he worked at Mr. Wyatt's in Oxford-road, I called there the next day, and he had left it some time, I took him before Sir Sampson Wright, and he was committed for further<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300100"/> examination, he them informed Sir Sampson that he found them in a field near Kilburn Wells.</p>
               <p>(The broken sixpence deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court to Allen. That was amongst the things found on the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What things did you lose out of the bar? - There was a bag the size of this, that had above a guinea and an half of good halfpence, and there were five papers of bad halfpence, tied up in five shilling papers. I believe there was 16 or 17 s. in farthings.</p>
               <p>You do not recollect exactly the quantity of farthings that were in your bag? - We never tell them.</p>
               <p>Do you know the bag? - This bag I will venture to say is the same.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of it? - Canvas is a thing one cannot swear to, there is no mark on it, the size is exactly the same.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing else you lost? - Nothing but bad silver; there was a five shilling piece found in his pocket, and I remember I had one in my cupboard; but I cannot swear to it: the seal I have some knowledge of, I was left trustee to a little girl, and this was amongst some little toys of hers, but I cannot swear to it; the little girl is dead.</p>

               <p>I was walking in the fields on Sunday morning by Kilburn Wells early, and I found these things in the field in the foot road; I have no witnesses, I have not been long in town.</p>
               <p>(The sixpence handed to the Jury).</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. The time that the prosecutor found his house broke open, was between six and seven; now it is good day light, at half past four; therefore you see there were two hours or near it, from day break to the time, in which this fact must have been committed, therefore to be sure the evidence is not direct as to the time in which it was committed: if it was commited after day-light in the morning, it is not in point of law a burglary; therefore that circumstance certainly leaves some latitude to you in the consideration of that part of the charge.</p>

               <p>Court. Do you remember the prisoner ever coming to your shop? - I do, on Friday the 14th of February, she came into my shop, and enquired for a person in my house, by the name of Mrs. Macglougal, and asked for some silk stockings; she was in company with another woman, she bought one pair for nine shillings, and paid me; she then asked for lace, I shewed her some, the other sister said, sister you want lace, after she had asked for it; and the prisoner desired me to cut off a yard and a half, and it was paid for out of a guinea; before this time a third woman knocked at the door, nobody was in the shop belonging to it but me, the third woman asked for some

            , and muslin, she likewise bought one yard of muslin, and gave me another guinea to change, rather before the third woman was served, a fourth woman came in and enquired for Lenno, she said, as I was very busy she would go to the next door, and return in a quarter of an hour; to the best of my recollection, the two first women went away, rather after the last woman went away, then there came in a fifth woman, enquiring as before, and she gave a guinea to change; my maid was sent out three or four times to change guineas; the 4th woman bought something, during the time they were there, I went out of the shop to speak to a lady in her carriage.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner there then? - I think not, the lady wished to come out, I begged her not, as I had so many people, I did not wish her to mix with them, and would wait on her; then I went to dinner, after dinner I missed the two pieces of muslin, one twelve yards and three quarters, the other nine yards, and nine pair of silk stockings.</p>
               <p>Court. Were the stockings you lost, the the same sort you sold the prisoner? - No, those I lost cost me ten shillings and sixpence a pair, they were womens stockings; they were never untied; I went to Bow-street, and my loss was advertised, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300103"/> prisoner was described and nobody appeared; I was desired if I saw the parties again to let them know; and on or about the 24th of March, a person whom I suspected to be one of the women came into my shop again, and enquired for muslin, I told her I could not possibly shew her such muslins as she wanted, for when I did the last time, I was considerably robbed, I told her the best thing she could do was to go out of my shop; at that time the prisoner knocked at my door, the prisoner then said, why did you leave me sister, I could not think where you was gone; I said, madam, as to you I know you perfectly well, you was the first person that came into my shop the day I was robbed; I mentioned the articles which she asked for, and the person; and I taxed her with the things, and told her I was clear it was her; she said she never was in the shop before, nor knew any such person; I told her my loss had been very great that day, that I did not suppose the parties who robbed me knew the value of what they took from me, I begged her if she was innocent to assist me in getting back some of my property, she then offered to go with me to the woman who was with her the time before; and asked me if my silk stockings had not Paris marked on each pair ofthem; which is a way that they have here; I told her they had.</p>
               <p>Court. Had the stocking she bought the Paris mark on them? - No, she said it was a shoe-maker's wife in a court in the Strand, that was that day with her, and she offered to go with me; but denied that she was her sister: she said she had no sister in the world, but that in the shop, and she had not been more than a month in London herself; I again intreated her to go with me to this other woman, she then refused, but said she would leave me a direction, I told her that did not at all satisfy me, and begged she would stay and let me advise with a neighbour; I sent my shop-woman for a neighbeur; after my shop-woman was gone for the neighbour, she and the sister expressed great uneasiness to be gone; and said the person stayed very long; during the time my woman servant came up into the shop and staid, for I desired her to wait as I might want her presently; they both expressed so much uneasiness to be gone that I was afraid, I went out myself and fastened the door after me, I left the women with my servant maid, and while I was gone the prisoner jumped out of the window over the rails; my servant was there, the prisoner's sister remained in the shop, I returned, my shop-woman came back exceedingly flurried, and said the prisoner had jumped out of the window, but presently we heard she was taken and carried to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever find any of your things again? - No, my Lord, I was told it was needless to search her lodgings so long after, but she refused to tell where she did live that day; I believe her lodgings we researched some time before.</p>
               <p>Court. But you never found any of your stockings on her? - No.</p>
               <p>You say she refused to tell where her lodgings were? - Yes, that was the time when she was taken to Bow-street before the magistrates.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. How many people were in the shop when you went to the coach? - Three.</p>
               <p>The parcel of stockings where the prisoner bought a pair from, was not the one that you lost? - No, the parcel of stockings that I lost, the string had never been untied.</p>
               <p>On the 24th of March, it was that you saw this woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that is the same woman? - Very clear, I think the first woman was one of the party.</p>
               <p>Have you ever learned the other woman's name? - Yes, her name was Lawrence, she lived at No. 6, Grosvenor Mews.</p>
               <p>When did you learn where the prisoner lodged? - On the 18th of February.</p>
               <p>You did not see her the second time, till the 24th of March? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So that three or four days after these<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300104"/> stockings were lost, you knew where she lodged? - Yes, the apartments of a Mr. Watmore was searched, but she was out.</p>
               <p>Well, that Mrs. Watmore is the prisoner? - Yes, no property of mine was brought there.</p>

               <p>I live with Mrs. Forbes, the prisoner came into the shop on the 24th of March, when I was in the shop, and asked for some muslin, the same as a bit that hung in the window, and Miss Forbes knew her, and told her when she was in the shop before she missed a piece, with several other things, at first she denied ever being in the shop before, but Miss Forbes insisted on it, then she said, if she had ever been in the shop before it had been very much altered, for the counter was turned towards the wall, and the goods were upon a little round table.</p>
               <p>Court to Miss Forbes. Had the shop been altered? - The counter was turned round after I had been robbed, and stood against a wall.</p>
               <p>Miss Holmes. She offered to give Miss Forbes a direction to the person that came with her, Miss Forbes not approving of that, sent me to a neighbour, one Mr. Christie that she wished to advise with, in the mean time, as I was returning from the neighbours, I met the prisoner in another street, and asked her what hurry, she said, she had left her sister, and would be back in a few minutes; there was one woman left in the shop, I know nothing further but what Miss Forbes has told us.</p>

               <p>What do you know respecting Mrs. Read, about the stockings? - I know nothing at all about the stockings, she is a mantua-maker, and does plain-work for me, I live at No. 6, in Grosvenor-mews, which is almost opposite to this good woman; she charged me with the felony first; I went into the shop to ask her the price of a bit of muslin that hung in her window, and she told me I had stole a piece of muslin; she searched my lodgings and found nothing; I have known the prisoner these three or four years, I cannot positively tell to a small trifle of time; my husband is a chimney sweeper and nightman, he has lived there 9 years, and works for all Old Bond-street.</p>
               <p>What is the character of the prisoner? - I never heard any thing against her in my life, but being a very honest, industrious, sober woman; she has done a great deal of needle work for me.</p>
               <p>Court. You did go and buy some muslin, there on the 14th of March? - I never was up the gentlewoman's steps before the 31st of March.</p>
               <p>How are you so particular in the day? Because it was the day before the first of April, that I went into her shop.</p>

               <p>Court. At that time the prisoner said, sister, why did you leave me? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You have heard the account he has given of himself? - Yes, about a fortnight ago coming up Oxford-road, I met the prisoner and another man, conversing about a pair of pistols, I knew the prisoner, and he knew me, he asked me how I did, and he asked me, to lend him half a guinea, I said, I had not a half a guinea, he said, it was to purchase a pair of pistols, I mentioned the impropriety of his buying pistols, and asked him what use he had for them, he said, to get something by them; I had not half a guinea, I let him have five shillings, and a guinea he had, he gave to the man; we went as far as Wardour-street, he apologized for the liberty of borrowing the money of me, and he said, I might want the money, and he would pledge the pistols for a guinea; he returned in about a minute, and gave me the five<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300110"/> shillings; I have not seen him from that time till yesterday.</p>
               <p>How happened you to see him then? - Passing by the Sessions-yard yesterday, I read in the bill of indictments his name, and enquired about him, and found he was in confinement, I directly enquired for him.</p>
               <p>Did you know him to be the same man, by seeing

             in the list? - I can swear to him.</p>
               <p>That I do not doubt, how came you to suspect that by the name, it was your friend? - I made bold to enquire, I did not five minutes before, know that he was in custody.</p>
               <p>It was a very lucky thing that you happened to enquire for him? - I knew his father and mother, and had been there several times.</p>
               <p>Where did they live? - They have lived in several places, they lived in St. James's place, then in Clarge's-street Piccadilly, and the last in Park-street.</p>
               <p>How long ago? - That was seven or eight months, they live now in Mount-street.</p>
               <p>You do seem to know them all very well, as you know them so well, of course they knew you very well? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They know that you are the son of this man, that lives here in Fleet-market, clerke to Mr. Price? - There was their daughter, was apprentice to a milliner that lodged in my master's second floor, through that, I became acquainted with their father and mother.</p>
               <p>You never heard any thing of the matter, till by accident you was going by last night? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was ashamed to trouble any of my friends about this affair.</p>
               <p>Court. It is the very thing in the world, to wipe off the stain of such a thing as this; is there any body here that knows you, any person of character here that happens to know you, because it would be very matrial for your character to be well established here? - No, Sir, I believe not.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any body near? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Court to Warre. Did you go before the Justice with the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What account did he give of the pistols there, did he mention his friends name? - Not a word of that, that this young man has mentioned, he said, he gave twenty-five shillings for them.</p>
               <p>Was he asked any questions, whether he had any body that could prove that? - I believe he was not, they know him pretty well there, and for that reason, did not say much to him.</p>
               <p>Court to Warre. What are those pistols worth? - I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>What have you sold them for? - Two guineas.</p>
               <p>Jury. They cost five guineas, they are worth four guineas now.</p>
               <p>Court. It seems very extraordinary that he was not called on, one would have thought the prisoner would have said, there is a young man of undoubted credit, that saw me buy them, and lent me part of the money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The reason of my not knowing where he lived he was out of his time, nor did I know till I asked him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Innocently, my Lord, it was some property that was lost in my company a twelve month ago, a silver tankard that was taken out of the house where I was drinking.</p>

               <p>I must introduce a little story; about the 13th of March last, a genteel dressed looking man knocked at my door, and enquired for lodgings, I had a bill for my first floor on my window, I live in <placeName id="t17830430-55-crimeloc307">Beaufort-buildings Strand</placeName>

               <p>Court. Is that the sword that he dropped in the scuffle? - This is the sword, it has hung in my parlour seven weeks; I am sure of the man, though his dress is changed, his hair and face are the same, but he had on then a scarlet coat.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. What are you? - I have been brought up to the sea.</p>
               <p>What was you? - In the India service, and I have been in the navy, I was midshipman in an Indiaman and in a man of was both, I was in the Worcester Indiaman, and was pressed into the King's service; I happened to fall into the company of this man, and being in want of money I took the sword; my character was never before impeached.</p>
               <p>Jury. What was the King's ship? - The Blenhelm.</p>

               <p>On the 31st of March, about a quarter after eight, the prosecutor told me he had lost his watch, and asked me to go round to the pawnbrokers, I went to several and did not find it, and as we were coming along, I said, let us call at the Black Dog, in St. Giles's, and I saw the prisoner with three girls of the town, and as he came along he pulled up the flap of his waistcoat, and was looking at the seal, I asked him how the watch went he had taken, he said, he had no watch, I pulled it out of his pocket; then he said, he only took it to look at.</p>

               <p>All that I have to say, is, if you will ask whether any one of the gentlemen saw me in the house, or take any box, or whether they can say I was the person that jumped from the wall? - Yes, Sir, I am sure it was him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, it was dark in the evening.</p>
               <p>Court. It is not your interest to make it a dark evening, let me put you in mind of that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I drive cattle from Mile-end turnpike to Smithfield, my mother lives in the country, I am nineteen years of age.</p>
               <p>Court. And already so knowing as to find your way by a ladder into a man's yard.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, it is stealing undoubtedly, if he took that box with intention of carrying it away, as from the nature of the circumstances, if he did take it, it most manifestly was with that intent; the lifting up a window under such circumstances does constitute in law a breaking; there is another thing to be attended to, which is, the indictment charges this to be done at eight at night; that will raise a doubt whether it was not at too early an hour, as the sun does not set till past seven, and it would hardly therefore he that degree of night even in London, to amount to this being in the night time; you will certainly give the turn of the scale in favour of life, when it is the very point to constitute the capital part of the case; there was another offence last night, but that was committed on the 6th of March, therefore night was certainly set in then.</p>

               <p>Court. How came it to your knowledge? - In consequence of those hand bills, and Mr. Nelson's knowing the Jew who bought it, he said, he had seen the prisoner, and was to take some things out of pawn, and if I would go and meet him that day, but I could not; but I saw the prisoner on Easter Tuesday, the 22d in the watch-house, in Fleet-market, he was taken up on suspicion of this robbery, I recollected him immediately, I believed him to be the same man.</p>
               <p>Did you charge him with the fact? - No.</p>
               <p>Was he told in your presence what he was taken up for? - He was examined upon it.</p>
               <p>What answer did he make? - The first time he said, he got the gown of a servant maid that was gone to America, and the last time he said, the Jew did not give him the money for the gown, and he denied having been in our house.</p>

               <p>Court. It is necessary to state, that the attack was made, and the demand of money likewise was made; this indictment only states that the assault was made, and that no demand of money was made, it struck me that this indictment was defective, therefore, I desired to see the indictment and act of parliament; it appears to me that the indictment is bad upon the face of it, for this reason? This is made felony, by the act of parliament of the 7th

            . which was only a misdemeanour before; in order to bring the fact within this act of parliament, the description of the act of parliament, must be fully expressed in the indictment, and accordingly pursued, if not in the very terms of the act, which is always the best and safest way, yet in terms expressing the same purport and effect: If any persons after the 1st of May, shall (then comes the description of the offence,) with any offensive weapon or instrument unlawfully, and maliciously assault, or shall by menaces, or in or by a forcible manner, demand any money, goods, &amp;c. with felonious intent, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>"The offence is in</p>
               <p>"the disjunctive certainly; the construction</p>
               <p>"is this, if any person shall assault, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>"or shall by menaces, or in and by a for cibl'</p>
               <p>"and violent manner, demand any monies.' It seems to me, to be indispensably necessary in an indictment on this act, to lay the whole fact, and either to charge, that the assault was made with an offensive weapon, or that money was demanded, one or the other; but not both. The word or seems to be necessary to this act of parliament: The indictment has not laid it with an offensive weapon, therefore it is clearly necessary that by menaces, he did demand money or &amp;c. the indictment states, that he made an assault, without stating it to be with an offensive weapon, and that he did menace with intent to rob; I am of opinion that this indictment cannot be supported, but as it is an offence of some consequence to the public, and both the Judges are up stairs, I will send a short note up to them, to know if their opinion concur with mine: The shortest way will be to send up the indictment, and act of parliament, in the mean time we will go on with the cause, and the prisoner will have the benefit of it, if the Court are of the same opinion that I am.</p>

               <p>"not a word or we will</p>
               <p>"blow your brains out;" I think more then one of them said it; and the words were repeated: Being so suddenly attacked, I said nothing, but as I recollect very well, that I saw one of them, put his hand to the inside of his coat, as I apprehended to pull out a pistol, or some weapon to present to me. As he fumbled a little, and did not produce a pistol immediately, I seized that moment, and laid hold of two of them, one with either hand and called out, Watch! It occurred to me that they could not instantly destroy me, and that was really the reason, I took that opportunity of making my resistance; when they found themselves held fast, they all joined in attempting to escape, and did not attempt any further violence; the prisoner Jackson was the man, who was longest in my hands, and last of all in my hands, and he set off to run: I pursued him a few steps to the edge of the paving, and as he stept across the kennel, I got a blow at him with this stick, and knocked his hat off, which he left behind: It occurred to me at the moment, if I should pursue this man, and he out run me, I should lose all three, I therefore immediately turned about, knowing that the other could not escape me: By this time a watchman up, I charged him with one of the men, and I took the other: This one who is since admitted an evidence, is the one that the watchman took hold of; I took hold of Randall, he struggled to get from me, finding he could not, he got with his back to the door, where there was a bow window, and he made a motion to let something drop very quietly, he stooped a little to one side, I observed him at the time, and said to him, in terms of very high resentment, being very much provoked, you damned eternal rascal or villain, what is that you are dropping, you are dropping your arms I suppose; upon which, I stooped down and took up this iron bar.</p>
               <p>Court. Was any other weapon found on either of them? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Was any thing else suspicious found on them, when they were searched? - No.</p>
               <p>When was Jackson taken? - About eight days after.</p>
               <p>With respect to Randall, was he ever out of your sight? - I cannot say my face was to him all the time, because I pursued

               <p>Did Randall and the other when you pursued Jackson, stand still? - They did, they waited to see which of us could run fastest.</p>
               <p>Are you equally sure with respect to Jackson, that he was one of the men, understand me right, I mean that you should speak from your own sight and recollection? - He is the man that I had the greatest struggle with, and the best view of, he was under a lamp, and the impression of his countenance was more on my mind, than either of the other two, if I had not apprehended them on the spot.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure he is the same man? - I think I may say, he is with a great deal of clearness; when Justice Hyde sent for me, and told me he was apprehended, I began to write his description; I then desired to be shewn him with others, and I immediately picked him out.</p>
               <p>Then you have no doubt that he is the man? - I have not a doubt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. My Lord, I submit the evidence does not go a jot further than the indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. It does not; and if the indictment had been right, there might have been a doubt, whether this evidence would have supported it; but I am not so clear upon that point as the other; I should leave it to the Jury, whether they would infer a demand from this.</p>

I met two men, and they asked me what was the matter, I saw him very distinct, I have no doubt of his person; the men pursued and took him, they brought him to me to the end of the garden.</p>
               <p>He got out of your sight when he ran? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long might he be out of your sight?</p>
               <p>- Ten minutes, I was close by home, it was opening the garden door.</p>
               <p>Then it could not be ten minutes? - The man spoke to me, and ran across, and asked me what had happened, and I told him.</p>
               <p>How long was he out of your sight from the time he ran away, till he was taken? -</p>
               <p>About 10 minutes, it was moon light.</p>
               <p>How long might he be with you? - A very short time, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he was the man? - Oh yes! his eyes fixed upon me so close, and by the moon, I saw him so fair, that I know him well, it shocks me when I look at him.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect how he was dressed? - No, I think he had brown on, but it was his face I noticed.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any doubt whether it is the same man that was brought back again? - It is the same man I am sure.</p>

               <p>Abroll. Our watch-house is very small, and has no conveniency, and the prisoner desired to go and ease himself, I sent the watchman with him, and he returned; Soliman also asked the same favour, I thought it natural, as this man returned the other would, but he run away from the watchman.</p>

It may be material for you to attend to the description of them, the bank notes that were put into the letter by Mr. Martin, clerk to Mr. Scott and Willis, were No.

             the satisfaction of the Jury by legal evidence, so in statute law; murder and robbery are crimes at common law: Secreting of notes, or stealing them out of letters, is that offence by the statute law, that is to be proved before the Jury by legal evidence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. I have a very respectable authority Mr. Justice Foster.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you should state that authority, I cannot argue it by piecemeals, I cannot go on letting you reply upon me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. It would be presumption in me, my Lord, to say any thing more on the subject, if you do not think the objection forcible.</p>
               <p>Court. I see nothing in the objection.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. I give it up, I can say no more.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Do you wish to say any thing to the Jury, or to leave it in the hands of your Council to examine your witnesses.</p>
               <p>[The Prisoner continued in a constant state of trepidation, and crying during the whole of his tryal.]</p>
               <p>Mr. Akerman. The prisoner says, he submits every thing to his Council and the Court.</p>
               <p>- WATSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I believe you have known the prisoner at the bar many years? - I have known him three years last January.</p>
               <p>Was not he apprentice to you? - He was for five years.</p>
               <p>How long did he stay with you? - Two years, and from January, to the month of May, or till the beginning of June, he did not stay his whole term.</p>
               <p>What was the cause of his leaving you?</p>
               <p>Court. You need not go into that, there is no charge against him for leaving his master.</p>
               <p>Did you ever intrust him? - I intrusted him with sums of money and goods to a great amount, to the amount of two hundred, or three hundred pounds: I never had any reason in the world to repent of the confidence I placed in him, he was an honest dutiful person as ever came into any man's house, and he is the last man I should have supposed to have seen at the bar.</p>
               <p>- EATON sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Little Tower-street, I am master of the academy, he was placed at my academy by a very respectable gentleman of Warwickshire, in the middle of June last, he continued under my care till the October following, he behaved with the greatest rectitude imaginable, nor had I the least reason to suspect his veracity or his honesty.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Mr. Shann. In he course of time you have seen him in his business at the Post-office, how has he behaved? - Very well, he has been about five months, I have no reason to blame his conduct.</p>
               <p>- AUSTIN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a sorter in the Post-office.</p>
               <p>You are of course well acquainted with the prisoner at the bar? - Since he has been in the office there was nothing in his conduct that could lead me to any suspicion of his integrity.</p>
               <p>- EVANS sworn.</p>
               <p>I belong to the Post-office, I am in the inland office, I have known the prisoner at the bar ever since he has been in the Post-office, his behaviour has been very good, he behaved with great propriety.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was you on duty that evening? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. The letters are stamped, f aced, and sorted, and then they come to the roads, and they had all these hands to pass through before they came to the prisoner's hands; therefore his are the last hands.</p>
               <p>Court. No, by no means, they are to be put into the boxes and bags.</p>
               <p>- HIRD sworn.</p>
               <p>I am in the inland office, I have known the prisoner ever since he has been in the Post-office, his conduct during that time has been very good; I never had any reason to suspect him.</p>

               <p>I am a sorter in the inland office, I have known the prisoner ever since he has been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300134"/> in the office, I never saw any behaviour but what was very good, I never had any reason to suspect him at all.</p>
               <p>When the box is full to the slit, is there a possibility of letters being stolen at the outside? - Before the boxes were altered, letters have been taken out of the boxes on the outside.</p>
               <p>Mrs. LEACH sworn.</p>
               <p>I believe the prisoner at the bar lodged at your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was his general behaviour during the time he was at your house? - He always behaved very steady and very sober while he was with me, I never had any reason to blame his conduct.</p>
               <p>Did any of his acquaintance come to visit him at your house? - Sometimes they did, two clerks in the Post-office I understood did.</p>
               <p>Did they come frequently to see him? - I cannot pretend to say how often they were there, but they have been there more than once or twice.</p>
               <p>Did these clerks stay all night at his house at any time? - Yes, they did.</p>
               <p>Can you fix any time when both those clerks laid at the house? - I cannot tell what night.</p>
               <p>Do you know any night? - It was of a Saturday night.</p>

This prosecution is founded on a statute made to protect that grand channel of negotiation, and circulation of property and intelligence in this country, the Post-office; the immense consequence of which to the public you cannot but be apptized of, and to guard against any improper conduct in the officers employed in the Post-office, through whose hands letters inclosing property must often pass; this act of parliament has protected that conveyance by the additional sanction of making it a capital offence, in any person actually employed in the Post-office, to abuse that trust, and to take the opportunity which that employment furnishes, to keep back or rob any of letters sent to that office; this man is proved to have been employed in charging letters, that were to be sent from the Post-office into the country, and the charge upon him is, that he has secreted a certain letter containing amongst others, three particular Bank notes, which are specified in the indictment, which letter was sent by

            , one of the persons to whom this letter inclosing the seven Bank notes was sent, is called, and tells you he lives at Southwold, his partner lives at Wangford, which is within a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300135"/> mile of Southwold, he says, that he and his partner expected a letter inclosing Bank notes, to the amount of 100 l. to come by the post, on the 13th of March, to set out the 10th; he says, he was at his partner's the next day, and there was no letter. Mr. Shann, one of the comptrollers of the Post-office says, the prisoner was properly a letter sorter; but this evening of the 10th of March, he was employed as assistant for the Yarmouth-roads, and he says his business that night was, to charge the letters, and put them into the boxes of the different post towns; he says there was another officer at the same table employed in the same sort of business; he has told you that letters are put into the receiving box, and as soon as it is full it is brought and emptied upon a table, where there are officers called facers, whose business is to stamp these letters, and throw them on their faces; then they are removed after this operation to another table, where those persons that are to charge them, and put them into the different boxes belonging to the different post towns, in order that they may be put into bags, are at work; so that you see every letter goes through different hands, a great number indeed, before it can reach the place of its destination: Mr. Parkin is then called, and he says that there being an account, that this letter had not been received; the 7th of April he was directed to attend, in order to examine the prisoner in case he had come to the office that evening; but he happened not to come, therefore Mr. Parkin was sent to examine the prisoner's lodgings in Great Titchfield-street, No. 40, he found him in the kitchen with Mrs. Leach; he informed him of his business, and desired him to let him have the key of his bureau, he gave him his key without hesitation, he went with him into the room, he opened the bureau with that key, and in a private drawer in that bureau, he found three Bank notes which he produces, and one other Bank note: he says the prisoner made no kind of objection to his making that search. These three notes being produced, it remains to shew you if they are able to do it, in order to make out the charge against the prisoner, that these three notes found in the private drawer of his bureau, are three of the seven notes put into that letter, which was put into the Post-office, on the 10th of March; for this purpose, they call Mr. Martin, who tells you that they correspond in every particular, except that there is a figure of one introduced in every one of them, increasing the number one thousand; he says that figure of one has been added in a different ink, that the alteration is visible, rather an addition than an alteration; that it is visible to have been made at a different time, and with different ink, and it plainly appears where the addition was made, and he has no doubt therefore, but these three Bank notes were originally three of the notes which he put into the letter; and supposing you should be satisfied that there had been an alteration, made since the notes were put into this letter, this would amount to a considerable degree of evidence, to prove that these are the identical notes; but in order to fix it with more certainty, you must be satisfied, and that for that purpose they have called an officer of the Bank to shew you that there cannot be two sets of notes of the same number, and corresponding in all respects as these notes do; because if it was the practice of the Bank to issue a great number of notes, all of the same letter; letter K. for instance, and of the same number and sum; then there being found in this young man's bureau notes with the numbers, letters and sums corresponding with the same numbers, letters and sums upon the notes put in by Martin, would be no proof at all that they were the same; you might as well suppose that one piece of ribbon would be a proof that the maker made no more: they have therefore called an officer in the Bank note office, who is capable of giving you abundant satisfaction on that head; and it does so happen that he is able to carry the evidence beyond the general course of office in the Bank; after telling you that they do not make out more notes than one of the same number, he tells you that one of these notes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300136"/> in particular, which is No.

            11152; he says further, that there could be no such note as that last issued by circumstance of the alteration of the figure, and he giving no account how he came by these notes; that he ought to be by you concluded to be the person that secreted the course of the bank, for they never go beyond the number 10000; therefore there are two reasons to prove that that note must have been made so.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, this is the evidence upon which they rest this prosecution, and you see what the substance of it is, that a letter containing three notes, the description of which you have heard amongst others, having been delivered into the Post-office, upon the 10th of March, and having been in the regular course of business to pass through the hands of several persons and the prisoner's amongst others, as officers acting that evening in the Post-office, that letter did in fact never come to hand, but was lost or embezzled, or secreted by somebody, and there is found in a private drawer of the bureau of the prisoner, in his lodging room, three notes, which they undertake to prove are the identical three notes which were put with others into that letter: then they leave it to you to make the inference as an inference of fact, fairly deducible from that evidence, that the prisoner having by his situation in the Post-office, the opportunity of secreting that letter, the notes contained in that letter being found upon him, with that suspicious circumstance of the alteration of the figure, and he giving no account how he came by those notes; that he ought to be by you concluded to be the person that secreted the letter, and that took the notes out of the letter, because of the apparent impossibility that any body else should have done it.</p>

               <p>It is that sort of presumption from one fact, concluding to another fact, which is ordinarily used in all examinations, and the course of proving facts at this place; and there is no manner of difference whether it be a prosecution at common law, or statute law, because in either case, a fact which constitutes the charge, is to be made out to the satisfaction of the Jury, in the same way by the some course of evidence, without any possible difference; whether they have succeeded in making out the fact to you, is for your judgment.</p>
               <p>The prisoner offers nothing in his defence, he might to be sure, if he had been an innocent man, have shown you how he came by these notes, and how they came to be found upon him; but he has given no account of them: his character is undoubtedly very good one, but the question is, what application has that character in a case where the notes which were put into that letter are found in his possession, and he is not able to give you any account how he came by them, he has called a witness indeed to give an evidence, to insinuate a possibility that the letter might have been brought to him, by two other clerks in the office, and that the notes might have been given to him, or brought to him, and so they might have been found in his bureau; that is the tendency of the evidence of Mrs. Leach. In almost every case that comes before you, there is a strict possibility where the positive fact itself is not proved by witnesses, who saw the fact, there is a strict possibility, that somebody else might have committed it: But that the nature of evidence requires, that Juries should not govern themselves, in questions of evidence, that come before them, by that strictness, is most evident, for if it were not so, it is not possible that offenders of any kind should be brought to Justice. Where there is reasonable probability, that not withstanding the appearances a man may be innocent, it is very fair to make use of them: But if it goes further, and if there is nothing but absolute possibility, where all the moral probabilities of evidence are against the prisoner, where nothing can save but absolute possibility that he may be innocent, it would be going too far to conclude him innocent from that, that would make it impossible that public Justice should take its course. Therefore, the true question for your consideration is, whether judging of this fact, as you judge of all other facts, that happen in the course of your dealings with mankind, and your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300139"/> correspondence with one another, it appears to you be proved satisfactorily, and to moral demonstration, that this prisoner must have been the person that secreted this letter, and took these notes out of it, if that be the fair result of this evidence, then the prisoner is guilty, and it will be your duty to find him so. If on viewing the evidence any reasonable doubt remains on your minds, that he is the person that secreted this letter, and took the notes out of it, he will be entitled to your acquital. The public justice of the country is extremely considered, on the one hand, if the charge is fairly brought home to the prisoner, that justice should be done upon him; while on the other hand, if there remains any distant hope of his innocence, he should have the same justice by being found not guilty.</p>

            , for acceptance, I was present, and received the bill from him, it was for 52 l. 10 s. I desired him to leave the bill as we had no advice from the drawer of it he left it in our hands; and the same day in the afternoon, we had a letter from Antigua, advising us of his having drawn for this bill, and another for upwards of 800 l. when we saw the letter from some circumstances in it, we began to suspect the whole a forgery, letter and bill; the letter came as a ship letter by the usual course: nothing material after that happened within my knowledge, till I believe the 15th, when the same man came again he brought one of the set, and he brought it with an acceptance on it.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that bill which he brought, a different bill of the same tenor and date? - The former was taken and carried to the Notary Publick's.</p>
               <p>Who took it away? - I cannot say, nor when it was taken, it was not in my presence, in point of fact it was taken away by somebody from our house; but by whom I do not know.</p>
               <p>When the bill was presented for acceptance did you examine any entry of the tenor or date of the bill? - I did not, but an entry was made.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300140"/>Then on the 15th, the man brought a a bill, which was either the same, or another of the same tenor and date? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But which you do not positively know? - I do not, the man came to know whether the acceptance on it was genuine, he brought me a bill with the acceptance, which I have had in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Is there an acceptance on that bill, purporting to be the acceptance of that house? - Yes, there is an acceptance on it, the waiter called to ask me whether it was our acceptance or not, I told him no.</p>
               <p>(The acceptance read.)</p>
               <p>Accepted, 15th January 1783. B. and T. Boddington.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that the hand writing of any person who accepts bills from that house? - No.</p>
               <p>Did no clerk of the house accept bills? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - I am.</p>
               <p>Are you well acquainted with the hand writing of Messrs. Boddingtons? - I am.</p>
               <p>Are you confident it is not their hand writing? - I am, I put the bill in my pocket, and went with the person who brought it, in search of the man that he told me was come up from Exeter, and that he came from Antigua: he afterwards was taken by this waiter, who it seems had advanced the money; the same man that brought the bill, brought the person who sent the bill to him, the forenoon of the same day before dinner.</p>
               <p>Who was that person that he brought? - The prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say when he was brought? - Nothing particular.</p>
               <p>Did he admit, or deny his having given him that bill? - Neither.</p>
               <p>Did you question him at all about it? - I did not, my Lord, he was in a coach, I took him to the Mansion-house, before my Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Was he examined then before the Lord Mayor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you present at his examination? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he admit, or deny it? - Neither, he said, he had nothing to say for himself, so it appeared to me; then he was committed.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner came in our Exeter diligence with two more men, on the 11th of January, and arrived at our house, the Saracen's Head, in Friday-street, on the 13th, which was the Monday morning; and breakfasted with one of the men, the other went away the Saturday night; at breakfast he asked me for a directory, I gave him one, and he asked me if I could get a person to go up to Mr. Boddington and Rodney, with a note to be accepted, he said, it was No. 15, in Mark-lane; I told him if he would wait till breakfast was over, I would go myself with it; when breakfast was over I asked for it, and he gave me a note, I cannot rightly tell the number, but it was for 52 l. 10 s. the other man was present.</p>
               <p>Was it he or the other man that gave you the bill? - It was the prisoner at the bar, he desired me to take it to Mr. Boddington and Rodney's for acceptance, I went and saw one of the clerks as I supposed, and he desired me to leave it with him, and call the next morning, I told the prisoner, and I called the next morning, I saw the man I gave it to him, he told me they had had no letter of advice, and I think he said, Mr. Boddington was not at home, and desired me to call the next morning; I came back and told the prisoner at the bar that I was to call again, he desired me to go and call for the note, either to have it accepted, or as it was, I went and saw the gentleman in the office, and told him the gentleman was very angry about it, and desired to have the note accepted, or to have it back as it was, I said, it is very odd you should give him so much trouble; he said, the clerk that had it was not at home, and desired me to call in the morning, he said, we shall either send a message or the note to night, but no message came that night; accordingly the prisoner at the bar wanted me to go again the next morning the 15th, I told him he had better write a line, which he did, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300141"/> do not know what it contained, he wafered it up, and I carried it; I saw the person I gave the note to on the 13th, he asked me what the gentleman was, I said, I did not know, he said, he might perhaps be a Captain of a ship, he said, they were waiting for a letter of advice; I said, I will be obliged to you to let me have a letter, perhaps he may be dubious that I have not left it here, and they gave me a letter in answer, which I brought to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. What did the prisoner say? - He did not say what the letter said, but I advised the prisoner to call himself, that it would be better for him to call and speak to the gentleman: on the 15th in the afternoon, the prisoner came into the coffee-room and said, either waiter or Thomas, I do not know which, I have been there, and have got it accepted at last; I told him I was glad of it, for he had had a good deal of trouble about it, as well as myself; he said he had, he asked me if I could get it discounted, he said, perhaps my master could do it, and he would allow five per cent, and give me a guinea for my trouble; I told him if he would wait till the morning the 16th, th at my master was not in the way but I would speak to him, and if he could not do it, I would get it done some how, because they told me that it certainly was a good note; on the 16th in the morning he was at breakfast about eleven o'clock, I told him my master was in the way, and I would see if he could discount it; I took it to my master, he said, he had not got so much cash about him, says I, it is the note I took for this gentleman, and he will allow five per cent for the time that is to come; says I, I took the note there, and they told me it was a very good house it was upon; says he, you will be safe enough in doing it, if you can do it; says I, then I will do it; I had ten guineas in my pocket, I gave him that, and I told him, in about five minutes he should have the remainder of the cash.</p>
               <p>Court. Had he asked you if you could do it yourself? - Yes, he said the ten guineas were sufficient, that would do for the present, he said, he should be back presently, I went home and got the remainder of the cash, and in coming down stairs I bethought myself that I would go to Mr. Boddington's, to see if it was their acceptance or no, I did so, when I came to the house, I met with the clerk I first gave the note to, he stopped the note, and told me it was a forgery; this is the clerk, Mr. Bettersworth; I came back with the clerk, and the prisoner was gone out; this gentleman left me, and he desired me to give charge if he came in to stop him; the prisoner came back in about five minutes, he was coming down the yard, and I spoke to him, says I, I do not like this note, I will be obliged to you to return me my money again, he put his hand into his pocket and trembled most ducidly, and he asked me for the note.</p>
               <p>Had he asked you at all for the remainder of the money? - I laid hold of him first, and said, I did not like the note, he had got the ten guineas and about two-pence halfpenny, and while I was putting the money in my pocket, he turned round again, and asked me for the note, I told him, he must go with me where the note was stopped, he turned round and ran up the yard which is a double yard, thinking I suppose it was a thoroughfare, and if it had I believe I should have lost him, but not being so I ran after him, and laid hold of him, I brought him down to the coffee-room, I sent for a coach and took him to Mr. Boddington's, they told me to take him to the Mansion-house, I told them he had given me my money, and they might do what they would with him, I had no peace officer.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say any thing about this to you at any time? - All that ever he said was, you have got your money, why do not you let me go, I told him I could not.</p>
               <p>That was all he said? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the bill that Bettersworth took from you and stopped, the same that you received from the prisoner? - Yes, the second time.</p>
               <p>Was it out of your possession at all till you delivered it to Mr. Boddington's? - No, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300142"/>Then every thing that was written upon that bill when the prisoner delivered it to you, was written upon it when you delivered it to Mr. Boddington? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Bettersworth. Does the bill remain unaltered? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It has been in your possession ever since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at the acceptance again more particularly, and tell me whether you are sure it is not the acceptance of that house? - I am sure it is not.</p>
               <p>What is the firm of your house? - B. and T. Boddington, there are no other partners.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>My Lord, my evidence will not go farther than Mr. Bettersworth's, I am clerk to Messrs. Boddingtons, I did not see the porter give the bill, I first saw it when Mr. Bettersworth came in on the 13th of January, I put it into a drawer, where we put bills, some of the clerks took it out, I suppose to enter it.</p>
               <p>How came it from your house again? - In that particular I believe, Mr. Bettersworth was wrong, because it was not given back again, because the first bill remained at our house, and I have it in my pocket now.</p>
               <p>Court. Produce it? - That is the bill, that was first brought my Lord.</p>
               <p>Then this is the bill that was left at your house on the 13th? - Yes, I know it by the number on the left hand corner.</p>
               <p>You never saw the prisoner at the bar at your house? - Not till he was brought by the porter.</p>
               <p>Does anybody accept bills at your house? - They never do.</p>
               <p>Court to Hepworth. What became of the other man? - He left the house the day before the prisoner was taken up, and he came the 16th and 17th, and said, he came to see the prisoner, who had some shirts of his.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have nothing to say, I have no witnesses.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. It seems that the bill itself is a genuine bill of exchange, the charge is for forging the indorsement.</p>
               <p>Jury. I understand your Lordship, that there was a letter sent from the prisoner to Messrs. Boddingtons, to know why they did not accept the bill, will your Lordship, indulge us with comparing the letter, with the acceptance of the bill.</p>
               <p>Court to Hepworth. Should you know again the letter that you carried from the prisoner? - No, my Lord, it was wafered up.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at that letter and see whether you know it, speak with caution? - My Lord, I believe it to be the same.</p>
               <p>Have you a distinct knowledge of it? - I am not quite sure.</p>
               <p>Jury. How long had you this letter after the bill was left for acceptance? - The afternoon of the same day.</p>

               <p>Where else did he cut you? - No otherwise than across the nose and face.</p>
               <p>Did you see who it was that cut you? - I cannot swear to the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see what weapon it was with? - No.</p>
               <p>Is any part of your nose cut my friend? - It is cut, the middle of my nose.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. I think you say you did not know the person of the prisoner? - I recollect something of his face.</p>
               <p>This was a very dark night? - Not so very dark.</p>
               <p>No moon at all that night, and there was a great mob, if I understand you rightly? - Not till I was cut.</p>
               <p>This was in the open street? - Yes, it was on the paved stones.</p>
               <p>Court. What was all this quarrel about? - We had no quarrel at all.</p>
               <p>How came all these people to have such an inveterate dislike to you? - I cannot say, my Lord, unless it was the night before; I disappointed them the night before, in robbing my cart.</p>
               <p>Did you know none of them? - Not as I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Had they no acquaintance with you? - No, I never was acquainted with such people.</p>

               <p>I do not find that night that they attacked your cart at all? - It was a good reason why, because I suppose opportunity did not suit them.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you sober? - There is my master who will say, if ever he knew me drunk in his life, or any body that knows me, I was coming from the other end of the town, from Grosvenor-street, I was bringing eleven lumps of sugar.</p>
               <p>Did you lose any sugar that night? - No, as they told me I lost none.</p>
               <p>Did they say any thing to you? - No farther than</p>
               <p>"damn him, knock him down," I heard no other expressions but hooting, and hallooing, there was no words between us.</p>
               <p>What was you to be knocked down for? - I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Had you run against any body with your cart? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Did any body quarrel with you, for running against any body? - No, never, neither that day nor any other time.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you do not know why they made this attack upon you? - No.</p>

               <p>I am engine keeper of St. Andrew's, Holborn, I know Brazier: coming down Holborn-hill, at the end of Plumbtree-court, I heard a noise; and I saw Brazier with what they call a stretched staff in his hand, which belongs to the cart, holding it at eight or nine people of whom the prisoner is one: Brazier was at the tail of his cart, halloo! says the people,</p>
               <p>"damn him, knock him down; now blast him, why do not you go it," and he in the mean while kept aiming at them.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he strike? - He did not strike; one says,</p>
               <p>"damn your eyes where is your knives;" several said so; at the end of the Swan-yard they trod my shoes down at the heels; I still kept close to them, but said nothing at all, and as Brazier was opening Mr. Furneaux and Wilson's door with his right hand to get in, the prisoner cut him with a knife, across his ear to his nose.</p>
               <p>Court. How near was you to the prisoner at the time he did that? - About two yards, and the blood of the man's face flew on my left hand; they made another aim at him, and broke one of the panes of glass, and there is the blood on the door to be seen now.</p>
               <p>What was that aim made with? - With a stick; it was broke by one of the gang; my eyes were fixed on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Could you see whether it was one of the gang, or whether it was Brazier? - I will not say that.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner was the man that cut Brazier? - I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>What became of him after this? - I stooped down to put my shoes up at heel, and they were all gone.</p>
               <p>When did you see the prisoner again? - Not till this day week, I saw him at a publick house by the Rotation-office, in Litchfield-street.</p>
               <p>In custody? - Yes, I spoke to Mr. Barwis's people about the man being cut, and I said, I knew some of them, by being engine keeper of St. Andrew's, Holborn, there are a number of pick-pockets and thieves attend that place, and my idea was to look at them; this is the man that cut the man; I have seen him before on that spot an hundred times and more.</p>
               <p>What business did he follow? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did you know his name? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you know the person of ever another of them? - I know the persons of several that were there.</p>
               <p>What are they? - Thieves.</p>
               <p>How long before the cut was made, was it that you saw him? - It was done in less than five minutes; there was hallooing and hooting, the same as they would at a mad bullock; I heard no quarrel, I did not hear the man say a word; I heard them cry,</p>
               <p>"damn your eyes, where is your knives; ah! blast you, where is the knives;" and he cut him; I saw him do it.</p>
               <p>Can you tell what it was that offended them? - I did not see the beginning of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You say you had not an observation of above four or five minutes? - No.</p>
               <p>So then all you said was, you knew some of them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not say to Mr. Barwis's people that you knew the man that had cut Brazier's face? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor you did not tell Brazier that you knew the person very well, and had seen him an hundred times? - No, Sir, if I had known where to have found him, I would have gone that night and took him.</p>
               <p>Did you, to Mr. Barwis's people describe the person and dress of the prisoner? - Yes, I have told my Lord now, I knew him before; I did not say so before.</p>
               <p>I should think it was natural to have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300147"/> said so then? - I do not know, I knew the prisoner's face; I cannot be deceived in a man's face.</p>

               <p>I am constable of St. George's, Bloomsbury, I was present when the prisoner was apprehended; Roberts saw him coming along; we went to him, and laid hold of him, and he was very unwilling to go, and he said, if he had but a little more liberty, damn his eyes if he would have gone at all.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him, you wanted him for cutting the carman? - Yes, he said, he knew nothing of it, and that knife was found upon him, he said then, that if he had but ten yards further liberty, he would have stuck it into our bloody hearts, and many more bad expressions of the kind: he damned us and would not be taken then, he and some more of them were going to take a walk that afternoon.</p>
               <p>He said nothing more about the carman? - At Litchfield-street, he seemed to be very much confused when he saw the carman, and Mr. Scott came, and I thought I heard a faint word come out, that he was a dead man; he rather dropped his countenance, and I understood him in the best manner I could, that he was a dead man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. If I understood you right, you do not know what it was he did say? - He spoke something that was the best I could understand, but he changed countenance greatly.</p>

               <p>According to your account that part of the nose was fairly cut through? - The under part that separates the nostrils was divided quite, we call it the sceptum; the under end, and each side of each nostrils was touched, but not much divided, that gristle was divided so, that it was laid down.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it what you commonly understand by slitting the nose? - It belonged to the nose, the whole lay over his chin, and his teeth shewed through.</p>
               <p>Court. A deep cut that penetrated quite through the whole substance of that part, and so through the cheek to the bone? - Yes, the cheek was cut through compleat.</p>

            , a man of rank of that time, who had given offence to somebody, and they meant to wound and disfigure him by slitting his nose, and by other wounds and maims to disfigure his person, and possibly ultimately to kill him: that was the foundation of this act of parliament which recites that particular transaction, and</p>
               <p>"that</p>
               <p>"if any person shall on purpose," (you will attend to all the words here)</p>
               <p>"and of malice</p>
               <p>"aforethought and by laying in wait, unlawfully</p>
               <p>"cut out or disable the tongue, put</p>
               <p>"out an eye, slit the nose, cut off the</p>
               <p>"nose, or cut off or disable any limb or</p>
               <p>"member, with intention in so doing to</p>
               <p>"maim or disfigure in any manner before</p>
               <p>"mentioned, such person shall be guilty</p>
               <p>"of a capital offence." You see therefore it is not the more simple outrage of one person upon another that is the subject of this charge; the mere wounding a man, the mere assaulting a man and slitting his nose, or otherwise wounding him, not attended with those circumstances so particularly mentioned, would still remain a great misdemeanor only; or if it came to what is called in the law maiming, it must be an offence of another description; more is necessary to constitute this offence; here the outrage is to be committed with a certain degree of preparation, watching an opportunity for the purpose, and with a certain degree of deliberation, that may mark intentional malice, a wilful and deliberate intended act of cruelty; that is what is imputed to this man: In short he stands accused of having wilfully, deliberately, maliciously, on purpose, and by watching an opportunity for it, and with intention to maim, having actually slit the nose of this Brazier. Now the question you are to try will be, whether he is guilty of the offence as it is described, therefore you will watch the circumstances which shew the deliberation, and the premeditation, and the intent to commit this particular crime, I cannot say you have much assistance from the evidence you have heard; for it is left a good deal to conjecture, to make out what was the ground which these people (be they who they may) had for attacking this man in the manner in which he was attacked; it is a conjecture, that it was done by way of revenge, because he was so watchful, that he would not suffer a parcel of thieves to rob his master's cart; therefore they meant by way of revenge, to mark any man, who should dare to be so vigilant a servant to his master, and to deter other servants in future, from preventing their committing their depredations: Whether that was their reason, will be one of the subjects for you to judge of; and perhaps, that may furnish you with a sufficient key, by which to understand all this case, and which may be a sufficient foundation for you to infer, that when these people found they could not attack the cart with success; that they set themselves to consider how to set a mark on the man who prevented them; in order to punish him, and to deter others from being<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300149"/> guilty towards them of that sort of diligence, which prevented them from committing their intended robbery: If that is not the key to it, I profess I am perfectly at a loss to know, whether it was a sudden violent impulse of rage, on some sudden quarrel, which I cannot come at; or whether it was some other act of revenge on some other ground which has not come out; the prosecutor prosesses not to know the cause, and none of the witnesses are able to tell: the prosecutor tells you, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>(Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence as before mentioned).</p>
               <p>As to the prisoner's saying he was a dead man, though it manifests a degree of conscious guilt, yet you will observe, that words which are not heard distinctly, are not to be relyed upon. Gentlemen, this being the nature of the evidence, the prisoner rests his defence on a general averment of not guilty: You are therefore to consider, whether he is proved to your satisfaction to be the man, who cut this Brazier in the manner you have heard; and in the next place, whether the manner of it, and the circumstances attending it, are sufficient to satisfy you that it was done maliciously, of malice aforethought, and by laying in wait, and with intent to disfigure.</p>
               <p>Every riotous outrage that is committed on a man, certainly is not within this Act of parliament; there may be a sudden quarrel between persons, and if one man should from the maliciousness of his heart take out a knife; if death had followed, it might be murder, but if death did not ensue, it would remain an assault in the consideration of law, but nothing else but an assault: To make it more, it must be attended with those circumstances of preparation, premeditation and deliberation, and intending to do that sort of injury: It rests entirely upon the engine-maker, as to the person of the prisoner; and he swears very positively, if you are satisfied that he has spoken upon good grounds, that the prisoner is the man that gave the wound, then we are advanced thus far towards compleating the present enquiry: if he is the man that committed the fact, the next question is upon those grounds of deliberation, preparation, premeditated malice, and intend to do this sort of mischief which I have mentioned, and which make a considerable, part of this offence; and as to which I cannot find myself a particular ground for this outrage, what it was that led to it, is to me extremely in the dark, and therefore very difficult to find a probable cause for; the engine-maker has told you, that before this cut was given, they said where is your knifes, and that after the cry, where is your knifes, it was that this cut was given; now if that was the signal that was to be held out for them, and one drew his knife, and took the first opportunity to give this man the cut, this is laying in wait here for him; if that is not sufficient, it is hard to find any circumstances, in the case from which it can be inferred. If he is not guilty of the indictment in the extent of it, he is not guilty at all; and in pronouncing guilty or not guilty, you will take the circumstances all of them into your consideration, if you find him guilty of the whole offence, then you will say so; if you find he was wounded by the prisoner; but that it was the effect of some sudden impulse, not of deliberation or malice, then he must be acquicted; if you have any doubt whether he was the person that gave the wound, of course you will acquit him.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the prisoner one of the gang the two preceding nights.</p>
               <p>Court. With respect to laying in wait, a man who has a purpose in his mind to do such kind of mischief, and does deliberately watch an opportunity to do it, I think lays in wait: I do not think it is necessary for a man to plant himself in any place, and then to come out of his lurking place to do it, if he forms such an intention, and comes up behind him, and takes the opportunity of doing, that is laying in wait; and I think we need not stretch that circumstance to any particular length of time, or to any extraordinary degree of preparation,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300150"/> if he seizes a convenient opportunity of doing it, and does it with deliberation.</p>

               <p>Court. Was it day-light then? - No, my Lord, I believe not, I rung my own bell, in my room to alarm the family, and then we all went down together; coming down to the bottom of the stairs leading to the shop, I found that door locked; I opened it, then looking into the shop, I found some person had come into the shop out of the cellar, there was a hole cut through the door, and he got his hand in, and pulled back the bolt, the door was then open; looking further into the shop, I perceived two of the rails of the banister taken out; upon the counter there stood a drawer with some mace, part of which was out; I found the desk adjoining was broke open; I found these tools on the counter, a gimblet, a chissel, and some iron bars, and this dark Janthorn in the cellar; perceiving these rails out of the banisters, we went up stairs, and found the dining room door open and some plate gone.</p>
               <p>How could they get out of the shop up stairs? - By taking these two rails out of the banister.</p>
               <p>Had the dining room door been locked? - I cannot particularly speak to that, what else did you miss? - The first was a silver wine strainer, a bottle lable, three salt spoons, and a large gravy spoon, which I apprehend was taken out of the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the outer fastenings of the house? - I found every outer fastening perfectly safe, as we left them the night before.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the cellar? - There was no way to get in but one, which was thro' a hole, where we shot the coals, I do not know that that was any way secured; it had not been open for too or three months, it was a common passage, and hardly visible.</p>
               <p>What was it covered with or shut with? - It was a boarded passage, and one part lifts up in order to shoot down coals into the cellar, and that board was lifted up, and not fitted down.</p>
               <p>Court. By that hole there was a way to the coal hole, which is in the cellar, and that communicated with the door that came into the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had your doors and windows been fast the night before? - They all were, I saw them bolted myself and fastened.</p>
               <p>What circumstance led you to charge the prisoner with this fact? - I was confident that no man could come there, but one that was used to the house, the prisoner had lived with me as porter above 11 months, he had left me one month, I suspected him.</p>
               <p>What did you do in consequence of that suspicion? - About ten that morning I went to the public office, in Bow-street, and described the prisoner's person, and when I had given the information, there was a person under examination in the inner office, and it was the prisoner; a man having stopped him, where he went to sell some mace, which mace was mine; but I did not know he was there, then I was sent for again that day, but was not at home; on Friday I went again, and the mace was produced.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose you could not swear to mace? - I could not, but the quantity<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300151"/> corresponded intirely; Sir S. Wright desired it to stand over till Friday following, to see if he could get any further proof than that of mace only; the prisoner totally denied the robbery; before the next Friday, in his box was found my money scales, with some of his cloaths, I was present, the box was found at the prisoner's lodgings in East Smithfield, one of the officers fetched the box, and I saw it in Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Do you know it or not? - I suppose I was doing my duty not for the sake of the reward.</p>
               <p>Do you know there is a reward? - Undoubtedly by law.</p>
               <p>You do not expect to get credit before these people by behaving in this manner, there was somebody present at this time? - There was.</p>

               <p>How came you endeavour to persuade this man to make this confession to you? - I did not endeavour to do it all, there was sufficient proof before.</p>
               <p>You pursuaded him, did not you? - I told he might as well tell where his master's plate was, I did persuade him, it is our duty to find out every thing.</p>
               <p>No, it is your duty to carry people to goal; so then you are a Justice, as well as witness and goaler: Was not there something said, about the indictment being thrown out at the Old Bailey? - How could I say so.</p>

               <p>How came you then to say, when you began your evidence, that you told him it was better for him to confess? - I did not say so.</p>
               <p>Then I will appeal to the Court and the short hand writer: What say you now, will you still persist? - To my knowledge I did not say such a word, no man can say I did.</p>
               <p>What will you persist, after it is told you by the Court, and the short-hand writer, and myself; consider my friend, there was a person present? - Well, if there was Sir, I would not false swear myself for you Sir, nor for nobody here.</p>
               <p>These gentlemen will judge of that afterwards, that person that was present then, is present now, will you persist in it still? - Yes, I will.</p>
               <p>You did not tell him that the indictment would be thrown out at the Old Bailey, and he would be discharged if he confessed? - No, I never did, I might say better or as well.</p>

               <p>Humpage. It is false, I never said no such word.</p>
               <p>Court. When was this? - This was on Friday, when the prisoner was fully committed, I live between Clare-street and Holles-street, the least child there, or any body there knows my name, I am a master poulterer next to Mr. Richards's the tripe shop, that is as good a direction as I can give.</p>
               <p>Is there one Andrews, a poulterer lives near you? - Yes, Sir, Mr. Morris lives close by me, I lived servant with Mr. Challenor about four years ago, and I said to an old acquaintance of mine who was coming along, says I, I am going in to see such a young man, says he, I will go with you, we went, and I said, William, I am sorry to see you here, says he, come and sit down, and the prisoner asked this gentleman to drink, and nobody was with him but this young man, and I, and the prisoner, and Humpage; it was in the tap room at Bow-street; we were in a room by our three selves; then he said, says he, I know more about the matter than you do, if you think I want to get any thing out of you for my ends, say nothing to me, but further than that, says he, it will be the only means of saving your life.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was the young man that was with you? - His name is

                  Henry

            , he keeps a green shop in Tottenham-court-road.</p>
               <p>When did you first tell these circumstances, and to whom? - I do not know that I told it to any body, till I told it to Mr. Railton's clerk, I told it to him in about three or four days after the prisoner was committed.</p>
               <p>How came you to tell it to Mr. Railton's clerk? - The prisoner's father sent me a letter to apply to Mr. Railton, I wrote to him, and he knew that I knew of this matter.</p>
               <p>Did you tell Mr. Railton that Mr. Miller heard it too? - I did not know that it would be of any signification, as he knew nothing of the prisoner only by going into the publick house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. What has been his general character? - An extraordinary good one.</p>
               <p>Court to Humpage. Is this true that this man has sworn? - No, my Lord, the words that he says are very wrong, as for telling him to save his life, it is no such thing.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was present? - This man was present, I believe.</p>
               <p>Was any body else present.</p>
               <p>Stapp. Was not there a young man sat on my left hand side in the box, you sat on the prisoner's left hand, and this young man sat on my left hand? - I do not remember there were so many people in the house, I cannot remember.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner called three other witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. The rule of law with respect to the confessions of prisoners, is founded in justice, candor, and humanity, for though the law very properly does not exclude the confession of prisoners, which if it is made uninfluenced, is evidence out of their own mouths, and cannot be mistaken or misrepresented, if it is clearly proved; yet the law will not suffer men charged with crimes, and unassisted with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300155"/> advice, to be either threatened, trapanned, or coaxed to their own destruction; therefore a confession obtained either by promises, or threatenings, cannot be received. With respect to the confession of the prisoner in this case, a great deal depends on the credit you give to the evidence of Humpage, as compared with that of Stapp: Humpage introduced his evidence with saying, that he told the prisoner now, that the scales are found in your possession, you had better confess where your master's plate is, and he not only swears, that he said no more than that, but in the other part of his evidence, he endeavours to explain it away; if it were as Humpage represents it, it would be straining the principle of law to say, that because a man says to another, you had better tell the truth, therefore his confession shall be excluded: therefore if the evidence of Humpage is true, I am clearly of opinion that the prisoner's confession ought to be attended to; but the evidence of Stapp is extremely different, and if that be true, he confessed under a direct assurance that it would be the only way to save his life: therefore, whether you will take into your account, the confession of the prisoner or not, must depend on the opinion you yourselves from of the credit of the evidence of Humpage or Stapp.</p>

               <p>I went to this house in Philip-lane, together with Atkins, our information lay in the two pair of stairs room, and as soon as I got to the top of the stairs, I saw Mrs. Harcourt coming out of the door, Mrs. Ellis was by the fire.</p>
               <p>Court. Was Ellis coming out? - No, she stood still in the room over against the door, one of the constables saying, there is a man behind the door, I let Mrs. Harcourt go and took him, in his pocket I found that bit of hard metal.</p>
               <p>(The Metal produced.)</p>
               <p>After tying his hands, I searched the room, and found a quantity of shillings and sixpences, and half-crowns, and these patterns, which I found in a closet twenty sixpences and four shillings, and on the fire I found this crucible, it is now broke all to pieces with this copper in it, and by the fire side a crucible with that metal in it as it is now, it was quite hot, it stood down by the fire side, I took up the moulds, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300161"/> in taking them up one of them broke, but one is very perfect.</p>
               <p>This is called the gett? - I believe this is the mould, it is right side upwards now, and this metal, (The things shown to the Jury) some pieces of brass and some of copper, sand and scouring paper, I went into the garret, and there was a vice, scouring paper, a few files, and a piece of cork in the cellar, there was a large stamping press, I found nothing else.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know the use of that? - I look upon the scouring paper and the cork, to be that with which they clean the shillings, they appear as if they had been used; Mr. Clarke has compared the patterns.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. When you went into the room Mrs. Harcourt was in company with her husband, was not she? - She was coming from the door.</p>
               <p>The maid was there too? - Mrs. Ellis was there; I do not know whether it was the maid or not.</p>
               <p>One of these moulds you say broke as you were taking it up? - It did.</p>
               <p>Therefore whether it was or was not compleat for this purpose you cannot possibly say? - That part is.</p>
               <p>Court. That part of the mould that is broke was the upper part was it? - It broke in taking it up.</p>
               <p>Was it laid then upon the under part, as laying together? - One upon the other, when I took the upper part off that part, some how or other I had an accident, it broke, it is a kind of a mould or sand, very fine sand.</p>

               <p>Court. Was the sand loose? - No, I then looked at the fire place, and Morant saw a crucible in the fire, covered with charcoal, with metal in it red hot, the fire place which this crucible was in, is made into what they call a wind hole for the purpose of drawing sharper, I saw this spray in Gregory's hand which he said he had found, I did not see it found, it was found in the room, this was found in the kitchen, I do not know the right name of it, in the room was their drawers with a quantity of sand, flasks, and crucibles, we all examined their hands, and the hands of all three of the prisoners appeared to be extremely dirty, they were all black alike, I then went into the garret, there we found a quantity of paper, and some of the files.</p>

               <p>You have been employed I understand for the Mint about fifteen years? - Pretty near, Sir.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300162"/>Will you explain to us this business that has been carried on at the house of Mr. Harcourt; what is that? - That is half a mould, a side of a mould.</p>
               <p>What is it made of? - It is made of sand.</p>
               <p>What is this? - This, a spray, now it is all together.</p>
               <p>Have you compared it with this mould? - I have not so well as I could wish.</p>
               <p>Compare it. - There is not a doubt but that has been run from this, not the least in the world.</p>
               <p>Look at this? - This is all good money.</p>
               <p>Is there any resemblance between that and the spray? - Here are four shillings that have been cast from them four shillings.</p>
               <p>Look at these two half crowns and shillings which were found on Mrs. Harcourt? - Here is a half crown piece, that is a good one which has been cast from it; here is another mark that runs from the nose over the half crown, that you will find from that, here is a shilling, that a shilling on the spray has been cast from, here is a notch on the tail side, that you will find on one side the shilling, and that notch you will find in the spray.</p>
               <p>Court. This notch seems to be almost fresh made? - You will see it in the spray, I have looked at them very minutely through a glass, you will find that in the spray, most of the sixpences are cast from the spray, but there is three or four that I can particularly mention.</p>
               <p>What is that mould fit for when it is set? - For pouring any thing that may be impressed into sand to take off the impression.</p>
               <p>Is the sand proper sand to make a mould? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is the process? - Whatever they please to run, there is a board, and there is a gett, that is the gett which is put in the board, and the impressions are laid inside that gett.</p>
               <p>Is that fit for to cast one side of a shilling? - That has been cast from it, not a doubt of it; these have been cast from these patterns, this half crown has been cast, and this is the mark on the nose.</p>
               <p>What is that bit of metal? - This is tin, I suppose these are crucibles; that is white arsenic, they flux the copper with t, and turn it white.</p>
               <p>Court. But scouring paper makes it smooth? - Yes, they are finished with sand paper and cork to make them smooth.</p>
               <p>Court. Are there all the ingredients there that are necessary, is there any aquafortis? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you no part of the upper mould? - That was broke all to pieces.</p>
               <p>But that was laid there on the other? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Morant. Let Mr. Clarke look upon that upper frame, and see whether it corresponds to match with the under frame in case it had sand in it? - That is it.</p>
               <p>Had that sand in it? - Yes, it was compleat.</p>
               <p>Court. Though we have not the sand, if we have the frame that exactly tallies with the other, that must be the compleat thing itself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You have what you call the half of a mould? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You may run one side supposing there is no impression on the other? - It would be impossible to make the impressions on the other side by making a separate mould afterwards, it could not be run a second time.</p>
               <p>One side of it might be finished and made, and the impression not being made it is no mould? - Yes, it is, when they are together they are called a pair of moulds, because one bears one side, and one the other; a thing of that kind cannot be fit for any thing.</p>
               <p>What was shewn you; the spray must have had then a pair of moulds to finish it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You said it was incompleat, and unfit for the business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can you by looking at that which is there in sand, say, that there is any resemblance of a shilling? - I think I can.</p>
               <p>You have seen the spray? - Yes.</p>
               <p>These may be used for buttons? - As for casting buttons there is no such a thing, they do not cast them, they are struck up in dies.</p>
               <p>That does not follow of course, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300163"/> that spray was cast in that mould, they might have made the same impressions on any other mould? - I am here on my oath, and dare to say, not only myself, but the Court and every gentleman here will agree with me in my opinion, that I do now declare, I have no doubt from their laying so exact upon the sand.</p>
