We were suspicious that we were losing a quantity of soap and barrilla until the apprehension of the prisoner. On the 13th of April I went into the barilla room, and found the prisoners coat upon an empty cask in the barilla room, I searched his pockets, there was a great deal of barilla dust between the lining of the coat and the outside, which was made as a large pocket; and there was also soap plastered inside that pocket. I then ordered my clerk, Mr. M'Clerc, to watch the prisoner, and I went to Worship-street for an officer. I returned with the officer. I saw the prisoner coming out of the manufactory; I pointed him out to the officer, and desired the officer to take the prisoner. The officer took the prisoner; we brought him into the accompting-house, we searched the prisoner there, and took from him a quantity of soap, twelve pounds of soap, from the flap part of his breeches. I gave the prisoner into the custody of the officer. The officer took the prisoner to Worship-street office. We went with the prisoner to the prisoner's lodgings, we there found three cakes of yellow soap, weighing eight pounds, value five shillings, and a hundred weight of barilla on the stair-case, facing the room door. When we were searching the prisoner's room, he said it was the first time, he hoped we would forgive him. I told him it was not in my power to do it. This is the barilla and the soap. We afterwards found about half a hundred weight of barilla concealed behind the cask where the prisoner's coat was.</p>

I picked up the knives, and asked him where he got them, he said he knew nothing about them. I was going to take him away to the watchhouse, I discovered some forks laying where I took up the knives. I picked up the two forks, I took the prisoner to the watch-house and searched him, I found two pence in halfpence upon him, and a metal broach. I questioned the prisoner at the watchhouse, where he got the knives and forks; he said he found them upon the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what stairs - A. In the house where one Arnold lived, he said he went to look after Arnold's boy to get him to come down and play with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know at all where these knives and forks came from, except from what he told you - A. No. I went to Mr. Johnson's house on the Monday morning, I did not take the prisoner with me. These are the knives.</p>

               <p>Q. What, Mr. Smith's shop - A. No, another in St. George's parish, and in going round my beat I met the prisoner with some hats under his arm; I asked him what he had got; he did not tell me; I said, you have got hats; I told him there had been some hats stolen that night, I must take him to the shop, and see if them were the hats that they had lost; he said he would go with me, he had them of one Mr. Franks. In walking along with me he tried to make his escape, I ran after him, and stopped him, and took him and the hats that he had with him to Mr. Sheppard, who had lost two hats; Mr. Sheppard said they were neither of them his.</p>
               <p>Q. How many hats were there - A. Seven. Then I took him to the watchhouse, and gave charge of him, and left the hats at the watchhouse till the morning in the charge of Mr. Jackson, the beadle. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure the person that was seized was the person that met Mr. Johnson, and you - A. I am certain of it; Mr. Johnson came back after the prisoner was seized, and looked round and found the watch-case.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have only to say I was passing by at that time, Mr. Johnson said, I had taken his watch, he laid hold of me, I said I had not, neither did I. I knew nothing of him or his watch.</p>

            , ESQ. Q. You are a member in the present Commons House of Parliament - A. Yes. On the 11th of this month (last Monday) I was going through the lobby towards the door of the <placeName id="t18120513-5-crimeloc24">House of Commons</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18120513-5-crimeloc24" type="placeName" value="House of Commons"/>
                  <interp inst="t18120513-5-crimeloc24" type="type" value="crimeLocation"/>
                  <join result="offencePlace" targOrder="Y"
                        targets="t18120513-5-off22 t18120513-5-crimeloc24"/>. As I was passing through the lobby, I stopped to speak to a gentleman whom I met with there; while in conversation with that gentleman I heard the report of a pistol, which appeared to have been fired close by the entrance of the door of the lobby.</p>
               <p>Q. By that door, do you mean the door by which members coming from their residences get into the house - A. Yes, the first door of the lobby. This appeared to have been fired from that door; immediately upon hearing the report I turned my head towards the place from whence the noise appeared to have proceeded, and observed a tumult, and probably a dozen or more persons gathering about the spot, almost at the same instant a person rushed hastily from among the crowd, and several voices cried out shut the door, and let no one escape. The person who came from among the crowd came towards me, looking first one way and then another, and as I thought at the moment rather like one seeking for shelter, than as the person who had received the wound, but taking two or three steps towards me, as he approached he rather reeled by me, and almost instantly fell upon the floor, with his face downwards. Before he fell I heard a cry not very distinctly, what appeared to come from him, in which were the words, murder, or something very much like that. When he first fell I thought he might be slightly wounded, and expected to see him make an effort to rise, but gazing at him a few moments, I observed that he did not stir at all; I therefore immediately stooped down to raise him from the ground, requesting the assistance of a gentleman who stood close by me for that purpose. As soon as we had turned his face towards us, and not till then, I perceived it was Mr. Perceval. We then took him in our arms, the other gentleman on his left side, and I on his right. We carried him into the office of the speaker's secretary, and ourselves on a table there with Mr. Perceval between us also sitting on the table, resting in our at that time completely pale, the small quantity from each corner of its month, and as I then thought probably not more than two minutes had elapsed since the pistol had been fired there were not scarcely any signs of life remaining; his eyes were still open. but he did not appear to know me, nor take any notice of any person that came about him, nor had he uttered the least articulate sound from the moment that he fell. A few convulsive sobs, which lasted three or four minutes, together with scarcely a perceptible pulse, were the only signs of life remaining, and this continued but for a short time longer, and when I felt his wrist for the last time assisted by Mr. Lynn a surgeon, who had arrived, it appeared to me that he was totally dead; I remained in the same situation with the body till we carried it into the speaker's house. I am incapable of giving any account of whatever passed afterwards in the lobby respecting the detension or conduct of the prisoner at the bar.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you afterwards any opportunity of seeing where Mr. Perceval was wounded - A. Mr. Perceval still remained on my arm when Mr. Lynn examined the wound; he came into the room, and examined the wound while we remained in the same posture. The body not having been moved at all; I saw the wound from which but little blood appeared to have issued.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the wound - A. The wound was very near the nipple of the left breast, a little above it and within it; the orifice appeared to me to be large for a pistol ball, and when Mr. Lynn probed it; it seemed clearly that the ball had slaunted downwards, but it appeared clearly that the ball had penetrated the cavity of the breast, for the probe did not touch it.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Perceval, I believe, was a person of low stature - A. Unquestionably.</p>
               <p>Q. State the hour of the day that this happened - A. I recollect from various circumstances that it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181205130006"/> must have been between five o'clock, and a quarter after.</p>
               <p>Q. I know you have been long a member of that place, is that about the time that Mr. Perceval, in his public situation, would come to the house - A. It is about the time that Mr. Perceval, in his public situation would come, and about that time he was constantly expected, and nearer to that time than any other.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the gentleman that assisted of the name of Phillips - A. I believe it was.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you sent for, and did you go to the House of Commons on Monday the 11th instant - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the afternoon - A. About a quarter past five in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the House of Commons, or about it did you go to - A. I went through the lobby into the passage to the speaker's secretary's room.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got there what did you see - A. I saw Mr. Perceval lay partly upon the table with his feet in two chairs one foot on each chair; I then saw some blood upon the white waistcoat and shirt; I turned it aside and saw an opening in the skin; I examined his pulse, he had no pulsation, and appeared quite dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you probe the wound - A. I probed it, the probe passed three inches obliquely downwards and inwards, it being immediately over the heart, about the further rib: I had no doubt that the ball had passed into the heart, if not through it. It was a large pistol ball apparently.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you from the appearance judge, sir, that that was the cause of his death - A. I have no doubt of that.</p>

            . Q. You are a solicitor - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. In the afternoon of Monday were you in the lobby of the House of Commons - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. A little after five o'clock did you hear the report of a pistol - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. From what part of the lobby did that report proceed from - A. From the entrance.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe next after the report of the pistol - A. I saw a person coming forwards along the lobby from the entrance towards the House, staggering, and just before he came to the pillars next the door I saw him put his hand to his breast, or nigh his breast, he said, oh, faintly, and fell forwards on his face; I heard some people say, that is the man, and I saw a man pointing towards a bench by the side of the fire place, at the side of the lobby. I immediately at the same instant went to the bench, I saw the prisoner sitting on the bench in great agitation, I looked at both hands, and saw his left hand on the bench, and in his hand, or under his hand I saw the pistol, I immediately took the pistol in my hand and asked him what could have induced him to do such a thing, or act; he replied, want of redress of grievance, and refusal by government; it was to that effect, I do not say these were the exact words; I said, you have another pistol in your pocket; he replied, yes; I asked him if it was loaded; he said, yes; I saw some person take it from the left side of the prisoner's person about the coat or breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took hold of the first pistol which you found in his hand, or under his hand in what condition was it - A. It was warm, it had the appearance of having been recently discharged; I have the pistol here, this is it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a large or a small bore to the pistol - A. I thought it was a very large bore. When he told me that the other pistol was loaded, I immediately put my hand into his right waistcoat pocket, and took out a pen-knife and a pencil, and a bunch of keys, and some money; at the same time I saw the pistol taken from him, and a bundle of papers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner detained in custody - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he examined shortly afterwards - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he taken up stairs in order, with other witnesses to be examined before the magistrate - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you before the magistrate in the presence of the prisoner relate the facts which you have today related - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had concluded your narrative did he make any observation up it - A. He did, he said as nigh as I can recollect, I wish to correct Mr. Burgess's statement in one part, but I believe he is perfectly correct in any other; instead of my hand, as Mr. Burgess has stated, being on or near the pistol, I think he took it from my hand, or out of my hand; I do not know whether he said from my hand or out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any other observation upon your evidence - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I take it for granted you have stated every thing that occurred - A. No, I cannot recollect every thing that he stated; I have recollected every thing of importance.</p>
               <p>Q. He said he had been ill used, and when you asked him why he did it, that is the reason he gave you, mere want of redress of grievance on the part of government - A. Redress of grievance, and a refusal by government.</p>
               <p>Q. That is all he said to you - A. No; he said, I will relate to you why I did it.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you asked him why he did it that is the reason he gave you - A. That is nearly the reason.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not state any personal resentment to Mr. Perceval - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. There were a great many persons in the lobby - A. Not a great many, not more than twenty.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean at the time the pistol was fired - A. I do. I do not think there were twenty at the time the pistol was fired.</p>
               <p>Q. There was an order given to shut the door of the lobby, had that order been given before or after your conversation - A. I will not pretend to say; I heard the order given.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the man was very much agitated - A. Very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not he have absconded after he had fired the pistol, before the door had been ordered to be shut - A. I will not say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. How long did that agitation continue - A. He was extremely agitated the whole time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181205130007"/> I was with him, afterwards, up stairs, he appeared perfectly calm and collected.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to the possibility of escape from the firing of the pistol must the prisoner have been within the lobby or without - A. I don't know, I should suppose there is no doubt he was in the lobby, I have no doubt he was in the lobby in my own mind.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe down three steps from the door of the lobby there is an officer stationed - A. Two steps from the lobby.</p>
               <p>Q. And then four or five steps down there is an officer - A. There are persons belonging to the house stationed.</p>
               <p>Q. At the bottom of these four steps there are two persons stationed, are there not - A. I generally see one, sometimes there are two, I generally see one.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any person go out of the lobby without going close by that person - A. He must have gone within a yard of him or less.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you in one of the committee rooms in the afternoon of Monday last the 11th inst. - A. About five o'clock on Monday last I went to the House with a petition, to let Mr. Perceval see it by his own desire, previous to that petition being presented to the House. Before five o'clock the House resolved itself into a committee of the whole House, to proceed further respecting the Order of Council. Mr. Perceval then not being come down to the House, I postponed, till his arrival, presenting that petition, and went up stairs into the committee room, close by the ballustrades which look down into the lobby, the door open towards that ballustrade, it was merely the same thing as to hearing, as to being in the lobby of the House. I heard the loud report of a pistol shot, and almost instantaneously the cry of close the door. I rushed down stairs, through the House into the lobby; the door facing of the ballustrade was open. The moment I came into the lobby, I saw a crowd collected about some individual whom I could not see, and to whom the attention of almost every person was directed, I mean the generality; a person near me, whom I should not know if I were to see him, immediately said, that is the man that fired the pistol, pointing to

            , who stands there, whose person I well knew, and whose name I was acquainted with; I flew towards him, he was then sitting with one or two others upon the bench, at the right hand side of the fire-place of the lobby, supposing your back turned towards that fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Between the fire-place and the entrance door of the lobby - A. Just so. I seized him by the breast, I think, and as he lifted up his hand, it appeared to me that a pistol was in that hand, either cocked, or upon the half cock, it appeared to me cocked. The The first impression in my mind was, that it was to be used against himself. I saw the pistol in his hand grasped, I therefore kept down his arm with all my strength, and a person, whom I believe to be the last witness, Mr. Burgess, whom I then did not know, took that pistol from under his hand, his hand being so held that there was little or no resistance from him. I heard that person ask him whether he had another pistol, I heard his reply - that he had; I proceeded to search for it, there were then others searching him. I put my hand into his coat pocket, I think one of the inside pockets, I had my hand in several of his pockets, I pulled out a bundle of papers, tied together with red tape; the pressure was great at that moment, I found myself closely pressed at that time, I was fearful of losing these papers and of losing the prisoner. I held up the papers, and Mr. Hume, a member of the House of Commons, took the papers out of my hand, with my consent; it appeared to me at that time, as it were the prisoner was dragged from my hold, I have no doubt now but it was the effect of persons to secure him; at that time I thought it was to drag him out of the lobby. I fastened both my hands upon him, told him he could not escape, that I knew him well, and that I would not lose sight of him, he said he had submitted, as if it were not to use him ill, I believe he rather complained of my using his arm rather roughly, he said that he had submitted, that he was the person that fired the shot; some other questions were asked, but I cannot now distinctly speak to them, nor to the answers, but with the assistance of other she was dragged into the body of the house and placed at the bar, in the custody of the two messengers. I mentioned to him his name, which he admitted.</p>
               <p>Q. From the body of the house he was taken to another place where he and you were examined - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were examined, and that examination took place in his presence - A. It did.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had made your deposition did the prisoner make any remark upon it - A. Something to this effect: General 
               <persName id="t18120513-5-person103">Gascoyne</persName>
             is too correct for me to question what he has said. He must have been less agitated than I was; he complained of the violence to his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first laid hold of him did he appear to be in a state of agitation - A. He certainly appeared to be in a state of agitation, as any man, would be, guilty of a crime, in a perspiration.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to have recovered from that agitation after your deposition was over - A. Completely composed, as I had known him before this occurrence happened.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated that you knew him, how lately before had you seen him - A. The precise day I cannot mention, I can recollect some time in April, I saw him and conversed with him at my own house at Liverpool.</p>
               <p>Q. You represent Liverpool - A. I do. He left his name the day before, saying he would call on the morrow; and when he came, I sent word with my servant to let him in, he came by my appointment.</p>

               <p>Q. He came as a stranger - A. Yes, he gave me an order for a pair of pantaloons and a striped waistcoat. I made them and took them home myself, and he paid me for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take them home to - A. No. 11, New Millman-street, in Guildford-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take them according to the directions that you received from the customer at the time of the order - A. Entirely so, he gave me the directions in my hand; he wrote his own address in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. You carried them home, and he paid you - A. Yes, he approved of them, and he paid me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you learn from him whether he kept the house, or was a lodger - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you carried home this first article did you see the prisoner again - A. The next time was about the 25th of April, the other was on the 5th of March. On the 25th of April I met him in Guildford-street, he informed me that he had a small job to do, and if I would step back with him he would give it me immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go back with him to the same house that you took the former articles - A. I did. When I got to the house he asked me into the parlour, he then went up stairs and brought me a dark coloured coat, he gave me directions to make him an inside pocket on the left side, so as he could get at it conveniently, he wished to have it a particular depth, he accordingly gave me a bit of paper about the length of nine inches.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you a bit of paper about nine inches in length, did he bring that from up stairs, or from what other place did he produce it - A. He brought it all down stairs together; I saw him go up stairs and come down; he brought the coat and the pattern paper.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you waited from the time that he asked you to sit down and wait for his coming down stairs - A. I suppose about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you execute that order - A. I did, he was very particular to have it home that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry it home yourself - A. Yes, I delivered it to the maid-servant, I met him about six days ago in Gray's Inn-lane.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did any thing pass between you and the prisoner when you met him in Gray's Inn-lane - A. Yes, I bowed to him, and he informed me that in the course of a few days hence he should have something for me to do; I never saw him from that till this morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Describe particularly where he stood - A. I observed him standing in the lobby, by the side of that part of the door that is generally closed.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a double door, and the other part open for the members to go through into the lobby - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There is one half closed and the other half opened - A. Yes, he stood at the lobby door, at that part which is generally closed.</p>
               <p>Q. How near might that be to where a person must pass the avenue, who are members - A. Within an arms length. I observed him, as if watching for somebody that was coming; perhaps the impression is stronger on my mind now than it was then. I thought he appeared to be anxiously watching, and as my recollection serves me his right hand was within the breast of his coat in this way; I passed on to the stair case of the gallery.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you had passed that door where the prisoner was that you described did you hear any noise - A. Almost as soon as I got on the top of the stairs that leads to the gallery for strangers there is a sort of an anti-lobby as you pass part of that gallery there, I had just got into the upper lobby.</p>
               <p>Q. About twenty steps - A. Yes, about that. When I got up there I heard the report of a pistol, I immediately heard the general confusion, and somebody said Mr. Perceval was dead. Then I came down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain that the prisoner was the person that you thus saw at that place - A. I am perfectly certain; I had frequently seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any private acquaintance with him - A. None; I had seen him in the gallery of the House of Commons, and about the passages of the House.</p>

I examined it myself almost immediately after I took the prisoner, it was loaded with powder and ball that is now in it. It was primed as well as loaded. This ball fits one pistol as well as the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the pistols a pair - A. They are; they bear the same maker's name.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner ever before - A. Several times. I had seen him several times in galleries in the House of Commons, and the avenues leading to it.</p>
               <p>Q. According to your best recollection about how long is it ago since you have seen him - A. About a week or six days back, from my seeing him last Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. I apprehend you are frequently in the galleries during the debates - A. Frequently; on one occasion I sat immediately next to him, while the House was in debate; I sat next to him about half an hour; I cannot say the precise time; there was a sort of general conversation between him and myself, and some other person that was sitting near me.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I feel great personal obligations to the learned Attorney General for the objections that he made to the defence set up by my counsel on account of insanity, it is far more fortunate for me that such a plea as that should be unfounded, and at the same time I am under the same obligation to my learned counsels for their zeal in my defence in setting up the plea that I am insane by the desire of my friends, or that I have been insane. I am not apprised of a single instance in Russia where my insanity was made public except in one single instance, when the pressure of my sufferings had exposed me to that imputation.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I beg pardon. This is the first time I ever was in public in this kind of way, and you I am sure will look at the substance of what I say more than the manner of my offering it.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, As to the lamentable catastrophe for which I am now on my trial before this court, if I am the man that I am supposed to be, to go and deliberately shoot Mr. Perceval without malice, I should consider myself a monster, and not fit to live in this world or the next. The learned Attorney General has candidly stated to you, that till this fatal time of this catastrophe, which I heartily regret, no man more so, not even one of the family of Mr. Perceval. I had no personal or premeditated malice towards that gentleman; the unfortunate lot had fallen upon him as the leading member of that administration which had repeatedly refused me any reparation for the unparalled injuries I had sustained in Russia for eight years with the cognizance and sanction of the minister of the country at the court of St. Petersburg.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I must begin to explain the origin of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181205130010"/> this unhappy affair, which took place in 1804. I was a <rs id="t18120513-5-deflabel25" type="occupation">merchant</rs>

In consequence of some circumstances connected with this refusal, and the loss of the ship, they cast their suspicions at me, at the same time I had no concern in it whatever, I was about leaving the place; they writ up to Lloyd's coffee-house who had given the communication; I was seized as I was passing the Russian frontier by order of the military governor of Archangel, and thrown into prison; I immediately aplied to the British consul at Archangel, and through him to the British Ambassador, Lord

            , then at the Russian court, stating my case. Lord Gower wrote to the military governor of Archangel, desiring that if I was not detained for any legal cause I might be liberated as a British subject, but the governor answered, that I was detained in prison for a legal cause, and that I had conducted myself in a very indecorous manner. From this time Lord Gower and the British Consul positively declined any further interference in the business, and I was detained in durance for near two years, in spite of all my endeavours to induce the British Minister to interfere with the Emperor of Russia for an investigation of my case. At length, however, after being banded from prison to prison, and from dungeon to dungeon, fed on bread and water, treated with the utmost cruelty, and frequently marched through the streets under a military guard with felons and criminals of the most atrocious description, even before the residence of the British Minister, who might view from his window, this degrading severity towards a British subject who had committed no crime to the disgrace and insult of the British nation. I was afterwards enabled to make my case known through the Procureur - it was investigated, and he obtained a judgment against the military governour, and the senate. Notwithstanding this decision I was immediately sent to another prison, and a demand was made on me for two thousand rubles, alledged to be due by me to a Russian merchant who was a bankrupt. I refused to pay this demand for a debt which I did not owe, and the Senate, finding me determined to resist the demand, I was declared a bankrupt, and continued in prison under the pretence I had made answer that I could not pay it, because all my property was in England. No such answer was ever given by me; under this pretence I was detained in prison.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen - It is a custom in Russia, that if a foreigner is declared a bankrupt, three months are allowed for all his creditors in Russia to make their claims, and eighteen months more for creditors resident in other parts of the world; but notwithstanding that, the three months had elapsed and not a single claimant appeared, although the Senate sent forth their clerks to enquire of all strangers who arrived, whether they had any demands against me. Still I was detained in prison, and sent from gaol to gaol, and I was finally handed over to the College of Commerce; the two thousand rubles were still demanded of me, and Lord Gower refused to interfere in the business, and the Consul told me I must pay the money. I was not destitute of the means of payment, but I resisted the claim, on account of its gross injustice. When the Marquis of Douglas arrived in Russia I made my case known to him, and said I only wished it to be shewn that the money was justly due, and I would pay it. The Marquis of Douglas made a representation, and stated, that it was only desired that the justice of the claim should be shewn and the money should be paid; this application was ineffectual, and I was still required to pay the two thousand rubles, or even twenty rubles, to acknowledge, in some degree, the justice of the demand; but I was aware if I had done this, I should justify the conduct of the Senate, and the military Governour of Archangel, against whom I had obtained a legal decision, with an acknowledgement that I had been unjustly treated. The necessary consequence would be, that for my supposed contumacy in bringing a false charge against the Senate and Governor, I should be sent to Siberia, I persisted in refusing to comply with the claims.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, All this while my wife, a young woman of only twenty years of age, with an infant at her breast, remained at St. Petersburg, in expectation of my arrival, and at length, in the eighth month of her pregnancy, disappointed of her hopes, was obliged to set out, unprotected, on her voyage to England. At last, after a series of six years persesution in the manner I have described, and after the repeated refusal of Lord Gower and the British Consul to represent my case to the Emperor, a circumstance occurred which proved, in a more particular degree the peculiar negligence which I had experienced. A captain Gardiner, of a Hull ship, arrived at Archangel, he had a little squabble with the commander of a guard ship about a demand of a few rubles for pilotage, and yet this man's complaint was represented to the Emperor four times within a month by the British ambassador, while, for a series of six years unparalleled persecution I was not able to obtain any interference on my behalf. At length the Senate, quite tired out by these severities, in 1809 I received, at midnight, a discharge from my confinement, with a pass, and an order to quit the Russian dominions, which was in fact an acknowledgment of the justice of my cause. On my return in England I laid a statement of my grievances before the Marquis Wellesley, accompanied by authentic documents, and claiming some redress for the injuries I had sustained through the British minister in Russia, which injuries it was impossible I should have suffered, if they had not been sanctioned by that minister. The noble Marquis is now in Court, and could contradict my statement if false, but I represent the circumstances as they really were, and not as personally concerning myself but as involving the honour of the British Government, I was referred by the Marquis to the Privy Council, and from the Privy Council to the Treasury; and thus baffled from one party to another,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181205130011"/> I applied to Mr. Perceval, during the session 1811, but received for answer, from his secretary, that the time for presenting private petitions was gone by, and that Mr. Perceval could not encourage my hopes, that he would recommend my claims to the House of Commons. I next memorialized his Royal Highness the Prince Regent, with a statement of my sufferings.</p>

               <p>I am, Sir, your most obedient servant, J. BECKETT."</p>
               <p>Some time afterwards I received an answer from Colonel M'Mahon, stating, that by some accident my petition was mislaid. I then wrote another petitition to his Royal Highness, and I understood it was referred to the Treasury, as appeared by a letter I received from Mr. Ryder at Whitehall. Gentlemen - under these circumstances I was plunged into ruin, and involved in debt; and the learned Attorney General has admitted there was not a spot on my character until this fatal catastrophe, which when I reflect on it I could burst into a flood of tears. I was totally refused any redress. Gentlemen, what would be your feelings - what would be your alternative; as the affair was national, and as his Majesty's Ministers recommended me backwards and forwards from one to another. I wrote another petition to his Royal Highness, but was informed by a letter from Mr. Ryder, that his Royal Highness had not been pleased to give any commands on the subject.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen. - As my petition was of a pecuniary nature I was informed by General Gascoyne, that it was impossible to come into the house without the consent of one of his Majesty's Ministers, for which I thank General Gascoyne for his politeness in giving me that information, and as I was very well known in Liverpool, I could have got the signatures of the whole town. I began to flatter myself I should get redress, but instead of redress, his Majesty's Ministers, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer told me I was not to expect any thing. I was obliged to give notice about six week since to the magistrates at the public office Bow-street, in a letter stating my grievances, intreating their interference, by application to Government, and adding, that if all redress was refused me, I must be obliged to do myself justice by taking such steps as those must be responsible for who resisted all my applications.</p>
               <p>(Here the prisoner read a letter to Mr. Read, of Bow-street.)</p>
               <p>To their Worships the Police Magistrates of the Public Office, Bow-street.</p>
               <p>"SIRS, I much regret it being my lot to apply to your Worships under most peculiar and novel circumstances, for the particulars of the case I refer you to the enclosed letter from Mr. Secretary Ryder, the notification from Mr. Perceval, and my petition Parliament, together with the printed papers herewith. The affair requires no further remark, than that I consider his Majesty's Government to have completely closed the door of justice, in declining to have or even permit my grievances to be brought before Parliament for redress, which privilege is the birth-right of every individual. The purport of the present, is, therefore once more to solicit his Majesty's Ministers, through your medium, to let what is right and proper be done in my instance, which is all I require. Should this reasonable request be finally denied, I shall then feel myself justified in executing justice myself, in which case I shall be ready to argue the merits of so reluctant a measure with his Majesty's Attorney General, wherever and whenever I may be called upon so to do; in the hopes of averting so abhorrent but compulsive an alternative,</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181205130012"/> I received an answer from Mr. justice Read, saying that the office could not interfere.

               <p>Finding myself thus bereft of all hopes of redress, my affairs ruined by my long imprisonment in Russia through the fault of the British minister, my property all dispersed for want of my own attention, my family driven into tribulation and want, my wife and child claiming support, which I was unable to give them, myself involved in difficulties, and pressed on all sides by claims I could not answer; and that justice refused to me which is the duty of government to give, not as a matter of favour, but of right; and Mr. Perceval obstinately refusing to sanction my claims in Parliament; and I trust this fatal catastrophe will be warning to other ministers. If they had listened to my case this court would not have been engaged in this case, but Mr. Perceval obstinately refusing to sanction my claim in Parliament I was driven to despair, and under these agonizing feelings I was impelled to that desperate alternative which I unfortunately adopted. My arm was the instrument that shot Mr. Perceval, but, gentlemen, ought I not to be redressed; instead of that Mr. Ryder referred me to the Treasury, and after several weeks the Treasury sent me to the Secretary of State's office; Mr. Hill informed me that it would be useless to apply to government any more; Mr. Beckitt added, Mr. Perceval has been consulted, he would not let my petition come forward.</p>

Mr. Perceval has unfortunately fallen the victim of my desperate resolution. No man, I am sure, laments the calamitous event more than I do. If I had met Lord Gower he would have received the ball, and not Mr. Perceval. As to death, if it were to be suffered five hundred times, I should prefer it to the injuries and indignities which I have experienced in Russia, I should consider it as the wearied traveller does the inn which affords him an asylum for repose, but government, in the injustice they have done me, were infinitely more criminal than the wretch, who, for depriving the traveller of a few shillings on the highway, forfeits his life to the law. What is the comparison of this man's offence to government? or, gentlemen, what is my crime to the crime of government itself? It is no more than a mite to a mountain, unless it was proved that I had malice propense towards the unfortunate gentleman for whose death I am now upon my trial. I disclaim all personal or intentional malice against Mr. Perceval.</p>

            . Q. Where do you reside - A. At Ringwood, near Southampton.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you arrive in London - A. Last night.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to come to London - A. I thought I knew more of Mr. Bellingham than any other friend that would come forward. I have known him from his childhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he live latterly - A. In Liverpool.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long ago it is that he left Liverpool to come to London - A. I think that he came at Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Does his wife and children now reside there - - A. Yes, they do.</p>
               <p>Q. What situation of life has he been in - A. Something in the mercantile Liverpool business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know his father - A. Yes, he died insane in Titchfield-street, Oxford-street; he died there in a state of insanity.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. Do you know that of your own knowledge - A. Yes, and my knowing of it was a great inducement of bringing me to London, and within this last three or four years it is known to myself and Mr. Bellingham's friends that he has been in a state of perfect derangement with respect to this business he has been pursuing.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had an opportunity of seeing him in London lately - A. No, not lately; it is more than a twelvemonth ago that I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time how was he - A. Deranged, when he spoke of this business.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know for what purpose he was in London at that time - A. Pursuing the same plan.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that had you seen him at Liverpool - A. I saw him at Liverpool about a year and a half ago.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state of mind was he at that time - A. He was in a deranged state when any thing of this was mentioned to him. I did not mention it to him because of the state of mind he was in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. This purpose of being in London a year ago was for the purpose of pursuing the same object, what do you mean by pursuing the same object - A. That of going to government for redress of grievances.</p>
               <p>Q. And to use your own words in you own opinion you considered he was in a state of perfect derangement - A. Yes, I do. He has been more than three years in a state of derangement, and since he has been in London he has been pursuing the same plan, and for a long time before that. When he was in Russia when he was pursuing the same object as soon as he returned home all his friends were well convinced that was the case.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you spoke of him as a married man - A. Yes, he has a wife, she carries on the millenery business at Liverpool.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose that he some male friends - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that he was engaged as a merchant - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any of the persons that he was engaged in business with - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know the name of any one person that he was in business with at Liverpool - A. No, not one. I was in the house with his family at Liverpool, I did not know any body that he was concerned in trade with. I was in the house more than a week. I would wish to mention one circumstance which strongly confirmed me in my opinion, and a strong mark of insanity. Two years ago last Christmas<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181205130013"/> he had been telling me of his great schemes that he had pursued, he said that he had realized more than an hundred thousand pounds, with which he intended to buy an estate in the west of England, and to take a house in London; I asked him where the money was, he said he had not got the money, but it was the same as if he had; for that he had gained his cause in Russia, and our government must make it good to him; this he repeatedly said to me and his wife, but neither she nor I gave any credit to it; he then told Mrs. Bellingham and myself, to convince us of the truth of it, he would take us to the secretary of state's office; he did so, and we saw Mr. Smith the secretary. When Mr. Smith came to us, he told Mr. Bellingham that if he had not known that he had ladies with him, he would not have come at all Mr. Bellingham then told him the reason he had brought us, that it was to convince us that his claim was just, and that he should very soon have the money. Mr. Bellingham said - Sir, my friends say that I am out of my senses, is it your opinion, Mr. Smith, that I am so, Mr. Smith said, it is a very delicate question for me to answer, I only know you upon this business, and I can assure you, that you will never have what you are pursuing after, or something to that effect. We then took our leave of Mr. Smith, and when we got into the coach, he took-hold of his wife's hand, and said, now I hope my dear, you are well convinced all will happen well, and as I wished, and as he had informed us, to which we felt indignant, that he should have taken us to an office, and made us appear in the light he did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is this ago, pray ma'am - A. This was last Christmas two years.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you stated that he has been in town from last Christmas - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he been staying in London all that time - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he been pursuing the same plan - A. I understood all along that he was here pursuing the same object at the public offices.</p>
               <p>Q. And upon that object you always considered him in a perfect state of derangement - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Smith received you with politeness and attention - A. Yes he did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you remain in town after that - A. Till the next midsummer.</p>
               <p>Q. In the same family with the prisoner - A. No, I saw him frequent.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he under any restraint at that time - A. Not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in habits of intimacy with his family - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If he was coersed you must have known it - A. I think I must.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had been any restraint do you think it would have happened without your knowing it - A. I do not know that it could.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he live when you were in London, at the time you went to the secretary's office - A. I think Theobald's road; his wife was in town then, she was on a visit with me.</p>
               <p>Q. And he was living by himself at the time that all his friends' thought him in a state of perfect derangement - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you state any period or month, or a week, or a single day, he was ever - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. At no period from his return from Russia - A. Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he been left to act upon his own will as much as me, or of any body else - A. Yes. I believe he was.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever communicate to the government that he was in a deranged state - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. After your visit to Mr. Smith, at the secretary of state's office he remained in town, and after that, either you nor his wife give any intimation to Mr. Smith that he was a deranged man, or to any of the officers of government - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it ago since you saw him - A. More than a twelve month ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it consist with your knowledge that he carried fire arms about him - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know him confined for a single day - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you form any judgment respecting the state of his mind ever since he came from Russia - A. It is my opinion that he has been disordered in his mind.

               <p>Mr. Attorney General. He came up from Liverpool to London he came up alone - A. Yes, he left his wife, and he came up alone, to the best of my knowledge, he told me that he was come on business.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley, counsel for the prisoner, directed the door-keeper to call at the door for the purpose of ascertaining whether any witnesses had arrived from Liverpool; shortly after, Mr. Sheriff Heygate announced to the bench that he had been informed two persons had, within the few last minutes, arrived from Liverpool in a post chaise and four, to give evidence in favour of the prisoner, these persons being admitted into court, looked at the prisoner, but declared he was not the person they supposed him to be; they mentioned the circumstance of their having heard of the apprehension of the prisoner, and knowing something of a person bearing his description, in whose conduct they had seen frequent marks of derangement.</p>
               <p>Lord Chief Justice Mansfield. Gentlemen of the jury, you are now to try an indictment which charges the prisoner at the bar with the wilful murder (here the learned judge was so hurt by his feelings, that he could not proceed for several seconds) of Mr. Spencer Perceval, (in a faint voice) who was murdered with a pistol loaded with a bullet; when he mentioned the name of (here again his lordship was sincerely affected, and burst into tears, in which he was joined by the greatest portion of the persons in court) a man so dear, and so revered as that of Mr. Spencer Perceval, I find it difficult to suppress my feelings. As, however, to say any thing of the distinguished talents and virtues of that excellent man, might tend to excite improper emotions in the minds of the jury, but would with-hold these feelings which pressed for utterance from my heart, and leave you, gentlemen, to form your judgment upon the evidence which has been adduced in support of the case, undressed by any unfair indignation which you might feel against his murderer, by any description, however faint, of the excellent qualities of the deceased. Gentlemen, you are to try the unfortunate man at the bar, in the same manner, as if he was arraigned for the murder of any other man. The law protected all his Majesty's subjects alike, and the crime was the same whether committed upon the person of the highest and most distinguished character in the country, as upon that of the lowest. The only question you have to try, is, whether the prisoner did wilfully and maliciously murder Mr. Spencer Perceval or not. It is not necessary to go very minutely into the evidence which has been produced to the fact, as there is little doubt as to the main object of your enquiry. The first thing you have to say is, whether the person charged with having murdered him; and whether that murder had been committed with a pistol bullet. The learned judge<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181205130015"/> then proceeded to read the testimony given by the several witnesses examined. That of Mr. Smith, surgeon Lynn, and Mr. Burgess, clearly substantiated the fact, that the deceased had died in consequence of a pistol shot which had been discharged into his breast, and that the hand of the prisoner was the hand which had discharged that weapon. With respect to the deliberation that had been proved by other witnesses, and from what I could collect from the prisoner's defence, it seems to amount to a conclusion, that he conceived himself justified in what he had done, by his Majesty's government having refused to redress some supposed grievances. Such dreadful reasoning could not be too strongly reprobated. If a man fancied he was right, and in consequence conceived that that fancy was not gratified, he had a right to obtain justice by any means which his physical strength gave him, there is no knowing where so pernicious a doctrine might end. If a man fancies he has a right, and endeavours to assert that right, is he to put to death the persons who refuses to give him any reparation to that which he supposes himself entitled. By the same reason every person who presided in a court of judicature refusing to give to a suitor in an action, what he requires, would be liable to revenge equally atrocious. In another part of the prisoner's defence, which was not, however, urged by himself, it was attempted to be proved, that at the time of the commission of the crime he was insane. With respect to this the law was extremely clear, if a man was deprived of all power of reasoning, so as not to be able to distinguish whether it was right or wrong to commit the most wicked, or the most innocent transaction, he could not certainly commit an act against the law; such a man, so destitute of all power of judgment, could have no intention at all. In order to support this defence, it ought to be proved by the most distinct and unquestionable evidence, that the criminal was incapable of judging between right or wrong. There was no other proof of insanity which would excuse murder, or any other crime. There are various species of insanity. Some human creatures are void of all power of reasoning from their birth, such could not be guilty of any crime. These is another species of madness in which persons were subject to temporary paroxysms, in which they were guilty of acts of extravagance, this was called lunacy, if these persons committed a crime when they were not affected with the malady, they were to all intents and purposes ameniable to justice: so long as they can distinguish good from evil, so long are they answerable for their conduct. There is a third species of insanity, in which the patient fancied the existence of injury, and sought an opportunity of gratifying revenge, by some hostile act; if such a person was capable, in other respects, of distinguishing right from wrong, there is no excuse for any act of atrocity which he might commit under this description of derangement. The witnesses who had been called to support this extraordinary defence, had given a very singular account, to shew that at the, commission of the crime the prisoner was insane. What might have been the state of his mind some time ago, was perfectly immaterial. The single question is, whether at the time this fact was committed, he possessed a sufficient degree of understanding to distinguish good from evil, right from wrong, and whether murder was a crime not only against the law of God, but against the law of his country. Here it appears that the prisoner had gone out like another man; that he came up to London by himself, at Christmas last, that he was under no restraint, that no medical man had attended him to cure his malady, that he was perfectly regular in all his habits, in short there was no proof adduced to shew that his understanding was so deranged, as not to enable him to know that murder was a crime. On the contrary, the testimony adduced in his defence, has most distinctly proved, from a description of his general demeanour, that he was in every respect a full and competent judge of all his actions. Having then commented on the evidence of Mrs. Clarke, Mrs. Billett, and

            , his Lordship concluded by advising the jury to take all the facts into their most serious consideration. If you have any doubt, you will give the prisoner the benefit of that doubt; but if you conceive him guilty of the crime alledged against him, in that case you will find him guilty.</p>

               <p>The jury, after a consultation of two minutes and a half in the box, expressed a wish to retire; and an officer of the court, being sworn, accompanied them to the jury-room. As they passed out, the prisoner regarded them separately with a look of mingled confidence and complacency. They were absent fourteen minutes; and on their return into court, their countenances acting as indices to their minds, at once unfolded the determination for which they had come. The prisoner again directed his attention to them in the same manner as before.</p>

            , you stand convicted of the wilful murder of the Right Honourable Spencer Perceval; what have you to say why the court should not give you judgment to die according to law.</p>
               <p>To this interrogatory the prisoner made no reply.</p>
               <p>The Recorder passed sentence in a most solemn and affecting manner, which was as follows: -</p>
               <p>"Prisoner at the bar! you have been convicted by a most attentive and a most merciful jury, of one of the most malicious and atrocious crimes it is in the power of human nature to perpetrate - that of wilful and premeditated murder! A crime which in all ages and in all nations has been held in the deepest detestation - a: crime as odious and abominable in the eyes of God, as it is hateful and abhorrent to the feelings of man. A crime which, although thus heinous in itself, in your case has been heightened by every possible feature of aggravation. You have shed the blood of a man admired for every virtue which can adorn public or private life - a man, whose suavity and meekness of manner was calculated to disarm all political rancour, and to deprive violence of its asperity. By his death, charity has lost one of its greatest promoters; religion, one of its firmest supporters; domestic society, one of its happiest and sweetest examples; and the country, one of its brightest ornaments - a man, whose ability and worth was likely to produce lasting advantages to this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181205130016"/> empire, and ultimate benefit to the world. Your crime has this additional feature of atrocious guilt, that in the midst of civil society, unarmed, defenceless, in the fulfilment of his public duty, and within the very verge of the sanctuary of the law, your impure hand has deprived of existence a man as universally beloved, as preeminent for his talents and excellence of heart. To indulge in any conjecture as to the motive which could have led you to the commission of this atrocious deeds, would be to enquire into all that is base and perfidious in the human heart. - Assassination is most horrid and revolting to the soul of man, inasmuch as it is calculated to render bravery useless and cowardice successful. It is therefore that the voice of God himself has declared,</p>
               <p>"that he that sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed." In conformity to these laws, which God hath ordained, and men have obeyed, your disgraced and indignant country, by the example of your ignominious fate, will appreciate the horror of your offence, and set up a warning to all others who might hereafter be tempted to the perpetration of a crime of so deep a dye. A short time, a very short time, remains for you to supplicate for that mercy in another world, which public justice forbids you to expect in this. Sincerely do I hope that the short interval that; has elapsed since the commission of this atrocious offence has not been unemployed by you in soliciting that pardon from the Almighty which I trust your prayers may obtain, through the merits of your Redeemer, whose first attribute is mercy. It only now remains for me to pass the dreadful sentence of the law, which is -</p>
               <p>"That you be taken from hence to the place from whence you came, and from thence to a place of execution, where <rs id="t18120513-5-punish27" type="punishmentDescription">

When I got into New Palace Yard, against the New Square, she got out first, she said, good night, and I said, good night. I put my hand into my pocket to pay the coachman his fare, I found my silver deficient, I paid the coachman eighteen pence, his fare, I followed the prisoner, she was not out of sight, I told her that she had robbed me, she said she had not. I told her if she did not return me my money what she had got, I would take her to the watch-house. The watchman came by at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the might was this. - A. Very near one o'clock, I told the watchman if this woman did not return me my money, I would give her in change, she still denied having any of my money. She was taken to the watch-house, I gave charge of her to the constable of the night, the constable searched her, and found the money upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you were rather in liquor. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you called the Hackney coach, and before you saw this woman, can you swear how much money you had in your pocket. - A. I had from forty to fifty shillings of silver in my pocket, and a dollar among the silver. There was ten shillings and sixpence left behind in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you should know the dollar again. - A. Yes, I think in the morning I saw two or three marks upon it, by which I should know it again. I did not know that I was robbed of a piece of brown paper until the constable brought it out in his hand, I told him if it was mine there were three one pound notes in it. I felt in my pocket, I found the brown paper was missing.</p>

I was in the act of throwing the brown paper away, Le Maire said, do not throw that away, because it contains three one-pound notes, I then opened it, and saw these three one-pound bank notes.</p>

Probably a week, or so on, he returned from that second journey, and went out on the western journey; he absconded from Andover; he wrote to me from Andover, the letter is dated 28th of September, 1811; in this letter he says that he shall be in London soon, in the course of a day or two. He did not return to London, he gave me no intimation that he had received it, nor is it entered in the book.</p>

On Friday afternoon, the 10th of April, between three and four o'clock, the prisoner came into my shop, she asked for a skein of thread, I gave it her, and before she quitted the shop a person came in for black ribbon, I shewed the black ribbon, and the prisoner stopped and looked at it, and at the same time she looked at the different ribbons and asked the prices, she told me she would have three quarters of a yard of narrow ribbon, and while I was doing up the ribbon for her, I turned my head aside to answer another person, she then took the ribbon that I had cut off the three quarters of a yard for her, she took the ribbon that I had done up for her and was going to leave the shop, she then said have I got my skein of thread? I said yes, and something else. I took hold of her hand that held up her apron, and in her hand was the ribbon. I then sent for an officer, and gave her in charge. I did not see her take it. She did enough for me to have suspicion.</p>

On the 18th of April, near five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the shop serving a lady, and the two prisoners came in and asked for ribbon, I shewed them the ribbon; after some time they said it would not do; they bid me good afternoon and went out, I looked at them as they went out, as we had reason to suspect them robbing us some time, I knew them by sight well, Edwards more than Phillips. I thought when I looked at them I saw a confusion in their countenances. I then looked at the things I had been serving, I saw a vacancy in the box of ribbons. I ran out into the street and overtook the prisoners, when I got up to them I stopped them and looked between them, I saw Edwards shew Phillips what she had taken from me. She had a fruit basket. I took hold of each of their arms and told them I would thank them to walk back with me, they asked me what for? I told them I thought they had no occasion to ask the question, they made fun, and said walk back; I said if they did not I should have them secured; when they came in the shop I took the velvet ribbon out of the basket, it had my private mark upon it, Mr. Parry came in and sent for a constable. The prisoner Edwards had a child with her, she said the child must have put it in the basket.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Edwards's Defence. I was going to market, I had the market basket in my hand, we went into Mrs. Parry's shop to buy some ribbon, she had none of the colour we wanted. I do not know which way the ribbon came into the basket, without the child put it in.</p>
               <p>Phillips's Defence. I know nothing about it.</p>

I gave her a few halfpence, she then left me and went down the court again. The watchman met me in the court and asked me if I had lost any thing? I clapped my hand to my fob and found my watch was gone. I gave charge of the prisoner to the watchman, he took her to the watch-house.</p>

I am a journeyman to, and I live upon Mr. Hooper's premises. I heard footsteps going up the court, it is no thoroughfare, I stepped out after it, and lost it, then about a quarter before ten o'clock we heard some footsteps come down the court again, when he came back I followed him out, he had got a deal upon his shoulder. I followed him into Aldersgate- him street, I then saw a watchman, I gave him in charge immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see where he took the deal from - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. What became of the other man - A. There was only one at the second time. I secured that man with the deal.</p>

I said my man should go with her; she took my man to East Lane, she told him they belonged to No. 5, Barker's Row, there were two No. 5. My man brought her back again, she said she lived in Helmet Place, Old Street; I was going to put down the direction; she first said No. 100, and afterward 124.

            . Q. What do you know about this business - A. The prisoner came on the 17th to our shop, she asked me leave to let her leave the things, I rather refused her at first, and as soon as she had liberty to leave them she put them down on the block; on the next day she came about one o'clock, she said that she came for the tub that she had the things in, I said if they are your's, but there was a man came in after you left the things and there was a bother about it; then my master came in and cross questioned her about it.</p>

On Tuesday the 21st of April, the prisoner, with another person, came into the shop and asked for some ribbon, and while she was looking at them another woman came in, wished to see some thread, and was very impatient, so much so that I suspected the three were companions together. The other woman said she was in an hurry, I said she should be served in her turn, I turned round quick suspecting the prisoner, I saw the prisoner very much confused; at the same time a person in the shop said that she had stolen something, I laid hold of her apron and found that she had half a piece of ribbon; the woman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181205130020"/> that was so impatient ran away. I stopped the prisoner and another woman and sent for Sapwell, who found the ribbon on her, she said by some accident it had fallen into her apron.</p>

            . I searched the prisoner, I found the ribbon mentioned in the indictment in her apron, I asked Mr. Bluck if that was his property, he said yes; since that I have dropped the ribbon out of my pocket, through some misfortune I have not got it to produce.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a private mark upon it - A. Yes, it was sworn to the next day before the Lord Mayor by Mr. Bluck.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Mr. Bluck) Are you sure that the ribbon that Sapwell shewed you had your private mark upon it - A. Yes, I do swear that it had my private mark, and it was my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I went into this gentleman's shop I asked to look at a bit of ribbon, I had some muslin in my apron, I looked at two piece of ribbons, I asked him to cut me a couple of yards off; a person that was there did shove against me and that ribbon fell into my lap, and before I could have time to take it out of my apron that gentleman took hold of me, he asked me what I wanted with the ribbon, he rolled it up in my apron and kept it there. I wish to see what is the property against me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. A neighbour had watched her, and came to tell me they were suspicious characters.</p>
               <p>Sapwell. When I lost the property I made it known to the Lord Mayor's clerk, and to Mr. Newman the solicitor; I called the several watchmen together in the parish, I told them I would give them a guinea if they could find the property or any body that did, and since then one of the watchmen went down to the Compter and let the prisoner know that I had lost the property. There was a fire at Mr. Mott's the soap boiler, I lost it out of my pocket; whether the hole in my pocket was cut or no I cannot say.</p>

            . I am a broker in Moorfields. On Thursday morning last, a neighbour of mine came to me and said, there goes two women that have stolen some carpet, I saw a part of the carpet hanging under the cloak of the prisoner, I asked the prisoner what she had got, I opened the carpet and there were two pieces of carpet; as I opened the carpet the label tumbled out. It is Mr. Bartlett's carpet, the carpet hung up in his window. It was known by some of my neighbours, so I sent for Mr. Mott and he sent for the owner, Mr. Bartlett. This is the carpet.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you lose this telescope - A. Last Saturday afternoon, the 9th of May, in the afternoon between five and six, the prisoner came into the shop for some relief. I am an overseer. She produced this pass to me as overseer, and while I turned my back to write my name on the back of the pass, she secreted a telescope; I had no suspicion of the telescope being gone, my wife assured me that she had taken something.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your wife present - A. She was not, she was in the parlour, the parlour door had glass windows.

I am the officer that took the prisoner, I had taken this woman about three hours before, she was drunk in the street, I put her in the watch-house and sobered her; when she went out she went to Mr. Banks's and stole this telescope, I put her in the watch-house and kept her there an hour to keep her from the boys, she had an hour's sleep and got sober.

               <p>Q. How long did she stay with you - A. She went out on the 13th of April, and never returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she pay for her lodging - A. No. She never returned. I missed a pair of sheets off the bed in which she slept, a pair of blankets, a bolster, a pillow, and a pair of pillow cases, and a chair, and tin and crockery ware and glass.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did she go out in the morning - A. I went down about nine o'clock in the morning and shut the street-door; I found it open. Her room door was open, that is how I missed the things. The prisoner lived below stairs. I applied to an officer, Mr. Gillman, I got some of my things again, but not all.</p>

             I am an officer of the Thames police. On the 13th of April Mrs. Warner applied to me, I could not hear any thing of the prisoner until the 18th, I then found the prisoner in a back room, Cock Hill, Ratcliffe. I found in the room a chair, and in the room three duplicates; I put the duplicates in my pocket. I asked her if she knew any thing of Mrs. Warner's things; she said, no. She said her name was not Griffiths. I then called Mrs. Warner in to identify her; I asked her if that was the woman that lodged with her; she said, yes, it was. I asked the prisoner whose duplicates them were; she acknowledged to pawning the things, and said she ment to get them out. I took her to the office, and desired the pawnbroker to attend with the things, and they are here now.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner at the bar coming to your shop about the middle of March last - A. To the best of my knowledge she is very much like her.</p>
               <p>COURT. She came into your shop, when - A. About the 14th or 15th of March. I recollect the woman coming to my shop before that time; I had given her change for a a pound note about a fortnight before that time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bosanquet. That must be about the beginning of March - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had seen the prisoner at the bar, and had given her change for a pound note - A. Yes, to the best of my recollection. I asked her no questions for that note, but gave her change. I saw her again about the 14th or 15th of March, she came into my shop, she asked for two ounces of tea, and a pound of sugar, I weighed her the tea, and gave her the sugar on the counter, and she presented me a one pound note in payment; I looked at her, and I thought I knew her again; I thought I had seen her in the shop before; I asked her name and place of abode; she gave me the name of Mr. George, No 9, Frederic-place, Hampstead-road, and that place not being above half a quarter of a mile from my house I did not scruple of taking the note at all; I took the note, and wrote upon it before I gave her the change.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this note, sir, and say whether that is the note - A. This is the note, it has my hand-writing upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, you say you believe that the person that gave you this note was the same person that gave you a note before - A. I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. You believe so. Have you any doubt that the prisoner at the bar is the person, from her features, and her height - A. I have no doubt that she is the same person, to the best of my knowledge and remembrance it is her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Can you swear positively it is her. Do not be in a hurry. Look in the woman's face - A. To the best of my recollection it is her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bosanquet. Do you mean the same person who uttered the former note as the person that gave you this note - A. Both.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that she is the person that uttered to you the second note, this note - A. No, she is the same person to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt upon the subject - A From all appearance I have no doubt of it. She was a stranger to me, though she was in my shop twice.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you observe what the gentleman means. I ask you whether you have any doubt upon the subject that the is the same person - A. I could not swear positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you, or not, swear positively that she is the same person that tendered the same note - A. I believe it is, from her appearance and her height, and her features, though she had a large bonnet on at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it - A. I can say no more than what I have said.</p>
               <p>Q. If you have a doubt say so; if you have not, say that. Look at the woman, and say whether you have a doubt or not - A. Why, I have not much doubt of it. I cannot say but I have some doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, do answer a plain question. Have you any doubt that she is the same person or not - A. Not much doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. I will have a direct answer - A. I have some doubt; not much doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have some doubt - A. Not having seen the woman but once before I have some doubt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You say, like an honest man, now, that you have a doubt - A. I can say no farther than to the best of my knowledge and recollection.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you mean to say that it is the same woman to the best of your knowledge and recollection - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q If you had met her in the street should you have known her to be the same woman - A. Not without I had taken particular notice of her.</p>
               <p>Q. I asked you if you had met her in the street, whether you should have known her to be the same woman - A. I believe I should.</p>

She gave me a one pound note. I took the note in my hand, and not finding the salvages smooth, there were two rough sides. I suspected the note. My wife said, where does the young woman live.

               <p>Q. It is your duty to examine all bank notes - A. It is.</p>
               <p>COURT. Will you tell me whether that is a genuine Bank of England note - A. It is not. It is a forgery altogether.</p>
               <p>COURT. It is not an impression from a bank plate - A. No. It is not the paper of the Bank, nor the signature it purports to be. The whole is a forgery. It is not the Bank of England ink.</p>
               <p>Q. In short, there is no part of it like what appertains to a Bank of England note - A. No, there is not.</p>

               <p>Q. to Glover. Is that a Bank of England note - A. No, it is a forgery throughout as the other I have been just describing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. This seems to me to be a most excellent note. It is a thing that a poor ignorant person would take for a Bank note - A. Surely.</p>
               <p>Q. It is impossible for any body to say it is a bad note that is not in your secret - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. A man that could read and write could not tell, much less a person that is ignorant, and no scholar, if they had not your secret - A. Surely.</p>

I took him in Somerset-place, and secured him. I took him to Bow-street, and he was committed. I have the handkerchief, I have kept it in my possession ever since. This is the handkerchief.

I am sure she is the same person. I had half a pound of sponge tied up in paper, lying on the counter, I went into the shop, almost up against the parlour door; I thought she might be a customer come to buy something. As I was not in the shop she turned herself about, as I thought to rest herself against the counter. I went out of the parlour to her; she turned herself from the place where the sponge lay, and went out of the door. I missed the sponge immediately, and I knew that she must have it; before she got out of the shop. When I came out of the parlour I looked on the counter, and saw the sponge. I let her go out into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. When you missed the sponge the prisoner was not gone out of the shop, why did not you seize the prisoner - A. I was a mind to see what she would do. I knew that she had got it. When she got out of the door she went down the street. I stood at my own door, and watched her. It is a short distance from my house to Ogle-street. She went up Ogle-street; I immediately ran after her and she went into a private house. That is the house where she lodged.</p>
               <p>Q. You guessed that she lodged there - A. Yes. I did not know it till afterwards. I stood a little time at some distance from the door waiting; I thought she might return back again. She came out again in the course of two minutes; she was coming the same road back to Foley-street. I came back, and stood in my own shop until she past the door, and when she came past I went out and laid hold of her. I asked her what she had done with the sponge that she had stolen out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181205130024"/> of my shop. She told me to be careful what I said; she never was in my shop in her life. I kept her in the house until a gentleman came past; his name is Sims. I charged him with the woman. He is a constable. He took her to the watchhouse. I went with him. At the watchhouse she gave the constable a key, and said that she had stolen the sponge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her it would be better for her to confess - A. I told her I would forgive her if she would confess. I saw her give the constable a key.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner to the watchhouse; she gave me a key to search her room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the room according to her directions - A. I did. I took Mr. Giles and another man along with me, and the landlady of the house. I opened the door of the room where she directed me; I found fifteen pieces of sponge under the bed. The prisoner said it laid under the bed.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is the sponge that lay upon my counter, that I made up in a parcel. That is the right number. I know the sponge well; I have trimmed it with shears. I am sure it is my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The gentleman said if I would confess he would give me a shilling, and I might go about my business. My lord, I leave myself entirely with you, and the gentlemen of the jury's mercy, and I pray for God's sake you will shew mercy.</p>

I asked the little boy where he was when the prisoner stole the things; he told me that the prisoner came and knocked him down. This he said in the prisoner's presence. The prisoner said nothing. He said, when the man stole the things, he called his father, and told him a man has stolen a coat, and his father ran out and saw the prisoner going round the corner with the things on his arm; he brought them back into the shop.

I asked the prisoner what he wanted; I asked him the second time what he wanted; he gave no answer neither the first time nor the second, and perceiving him going away I supposed he was a robber. I immediately ran after him.</p>

               <p>Q. Does your pantry go through the area - A. Yes. There is a passage door, and the pantry is further on. There is an area-door, and two other doors before you come into the pantry.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you to say that you saw him come out of the pantry - A. I did, and upon seeing him go off I ran after him, and came up to him in Duke-street. I took him by the collar into a public-house, into the tap-room; I immediately sent for my master, and likewise for Taunton, an officer of Bow-street; he searched him, and found the property on him in my presence. A silver wine strainer was found on him, and a metal seal.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to know of your own knowledge that this wine strainer was in the pantry - A. I am certain of it. I had been decanting wine five minutes before, and used the wine strainer.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the seal there - A. I bought it a little while ago, and it laid on the shelf. I had seen the seal on the shelf not half an hour before the prisoner came out of the pantry. The prisoner was secured.</p>

            . On the 17th of April last I was returning from our barge builders, on the south side of the river Thames, to the north side. I saw a man taking coals out of a barge.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the barge lay - A. About fifty yards below Mr. Wood's wharf, on the Middlesex side of the river.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner one of the men - A. He was, it was about eight o'clock in the morning. I rowed the boat towards them. I saw one man in the barge, and the prisoner in the boat alongside of the barge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man in the barge doing any thing with the coals - A. I saw the man in the barge lift a basket of coals up three times on the gunnel, the prisoner each time took the basket off the gunnel; I saw the prisoner shoot the coals out of the basket in the boat. I immediately rowed alongside of the boat, I stepped into the boat where the prisoner was in. I said to the prisoner you must go along with me immediately to our wharf, you have been taking coals out of this barge.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the man that was with him - A man of the name of Groves was in the head room of the barge, when I seized the prisoner the prisoner clung to the barge, to hold the boat alongside of the barge, for the other man to step into the boat. Groves came upon the gunnel of the barge, I found he wanted to get into the boat along with the prisoner. I shoved the boat off the barge; the prisoner begged very hard for me to let the other man come in. I took one scull away and immediately rowed the prisoner to Mr. Wood's wharf, and before I got to the wharf the other man that was in the barge called a boat along side and was rowed over the water. I rowed the prisoner into our dock, and sent for Mr. Wood. An officer came to take the prisoner into custody, and while the officer was there we took the coals out of the boat and put them into two sacks, these coals were the property of Messrs. Wood and Co.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

On the 23d of April, about half past four o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop and requested to look at some black ribbons; the drawer was produced, and by her manner I rather suspected her. She then enquired for black figured ribbons; I told her I had no black figures - she was perhaps ten minutes at the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew her any thing besides the black ribbons - A. No. There were three pieces on the counter, she conveyed one piece to the edge of the counter, in her clothes; she endeavoured to hide that piece by the corner of her shawl; she then said none of them would answer her purpose, my answer was, very well; I put the drawer in its place, and she went out; I followed her to the door, and when the shawl was attempted to be thrown over the ribbon, I saw a white paper on the ribbon, and as she got off the step of the door I took hold of her arm, and said what have you done with the ribbon, she said she had got none: I brought her back into the shop, and at the same time the witness Turner gave me the ribbon, and said, sir, I believe this is your ribbon. She strongly denied that she ever meddled with the ribbon.

               <p>Q. You went into the shop did not you - A. Yes; I heard the prisoner deny having the ribbon, I asked her how she could deny it when I saw her drop it.</p>

The bedstead was then lifted up by the other servant, and from under the bedstead was produced a table-cloth and a bit of India muslin, and a small piece of brown Holland.

She asked her what she had throwed under the bed, the prisoner said it was only a bit of brown Holland; she then called master up. The prisoner crept under the bed and tried to conceal them, and master brought out a table-cloth from under the bed; mistress said, good God! here is my table cloth.

The constable took all my duplicates from me. My mistress never missed a sheet.</p>

On searching the drawer in the prisoner's apartment, I found a petticoat and pocket, Mrs. Smith said they were part of her property. I asked her what she had done with the rest of the property, she began crying, and said she had pawned them; she directed me to Mr. Morrits, and to Mr. Dry's; I found the shirts at Morrits's and several articles at Mr. Dry's, which Mr. Dry's man will produce. Mr. Morrits's gave the shirt up. The shirt has been in my possession ever since, and the petticoat.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he ever work for you - A. Yes, but not at that time. In searching the premises we found a gun.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at home - A. No, his wife was in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a married man - A. Yes, he lives in a room over a stable; we searched this room; we found the gun in the cieling that covered his bed room. The officer took the gun. The prisoner came home in about an hour, we took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, when Townrow brought you the caddy, what did you do with the caddy - A. I kept it at home, and when we took the prisoner to Bow-street, I took the caddy there, I produced it to the magistrate, and then the officer had it. The officer's name is Salmon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. I think you said it was six o'clock when you came down stairs - A. Yes it was quite light then, I was the first person up in the house. The prisoner had been in my employ, I entertained a good opinion of him till this time. I value the tea-caddy at twenty five shillings, and the gun at three pounds.</p>

A young man of the name of King, called upon me, after he called upon the prisoner for a small debt, this young man had the caddy of him for that purpose, he is here, he brought me the caddy; I knew the caddy to be Mr. Hopkins's, I was with him when he bought it; he gave one pound sixteen shillings for it.</p>

               <p>Q. You know the prisoner - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was indebted to you for a small sum of money, was not he - A. Not my debt, it was my father's; my father gave me the bill to carry to him, because I lived nearer than he did; I gave him the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181205130028"/> bill about a month or six weeks ago; I met him in Oxford-street; I gave him the bill, and made demand for payment. He told me he could not pay it; then he asked me where I lived. He said he would call at my house in three weeks time. I called at his house on Sunday the 3d of May; he never called at my house on the Sunday before I had the caddy.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, before you gave the caddy to Townrow you called upon him the 3d of May he was not at home - A. I saw his wife; she told me if I would come up on Tuesday evening following I might depend upon having the money.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the amount of the bill - A. Twelve shillings and four pence. I called on the Tuesday, and he could not pay me then. He was at home; he wished me to come up on the Sunday following and measure him for a pair of shoes, and then he would positively pay me. He told me he could not pay me then, he had made a caddie for a person, and that person was to call at twelve o'clock on that day, and as the person had not called that was the reason that he could not pay me. He shewed me the caddy. I left his house then, and went to Mr. Townrow; I told him what I had seen; he asked me what kind of a caddy it was; I told him. He advised me to go, and purchase the caddy.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of his advice did you go back to Goff - A. Yes, the same evening, and I met Goff's wife at the door. I told his wife if the person had not come for the caddy while I had been away I would purchase it, if he had no objection. Goff was there himself. They readily agreed for me to have the caddy. I offered to pay nine or ten shillings then besides the bill, and when I had made Goff's shoes I would pay the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that the bargain was made, was it - A. Yes. He tied the caddy in a pocket handkerchief himself, and that same hour I carried the caddy to Townrow. That is all I know of it.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember going with Mr. Hopkins to the house of the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes, on the 6th of May. The prisoner was not at home. In searching the loft, there is a temporary room built in the loft, the top of the room does not reach the top of the loft.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a little room parted off from the loft - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The top of which does not touch the ceiling - A. It does not. On the top of this room I found a gun, between that and the ceiling.</p>
               <p>Q. So that it was not visible to the eye - A. No, it was too high; I was obliged to get up on a trunk to get it down.</p>
               <p>Q. You got up on the trunk - A. Yes, and then I saw it handed to the prosecutor the moment the prosecutor saw the gun; he said, this is my gun, I can swear to it. I have had the gun in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. The prisoner was not there - A. No. This is the gun, and these pistols I found upon the mantle-piece, they were loaded with powder and ball, (I have since drawed the charge), and a powder horn with powder and ball in it. I was not present at the apprehending of the prisoner. I was obliged to return to Bow-street to attend an examination.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I was present at the search of the house. I had the search warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose Salmon has given a true account of what was found there - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You apprehended the prisoner, did you - A. Yes, on the 6th of May; on the same day. I apprehended him in the stable, before he same up stairs, as he was coming in; I ordered him to go up stairs. I was searching his pockets, I found nothing in his pockets. He said, this is through going into bad company. I neither encouraged him, nor used any threats at all. He said, this is the instigation of being in bad company; it has brought me into this. I found these things, a dark lanthorn, and phosphorus box, before he came home, they were hid under the boards in the bed-room. One of the boards had been taken up, and was loose; I lifted up the board and found the dark lanthorn and phosphorus box, matches and skeleton keys, a picklock key, a centre bit, and a small chissel, and a wrenching tool, and some duplicates I found upon the mantle piece that I believe is his own property.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. to prosecutor. When you got up about six o'clock you found your doors open, did you examine the door to see if any violence had been used to get in - A. I did. The house door was locked on the inside; he unlocked it after he got it. I left the key in the door. I could see that they got in at the window; the square of glass in the centre of the sash was broken; the sashes were double hung; the top sash came down, and the bottom sash lifted up. The lower pane of glass in the top sash was broken, so that any person by a hand might open the fastening of the sash, and when the sash was unhasped they might throw up the lower sash, and a block of wood was placed outside to enable them to get in. The tea caddy is mine; the lock was taken off, and put on again without any screw; I took the lock off to get a key to it, and put the lock on again without any screws, and it was without any screws when I found it. The gun is mine, it has a stop lock, and the same name, and the end I have had new steeled. I brought this gun into the parlour for a young man coming out of the country to clean on the Saturday; and the tea-caddy I had seen there a day or two before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking on the Saturday morning previous to my being detected on the Wednesday, I met a young man, he said he was going into the country; he asked me to put some things bye for him; I told him, I could. On the Sunday morning he brought them. When he produced the things I did not much like to have them, but did not like to deny, having promised to take care of them for him. I took up a board in the floor, and put them under. I did not like my wife's mother to see them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I saw some hats in the privy, they had no business to be there. That was about the 17th of April. I watched and saw that they decreased. I saw the prisoner come from the privy and go out. After the prisoner went out I went to the privy, and there was one hat gone. He was gone from the shop about an hour. When he returned I spoke to him. In the course of an hour or two I asked him how he could think of robbing me in the way he had done a considerable time. His answer was, he hoped I would let him go. He pleaded his family, and said he had six children. I told him, as he had robbed me in that kind of way I could not think of letting him go. I sent for the constable. He delivered to the constable five duplicates.</p>

            . I am a fellowship-porter. On the 5th of May, before ten o'clock, I happened to go into the tap-room, I saw that the prisoner had something of a bulk; I hit her over the thigh. I told her I suspected she had got something there that was not her own; she made no answer; in the space of three quarters of a minute she dropped three pint pots; they were all three clean ones. They had not had any beer in them. She was taken into custody immediately. I picked up the pots, there is the name of

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Tuesday morning I went out to a day's washing; I came home about eight o'clock in the evening; there was a letter when I came home, for my husband to go and bottle off wine. I went to Mr. Child's tap-room to see my husband, to give him this letter; my husband told me to get a pint of beer; that man came to me and said, you have got something that does not belong to you. I said, I had nothing but my pocketbook and a few halfpence; they searched me and found nothing. I go out a charring to gentleman's houses, and wish to get my bread in an honest manner.</p>
               <p>Q. to French. Are you quite sure that you felt the pots before she was searched - A. Yes. I turned up her apron, she had got a very large pocket, big enough to hold a bushel of corn.</p>

            . I am one of the marshalmen. I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner at Mr. Barton's house; I found the prisoner at work there, painting. I told the prisoner that I had a very unpleasant circumstance to relate to him, that Mr. Barton was suspicious that he had taken a twenty pound note out of his desk. The prisoner said he knew nothing of it. I told him I must search him. I did search him, and found nothing upon him of consequence but a key; I asked him what key that was; he said, it was the key of the door; I told him I must search his apartment; I took him with me, and went to the room in Camomile Mews. I opened the door with that key.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body there - A. No one. There was nobody in the room when we entered it; his wife was not at home. I then proceeded to search. The first thing I searched was a chest of drawers, or a bureau; the first thing I found, that Mr. Barton identified, was a case of instruments, which I produce; he claimed it, and he said it was in the desk where the money was. I then found a pocket-book in the same drawer, it contained ten one-pound bank notes. I enquired of the prisoner, before that time, if he had any money in the house; he said he had a little. Upon looking at them notes I found each note had a particular stamp at the back, as if they all came from one person. I said to Mr. Barton, I am satisfied that this is part of the property; he has changed the note. The prisoner said nothing. We then proceeded to search further, and in a deal box, not locked, lay the steelyard-beam; Mr. Barton identified it. I then asked the prisoner, whose box it was; he said it was either his brother-in-law's, or a relation's; I cannot say which, but I think, a brother-in-law's. I found nothing more until his wife came in, when we had nearly closed the search. I ceased from searching, and began to look at her; the prisoner was standing by; I asked her if she had got any money in the house; she said she did not know of any, except a trifle that she had in her pocket, a three-shilling piece, and a eighteen-penny piece, and a trifle of silver. I found by the receipts that they had paid away, from Saturday night before, several pounds. I asked her what money her husband brought her home on Saturday night; she said, a guinea and a half. This was the Thursday. I told her I found by the receipts I had in my hand that they had paid away more money than that; she said, that was accounted for by a pound note she had saved up previous; but that did not account for the whole of the money. I then asked her if she had not got some money in her pocket; she said no, only that trifle of silver. I told her to empty her pockets; she did, and pulled out this pocket-book, and in the pocketbook was ten one-pound notes, that makes twenty one-pound notes found in the house; they were all bank notes. Upon examining the notes, I found they answered with the description of the stamp that the others had; they were all stamped. I then asked her how she came by them; she said she had them from her mother, as she was with child, and an expensive time was coming on. I told her I was satisfied how she came by them, and asked her where she had changed the twenty pound note; she said, at the bank that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Her husband heard all this, did he - A. Yes. I then asked her of whom she had the twenty pound note; she hesitated a moment, and said, I must say my husband; he made no reply. I asked him how he came to do so; he said he had an expensive time coming on; he had been out of work some time, and he took it to carry him through his expences.</p>


               <p>Q. Did you go to the Bank afterwards - A. I did not; the prosecutor did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the wife appear to be far advanced in her pregnancy - A. Very near her time.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you change a twenty pound note with any person on the 23d of April - A. A person of the name of Thompson changed a twenty pound note. I cannot say whether it was a man or a woman.</p>
               <p>Q. What number was it - A. I have only the entries<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181205130031"/> of the numbers which were given for the twenty pound note. When I changed it I entered the number of the notes for which it was paid. The party who changed that note had twenty single one-pound notes. I saw the twenty one-pound notes before the Lord Mayor, and they corresponded with the notes I gave for the twenty pound note; their numbers are, 57,758, 28th of September; 18th of February, 38,657; 3d of March, 7,079; there is two of that date; the other is 75,229: 29th of February, 33,150.</p>

I only know the note by the name. The twenty pound note is in the custody of Mr. King. I neither knew the number or date of the twenty pound note. We have the name and residence of every note we change. I only know the twenty pound note by the name of Thompson; I have no doubt it is the identical note for which I gave the person them twenty one-pound notes. I only entered the name.

I stopped the prisoner; he said he had no property belonging to Mrs. Neal. He dropped the bundle and got away from me, and made a run down the alley, and up Peter-street. I lost sight of him until I got to Peter-street. I am sure he is the same man. I never saw him before that morning. I took part of the property from him in Dunning's-alley; the book, the scales and weights, and the razor, out of his pocket. I have kept the bundle ever since.

               <p>Q. You were surrounded by five or six men - A. Yes; it was a moonshiny morning, very light; my arms were pinioned by some of them, and the prisoner pulled at my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at him; are you sure that he was the man that was pulling at your watch - A. Yes, I am positive that he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he before he was able to get the watch out of your fob. Did you lay hold of your watch - A. Yes, I clapped both my hands to my watch, to prevent it going from me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think the struggle might continue before he was able to wrench it from your person - A. From three to five minutes; and, by the violence of the pull, when he did get it out, he fell backwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the people still continue to pinion your arms - A. No; as soon as the watch went I received a blow on my face; it did not knock me down; the prisoner got up and ran away, and I after him, and cried out watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did the prisoner run - A. Down William-street, along King Edward street, and when I got into King Edward street, he ran into Bridge-street again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he out of your sight at all - A. No. I pursued him, and cried out watch, and a fireman stopped him in Bridge-street. I was nearer to him then than I am now; I never lost sight of him at all.</p>

I said, that is the man that has got my watch; he said he had not got the watch, and offered to strip himself, and he ran from the fireman across the road.</p>

            . I am a fireman. I was in Bridge-street upon this morning. I was going to fetch an engine for a fire at Ratcliffe. I heard the cry of watch. I saw the prisoner in Bridge-street. I do not know exactly what street he came out of; he was in Bridge-street when I saw him. I saw the prosecutor follow him. I took to my heels and overtook him, and stopped the prisoner in Bridge-street. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181205130033"/> prosecutor gave charge of the prisoner for having stolen his watch. The prisoner broke from me once. He said he was not the man they were calling after, he was running the same as other folks - he got away, but he did not get out of my sight. I picked up the watch, it laid about four or five yards from him, in the direction he had been moving; it was in a spot he had passed by in running before I stopped him.

               <p>Q. Do you know the person of the prisoner - A. No; I never saw him before he was delivered to me at the watchhouse. I have kept the watch ever since. This is the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at the watch; is that the watch that was taken from your pocket that morning - A. Yes, I can swear this is my property; I have had the watch about eleven years.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gardner. At the time that you stopped the prisoner, did he tell you there was any gentleman by, who would prove his innocence - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. All I can say, is, I am innocent; and I believe it is well known I am innocent. I know within myself I am innocent. And as to saying I ran away from Mr. Gardner, that is false; the prosecutor was in liquor I think.</p>

Four one-pound Bank of England notes, and a twenty-pound bill of exchange; and about eight hundred pound of accompts, but not money, only receipts. While I was looking at my watch I turned round; a gentleman pointed the prisoner as the man that had taken my pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the prisoner from you - A. About two or three yards. I took the prisoner myself. I felt a hand in my pocket before I turned round. A gentleman said, what is the matter. I said, my pocketbook is gone. He said, there is the man that took it. I seized hold of the prisoner. I have never seen my pocket-book since; it was handed off.

               <p>Q. Did you happen to be in Exchange-alley at the time this matter happened - A. I had been to Barclay's the bankers, and coming from there, I saw the prisoner and another person attempting the captain's pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whether they took any thing from it - A. Not at the time: I followed him from Birchin-lane into Exchange-alley: I was going that way and I followed them. I followed them through King's Arms-buildings into Exchange-alley again. I saw the prisoner next to the prosecutor, and another person behind him; his companion was with him when I first saw him. I saw the prisoner take the pocket-book out of the left hand pocket of the captain: the prisoner put his hand back. I thought he was putting it into his own pocket: I immediately went out of the alley and saw the prosecutor; he said he had lost his pocket-book. I said, that is the man I saw take it.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the companion - A. I did not see the companion go off; the prisoner was rubbing his face. The captain stopped the prisoner, and took him to the Mansion House.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I have some slight recollection of him from the distance of the time; I saw him but very little.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember upon what occasion you saw him - A. Purchasing stock.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the stock receipt, is that your writing - A. That is the entry of my clerk at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy in any stock of that amount on that day - A. I did; it appears to be in December, 1806.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he bought in some stock upon his own account at that time - A. He did, two hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, on the 17th of April, 1807, seeing the prisoner again. Look at the transfer of April, 1807, is that your signature - A. That is my hand-writing, as witness to the identity of the persons who transfered the stock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sell both the two hundred pounds that day - A. The tranfer of both were made at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner the person who came to transfer, or did any other person come with him - A. Another person.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the prisoner that employed you to sell the stock, or the other person that came with him - A. Him. He was the only person that employed me, and is the only person that I mean.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner sign the transfer in your presence - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, Miller, introduce the other person to you, and how did he introduce him - A. As Brissenden, to make the transfer in the usual way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I believe, sir, as soon as a broker identifies the person to whom the transfer is made he is responsible to the Bank. If you introduce a person to the Bank you do not think you are responsible, do you - A. I am not aware of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. In consequence of this person employing you and Brissenden, what did you do - A. I afterward deducted the commission, and gave him a draft of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that draft, is that the draft - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the amount of that draft - A. It is composed of both the two hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>COURT. You gave it to Miller - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You are a stock-broker. In the course of the last five years how many transfer of stocks were you a witness to - A. A great number.</p>
               <p>Q. Thousands. Have you any doubt - A. A very considerable number.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the persons of all those for whom you transfer stock - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. You began by telling us that you had a faint recollection of the prisoner himself - A. Respecting him I have a faint recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted that faint recollection is, you have seen him at a time when you have transacted business with him - A. Yes, I have.</p>


               <p>Q. Now, sir, I ask you whether your recollection respecting him goes any further than this, that upon some occasion you have seen him - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what you have been telling us of his employing you, and his introducing Brissenden, is what you have formed your opinion from these papers - A. Yes, of having bought and sold stock.</p>
               <p>Q. It appears that you are a witness; that you vouched to the Bank of the persons of a Miller and a Brissenden - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other knowledge than that a person of the name of Miller having introduced a Brissenden - A. I have no other knowledge, that I furnished the stock to him than from my own books.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, you vouched to the Bank that the person that came there, and signed, was Brissendon; now, have you any recollection of any such a person on your mind - A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether he was a tall man, a lusty man, or a short man, you cannot tell me - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I ask you, whether you have any recollection of Miller as identifying that particular transaction - A. I have a faint recollection that this is the same man that employed me. If I had met him in the street I should not have known him.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing this to be the same man, sir, have you any recollection of the person of the prisoner, as applying to the first purchase of the stock - A. A very faint one. If I had met him in the street I should not have known him.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell me whether Brissenden was a black man, or a white man, can you - A. I have no recollection of that circumstance.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Mr. Jones, as you cannot tell me whether Brissenden was white or black, can you recollect that Brissenden was introduced to you by any person - A. I suppose Miller introduced him at my office.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you do not speak of the circumstance<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181205130035"/> of a person being introduced to you by a person of the name of Miller; how can you recollect that when you do not recollect whether Brissenden was a white man or a black man - A. I do not recollect Brissenden at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me how it is possible that you can recollect that Brissenden was ever introduced by any other person - A. I do not recollect whether he was or was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. In the first place your recollection of Miller is faint with respect to both transactions - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had seen Miller twice - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Miller recommended to you or did you know him before - A. He was recommended to me.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that your memory goes faintly to remember him in these two transactions - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. And (be it who it will) the same person that bought was the same person that transferred, are you quite sure of that - A. Yes, I am.</p>

            . I am a shoe-maker; I live in King-street, Maidstone. I am a member of the benefit club there; I am one of the secretaries now; I was one of the stewards in 1807.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember in the year 1807 the prisoner paying any dividend - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. What sum - A. Two hundred in the 3 per cents. In November, 1807, he paid me, on the behalf of the society, the dividend of two hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any application to him after that time; any desire to sell that stock - A. I wrote a letter to him.</p>
               <p>COURT. You wrote to him to sell it - A. Yes, at the request of the society. I received an answer to that letter.</p>
               <p>(The letter read.)</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present any time in January 1812, when the prisoner's brother paid any money to Goodwin and Woodward - A. I was. They were the stewards at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money was it - A. Five pound eight shillings; that is, a year's dividend, deducting the income tax, on account of the society.</p>
               <p>Q. That was Miller's brother - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you asked the prisoner at any time to sell the stock - A. He called on me personally, nigh two months back, in this year, merely to know what we wanted to do with the money in the funds. One question he put to me was, whether I understood what money we had in the funds, because I mentioned in my letter two hundred pounds. I told him I understood it very well, two hundred pounds stock. He asked me what we intended to do with the money; I told him the club had come to no resolution what to do with it. He said he would not sell out; his objection then was because the stocks were then low; he asked me what was better than Bank of England security. I told him I considered for my own part that we had not got Bank of England security for our money. I told him I considered it necessary that Mr. Brissenden, and him should sign some instrument to prove, in case either of them should die, that the money belonged to the society, not to them. I asked him if he would be willing to sign an instrument of that kind if the society should think proper to let it remain in the funds, as the stocks were then low; he said he would.</p>
               <p>Q. This conversation took place about two months ago - A. Yes, since the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing about any letter that he had written to you - A. I do not remember that.</p>

               <p>SIR,</p>
               <p>I received your letter respecting the money in the funds, which I should have answered before, but waited to see what you would do with the money, as I have received two letters, one before yours, and one since. One letter informs me that the club intends to divide four hundred pounds among its members.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181205130036"/> The other letter said the club intended to draw all the money out in bonds, and place it in the Kentish bank, and left me to think which is the safest, the Kentish bank or the bank of England. When you appoint a safer place, then it shall be sold out, and not before that.</p>

The prisoner was brought to me in January last: I think so. I cannot fix the precise month: I did not pay much attention to it. I told the woman there was a regular complaint alledged against her, for having received the wages of Charles Serjeant. She asserted, that she was the lawful sister of the seaman. She did not deny receiving the wages. She said she was the lawful sister, and next of kin to

She did produce a certificate of marriage, but to me it appeared that her maiden name was not Serjeant. She accounted for this by stating, that she had been married before, in Ireland; but she had no certificate of this first marriage. She was taken to Bow-street.</p>

               <p>COURT. The question here is, whether she has falsely taken this oath. The oath is proved to be taken; and the fact is proved, that she is no relation; and Dr. Dobree has stated, that administration is never granted without the oath.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 17th of April last had you any occasion to send any letter to Messrs. Harding, Oakes, and Company, at Tamworth - A. Yes; I sent four; they were directed to Messrs. Harding, Oakes, and Company, Tamworth; and in one of these four letters there were enclosed thirty notes of five pounds each.</p>
               <p>Q. Read the contents of that letter - A.</p>
               <p>"Enclosed are thirty five-pound notes: London, April 17, 1812."</p>
               <p>Q. In what way did you seal that letter - A. With two wafers.</p>
               <p>Q. Any sealing wax at all - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with that letter and the other three - A. They were put on the junior clerk's desk, Mr. Ariel, before him, these four letters were.</p>
               <p>Q. Produce your book if you please; you have a book containing the numbers of these thirty notes - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is No. 4,927 one of those thirty - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is No. 4,952 one other of those notes - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. These notes are notes that are issued from the country; they are sent to you to be paid for, and then they are sent back to Tamworth to be issued - A. Yes; they are country bank-notes.</p>
               <p>Q. They are made payable at your house in town, and payable at the other house in the country - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said these letters were put before Mr. Ariel, he is a junior clerk - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They were put before him on a desk; were they mixed with others? Were there other letters on the desk at the time - A. Yes, there were.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these four letters unsealed - A. I think the four letters were sealed with wafers; three of them I sealed myself, and one was to be copied; the one in question was wafered.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there were other letters on the desk - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether they were wafered - A. I do not know whether they were or were not; only the three that I put there myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mears. Look at this; is that another of the four letters - A. Yes; that was also sent off at the same time; that is sealed with a wafer.</p>
               <p>Q. You have another small book in your possession I believe - A. Yes; it contains the numbers of the notes; I wrote it myself.</p>
               <p>"Fourth cover, sent by post, containing one hundred and fifteen notes."</p>
               <p>Q. There were not any others that evening but these four letters to be sent to Tamworth bank - A. Not any others than these four.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you at home at your banking-house on the 18th of April - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any letters from the London Post that day, by your correspondent Doriel - A. I did; three, and no more; they contained notes. There was a letter of advice with them, they were all the notes that day that we received; they corresponded, but one cover was deficient.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your letter of advice give you reason to expect there was another cover wanting - A. Yes. The letter is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did another arrive by the Post on the next day - A. It did, by the Post, on the 19th; from the same persons: it contains merely these words:</p>
               <p>"enclosed are thirty five-pound notes. London, 17th of April, 1812."</p>
               <p>Q. I observe upon that letter there is the appearance of wafer and wax - A. There is. It came to me in that state, both wafered and waxed.</p>
               <p>Q. How many notes did it actually contain - A. Twenty-eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there among others a note No. 4,927 - A. No such number arrived.</p>
               <p>Q. Did 4,952 arrive - A. No, all the notes of which I had advice arrived except the two, No. 4,927, and No. 4,952; and these two had been subtracted from the letter which arrived on the 19th; it had the London post-mark on that letter, 18th April, very plain.</p>
               <p>Q. These notes that were thus sent down to you were the notes that had been paid by your correspondents, Messrs. Doriel - A. They had.</p>
               <p>Q. When they are returned to you, your regular course is to issue them again - A. Exactly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you issue them in precisely the same form - A. Precisely.</p>
               <p>Q. They bear no marks, as payable at the house of Doriel and Co. - A. None whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a note, No. 4,927; tell me whether that is one of your notes - A. Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the date of it - A. 28th of March, 1812.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you more than one note of that number and date in circulation - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbot. What length of time is allowed you by Act of Parliament to re-issue these notes - A. Three years for fives and tens. There is nothing done by us to know that they have been issued; no mark whatever.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181205130040"/> MR. RAVENHILL. I am a linen-draper. I live in Beech-street, Barbican. On the 21st of April the prisoner came to me, and purchased goods to the amount of two pounds and a penny; for which he tendered me a five-pound Tamworth bank-note.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the number of the note he first offered to you - A. I cannot state positively, that this is the first note. I believe it was. I rather objected taking it. I cannot say that this is the number of the note he first tendered me, because I had two in my hands. I asked him if he could not let me have bank of England, or something similar. He told me that he had nothing but a note of the same description; he then produced to me another note of the same description.</p>
               <p>Q. And are you certain that that note which you hold in your hand, was one of the notes - A, Yes. 4,927, that is the one I hold in my hand. I asked him his address; he said his name was

I asked him where he was at when in town, he gave me the Blossoms Inn, Lawrence-lane; he said he was well known there; he said he slept at Hackney the night before. I gave him three one-pound bank notes in change. He went away; after which I had occasion to go into the city: I took this note and presented it for payment at Messrs. Doriel's. They refused paying it, saying it had been stolen out of a letter with another note. One of the gentlemen at Messrs. Doriel's went with me to the Post Office. I went from thence to Mr. Parkin's house in Ormond-street, and the next evening I went again to the General Post Office; and after I had been seme few minutes in the Post Office I identified the prisoner as the person that paid me the note; him and several others were in the room at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him there when you first went into the room where the others were - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any person point out to you any particular man - A. No. I selected him from many others. I have no doubt that he was the person that purchased the goods of me.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner there on his duty that evening - A. He was. His employment, in the early part of the evening, was to face letters; that is, to put the letters all with the directions downwards.</p>

               <p>COURT. Does the stamp always denote the time of the letters going off - A. The day only. Facing is the first thing that is done to letters after they come into the office, and the next thing is stamping, and then sorting them.</p>

On Monday night, the 11th of May, I had occasion to go out to spend the evening among some friends, and the carriage being ordered, the second coachman drove the carriage out about nine o'clock, and the lad and me went to the stable soon afterwards. We met the prisoner a little way from the stable. From thence I proceeded to spend the evening; and when I returned, the second coachman informed me that somebody had attempted to break into the stable. I went up stairs, and opened the door, and found some things missing. This was about half past five in the morning; and from the lad's information I suspected the prisoner. I found the prisoner about half after seven<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181205130041"/> o'clock, in Barlow Mews. He is a coachman. He was washing his carriage. I questioned him with it, and he denied it. I got Mr. Plank, the constable, to apprehend him. The prisoner then owned to me that he had taken the things.</p>

            . I am thirteen years old. I am a servant to Mr. Buck. I am a helper in the stables. On Monday night the second coachman went out, and I went with Waterman to the stables. On my going from the stables to the house, I met the prisoner. The second coachman went back with me to put the horses in. He left me there; and the prisoner came down stairs. He took the light out of the lanthern, and desired me to go out. I asked him who he was, and how he came there. He told me, I must go up stairs. I told him, I would not. I ran out of doors and called, murder.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get in - A. We left the key in the coach-house door.</p>

I asked the prisoner, if he had been enquiring about a vessel that was to be sold of the name of Stephens: the prisoner, answered, yes. I told him, the price was an hundred and sixty pounds. He said he could hardly tell how to act, as it was chiefly upon his father's account that he wanted to purchase a vessel of that description. He said, his father was not in town; his country-house was at the forest; but I was to take a bill of four or five months. I told him I could not give an answer to that until I saw Mr. Haley, who was a part owner with me. He said, very well; he should see his father that evening, and if I would call the next day he would give me an answer. On Saturday, the 4th of January, I saw him again. Mr. Francis asked me if I had agreed with my partner about taking a bill. I told him, yes; but not for a longer date than three months. He asked me, if I knew Mr. Parker of the Tower Dock. He said, he would go with me to Mr. Parker, to have the ship papers transferred: and when we came to Mr. Parker's he told Mr. Parker to transfer the papers as soon as possible, as he was going out of town, and must have them that evening. Mr. Parker appointed four or five o'clock for all parties to be at his house. We met there between five and six o'clock. Mr. Parker filled up the new bill of sale; and, after we had read the particulars of the transfer, the prisoner took out of his pocket-book a bill, and putting it on the table, saying, I must get one of you, gentlemen, to sign this bill. It was ready drawed, and accepted. This is the bill. Mr. Haley then put his name to it. The bill was then delivered over to me, for the pay of the sloop Stephens; and when the bill became due I found no such a house as Francis and Son's, when I went to get the bill discounted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barry. When you presented the bill you knew he was in custody - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to 51, Great Hermitage-street - A. I did. There was no such persons there.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, after he had given you this bill. he was in custody upon other frauds, and being in custody he was detained upon your charge, before the bill became due.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I do; and I know his father: they rented an accompting-house of me, 51, Great Hermitage-street, Wapping.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see his father - A. Yes. When they took the apartment they both came together: they carried on trade in the firm of Francis and Son. They entered at Christmas. Different people came and enquired for Mr. Francis, junior, and I have heard him say he must consult his father.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the Jury, I am truly sensible of the awful situation I am in, but conscious of my innocence. Two years ago I unfortunately became a bankrupt; every one of my creditors signed my certificate. I got into the situation of Smith and Bell at the time. I found every thing respectable. They had a banking-house, Sharpe and Sons, Smithfield: they paid their bills at that time. Mr. Smith got a sprain in his arm: he got me to sign, Smith and Bell. I did it; conceiving I had his authority fully so to do. I conceived his authority was sufficient for me so to do. I throw myself upon the Jury, that what I did I thought was right and just.</p>

About three weeks ago I went to see Gibson, who was in prison in the same room with Smith; I desired Smith to assist the prosecution. He had spoken a good deal against Ashbee. He denied all knowledge of this transaction of Messrs. Carter and Strong. He said it was hard for him: they had been doing business without his knowledge, and it was hard for him to answer for it. He said he always knew the prisoner's name was Ashbee. He said, Ashbee was the only partner he had.</p>

               <p>Q. What did the box contain - A. A great deal of value; the articles that I lost were plate and money, more than put in the indictment; there were eighteen guineas and forty pounds all but a shilling, and three large handsome silver cruets, and a great deal of silver coin.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find out who had taken it - A. Nobody knew where this box was but the prisoners; they lived opposite of me. They were put in the box ever since October, and they were all safe in the box in October. In April my sister said she had got an old guinea, I said, I would look for an old guinea that I had, and my sister turned pale as ashes. I found my box broken open in May. I left my key with my sister when I went out, no common thief could have taken them things. I had a search warrant. Mr. Read, the officer, searched the prisoner's apartment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any property upon the prisoner - A. Yes; ten guineas in a little box, and in April she could not pay a quarter's rent; she told me so. There was this silver snuff-box on the table, and a dozen silver-handled knives and forks. In case if it had been a common thief, do you think they would not have taken them; there were nothing taken but from the box under the bed.</p>

            . I am an officer. I searched the premises of Croome and his wife, on the 5th of May, about five o'clock, they were both at home; they lived in a one pair of stairs room, opposite of Mrs. Penn In a box in the cupboard I found these ten guineas; there were dollars in the same box; Mrs. Penn said, she did not think she could swear to them. I did not bring them away. The next day I went for them they were gone. I took the prisoners in custody, the first day this half crown was found in a drawer in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Look at them guineas - A. This is the guinea I swear to. Mr. Penn and I have often looked at it; he thought it was a bad one, as well as me. It is my own. I believe it was him that broke the box open, and not my sister.</p>

            . I am a constable of Harrow. I, by the order of Skins, about nine o'clock, went to the place where the lead was. I kept behind the hedge, about twenty yards from the place where the lead was concealed. I could see what passed. In about three hours afterwards Jackson came by with his cart loaded with sash-frames. He was going to Mr. Gray's, Wemley-park. In about an hour after he came back with his cart. Dyke came with him. Jackson stopped his cart. They both went to the place where the lead was, and Dyke brought the lead forward, and by the assistance of Jackson they put it in the cart. Jackson went on with his cart. Dyke stopped where the lead was: he seemed to be searching for something that he could not find. I stepped from my hiding-place, and took Dyke in custody. I asked Dyke, where he got that lead from that he had put in the cart. He said he knew nothing about any lead. I then followed the cart, with Dyke in custody. Jackson stopped before we came up. I asked Jackson how he came by the lead. He got into the cart and threw the four pieces out.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose two screens at any time - A. I did. I missed them on the 3rd of May, on Sunday morning. I saw them on the prisoner's premises at half after ten, on Sunday morning, May the 3rd. I was called up by the watchman. He told me, that he stopped a man that had been robbing my shop. I dressed myself, and went with the watchman to St. Giles's watchhouse. He said, he stopped the prisoner with a basket of tools. (Pointing to a basket of tools, at the watchhouse.) On the next day I found my workshop had been untiled, big enough for a man to get in. The prisoner had worked in my shop untill I turned him out.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any suspicion did you go to Langford's premises - A. I did He lived in Plumb-tree-street, St. Giles's. He occupied the first floor. And as I went in at the door, by the side of the door I saw two screens, that I used to keep the sun off the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I took part of the shop of him, and I bought the screens of him, and many other things.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. to prosecutor. Had the prisoner ever taken part of the shop of you - A. No. He was there on sufferance, until he got another place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he keep his tools there - A. He did. I turned him out on the 1st of May, with his tools in the shop. I catched him cutting up a stretching-frame, for a picture-frame, for a customer of his.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say when you charged him with untiling your shop; did he say that he untiled the roof of your shop to get his things - A. I did not hear him say that. He shook his fist at me, and threatened me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was stopped with my tools I sent the watchman to tell him of it.</p>

I stopped him. He told me they were his own tools. He said, one half of the shop belonged to Mr. Linnard, and the other half to him. Mr. Linnard came down to the watchhouse.

On Saturday, the 2nd of May, I went out to a charity committee, for which I always go one day in every month; that my servant was well aware of. I was gone about two hours and a half. On my return my servant was gone. I found almost all my plate gone, except some weighty articles that she, I suppose, in her hurry, could not take away. On the Monday I received a blank cover, containing thirty-four pawnbroker's tickets, enclosed without any writing on the cover. On making a rough draft, between seventy and eighty pounds appeared to have been lent on these tickets. These are the duplicates.</p>

He said, he knew Mr. Smith very well; he lived at a linen-drapers a few doors further. The prisoner then told me, that he was Mr. Mason's apprentice, and had not long to serve. He walked with me; he took the boots from me. He then walked to Symond's Inn; and when we came to Mr. Mason's, he said, you had better take them in; and I insisted upon him taking them in, as he had carried them so far. When he found that I wanted to see them delivered he tried to run past me. I catched hold of him, and in the scuffle I got the boots from him. He gave me a push, and ran away. I pursued him. I suspected him to be a swindler.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Are you sure he got the boots from you - A. Yes. He took them from me. I did not give them to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you consent to his carrying them - A. No.</p>

In searching for it, she saw part of a towel hang out of the prisoner's box; upon which we sent for an officer of Bow-street. The officer came, and found two towels in her box; and the prisoner confessed that she had taken a number of things to her mother's house. I promised the mother forgiveness, if she would restore the things to me that she had in her possession. I am now sorry I promised the mother: I believe she is worse than the daughter.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you lose these things - A. On Friday morning, the 8th of May, between eight and nine o'clock, as I was at breakfast, two females came up stairs. I occupy the two pair and the attic. I opened the door on the two pair of stairs to let the females in, and inadvertantly left the stair-case door open. After the females had been some time in the second floor they fixed upon some worked muslin. I then wanted the yard measure to cut it off. I went to the landing, for the yard measure, and, to my surprise, I saw the prisoner go down stairs with an umbrella. I pursued the man, and called out stop thief. I ran across Brooks'-market, into Fox-court. I met the prisoner coming back, in the custody of the beadle. We took him up to the two pair of my house. He then begged for mercy. In his pocket we found a metal candlestick, which was my property. This is the umbrella that he dropped on the foot of the stairs, going out. It is my candlestick and umbrella.</p>

From suspicion I followed the prisoner; and on his returning home I saw him, in Rosemary-lane, take two nose-bags from the side of the waggon. The nose-bags contained corn and chaff. He went down an alley with the nose-bags, and emptied them there. The man had given him a few halfpence. He had the halfpence in his hand when I went and met him. I then asked him whether it was my property he had been selling, or his. He asked me to forgive him. I took him to an officer, and gave him in charge.</p>

My father's name is Adolphus Hill, and my brother's name Benjamin Hill. They are partners. On the 11th of April I took the prisoner in custody, and delivered him to Perdow, the officer; and this knife I took out of his hands. I saw him upon the timber, in the dock, with the rope in his hand; and this is the rope he took. It is my father's property. I saw him cut the rope myself.</p>

I looked about by the light of the shop windows: I could not see the pocket-book. I went into the shop, and got a light; and within three yards of where the prisoner and Mr. Hall were standing, I picked up the book.</p>

               <p>Q. In the month of March you were under the necessity of going to lodge in the prisoner's house - A. In January and February; and afterwards in March. The prisoner had a house in Paddington. I was absent from my house till the 4th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. And during the time you were absent from your house, you left the prisoner in the care of it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After you became a bankrupt, did you in consequence of suspicion, search the prisoner's house - A. I went with the assignee, Mr. Barnard, to search his house; I there saw a glass hookabottom, and some gools, that I claimed as mine; the gools are my own making. The gools are made of charcoal and rice. And I found some tobacco.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When did the prisoner leave your service - A. In March.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were before the justice, did not the prisoner assert that you had sent the hookabottom there by your servant Elizabeth - A. Yes: but I did not send her.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you brought that girl here - A. I cannot find her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your assignees complain of your moving any thing to Barlow-street - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember making an application to the prisoner, some time before you were a bankrupt, for him to accept bills for you - A. Yes; and he refused it.</p>
               <p>Q. That made you more his friend than before - A. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The tobacco, with a part of the gools, I brought from India. The hookabottom, with a part of the balls, were brought to my house by his servant; her name is Elizabeth.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

I had not a shilling to pay for them. He beckoned over the prisoner to give change. When the prisoner came up I gave the five shillings and sixpenny dollar to the prisoner. It happened to drop out of his hand into the basket. Moses gave me four shillings and an eighteen-penny piece in change. The prisoner took a shilling out of my hand with a head upon it, and gave it Mordecai. The other three shillings and the eighteen-penny piece I kept in my hand. The officer has got them now. I gave them to the beadle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the three shillings - A. I did. I am no judge of silver. I was told in two minutes afterwards that they were all bad. I pursued Mordecai, and gave charge of him to the beadle of the parish. I believe it was a month after that I saw the prisoner.</p>

            , you were found guilty at a former sessions for uttering and vending a counterfeit mark and stamp, forged, to resemble a certain mark and stamp, used and provided in pursuance of an act, made and passed in the reign of the present King; this stamp was affixed to a box of medicine, all the parts of it resembling a genuine stamp, except where, in the centre of the genuine stamp, it was essential that it should specify and denote the duty: that centre was cut out, and, that the vacancy should not be perceived, a paper was pasted over it, with</p>

             observed, this was a case to go to the Jury, and reserved the law of this point for the opinion of the Judges. And in a former case the like was reserved by Mr. Justice Bailey. The objections of the counsel in this case were argued before the Judges: first, that the indictment did not state what the resemblance was, and that it was not a resemblance, but a misrepresentation to deceive; notwithstanding, the Jury found you guilty: and they were warranted in so doing; the counterfeit stamp was so well done, and so well calculated to deceive. The Judges are of opinion that the forged stamp need not be a facsimile in all its parts but such as that pretended to be a false making. And, indeed, the false making, and making to deceive, is the true denomination of a forgery; which is an answer to the first objection. To the second, the answer is, the statute makes the uttering, with a counterfeit mark thereon, a capital felony. To resemble the mark or stamp that is used and provided in the act of George the 3rd, chap. 9, sect. 99, it is stated in the indictment, and it is proved in evidence; therefore the Judges are of opinion that this objection is no more valid than the other. The indictment is good, and the offence is proved.</p>

            , the prisoner at the bar, was tried at last February Old Bailey sessions. before Mr. Justice Heath, Mr. Baron Wood, and Mr. Justice Bailey, for stealing in the dwelling-house of Messrs. Birch and Chambers, two bank-notes, value 50 l. each. A question was held for the Judges opinion, whether that was done by the prisoner. On the 19th of December it was said that he entered a credit of the sum of two hundred pounds. This entry was a false making, that he, the prisoner, paid two hundred pounds into the house of Messrs. Birch and Chambers, to the credit of Mr. Vale. The prisoner, at the same time produced a stamp, and desired Mr. Vale to draw a two hundred pounds check. A bill is drawn upon the house for one hundred pounds, which he changed with good bills of the house. The prisoner took out of the till of Messrs. Birch and Chambers, two fifty pound bank-notes, mentioned in the indictment, and deposited the check of an hundred pounds of that day, and entered it in the check book. It was not in the book on the morning of the 11th of January; and the apparent balance in the ledger, and in Mr. Vale's banking book against him, was several hundred pounds, by striking out the false credit, made on the 19th of December. And, on further investigation, it appeared, that before that time the prisoner made false entries to the amount of eight hundred and thirty pounds. It was insisted, on the taking these notes, that Messrs. Birch and Chambers would be no losers of the money: they would be entitled to obtain the money of Mr. Vale. The learned Judge told the Jury, that if they were satisfied the prisoner took the notes out of the till, he thought they ought to find him guilty. He told them also, whether he made the false entries fraudulently, to enable him to steal the notes, they would find him guilty; if they were of opinion he did it fraudulently for that purpose; and he, the learned Judge, would reserve the point of law for the opinion of the Judges, that so, the prisoner might have the benefit of it. It appears, that the indictment charges the prisoner with stealing in the dwelling-house of Messrs. Birch and Chambers, two bank-notes, value 50 l. each. The statute of George the 2nd makes the stealing of bonds, notes, drafts, and bills, of more than the value of forty shillings, in a dwelling-house, a capital felony. It is a capital felony to steal in the dwelling-house any note of the value of more than forty shillings. The objection is, that it is a fraud, and not a larceny. Now, the true meaning of a larceny is, taking goods, the property of another person, and converting it to their own use. Now, in this case, the taking the notes mentioned in the indictment, is stated, and proved, as is the felonious intention, in making the false entries.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181205130054"/> The act of taking, and converting, is a larceny. On this ground, the Judges are of opinion, it is a felonious stealing in the dwelling-house; and, being to the amount of one hundred pounds, it forms the offence of larceny to the amount of more than forty shillings. And therefore, they are of opinion, that the charge against the prisoner is well founded.</p>
