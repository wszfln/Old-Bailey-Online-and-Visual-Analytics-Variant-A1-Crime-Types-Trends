                  </hi>. I am a leather! merchant at Overstone Road, Northampton—I first became acquainted with Summers about November, 1878—I know nothing of the other prisoners—Summers was introduced to me through one of my travellers, and on his representations I made a small sale to Summers of goods to the amount of 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I sent them to the address given me, 10, Worship Street, London—in the beginning of December I saw Summers at 10, Worship Street, on the second floor, respecting the account that he owed me for the goods that I had sent him—I think his name was there; there was no stock there—not many pounds' worth—he represented that he was going to do a large trade, and wished to make arrangements for me to supply him with more goods—I arranged to take part leather and part cash in settlement of my account—I sent him goods for that, and on or about 24th December I received this letter from him (<hi rend="italic">This and the subsequent letters were proved by Andrew James Irving to be in Summers's handwriting</hi>)—previous to that letter I had received a consignment of leather by the North-Western Railway, and this invoice gives the details of it—on the 14th I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">This stated that Summers had removed to 24, Castle Street, Finsbury</hi>)—the value of the parcel I dispatched was 67<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., another parcel to the value of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on 16th January another parcel, 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave him per<lb/>mission to draw on me for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bill I accepted and subsequently met; that balanced the account between us.</p>

I live at 33, Myrtle Street, Hoxton—I have known Mannion six or seven years—I knew him when he was trading under the name of Stokes and Co., in Sun Street, Finsbury—I was a warehouseman and salesman in the hop trade in 1876—I went into Mannion's service as ware-houseman and salesman—I received weekly wages—I was there when the failure took place; Stokes and Co. became bankrupt—I knew that Man<lb/>nion was bankruptr—I recollect after that the Leather and Shoe Co. being commenced about 4th January, 1877—the warehouse was in Sun Street, and the offices in Finsbury Place—they took the premises of Stokes and Co., and I occupied the same position as I had hitherto, warehouseman and salesman—I did not act and write letters as the secretary—I acted as manager for about fortnight—I believe Mannion was manager when it commenced—I never knew what Lordan was; he was there on and off—they held their meetings at the offices, which I knew nothing about; I was never there—I had my salary, 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and then 21. at the latter part of the time the company did business—they got goods from various places; I was not the buyer—Watson merely called in there casually—I believe the company lasted'a bout 12 or 15 months; it was registered in January, 1877—it afterwards became a limited company—we had transactions with John Pantony, of Liverpool—I received this telegram from him—I recollect Lordan and Co. starting at 10, Worship Street, in September, 1877—I remained in Sun Street for about two months in the Leather and Shoe Co.; after that I went to Hoxton Street, and started a small business as a leather-cutter—I had no capital—it was agreed between Mannion and I that I should take that shop; he was to supply me with the leather—Lordan and Co. had started then—I did not know the position of Mannion at Lordan's; I did not inquire—they did supply me with leather from 10, Worship Street, to the extent of about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—I have paid them money on account—I can't say how much, perhaps 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with bills and that—I had grindery goods from other places, but no leather—I accepted bills for them; I can't tell you the amounts—I did not pay any of them with my own money; I met some of them, and a good many I did not—directly Lordan and Co. failed, I failed; I owed about 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with these bills—I only had what I stood upright in—some of the bills were brought blank; I do not know what I accepted; I accepted them as they came from Worship Street—I recollect going heme one day, and finding some boots there—at that time I did not know that Lordan and Co. had failed—I had not ordered them; I asked my wife, and she said they came from Worship Street; they remained there two or three days; Butler fetched them; I saw Mannion the day before, and he said they would be fetched to-morrow morning—I think Watson called twice in</p>

I had known Mannion some years—I was in his service when he was carrying on business in the name of Stokes and Co.; that was a leather warehouse—from all I saw, it Was a bond fide business—I never saw anything that was not bond fide—gooda were bought and sold in the usual way—there was nothing suggestive of fraud—just before the business failed Mannion sprained his ankle or knee, and he was away for a week or a fortnight; and then he used to come in a cab, and go away again directly—for a considerable period he was practically unable to attend to the business—there was not much business doing there in conse<lb/>quence of there being no one there—the result was that the business fell away; it never recovered from Mannion's absence, and he was obliged to file his petition—previous to that, Stokes and Co. met all their liabilities to the best of my knowledge—the Leather and Shoe Co. was started after that; it did a comfortable trade; it was a bond fide business; it after<lb/>wards became a limited company, and Mannion continued as manager up to a short time before it closed—a. great many of the creditors of Stokes and Co. were also creditors of the Leather and Shoe Co., and they con<lb/>tinued to supply goods—when I started in business for myself I asked Mannion whether he would assist me by letting me have goods—I hoped to he able to make the business pay—I did tolerably well at first, but I was never able to get over the fact of starting without capital—I was origin<lb/>ally supplied with stock by Lordan and Co.—I did not pay for those goods when I first had them—I subsequently agreed to accept bills on account of those goods, and some for the accommodation of Lordan and Co.; I can't say to what amount—some were taken up by Lordan and Co.—at the time of their failure there were acceptances of mine out—there were two bills due—I don't know the amounts—about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was due from me to Lordan and Co. at the time of their failure—I could not say whether or no the bills were in respect of goods I had from Lordan and Co.—I was never told what they were for—I accepted hills previous to that, they were not all taken up—I know Hammersley and Splenthall—I have had an intima<lb/>tion that they were connected with the business of Lordan and Co.—I heard it just after the failure, not before—I know them personally.</p>

I still say that as far as the business was concerned, and I was connected with it, it was bond fide—I do not know whether five bills had been dishonoured—I was not manager at that time, I was only temporary manager for a fortnight—a business was certainly carried on—Mannion used to buy goods as manager from Pantony and other places—I only had the sale; I did not have the buying—I had invoices—I hate not them with me; I know some came from Finsbury, and some from Bermondsey—I did not keep any books; they were kept in the desk—I merely entered in the rough book.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FULTON</hi>. I knew Mannion personally—it is not at all unusual for goods to be sent to our auction rooms to be sold—these goods fetched very near their market value; we have consignments from the trade generally; they are very often goods not suited for the purposes of the trade—they were not sold at a sacrifice, we invariably get the market value, we never sacrifice them—Schlesser Brothers are in the habit of sending goods to us to be sold in this way; they do a large trade—their consignments to us have been very small, perhaps unsaleable damaged skins, or things of that sort.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SIMS</hi>. Summers only mentioned Lordan and Co. in the letter:—before that the consignments were always in his own name he did not tell me that in carrying on business as a leather-seller he had gone to Lordan and Co., and that the consignment in September was on their account—lie had been a customer of ours for some years, and he always told us that he was agent for the trade; his name has been on our books 7 or 8 years—we had purchased manufactured goods of him for some years, boots and shoes.</p>

                  </hi>. About December, 1877, I entered into the service of Lordan and Co. on the introduction of Mannion; I had known him very slightly for some years—I had not known Lordan, Watson, or Summers until I entered the service—I was engaged as clerk—I found a set of books, but they had not been opened; I did the beet I could, not particularly to open the books; they had got in arrear—I saw the delivery order book and the initials "J. D. and S."In one part of it—I asked Mannion what they meant, and he said I most not bother about it, that they were some things that had been sent to John Davis and Sons for auction sale—I subsequently knew them to be auctioneers—there was no account in the ledger at that time opened to John Davis and Sons—I don't think I opened one—they kept a bill book in which bills taken from customers were entered at one end, and hills payable at the other end—the business of Lordan and Co. was carried en in the basement—I believe Ay res was on the top floor; I did not know him then personally—Summers was not there when I first went—no agreement was made with me as to salary; it appeared to me to be temporary work at first; I was paid a regular weekly salary, about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week at first, and subsequently 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mannion took a part in the business; he had a great deal to do with the financing, the cash part of it, attending to the bills, and looking of cus<lb/>tomers—Watson was salesman—I have seen a Mrs. Ellis in the place; I can hardly speak from memory as to when she first became a customer; the only entry in the ledger is March, 1878, 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had the most to do with taking up dishonoured bills; I took up a great number; the book will show them; the margin of the cheques will show where I get the money to pay the bills—the "cash received" book will show what goods were sent to auction sales; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—the first I look at is 13th July 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Summers—I presume that refers to goods sent to Davis in Summers's name—whose goods they were I cannot tell—the receipt of the money is entered in this book—on 21st February, 1878, there is an entry of "Davis and Co, per Summers, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and on March 1st "T. Summers, cash, 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I made all these entries from verbal information given me at the time by some of the partners; I saw no documents—there is an account entered to Ayres from October, 1877—the sum total appears to be 1,646<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the amount paid by him in cash and bills is totalled of as 536<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot tell whether the bills were paid, without referring to the bill book—from October, 1878, 4th 4th December the amount of goods he received was about 583<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that includes an account rendered of 370<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that is entered in pencil—I can't tell whether that wen part of the 536<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there are "returns in goods;"I suppose that would be manufactured goods; in cash, bills, and goods it is about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is no entry in this book of a sale of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of goods after the petition in December—I was there up to the day of the filing of the petition—I do not recollect any goods being sent up to Ayres the day before the petition; I was then leaving the employ, and lor about six weeks before I was engaged out of doors collecting bills and looking up customers whose bills had been returned—I was very little in the place, and I was frequently buck when the place was dosed—I cannot tell yen how many executions had been put in during the three months previous to 18th December, perhaps half a dozen, all of them had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187911240022"/>
               <p>been more or less partly paid out—I knew of people calling to serve writs—it was some months after I entered the service before there was any execution put in, I would not pledge myself to say exactly—as far as I know, there is no entry in the books of any loan by Watson to the firm; it is possible he did from his own cash, but he kept his own private cash book—an accountant was called in in July, and he made up the cash account—the margins of the cheques will show what each person drew; they drew as they pleased—when I first knew Lordan I believe he was living with his brother in-law, Mannion—iu the early part of 1878 he was living at Payne's Hotel, Brighton—I had a great many letters and tele<lb/>grams from him from there; these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are some of them. (<hi rend="italic">These contained repeated applications to the witness to send him money, and com<lb/>plaints of delay.</hi>) His drawings from 1877 amounted to perhaps 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he occasionally came to 10, Worship Street—the books were always there; he had them to look at—he used to make inquiries about the business; I told him the books would show what we were doing—a few days before 10th December I sent some skins to the cloak-room of the London Bridge Station in my own name—I sent them from a letter I had from Lordan asking me to do so, to borrow some money, or rather to sell some goods if I could—this is the letter—I believe I told him what to say; he wanted some money, and so did I; there was great difficulty in getting it—I think that letter was written about the early part of December—I did not send the goods, they were sent by my direction; I asked Watson if he could get a cash customer for them, and he promised to do so—I saw no more of them—I think he gave me a sovereign, I was very short of money—all our moneys had been taken away by Mr. Holland, the gentleman who had been carrying on business for Mr. Hammersley; all the bills and money that had been collected—in September, 1878, Watson said "There are some goods we are sending to Davis, and I am going to send them in your name;"I said "Why?" He said "We have sent there before, and we want another name;"I said "I know nothing about it;"I had no idea there was anything wrong in doing so; he sent them, I did not—I received the money and put it into the cash received book—I presume I paid it into the bank; I accounted for it, it was 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think—the prices were put on them by Watson; they came to 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., they realised 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received this letter from Summers in August, 1878—he was then on the second floor, as I thought as a servant of Lordan's—when Lordan was going away he used to leave blank cheques—I received this letter of 2nd October, 1879, from Mannion the day before I went to sign my deposition, after I had been examined—I handed it to the solicitor for the prosecution—it is not signed, but I took it to be Mannion's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This contained suggestions as to the questions that might be addressed to the witness on his cross-examination on the trial.</hi>)</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GLYN</hi>. I was engaged by Mannion—I think Lordan was there within a day or two, he was in town at that time—I arranged as to salary with Mannion, I always looked upon him as the principal manager—Lordan did very little with regard to the business, he did not seem to know anything about it—he never seemed to enter into it as a man of business would—he did not appear to know how to raise money on the goods, and I told him what I considered was the best way—he was very frequently at Brighton, he stayed there for a month</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187911240023"/>
               <p>—he signed cheques because he knew they would be required in carrying on the business while he was away—he signed blank cheques, and left them in my custody, and I filled them up as they were required for the business—I dare say he asked me what was in the bank and what bills were out; but he had the opportunity of seeing, it was all in the books—there was no secret, nothing was kept from him—when he was at Brighton he used to write most piteously for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I supposed he wanted mouey—all these letters were intended for Mannion though addressed to me—he no doubt thought Mannion did not pay attention to his require<lb/>ments, so he addressed me as a sort of intermediate or go-between—Lordan was very little there; he was not of temperate habits—he was knowu to take a great deal more than was good for him—he was fre<lb/>quently in drink—he was generally right when he came to the office—I always thought he was a man who understoad right and wrong, and would not do any one any harm or wrong—I don't know the exact amount that he drew out, it is to be got at—Mannion also signed cheques—I know that Lordan advanced 4,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the business; it is all entered in the books—I thought there was a great deal more to come—I presume he is without a shilling—I think Mannion borrowed some money on his wife's income in some way.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FULTON</hi>. I do not know that Mannion's wife's private income has been stopped during these proceedings—when I first went into the business I thought it was a prosperous one—I thought it was a very good thing for me to go there; that it was a good bond fide trade—I thought it was merely when they were short that goods were sent to auction, when customers' bills came back and they had to meet them—I think I knew Hammersley within a few weeks of the first—I believe he and Mannion had done business together in some company—I think he was a director of one of the companies, and goods were supplied by Lordan and Co. to the company—I remember witnessing documents, at one time, some agreement with Hammersley and Splenthall—I can't tell when that was—it would be at the first part when Some money was put in—it was long before Mr. Holland was sent to manage the business; that was about October, 878, about two months before the stoppage—I considered it was Hammersley and Splenthall's business from the date of my leaving—I cannot say that they took over the business in October, but they sent Holland to take control of matters—I suppose they were not satisfied with the way things were going on. and they would have financial control, in conjunction with Watson—Hammersley opened a banking account at the Capital and Counties Bank, Paddington branoh, and gave Holland permission to sign for him—Manuion still came there; he told me he was very likely to leave as well as me—I can't tell whether he considered himself a servant; he never was in the position that I was—I can't say that from the time Holland came Mannion practically ceased to be manager, because he was there, and I still looked upon him as the same—I believe Mr. Barrow was one of the largest creditors of Lordan and Co. at the time of the bankruptcy—I have seen, him frequently at 10, Worship Street—I have seen him and Mannion at the desk together, with the books before them, talking over matters—I did not leave previous to the filing of the petition—I was with the trustee for a time to assist, but I was out so much—I have no doubt that I witnessed certain documents between Hammersley and Splenthall—I can't say</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187911240024"/>
               <p>that it was in July—I do not recollect bonds being given signed by Mrs. Mannion as collateral security—I have no doubt said to Mannion "You don't know what you are doing," but he would not take my advice—I believe an assignment was made—I have witnessed many documents, and very likely that one.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SIMS</hi>. Summers came into the premises first after some trouble between Lonian and Co., and Mr. Ayres and his lather; he came in to manage the manufacturing part of the business, in place of Ayres—when I went there Ayres occupied two floors, and the factory was the part that Summers came in to manage after Ayres left—X supposed the factory to be a portion of Lordan and Co.'s business—when Summers was there Manuion managed the business, Summers never, and to my knowledge he was entirely upstairs—I saw very little of him after Holland came—the business seemed to go on under a joint pro<lb/>prietorship with Hammersley and Spleuthall and Lordan and Co.—the books were still continued as Lordan and Co.—a fresh account was entered as for Hammersley and Co., and everything was to go through Holland—I think Lordan's interest in the business was very little then—they were coming in and taking it from him; they had been under heavy liabilities for Ayres—all the arrangements with Hammersley were behind my back.</p>

Lordan and Co.—on the first occasion I saw him with Mannion respecting the accounts when they were nearly completed—I had a general conversation with them in order to draw out a general statement of the affairs—they and their clerk Irving gave me information, and ultimately on the information they had given me a statement of affairs was got ready for their signature—this is a true copy—the reversionary interest of Lordan is set out at 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it states "The debtor is entitled to one moiety of the estate under the will of his father, of which he has received 4,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the residue estimated to produce 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" that includes the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that sheet is signed by Lordan, it is treated as an asset—I got the information in the first instance from Lordan, after that from Mannion, and subsequently from Grueber, the solicitor to the</p>

The books do not disclose that Hammersley and Splenthall were taking part in the transactions previous to December; I know that they were to put some money into the business—there is no deed of partnership, if the word "partnership "Is put in, that is a mistake; but I believe the solicitor referred to it as a partnership deed as you have now—a man named Musgmve was not hi the business on behalf of Hammersley and Splenthall, he was a nominee of theirs, and was attempting to inspect a set of books—they had a clerk named Holland—I did not know that they were buying goods and having them consigned to them in their name—from inquiries I have made as trustee I believe it is utterly untrue—their name was on some of the bills in Lordan and Co's bank<lb/>ruptcy</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187911240030"/>
               <p>—I do not know that goods sent by Barrow shortly More the bank<lb/>ruptcy were consigned and were upon the orders of Hammersley and Co.; I have made special inquiries, and Mr. Barrow will support me if he is put in the box—the butts said to have been removed on 15th December were not consigned by Barrow, they were sent by him—when I took possession they were not entered in the books, but these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are Barrow's original invoices—the earliest items are Lordan and Co., Hammersley and Splenthall's name only comes in on the later transactions—the butts which were removed were a portion of these goods—they were not consigned, they were sold out and out to Lordan—I had nothing to do with purchasing those goods, I only know it from my inquiries as trustee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Watson.</hi> I recollect you calling on me in January, relating to a 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—you brought a consignment sheet, which you said belonged to Hammersley and Splenthall, and was put under your care—I had stock taken at 10, Worship Street a few days after I took possession—you assisted my clerk to take stock, and this is the stock-book you went through with him—there is no note of any of them being consignments at that date—the whole of the stock was taken as it stood, and you pointed out certain goods which you said were Mrs. Ellis's—I had a claim sent in from Hainmersley—the notice not to sell his stock is on the file—I do not believe any goods were purchased by Mrs. Ellis; there is only a memo<lb/>randum of yours in the books—I sent an order that you were not to com<lb/>plete any orders, and I took possession of the premises, and left my representative there—on 10th December you wanted to send a parcel of goods to Mrs. Ellis, and I refused to let them go—she owes me 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; she cannot be made bankrupt, because her husband is in America—I made an affidavit that I believed this was done to cheat and defraud the creditors—you have threatened to follow me till the day of my death—the stock taken by Musgrave on the premises on August 31st, 1878, was 2,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my clerk has checked the goods sold by you up to December 6th, and the result is that in leather alone there appears to be a deficiency of 60 cwt.—I have gone through the books of the sale of all the butts from September 1st to December 6th; the weight is 259 cwt. 3 qrs. 27lb.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. I have taken all the purchases and the stock on 31st August, and the stock I found on the premises, and I find a deficiency of 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is all from the books of Lordan and Co., and there is a further deficiency in the kid skins—the weight of stock on 31st August was 234 cwt 1/2 lb.; the purchases since are 566 cwt. 11 1/2 lb.; total, 800 cwt. 121b.—the sales are 631 cwt 1 qr. 21 1/2 lb., leaving a balance of 189 cwt, 23 1/2 lb.; the deficiency on some articles is 104 cwt 15 1/2 lb., but from the difficulty of describing some items there is an apparent excess of 43 cwt 26 lb.—those which Mrs. Ellis claimed are included.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SIMS</hi>. I said before the Magistrate "I have not been able to learn the true position of the sales between Lordan and Co. and Hammersley and Splenthall because Lor dan's books were kept so badly"—there are a large number of cash transactions which it is impossible to understand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Mr. Musgrave has claimed about 197<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the estate for his services—when I took possession of the premises both Hammersley and Splenthall were there; nothing was said about their being the proprietors of the business—I attended both meetings, claims were made by the receivers of both estates, who I fought successfully; one of them withdrew.</p>

I took charge of these transactions from the commencement before any of the persons were arrested—I had had the premises of 44, Snn Street, under my inspection—I arrested Mannion and Lordan on Sunday night, 17th August, up a small turning in Featherstone Road—they were in company—I had been watching them for some time, but had not seen them together before—Inspector Hoots was with me—it was dark—I said that we were about to arrest them in connection with Lordan's bankruptcy—Lordan made no reply, Mannion said "All right, this matter has been on the tapis three months; it has been to the Treasury and they have thrown it out, and now it is taken up out of spite"—I took them to Mann ion's house, where I read the warrant to Mannion, and asked if he had any papers connected with the matter—he at first said "No"—I found a bag and asked him what it was—he said "There are some papers there, but they relate to Sun Street"—I have gone through them with the solicitor's clerk and sorted them—I went on to Watson's house, 146, Church Street, Islington, and saw him at the area steps—I said we were police officers and were going to arrest him in connection with the bankruptcy of Lordan—we went into the house and I read the warrant—he said "Well, I am not at all surprised; I am glad it has come to a point, as the matter can now be settled; I have lost a great deal of business during the three last months that this matter has been noised about; the business was a curious one, but I was only a servant, and as far as I am concerned it is quite straight"—I took them to the station, where Watson handed me some papers, which I brought away; among them was this document relating to 10 butts delivered to Hodd (Handing in several documents awl dishonoured bills for 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 97<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—I went to Sheer<lb/>ness next day and took Summers about 10 p.m—I told him the charge; he made no reply.</p>

I am a sausage manufacturer at Brewery Road, Caledonian Road, and a provision merchant in the Poultry Market; I employed the prisoner as town traveller, and provided him with a horse and trap, and paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week and commission; he would receive the sausages at Brewery Road, and the cheeses at the market; I went to Brewery Road once or twice a week—Hogan was manager there; it was the prisoner's duty to account daily for the deliveries, and it was a ready-money business as far as I knew—on 20th August the prisoner said he wanted cheeses for a customer, and 5 cheeses in boxes were given to him weighing 3 cwt. 5 lb., value 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for which he should have accounted to Mr. Hogan—he said he had not been paid for them! and if I would let him have a second lot he should be paid for both together; in consequence of what I heard I saw him about the end of September, and said "I understand you say you got these goods on your own account, and the debt is yours"—he said I never stated anything of the kind"—J said "You; know perfectly well, Bradley, when you get goods to sell, that they are got for my account"—he said "I know that—I went to the police on 19th October, and he was given in custody—he was before the Alderman on the 20th, and allowed to go out on his recognisances; I was present on 27th October, when the evidence was taken against him—he defended himself, and asked for a small book from the officer, but never disclosed the name of Mr. Welch as the purchaser of the cheeses—on 3rd November he was represented by a solicitor, and was committed for trial—after that his father came to me—I never saw him with his father—his wife and children came to my place afterwards—I did not speak to her—he was present, and said he wanted to speak to me—I took him to my private room, and told him to be careful to say nothing to commit him<lb/>self—he said "I have come to beg your pardon for what I have done, and to crave your forgiveness; I was pressed at the time, and had the brokers in the house, and had got your money, and I intended to repay it to you"</p>

On the night of the 27th the Hoopers were brought to the station and charged—after being in the cell some time Ann Hooper sent for me and said "I will state the whole truth"—she then said her husband had received the property from Mr. Walsh, a publican in Westminster, where she had been as nurse, and that if her</p>

               <p>husband knew she was telling this he would kill her, but that she intended to get him out of it, as he was innocent—at 12 o'clock at night I went with Sergeant Bull and saw the prisoner Walsh at the front of his bar—he said "What are you going to have, gentlemen?"—I said "Nothing. Do you know a man named Hooper?"—he said "No"—I said "I think you do, his wife was your wife's nurse"—he said "Oh, yes"—I said "I hare every reason to believe that you have stolen pro<lb/>perty in your possession"—he said "No"—I said "Yes, I believe you have some knives and forks"—he said "What I had I had from a man (<hi rend="italic">mentioning his name</hi>), but they are gone"—I said "I must search your cellar,' and with two officers I went into his cellar, and behind a barrel in a basket I found the articles produced tied in a rag—they have been identified by Mr. Draper as his property, and part of the proceeds of the burglary—they consist of a sugar sifter, fish knife, lemon knife, and an eye-glass—we were about to make a further search in the cellar when Walsh went up about four steps and put his hand between the rafters and the ceiling and took from there these-knives and forks wrapped in newspaper—they have also been identified as part of the proceeds of the burglary—we then made further search—I found between the ceiling and the rafters, over some coals, two card trays tied up in eloth; also come sheets, and upstairs some clocks, and also a small Geneva watch behind the barrel in the cellar—that property has not been identified—I asked him if he could account for it—he said he had bought it from a man whom he well knew, giving the name of a man whom I know by sight, but have not been able to find.</p>

About 8 am. on 23rd Semtember I went to Mr. Draper's and found an entry had been effected by climbing the wall and getting in at the window—there was a ladder there close to the window catch, and the glass had been broken and had fallen inside—a staple had been taken out of the wall outside—I found in the garden a dinner napkin and a piece of candle—I found foot-marks of one person near the back gate in the garden—it had been a very wet night.</p>

About 12 o'clock at night on 27th September I went with Inspector White to Walsh's premises, when the pro<lb/>perty was found, and his evidence is true—I searched upstairs, and found two clooks and a pair of opera glasses, and other small property, and in the coal cellar two spoons and a knife and fork.</p>

Walsh came to our house on the Monday and asked for my husband. I said he was at work. Walsh said "Tell him if he is not at work on Tuesday to come to me, I want to see him particularly." My husband did not go out except to work till Tuesday morning, and about 12 o'clock he met Walsh, who gave him those spoons.</p>

I said to her "These are some of the articles Mr. Walsh wants to dispose of, I suppose he wants to make some of the money; you take care of them."Had I known they were stolen I should not have sold them. A month after, when those spoons were sold, Walsh said "You need not tell them my name."I did not give my own name, as I did not want people to know I was so poor as to have to pawn things.</p>

                  </hi> I am secretary to the Persian Ambassador, Prince Malcolm Kahn—I remember seeing the prisoner in the hall at the Embassy con<lb/>versing with the servants, but they did not understand him—I can't say the exact date; it is nearly 40 days ago, and a week before the letter was received—I asked what he wanted, who he wad, and where he had come from—he said he was a Persian subject and an Armenian—I asked from what part—he said from Ispahan—I asked if he knew the Persian language—he said "No"—I said "How is it you have come from Persia and yet not know the Persian language?"—he said he was five years old when he left Ispahan, and then he was in Russia and was educated in Russia—I then said "What do you want?"—he said "I came here to be helped; I am a poor man; I don't know what I shall do"—I said "Why do you come here? what is your business here?"—he said "I came here to learn some profession"—I said "How came you here without money?"—he said "I had 600 roubles" (nearly 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)," but I have lost them"—I said "Where have you lost them?"—he said "In France"—I said "Were you robbed or did you drop it somewhere?"—he said "I do not know; I don't remember in which country it happened"—I then told the servants to give him something to eat, which they did—he said "I wish to see the Princess," the Ambassador's wife—I said "You can't see her; if you want to say something put it on paper; she understands Armenian"—on Sunday, the 26th October, I saw this letter in the Ambassador's hand, at his residence, Holland Park, which is also the Embassy—I afterwards saw the envelope; the butler showed it to me.</p>

I am an interpreter, and lire at 8, Booklet Road, West Kensington Park—I have made a translation of this letter, addressed to His Excellency the Persian Minister—it is perfectly correct—the original is in Armenian—it is the letter of a man of a certain education—this letter was shown to the prisoner before the Magistrate, and he made this state<lb/>ment, which I interpreted to the Magistrate: "Really and truly I am the writer of the letter to M. the Minister, because he has no care for me. I have inadvertently fallen into trouble to the extent of 600 roubles. I am without bread, and am without means to earn my daily bread. Why?"</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The translation of the letter being read stated that he went to the embossy to ask for advice and assistance, and was unable torn the Ambassador. It contained the following sentence;</hi> "Do you think think I am an ignorant man, and know nothing and have seen nothing? Ton are mistaken, consider it superfluous to Bay more. Should you not by some means succour me your soul will not have any significance in my sight, as my soul has not had in yours. Therefore I shall be obliged first to kill you and then kill myself. I assure you I will certainly and surely do so."</p>

I don't recollect writing it I have a trouble which from time to time upsets my mind, and I wish for doctors to examine me."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner in his defence stated that he had no intention to do anything of the sort contained in the letter; that he had no cause of complaint against the Ambassador, he having been treated with kindess by the Princess, and that he had no recollection of what he wrote.</hi>

I am manager to Mr. Bankhouse, who trades at Roberts and Co. at 76, New Bond Street, Chemists—I was with then in the Paris house three years, and only knew Blunt as an assistant when I came to manage the London shop about seven months ago—his salary was 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year and board and lodging—in consequence of suspi<lb/>cions I saw Sergeant O'Dee at Vine Street Station, and he marked some coins in my presence with a letter-punch—I received from him live half-sovereigns marked "J," which I placed in the till at New Bond Street just before 11.30, removing all other money except between 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver unmarked—I had sent Blunt upstairs—we keep this cash-book (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) at the shop, and also a cash-sheet—the assistant who receives money for shop sales enters the amount and the article sold, on the cash-sheet, and puts the amount in the till—while Blunt was upstairs I made a fictitious entry in the book, so that he might not suspect that the half-sovereigns had been put into the till—the page was blank—the sheet was in its place by the till—the entries are in pencil; there were three, and I had marked the last—Blunt came down in a few minutes—it was his duty in my absence to serve customers and receive moneys—I had communicated with Mr. Williams, the other assistant—I then went away for about half an hour—Detective Sergeant O'Dee was near the shop by arrangement when I returned, and Blunt Was serving—I do not remember if Williams was there—I stood at my bureau, and saw Blunt write the last entry in the cash-book "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., Miss Stuarton"—"Pinto" is the fictitious entry—the 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is Blunt's, and "Sands "is mine—"Sutton "and "Stuarton "are his writing—"Livier "and "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. cash-book "are mine—I then cleared the till of all the gold, viz., five half-sovereigns marked "J," one half-sovereign marked "F," and three unmarked—there was about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. silver—I found three entries had been written in the cash-sheet by Blunt "Anti-fat, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; Mrs. Ellis, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; Maddison, 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—after communicating again with O'Dee, I came back to business and waited for him—I said nothing to Blunt—O'Dee came in about ten minutes and spoke to me in a private room—Blunt was then called in from the shop, and O'Dee asked him if he had any money; he produced two half sovereigns—after examining them, O'Dee said "These are marked coins; I caused them to be paid over the counter"—he replied "You have me"—I give him in custody—I had seen the two half-sovereigns stamped "T "by the officer.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We have generally two, and often three assistants, not including the boy Fitzgerald—on this occasion Williams and Blunt were the only two, and the shop was under-handed—it would not be Blunt's duty to prepare medicines or prescriptions; that was Williams's</p>

               <p>duty—we have a cash trade and a credit trade—ready money across the counter would be entered in the day-sheet, and money received on credit aecount would be entered in the cash-book—Williams would also enter on the sheet anything he sold over the counter, and it would be his duty to enter it then and there; that is the practice, but I have known it violated—at the end of every day there is always an item "sundries," which includes money received for goods sold over the counter—I do not know that the prosecution have received notice to produce the other day-sheets—"sundries "would appear in all of them, and would sometimes amount to 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it is irregular, but there is nothing wrong in it—I first gave information to the police on Thursday, 30th October—Detective O'Dee was called in on 1st November—Blunt has been with us about 18 months—I do not know of my own knowledge whether he came with testimonials or a character—he is qualified to dispense medicines; we have been friendly—I had a tiff with him on 29th October—I told him not to be so insolent—I told him that in the presence of a customer—I told him that unless he apologised I would write to the manager in Paris—Williams was in the shop when I put the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the till; he did not see me; Blunt was there; he could see if he liked—I did not call him; I Buspected him some two or three weeks; I do not remember the day I quarrelled with him—I said at the police-court "When I came back at 12 o'clock I found one half-sovereign marked T and three half-sovereigns not marked n—I saw the boy Fitzgerald when I came back—Blunt said he had replaced the two sovereigns by the half-sovereigns—I do not remember what else he said—when the detective told him they were marked he did not say "Well, if they are marked you have me, but I took four half-sovereigns out of my pocket and put them into the till"—he only said "You have me," and nothing about "if they are marked"—I do not remember what else—I cannot remember the conversation, except that he said he replaced the two sovereigns he had in his pocket by four halves—I saw the boy in the hall when I came back—there is an entry 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. written in the cash-book by Blunt; that is Mr. Sutton's account; also 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received on account from Mr. Stuarton; also 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the ready-money purchases of the persons who paid the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Stuarton was the customer the boy was sent to—when I cleared the cash I noticed that "Stuarton" was entered in Blunt's hand<lb/>writing—the tiff arose intentionally on my part—we had all been watching him so closely that I thought he was getting suspicious, and to restore his confidence I pretended to have a tiff with him—my principal was in Paris; the marking of the money was not with his knowledge, but they knew I was Watching Blunt—they have left the prosecution entirely to me—Mr. Bankhousc has been over since.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant C</hi>). On 1st November I marked these gold coins (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the two sovereigns taken from Blunt are marked T; there were no other marked sovereigns to my knowledge—I did mark these others, but they never, left my possession—I gave the two marked sovereigns to Elliot—I also marked these five half-sovereigns with the letter J and gave them to Mr. Saunders, and he took them away—I also marked four half-sovereigns with the letter F, and gave two of them to Elliot with certain instructions—I only got one back again—I kept the other two (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and have now three—after marking them I went a few minutes to 12 o'clock to 76, New Bond Street—Mr. Saunders had left me about half an hour before—I waited at the corner and walked up and down till he came to me—I saw him return to the shop, and I went in shortly after and saw Blunt there—after a conversation with Saunders in the private room Blunt was called in—I said to him "Have you taken any money?" he said "I have"—I said, "What have you got? just put it on the table"I had told him I was a detective sergeant—he took from his pocket the two sovereigns produced marked T, and about 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. silver unmarked—I said "These are the two sovereigns" that were paid in juet now; where did you get them from?"—he said "I took them over the counter, and I placed four half-sovereigns in the till in place of them"—after some conversation with Saunders Blunt said "There is no question but what you have me"—I then took him to the station—he gave no reason for replacing the two marked sovereigns—I afterwards searched his lodgings and found two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—I made inquiries and ascertained that they were his own money, and had been drawn from his banker's—he had 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the bank, and paid in 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and drew out the notes.</p>

               <p>any information—a day or two after 29th January the trustees' managing clerk, Mr. Humphrey, who has since died, came to me, and after that com<lb/>munication I saw Budgett—this draft was, I believe, drawn up on the 28th, and presented to Mr. Budgett on the 29th—I drew it upon the instructions of Mr. Humphrey, who was Mr. Leatherdale's managing clerk—the engross<lb/>ment of that was put before Budgett; he approved of it, and Mr. Leather<lb/>dale signed it; he came to my office on the same day, and the affidavit was taken down by my clerk—I read it to Budgett—I did not see him sign it; it was afterwards filed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> At the time the examination took place nothing had been done beyond the filing of the petition against Appleby and the petition and affidavit in support of it; he had not been an adjudicated bankrupt then—our object in getting Budgett there was to show that Appleby had departed from his dwelling-house to defraud his creditors—I examined Budgett for the purpose of proving an act of bankruptcy, and it was proved to the satisfaction of the Court, because they adjudicated it—I was satisfied with the examination—you do not find, as a rule, a brother-in-law coming forward voluntarily to give evidenoe—the first person Budgett put himself into communication with was Mr. Humphrey, as far as I know—Mr. Leatherdale is here, but Mr. Humphrey knew a great deal more about it—I saw Mr. Leatherdale frequently, but I saw Mr. Humphrey much oftener—there was no conversation between me and Humphrey and Budgett about it, except that I read the draft—giving evidence on a prosecution was never mentioned—what we wanted to do was to discover the bank<lb/>rupt's property—the affidavit was taken down by the clerk; it is more Budgett's language than the clerk's, but it was put into legal form; in fact, they are Budgett's words; I have no doubt it was read over to him—the contract he entered into about giving me information was carried out by him—the result of his coming forward voluntarily and giving me informa<lb/>tion was to upset the deed by which some sum was recovered—I am per<lb/>fectly satisfied with the way in which Budgett carried out the contract—that affidavit was supplemented by another to correct the date, it is up<lb/>wards of four years ago—this affidavit, coupled with others, were used on the motion—the trustee was represented—I think notice was given to Budgett to cross-examine him on his affidavit—he was cross-examined by Mr. Brown's representative four hours, it extends over 3,000 questions; Brown was cross-examined by Mr. Robertson Griffiths, and it seemed very much like being done in a hostile spirit—the decision of the Bank<lb/>ruptcy Court was in my favour; there was no appeal, and during all the time the proceedings were pending Budgett was at my disposal up to the last, and gave me every information—when it was proposed to take criminal proceedings and I heard that it was going into the hands of Miller and Miller, I said that it could not be in better hands—their appointment as solicitors is on the file; that was the first of criminal proceedings—the matter remained in my hands until criminal proceedings were instituted.</p>

You may expect to see him on Thursday or Friday next, when he will make arrangements. We beg to enclose a bill for 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which our Mr. Reid will explain." I produce the bill dated 8th July drawn by Fleming, accepted by Smith Brothers at two months—that bill was subsequently dishonoured—it was sent down by them, and I signed it, and on the Thursday or Friday the prisoner came down to Liverpool, and I saw him, and he then gave me an order in the names of 20 or 30 respectable firms in London—I had a conversation with him about the bill—he said he had left town on the Monday that I received the letter from Smith Brothers saying "Our Mr. Reid will call upon you, etc.," and added "That has been sent up in my absence; I know nothing about it; I will make inquiries when I return"—I explained to him that the bill was of no use to me, as I expected cash, and he said he would see about it when he returned—at that time he referred to an order of Mr. Leigh Cande, of Dunkerque—I asked him whether he was a reliable person, and he said he was—upon that I sent the goods, and sent. the invoice to Smith Brothers—he said I should receive the cash immediately on the receipt of the goods—I have not received it—the Monday afterwards, 29th August, I received from the prisoner this other bill for 1,000 francs, drawn on Ricoto and accepted by "Whitehouse, payable at 42, Rue de Moscow, Paris—I passed it through a bill-broker in London—I did not supply any more goods until after 12th July—in the middle of August I came to London and went to 39, Wilson Street—I found it to consist of two front offices on the ground floor, level with the street, and some back premises and a long passage—I saw Some empty barrels, and found a few samples of sardines and pickles—tie name of Smith Brothers was on the door—I then saw the prisoner, and told him I did not like the bill which was running, and that I would take 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the other goods—he said that he had bills owing that would become due before this bill matured, and he could not possibly let me have any more; he told me to call again in two or three hours, and he would try and get the money for me—I went into the City, and when I came back I saw the prisoner sitting on a stool in his office eating a bun—I asked him if he had got the money—ho said "No," he had not been out—I asked him what he had done with the goods, and he said "I hare sold them"—I asked him what he had done with the money—he said "I have spent it"—I parted with the goods believing the orders were genuine, and that Smith Brothers was a <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> firm doing a genuine business—putting it down at the lowest figure, after deducting commission, etc., I have lost 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the prisoner—I saw no person of the name of Smith.</p>

I only went after it was sold to collect the accounts, and I found it was sold for as much as it was worth. Mr. Clark keeps a tally shop and asked me to issue books to anybody who came into my shop who wanted goods on that system, and no doubt some of them gave me false addresses, and I could not look after them. I went to the Magistrate and tried to get a detective to take one man who gave me a false address.

                  </hi>. I am one of the official short-hand writers of the Bankruptcy Court—I took short-hand notes in this matter on 25th February, 13th March, 2nd May, and 20th May, 1879—the transcript on the file is correct—I was present at the first meeting of creditors under the liquidation; it was of a very stormy character; it lasted till a late hour in the evening, and broke up without any resolutions being passed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Hassfelt was there—I do not know whether he is a relative of the Barnetts—Mr. George Lewis appeared for the creditors something was said about a warrant, but I do not recollect what—the defendant was taken in custody on a warrant just at the close of the meeting—I was at the Mansion House on several occasions—I do not remember hearing Hassfelt say "Now we shall get 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound" when the prisoner was given in custody—there were a great many adjournments, and while he was at the Mansion House they were going on with the private sittings—I do not think the meeting was so disorderly that Mr. Lewis could not be heard; Mr. Lewis is always heard with great attention when he speaks, and they listened to what he had to say.</p>

                  </hi>. I am engaged for Cope and Simner, general merchants, 7, Well Street, City—I have known the prisoner two or three years, he had small dealings with the firm—I called on him first at the end of February or the beginning of March and said that I heard from our traveller that he had an order for Lima, and we had prepared a collection, and a few days afterwards he called with Mr. Coates—we were to supply the goods on three months' credit, and if they were not paid for then, a three months' draft at two and a half—those conditions were agreed to—I had not known Mr. Coates before; the defendant said that he was his buyer—Coates made a large choice of goods, Barnett simply assenting—that lasted two or three days, and the collection he made came to a much larger amount than I expected, and at the close I had a private conversation with Barnett upon it in his office—I knew that it was an old-established firm, and he said that it was Harris, Cohen, and Co. of Lima—the defendant said that he had known Coates as a little boy and had more confidence in him than he had in his own brother—they said that Harris and Co. were an old-established firm of jewellers, and were opening a dry goods' store as well—the articles selected were dry goods to the amount of about 1,100/.—they were to be forwarded to Harris, Cohen, and Co. of Lima, and the invoice, bill of lading,</p>

               <p>and insuaance policy were to be sent to Mr. Barnett—we were to draw on Barnett if any bills were drawn—the money was not paid at the expiration of three months, and we drew three bills which Barnett accepted, the first of which was paid, and the other two dishonoured—we had them at the meeting of creditors and they passed into Mr. Sears's hands, and from him to Mr. Wontner—700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is still due to us—Barnett said, "You may look to me," and he was indignant that I should not think him worth 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—I was not satisfied with that, but I could not get more from him—not being paid when we expected, I went and saw Barnett about it early in November—I asked him what was the meaning of the bill being returned dishonoured—ho said it was in consequence of the non-arrival of remittances from Lima, which had taken him by surprise—I asked whether that firm had failed—he said no, and he should be very sorry for the creditors if they had paid, that it was unfortunate for them, his brother was present, especially after all the money he had paid into the concern—I went home after that interview, taking the name of their solicitor, and in a few days I heard that they had stopped payment—we parted with the goods in consequence of his repeated statements that the firm in Lima was an old—established firm, otherwise I would not have done it—the transactions were small, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or so; we never had one of 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before—shipping business is not our legitimate business—I saw Coats in the street for one or two months afterwards, sometimes with Barnett, and sometimes alone, but I never spoke to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Cope and Simner are Germans, but the firm is in Paris, London, Lyons, and Gottingen—I have represented them four years—these goods were specially insured—we packed them ourselves, and directed them to Harris, Cohen, and Co., through the Liverpool agency of the Lima line, to go to Callao, which is the port of Lima—nothing was said about con<lb/>firming these sales—he said "I am responsible, and you have only to look to this firm," assuring me that it was an old-established firm, and he might as well earn a safe commission—he was, of course, pledging himself to see me paid—it spread over a month or six weeks before the whole of the goods were dispatched, but the time began to reckon from the very day of each respective invoice; there were three or four invoices—we then took three months before we drew at three months—we did not begin the shippings till the middle of March, and it was the end of April before they were com<lb/>pleted; we went to the middle of July before we drew—we did not sell the defendant one shilling's-worth of goods after the last shipment—large houses like Faudell and Phillips and Hattons deal in cheap jewellery as well as trimmings, but they do not consider themselves trading houses—I am a Swiss—if the purchaser is not very clever to forecast the fashion, the depreciation of value of such articles may be enormous—I believe I went to the Mansion House to get the warrant, on the very day of the first meet<lb/>ing of creditors—I do not think I had been there before to lay an informa<lb/>tion—I employed Mr. Wontner—Gard and Godwin are my regular soli<lb/>citors—Mr. Hassfelt introduced me to Mr. Wontner; Mr. Hassfelt told me that he is Barnett's brother-in-law—I only saw him a very little time before the meeting—he called on me—I cannot remember that he told me that, if I got a warrant, I should get all my money; I did not say to him that I did not like to undertake the responsibility alone, but if he would give me an indemnity I would join—I said that such proceedings were generally</p>

               <p>costly things, and I did Dot like to go into it without knowing how far it would go, but if he considered himself aggrieved, and liked to join in it, I did not mind—he suggested criminal proceedings—20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the limit I was prepared to go to, and all the rest for Hassfelt—I have that in writing, but not here; we exchanged ideas, and from him I got the idea that all the statements Mr. Barnett had made were false—I do not like to swear that no syllable passed my lips or Hassfelt's about getting a large dividend by criminal proceedings—I do not recollect that 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound was mentioned—Hassfelt did not say that he would pay most of the costs, and would take me to a good criminal solicitor, Messers. Wontner and Son—I believe he said that he had collected some evidence, and had put it, or was going to put it, into Messrs. Wontner's hands, and he took me to Mr. Wonter—he did not say that, though he had collected all the evidence, it was not well for a brother-in-law to be prosecuting a relative; but he said that my evidence was the only evidence on which a warant could be got—I do not think he said that that was what Mr. Wontner had told him: until he told me that I had not seen Mr. Wontner, and that was the first time his name was mentioned—I had not supplied him with my evidence, or given my statement to any one on oath—I don't think Has-felt made notes of my statement, but it is a year and a half ago; this conversation was a week or ten days before the first meeting of creditors—Hassfelt was a perfect stranger to me—the petition was filed on the 18th November, and he may have come to me on the 19th; I do not think I went to Mr. Wontner the same day, but within a day or two—I only saw Mr. Wontner once before I went to the Mansion House, and my statement was then taken down, and questions asked me as to my statement, which was not always very clear, because I wrote it in English—I understand all you say to me—the warrant was not in the hands of the police before December 6th—I do not know whether it was brought to the Lord Mayor's attention that the first meeting was to take place that day—I was at the meeting, but Mr. Wontner was not—Mr. Hassfelt was there, and was very excited—I did not hear him call out to the officer to have Barnett handcuffed—I saw Barnett taken in custody when the meeting was over, but I did not even know the officer till I saw him take Barnett—it was arranged that he should wait till the meeting was over and then take him—he was put in the dock before the Lord Mayor; the information that I had sworn was read—I was sworn and said that it was true—it was stated that he had been arrested at his first meeting of creditors, and Mr. Wontner asked to have it adjourned, which was done—I went there on oath twice—I may have been sworn as to the truth of my infor<lb/>mation—Barnett was admitted to bail, and came up several times at the Mansion House while the private examination was going on—after he passed his last examination there were adjournments till I was examined on 9th June—I have not paid my 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. yet—I have not discontinued Mr. Wontner as my solicitor in this matter—I believe the Treasury have taken it up, and I suppose Mr. Wontner represents the Treasury—I did not get from Mr. Hassfelt also an indemnity against any damages which Mr. Barnett might recover against my firm for malicious prosecution—I think I can get a paper which I say is an indemnity; it is at our office; I can send for it—I did not, between April and September, when the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid, solicit Barnett to give me further orders for Lima, or orders on his own</p>

I thought it more than enough, and forbade the travellers going there—he said that the firm at Lima were an old firm he had known for some time, and had done some little business with—Hassfelt came to consult me as one of the creditors—he said "I am Mr. Hassfelt," and stated the amount to which he was a creditor, that he knew there was some fraud in the case, some false state<lb/>ment which he thought he had evidence enough to show, and he wanted to know whether our firm would join in the prosecution—he gave me a few outlines of what the frauds were just to satisfy my conscience—I told him I could not embark in anything which I did not know where it would lead me to: I know that law costs money—nearly all of the creditors at the meeting were indignant—Mr. George Lewis was there on Barnett's behalf; I knew him as a well-known criminal solicitor—the indignation of the creditors was the cause of the confusion—no warrant was taken out against Eleazar Barnett.</p>

Drouitt—the balance-sheets for June and December, 1877, are not signed, the last one signed is December 31, 1876—Eleazar Barnett was a partner when I went there, so I cannot say when he came in—the cash payments are brought out at the end of each month; the total for July is 7,069<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; for August, 11,128<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; for September, 10,721<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and down to the stoppage on 25th October 12,110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. cash payments, including bills—I do not see why those figures should be subject to correction—all bills entered here are paid; that was the flow of cash out of the concern—with regard to the comings in, Montague Barnett or his friends brought in 800/. before 26th October—as to the actual stop. page, there had been a failure of remittances from Harris of Lima—orders for fancy goods or trimmings and braids are usually given two or three mouths before they can be executed—the generality of the goods delivered in August, September, and October would be ordered two months before—as far as I know, there was no pressure on the firm then—several parcels were refused after the first bill was dishonoured to the amount of many thou<lb/>sand pounds—I remember Miss Lewin coming and getting the silk and the watches before the first bill was dishonoured—I can't say whether she insisted on having the goods to meet her bill, but the goods given her were duly entered in the books—I believe Barnett sent money to Manchester in November, 1877, to fit up the premises there—I continued to act for the trustee for a few weeks—Andrews and Mason were the receivers under ha liquidation down to the adjudication in January, and they received letters from Lima and about 200/.—I gave them the figures and helped thorn to take out the figures—this is the statement lithographed for the creditors for the meeting of 6th December—I gave the figures for it as I found them in the books, and the defendant did not interfere—I urn not aware of any inaccuracy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant, of 20, Ely Place, Holborn—I was applied to by Barnett, 18th May, 1878, to make a balance-sheet for him for the last half of 1877—a trial balance which had been made by a gentleman named Trotter was handed to me—it was imperfect, and I requested Barnett to allow me to compare it with the books—he refused, but finally I got the materials to make a true balance-sheet, and the final balance for the half-year ending 31st December, 1877, showed a net capital of 360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—the value of the lease of the premises in King Street was included in that sum; the value of them is shown in the private ledger,—I believe it was 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the result of my investigations was entered in his private book; this is the entry signed by me—the lease is put down at 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it was given me originally as 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and it was put down with the assets as 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the first balance-sheet; it appeared at 142<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the previous balance-sheet for June, and in the trial balance-sheet at 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—omitting the question of the lease altogether the previous balance-sheet showed a deficiency on the capital account of about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I called his atten<lb/>tion to that, and he told me he wished the value of the lease increased by 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as he had made several alterations on the premises, which fully accounted for the amount to be added—I acquiesced in that after asking him to specify the alterations, and it was entered in the balance-sheet as 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not look at the alterations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know Mr. Trotter—he may have said after the final balance-sheet had been given to him that he wanted the books gone through, and the stock taken, but not before—I said I understood he could not let me have the books, because they were very busy, and the books were in use—that is what I call a refusal—he said that I might safely take Mr. Trotter's figures—my charge of four guineas would have been a most inadequate remuneration if I had not taken Mr. Trotter's figures—neither I nor any clerk under my direction took any account of the stock with the exception of the figures raising the value of the lease—the defendant never gave me a single figure—I remember seeing the bill-book; all the other books were very much in arrear—as to posting up entries book, a bill should be entered the moment it is given—I di covered a little error of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I cannot say that it was made by Mr. Trotter, and another little error of 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that did not affect the trial balance, but the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. did—the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was an error of the clerk in the office, and the 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was a balance which had been omitted to be written off—after the conclusion of the four guineas' worth of work I delivered the papers to E'eazar Barnett at his request—the Manchester stock is entered in the balance-sheet, and I cannot say whether the defendant said "You have taken no account of the Manchester stock"—I will not swear he did not—I believe I have not said "I cannot recollect anything being said about Manchester at all"—the conversation about the lease was previous to my handing over the papers in August—I sent in my account for four guineas on 20th July, and on 28th August I professed my readiness to make up the balance-sheet to June; no arrangement was made as to my remuneration for that; it would have been far more than four guineas—I compared the trade ledger with the bill-book, and the entries were all correct except the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It was when I presented the first balance-sheet to him that he raised the question of the increased value; the balance-sheet he was then speaking of showed a deficiency, and the lease was put down at 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he said it was too low—Mr. Trotter has done what I should have had to do if he had not—I presumed that he had checked the whole of the work—my labours were only putting the figures together, otherwise I should have had extra labour for which I should have charged—the error of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the only one affecting the balance-sheet, that was corrected in my final balance-sheet—the value of the stock at Manchester, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and of the cash at Manchester, 144<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., was included; that refers to the state of things on 31st December, 1877.</p>

Harris for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and accepted by the bankrupt at three months, dated 23rd July—I find on 28th October the following bills were dishonoured: one drawn by William Harris, accepted by Barnett, and held by Joseph Brothers for 568<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; it fell due on 25th October, being a six months' bill from 25th April, and on the same day a bill drawn by Bacher and Leon, on 25th July, at three months, for 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., due on 28th October, and on 30th October a bill for 577<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a bill drawn by Cope and Simner at 90 days, dated 29th July—by the statsment of affairs I find 18,733<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., due to unsecured creditors, and 1,115<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. due to creditors fully secured; estimated value of securities 1,445<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., surplus 330<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the creditors partly secured are 2,443<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., estimated value of securities 913<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I find other liabilities put down at 2,292<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. expected to rank for dividend to the extent of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the liabilities on bills discounted was 6,935<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which will rank against the estate 4,524<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., less cash and bills held by bankers 387<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., total value ranking against the estate 4,149<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the stock in trade in Ring Street is estimated at 860<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the book debts 2,672<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., estimated to produce 1,886<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the amount</p>

Wolf 2,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—there is no other entry to show what that is for, but it is called the Manchester account—the first of the bills which appear as cancelled was due on October 22nd, then comes November 14th, 22nd, 30th; December 4th, 22nd; and January 22nd and February 22nd, 1879—they are drawn by W. Harris on the bankrupts, and I was present at the examination when Mrs. Harris admitted that the signature was hers—my materials for the value of the stock at Manchester are just what the bankrupt stated, which is all down here, and his books, and I also made inquiries for Nicholle, Dupin, and Co.'s employed—at the time of the sale to Wolf the bills remitted from the London house to Man<lb/>chester from the beginning were 1,879<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., they are all in the hands of creditors who have not been paid; they appear in the books (<hi rend="italic">Heading a number of entries</hi>)—I find among Barnett's a number of bills drawn on Phillips, of Manchester, amounting to 989<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. by the bill book—they are payable on the National Provincial Bank of England—that may be the Manchester branch—I find Miss Lewin's name in the books, and an entry on 25th October, 1878, "Messrs.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Exhibit "H," which was produced at the Mansion House, was Miss Lewin's bill—the date of it does not correspond with the debtor's books; the bill itself is payable on 22nd July; a noting ticket is put on value 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but the ticket bears no date—the bill shows that it is due on 25th October—a bill of Narcoso's fell due on the 26th—Miss Lewin was examined—I have not been advised at present to bring an action against her to recover the value of the goods—she is entered as a creditor for 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she holds several bills, one of which is for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there has been no proof by her at present—she can prove for what she likes, but we should not admit the proof; we should not allow her to rank for dividend without charging for the goods—she can only rank against the estate after crediting all the cash and goods she has received—I acted for Josephs Brothers' creditors for 1,015<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on October 28th, that was the first time my attention was called to the failure—I saw Mr. George Lewis, sen., who is now dead; Josephs were his clients, I went there to instruct him, and he had already been instructed—Mason and Andrews were acting already and had sent out a circular that the books were in their hands—they' are respect<lb/>able people—they ceased to have anything to do with it because the liqui<lb/>dation had fallen through—the papers came from them into my possession; they prepared the statement, ana in the bankruptcy also; I prepared none—I believe a copy of the same statement served; I don't think there was any alteration—the committee of inspection were Mr. Percy, Mr. Josephs, Mr. Appleby, Mr. Kelly, and Mr. Fister—I went fully into the defendants' books when I became trustee—I prepared this exhibit "G," it shows that the firm of which M. Barnett was a partner commenced prior to December, 1866—he continued a partner all those years down to this failure—he has had three partners in that time, Mr. Druitt, Philip Samuels, and William Harris—Druitt was the first partner, and then Harris, Druitt, and Montagu Bantt were all together from 1867 to December, 1871; they all signed the balance sheets—William Harris and M. Barnett were then left alone till December, 1873; Harris has not signed the balance sheets, but his capital is here—the firm was next composed of M. Barnett and Philip Samuels, up to December, 1874, and then M. Barnett, Philip Samuels, and Eleazar Barnett—the first balance sheet showing capital to Eleazar Barnett is in June, 1875—I believe Samuels went out in June, 1876, leaving only the two Barnetts in; no, I see he was still in in December, 1876—the capital rose from 2,129<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in 1866, to 11,948<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in December, 1871; it fluctuated to 7,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 8,400<hi rend="italic">l:</hi>, until it appeared in December, 1875, at 4,452<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it then gradually fell to 363<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when the capital was 11,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the reserve for bad debts was 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and when it was 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was a loss in four half-years, and the other half-years a profit—there has been great commercial depression for the last few years—I have no materials by which to estimate the stock at Manchester; there are in the bankruptcy two principal leaks—I have no proof of any banking account at Manchester; Mason and Andrews had the Manchester books—Woolf has an action against us, and we have a counter claim; I took possession of the Manchester business and he got an injunc<lb/>tion against me—I do not know that Mr. Charles V. Lewis was acting for Woolf when I first got into communication with him—Mr. Lewis did not satisfy me that the sale had been the subject of a deed—I have never</p>

               <p>seen a deed; it was not produced by Woolf when he was examined—between six and nine months after the business was disposed of they offered it to me for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound, but that was after they had had the business in their own hands, and after there had been sales intermediate—on 6th December Mr. Woolf got up and said he would give 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the estate; 1 took that to be the estimated value of the stock—he did not claim against that 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to have the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—it was stated, I believe by the bankrupt, that the stock was worth 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Mr. Woolf said that he would give the difference between the price he had given and the valuation, but when it came to the time he never carried out the promise—we have not got the bankrupt's book relating to the Manchester business, and there is no account of the stock week by week at Manchester in Barnett's book—the only account is that the book when marked shows what has gone to Manchester—the destination of all the goods is shown clearly on the books—the vast mass of the goods went direct to Manchester without going through their hands at all—all the invoices sent from Barnett and Co. Were debited for stock in the invoice book—I found the actual invoiced from the manufacturers in Barnett's books—only 10 per cent, was put on the value of the goods as against Manchester; I made a mistake in say<lb/>ing 12 1/2—the 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. includes the 10 per cent. up to June, 1878, but not afterwards—I should not like to swear I knew Parsons 5 or 6 months ago; I gave no evidence against him at the Mansion House—my impression is that I heard about Parsons before the committal in July—I have a list of the hands employed in the London ware-house—from January, 1877, to October, 1878, the monthly expenses in London were 2,087<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., of which 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid to Messrs. Barnett for travelling expenses—that does not include their drawings for their own maintenance, that came out of their share of profit—Montagu Barnett's weekly drawings are mixed up with several accounts—he did not keep them separate—there are loans to Miss Lewin and other people, borrowing and paying back, but his drawings for the four months from July 1 to the end of October were 644<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and in June, 1878, it is 812<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the six months; that would be about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I am not able to say to what purpose those drawings were devoted—I have taken out the loans on both sides—they credit themselves at the end of every half year, and Montagu Barnett's is 520<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the half-year; he took 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and his brother 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week; that went to the trade expenses; he was entitled to draw as an employe—that had not to be taken out in the balance sheet before we got the net profits—we should look at the amount of profit made in the business—Montagu Barnett was living at the rate of about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year from 1877 to 1878—if he paid any person who obliged him any interest that would be debited to him, and being debited to him, it would be in the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—if he drew money from the business and paid it away it must appear to his debit—those amounts we can trace. I have told you of; those we cannot trace we conclude are his personal expenses—every farthing he drew which I cannot trace for loans I put down as personal expenses—the bankers' pass-book is correct, and the items vouched—all the items which appear in the cash-book are carried to some account—I do not think the prisoner wrote in the book at all—we have discovered no item omitted from the books but Parsons; it is impossible; we have no materials—when Mason and Andrews handed me the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. they gave me several</p>

               <p>letters from Lima, signed W.

I was carpenter on board the William—I joined at New I York—on the night of 11th October I was on the watch below—I did not hear anything till I heard the belaying pin come down—I jumped up, and came out of my cabin, and saw the captain standing outside of my door bleeding—I wanted to go on deck, but the captain would not let me go—the prisoner was on deck singing out for the captain—he said "Come up on deck, I will kill you, you son of a b——"—the captain's wife came out to speak to the prisoner, and he said "If you don't stand clear I will kill you I too"—I then went up on deck; the prisoner had then gone forwards—I I saw him with a knife in his left hand, and an axe in the right—I said "Drop those things, and step forward, and don't come no more aft; don't do any more harm"—he said "No, I will not do any more harm to anybody if they will leave me alone"—I afterwards went down into the cabin, and I found the mate lying on the sofa, and the captain standing up; the mate was bleeding—I took off his clothes, and stopped the bleeding—the crew were on deck all night, the prisoner was in the forecastle—in the morning the captain called all hands aft, and asked them to go and tell the prisoner to come aft; he came; he was ready to come—the prisoner said "I know what you want me to come aft for, you will put me in irons"—the captain put him in double irons—the prisoner afterwards said "If the captain dies I suppose I will get 10 years for this"—we went to Havre, and the prisoner I was there given into custody, and taken hefore the Consul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I told the prisoner that it would be better for him to come aft and be put in irons—he came forward voluntarily—during the whole of the time he was on board I never heard him disobey a single order of the captain's—I never heard him refuse to do anything he was told by the captain or the mate—he was always friendly and well disposed with the rest of the crew—he and I were always friends—I never saw the captain drunk; he was sometimes shouting after the crew—he never threatened I to shoot the crew—I heard him on one occasion say "I will shoot you fellows"—I don't know what fellows they were—after the captain was I wounded I heard a shot fired from the captain's cabin—I heard the captain I order him to stop at the mizenmast halliards—I saw him repairing a topsail—I did not hear what was said—I did not belong to that watch.</p>

On 8th October, about 2 p.m., I was with Detective Robinson in Arlington Street, Clerkenwell, and saw Sweeney and English I with a man not in custody; I watched them some time and lost sight of them—about 2.45 I saw Sweeney eating bread and cheese in a beershop I in Arlington Street, and told him I should take him in custody, and asked what he had about him; he made no reply, but pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket; I opened it and found three gold watch-keys, a purse, three pencil-cases, six pairs of silver filagree worked earrings, a gold pin, and three gold lings (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said "The things were given to me"—I saw James English in Holborn about 4 o'clock; another constable followed him, and at 7 o'clock I went with Robinson to 51, Wyld Street, Drury Lane, and saw James English, Puckridge, and Banbury in a room together—I told them we should take them for being concerned with another man in a bur glary at 17, Albemarle Street; they made no reply—I asked Banbury what she had about her; she took from her pocket a pair of silver links and two brooches from her neck-tie, and handed me a purse an I eight pawn-tickets relating to this property—we took them to the station—on 21st October about 11.30 I took Francis at a coffee shop in St. John Street Road, and told him I wanted him for being concerned in the burglary at 17, Albemarle Street—he said "All right; I shall go with you"—on the way to the station he said "I did not go inside; I stopped outside, and the I other two went in."</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The affidavit was ultimately read. The pari upon which the perjury was assigned was a denial of the allegation modi in the fourth page of the pamphlet, that prior to Hannah Dobbs entering the service of the defendant or at any period, he had immoral intercourse with her. The original pamphlet produced on the hearing of the injunction was marked Exhibit A, and this not being forthcoming, a certified copy produced before the Magis<lb/>trate was after much discussion proved and admitted.</hi>) I next saw the defendant about 7 o'clock that same evening; he came to the area gate, and whittled down the area, and Selina Knight went up—I afterwards went up—he asked me to go out for a walk—I said I could not go out then—he asked me if I would come out later in the evening—I told him I should not be allowed out so late; he asked me to come out after my people had gone to bed; after my master and mistress had gone to bed—I told him I would come out at 11 o'clock—nothing more passed then; he went away between 10 and 11 o'clock; I and my two fellow-servants dressed ourselves to go out—I had not locked the area gate—after we had dressed ourselves we all three laid down on the bed in the room behind the kitchen, where we all three slept, and we went to sleep—we were awoke by two policemen holding a bull's-eye lantern over us—we all three got up, went into the kitchen, I made some coffee, and gave to the policemen—they stopped about 20 minutes as near as I can say, and then went away up the area steps—I think it was about 1 o'clock when we went into the kitchen and gave them the coffee—we then locked up the area gate and the doors and went to bed—I saw the defendant the next evening about 7 o'clock—he whistled down the area again—Selina Knight went up first; I went up afterwards—he said "Why did not you keep your appointment last night?—I said we were very tired; we laid down on the bed, and dropped asleep, and were awoke by two police<lb/>men—he said, "Will you come out to night?" I said Yes, I would be out at 11—I got ready and went out at 11—I found him waiting down by the church in Torrington Square—I joined him there, and we went off together—we went to a coffee house; I don't know where it was; it was about a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes' walk from Torrington Square—I don't know in what street it was—we went into a bedroom there; I think it was on the second floor, I am not certain—we went to bed, and he had connection with me</p>

               <p>I went a time or two with Mrs. Pearce she went after I left off going—I don't know that it was in Lent; I forget—I was not charged at Mrs. Pearee'i with having stolen a sovereign—there was a dispute about a sovereign—I was not accused of it I did not leave in consequence of it—no sovereign was given to me, nor yet a shilling—Mrs. Pearce said she gave Selina Knigbt a sovereign for Clara Green to get some butter with—I said that I saw a shilling on the corner of the table, but no money was given to me—that was the month I was leaving—I had given warning—it is not true that I left Mrs. Pearce to go to Mrs. Wallis's; that is a mistake in the pamphlet—when I left Mrs. Pearce I went in Sandwich Street in lodgings, and then I went to Mrs. Wallis—I left Mrs. Wallis to go to Mrs. Cripps for higher wages—I think I stayed in Sandwich Street about a week—I was at Mb. Wallis's two or three months; that was at 133, Euston Road, I think, and I left there to go to Mrs. Cripps—I heard of Mrs. Cripps's situation through Selina Knight—she called on me once in Sandwich Street, and, once at Mrs. Wallis's I think—it might have been twice, but no I more—I met her the evening I was going to see Mrs. Cripps—we lived there together; she was servant at Mrs. Cripps—it was in conse<lb/>quence of what she told me that I applied for the situation there; I only stayed there one month—I left because I did not like it—Selina Knight called once; that was in Guilford Street—from there I went to No. 12, New North Street, Mrs. Northcott's; that is a private house where they let apart<lb/>ments—I was not in service there, I was only two or three days lodging there—I should have looked out for another situation after leaving Mrs. Cripps if I had not known that I was going to the defendant's—I did not know that I was going there before I went to Sandwich Street; I did not know that the defendant was married then—I think I went there on 17th June, 1876, and left on 2nd August, 1877; I was away nearly a month when I left in August, and I went back to live there again—Mr. Riggen-bach was still living there then—he complained of missing some of his things; there was a little dispute inconsoqnence of that; that was in July, 1877—that was not the reason for my leaving the second time—they did not accuse me of having pledged Mr. Kiggenbaeh's things or having sold them—the defendant wanted some money and he pawned all his own things that he had got—it was after the dispute of Mr. Riggenbach'i things that I left; he lost some more things again in 1878, there was another dispute about that—I did not pledge the second lot, I did the first; I did not sell the second lot, I had nothing to do with it—Mr. Riggenbach visited me when I was in prison for stealing; I told him I knew nothing about his things, he came to ask me about the second lot; it was true as to those—I had pawned the first lot—I did not tell him so, I told him I knew nothing about the second lot—I swear I had not pawned or sold the second lot—I did not sell the second lot to Mrs. Pearce in Euston Street—I never sold Mrs. Pearce any gentlemen's cloth<lb/>ing or blankets, or things of that sort, I sold some ladies' clothing—I had not sold anything of Mr. Riggenbach's there; Mrs. Pearce keeps a wardrohe shop, a place for the sale of second hand clothes; I did sell some things to her, but none of Mr. Riggenbach's—I pledged the first lot of his things at Mr. Clarke's, 21, Hampstead Road—I pledged them for the defendant, because he wanted the money for us to go to Redhill together—I knew they were the lodger's things, (<hi rend="italic">The following passages at page</hi>

Mr. Findlay seemed to be a very mysterious personage, he had lots of money, got I know not how"—I did not know how the other lodgers got their money, I never saw anybody get money like Mr. Findlay—"but where he and his money have gone to, I am only permitted to suspect"—I could not say when I wrote this pamphlet where he and his money had gone to—to tell the truth, I mean to say that perhaps he might have been done the same as Miss Hacker—I meant that the sane might have been done to him as was done to Miss Hacker—that is what I suspect; there was a Mr. Findlay lodging there—I stated before the Magistrates, "I have read the pamphlet, there are two or three mistakes in it; one is that I went to Redhill with Mrs. Bastendorff; it should have been Mr. Bastendorff, and there is a wrong name of one of the gentlemen lodgers; Mr. Waldron it should be, it is Mr. Warren, I think those are the only mistakes, the rest of the pamphlet is true. "It is true; there may be some little mistakes in the dates—in the pamphlet H says that I went from Torrington Square to Mrs. Cripps; it should be that I wont to Sandwich Street, and that I went to Mrs. Wallis's before I went to Mrs. Cripps—with those explanations I think the rest of the pamphlet is tree, and that is what I mean. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then are the jury to understand that when you wrote this you suspected that Mr. Findlay, like Miss Hacker, had been murdered at 4, Euston Square?—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was what I fancied, that was what I thought; because the defendant had a revolver. I first thought it when I went back into the service—when I went back I found that Mr. Findlay was gone. I don't say that I knew he had been murdered in the house; I did not suspect he was in the house; I did not think anything about it. I did suspect that he had been murdered. I went back and re<lb/>sided in the house where a lodger was missing since I left, suspecting that he was murdered. I afterwards had a watch and chain exactly like Mr. Findlay's, and which I thought was like Mr. Findlay's; I had that just after I went back to the service, about a week after I think. I don't re<lb/>member how long I had it, about a fortnight or three weeks. I gave it back to the defendant I afterwards received the watch and chain of Miss Hacker. "The police have been too stupid to guess, their officers too im-becile even to accept, a broad and startling clue. Dogberry and Noodle-dum. No matter, that is public business now. "The startling due was to see if they could go and find Mr. Findlay—I could only suspect where he had gone to—I had not told the police that I thought he was murdered—that was what I thought myself; now you are speaking of what I said of the police—as I said before, the startling clue was to see if they could find him, and inquire about him—I did think he had been mur<lb/>dered, and yet I remained in the situation—I do not know who Dogberry is; I never heard of him till I read the pamphlet; I don't know where he lives—I don't know anything about it—I do not know who Noodle dum is, or what he is, or where he lives—I could not fix the time after my return when I received Miss Hacker's watch and chain; the last time I saw Miss Hacker was when she went out to post the letter—that might be on the Thursday or Friday I know it was after she had gone over the third week—she had gone out to post her letter, and she had not returned—it was on the Thursday or Friday that I went to Hampstead with the Bastendorff s' children; it might have been Wednesday—I can't</p>

It was not that Sunday that was spent at Kew Gardens—that is not as I wrote it down in my book—I went again and again to the office—the pamphlet states that I have read it through and declare it to be correct in every particular—I did not any I went to Kew with the defendant—it was not that Sunday that I went to Kew, I was at Redhill, I could not go—I did not read all the pamphlet—I did not read it from beginning to end—I did not write that part that it was true in every particular—I don't know who wrote it—I signed my name to it—I was told to sign it—I don't know by whom, Mr. Moore or Mr. Birley—I did not think of all these little things at the time—I said I thought all the rest was true, all the other particulars—I have not seen much of Mr. Moore and Mr. Birley lately—I have seen them several times about this matter, and have been about with them—I have not seen them here to-day—I saw Mr. Birley here yesterday, but have not spoken to him—I have not seen Selina Knight at their office—I saw her at Mr. Armstrong's office, I met her there—I have seen her every day that the case has been on, every time we came to the Court—I have not gone away with her—I have met Clara Green at the Court, and have seen her twice at Mr. Armstrong's office—I have not seen her at the. Central News office—I saw Selina Knight three or four times between the time of my leaving Mrs. Pearoe and going to Mrs. Cripps—we were always intimate after becoming acquainted at Mrs. Pearce's—I never went to see a baby at Goodge Street, nor vet a child—I really mean to say that, and it is true—I did not go to see her in Goodge Street—I do not know Mrs. Jones in Goodge Street, or Mr. Jones—I know Richard Henry Jones, I have seen him once—I was down there one evening, at his house with Selina Knight, in Goodge Street, Tottenham Court Road—I don't think I went by appointment—Selina Knight went with me, because it was a friend of hers—we went out one evening from Torrington Square, I think—I did not see a child there, nor hear of one—I did not know there was a child there—Selina Knight did not go to see a child to my knowledge—I went into Mrs. Grippe's service because Selina was there—she came and told me and I got a situation in the same house.</p>

I said "Because I have seen it many times;" he said "It is not Mr. Find lay's, I bought it at a sale; "I said "It is just like it;" he said "There are many watches alike;" I said "it is too large for me, this is a gentleman's watch;" he said "You can wear that before I can get you smaller one; "nothing else was said at that time—I took the watch and chain and kept them, not until he gave me Miss Hacker's watch and chain—I had returned that one before I received Miss Haoker's, about a month before, I think; it may be more, it may be live weeks—he asked me for it—he came down in the kitchen one morning and asked me he said</p>

               <p>"Let me have that watch and chain, will you, and I will give you a smaller one; "I gave it to him, and I did not see anything of it afterwards—when he gave me Miss Hacker's watch and chain and eyeglass he came down in the kitchen and handed me a little box, and said "Here is a present for you"—I opened the box, and said "Is this for me?" he said "Yes, it is a smaller one than the first," he said "You will say you had it given to you by your uncle, the same as you said you had the first one from"—he said he had bought it—I did not know it was Miss Hacker's—he said "I bare bought this watch, but this one is rather large, you can wear that, and I may get the chance of buying a smaller one, and I will change that again; "that was all that passed that I can remember—I pawned the watch and chain, I think, in March—I remember taking the children to Hampstead when I saw Miss Hacker go to post a letter; I don't remember the day I went to Hampstead, but I think it was the Saturday after that that this conversation with the defendant took place; I know I received the watch on the Saturday; I cannot fix a date—it was before I pawned the chain that the defendant asked me for Miss Hacker's watch—I never saw that watch again after I gave it to him—he never handed me any money that he had received as the proceeds of the watch—he told me he had pawned it, I saw the ticket; he showed me a ticket, and said he had pawned the watch, and he would take it out again as soon as he could—he asked me to pawn the chain when he wanted some money—I first pawned Mrs. Bastendorffs necklet—there was some young person that had a child by Mr. Basteudorff—he gave me the necklet to pawn; he asked me if I would go and pawn it as he wanted the money—he said he wanted to pay her off, calling the girl by name, all at once, that she had had a child by him—I don't remember the girl's name now; she was a French girl; I had seen her at the house; she had been to the house; that was what took place at the time the necklet was given to me—it was about two days after the necklet was pawned that he asked me to pawn the chain, as he wanted to take the necklet out again, as his wife should not know it; he said so—I then pawned the chain—I never took it out of pawn—I gave the money to the defendant, except 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that I bought a watch with—when he gave me the necklet to pawn he said I could buy a small watch for myself—the chain was pawned for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the necklet was pawned at Mr. Gill's, in the Hampstead Road, in the name of Barnett, I think; I did not give any other name—I pawned the chain in Drummond Street; I don't remember the name; it was near the Hampstead Road end, Thomas's, I think—I pawned it in the name of Bastendorff—the necklet was redeemed; I went and took it out myself; that was after the chain was pawned—what 1 have written at page 14 of the pamphlet about my preparing for confirma<lb/>tion and about the clergyman and the sermon is true; I was confirmed—I don't remember the parson's name; it was at Tothill Fields Prison—Peter told me that he and his brother were bad friends no longer; he told me that in Southwark Bridge Road when he came to me one night about half-past 12—I think it was after the second hearing at Bow Street on this charge—I have been down to Redhill with Mr. Armstrong to the place where the defendant and I bad some refreshment on the Sunday, and I recognised a woman there—when I returned to Torrington Square after being out for the first night with the defendant I found my fellow-servants flitting up, and they were very cross with me for having taken the key of the bedroom out with me.</p>

I am a domestic servant living with my friends at 18, Abbey Lane, Stratford—I am not in service there—in 1875 I was in the service of Mrs. Pearce, of 42, Torrington Square—Selina Knight and Han<lb/>nah Dobbs were my fellow-servants—I know the defendant; I remember him coming there one morning; I was in the dining-room, Selina Knight was in the room, and Hannah Dobbs was sitting outside the windows; the defendant was standing outside talking to her—I don't remember whether I saw him again that night—I remember Dobbs going up the area step about 7 o'clock in the evening—Knight, Dobbs, and I dressed ourselves that night to go out—I don't remember the time, but Hannah was to meet the defendant—at 11 o'clock we went and laid down and fell asleep, and the two policemen came in, and there was some coffee made and given to them—they stayed there about 20 minutes, I believe half an hour—on the following Sunday afternoon I saw the defendant downstairs in the kitchen about 3.30—I believe my mistress was out of town at that time—Knight and Dobbs were in the kitchen—I went out between 6 and 7 o'clock; I would rather say it was 7 o'clock—the defendant was there all that time—I returned at 9 30; he was not there then—I saw him again on another occasion one evening about 10 o'clock; I cannot say how long it was after<lb/>wards; it might be two or three nights afterwards, I believe it was; he re<lb/>mained about an hour on that occasion—I see that his beard is mush shorter now than it was then—I saw him at Bow Streeet on 31st October this year, and looked at him, and I believed him to be the same man that I saw in Torrington Square—I say he is the man; I say so positively.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had not seen him since the time in Torrington Square till the 31st October last—I did not know him at that time—I had not seen him before, I did not take much notice of him the first time—the first time I saw the man was when he came down into the kitchen a night or two after the window cleaning—I was in and out of the kitchen—I don't remember whether I saw him after that Sunday night or not—I saw him twice come into the house; first on the Sunday afternoon and then a night or two after the Sunday—I did not say at the police-court "I don't remember whether I saw him after that Sunday or not"—I said "A night or two afterwards he came into the house, but I don't remember whether I saw him after that or not"—my depositions was taken down, read over, and I signed it—I don't remember saying that; I might have said it, but it was a mistake—I believe it was in September when the window-cleaning was—Mr. and Mrs. Pearce and family were out of town—they did not go out of town together; Mrs. Pearce went first, and Mr. Pearce afterwards—there was only the little boy at home, the others had gone away with Mrs. Pearce—I believe so, I won't be positive—they were away with Mrs. Pearce; they were not at school then; they used to go to school; they went to school daily, not on Sundays; they were not at school that day—I left Mrs. Pearce at the end of November, 1875; Hannah Dobts left a month before me—the next time I saw her was at Bow Street; at Mr. Armstrong's office was the first time I saw her since I left Mrs.</p>

               <p>Pearce, that was before I went to Bow Street—I was ordered to go to Mr. Armstrong's office by a subpoena I had; Mr. Birley served me with it—I have seen Peter Bastendorff; I saw him at Bow Street; that was the frit time I saw him; that was after I had been to Mr. Armstrong's office, on the same morning that I came to Bow Street—I went with the other wit<lb/>nesses; I went there there to see Bastendorff I believe; to see whether I could identify him, to see whether he was the same man I had seen in the kitchen at Torrington Square—I had not been told that he was the man—I was told that he was the man that was in Torrington Square—I hare a pam<lb/>phlet; I bought it on the day that I came to Bow Street, that was after Mr. Birley had served me with a subpoena—when I went to Bow Street, I went and looked at the defendant—I don't know whether he saw me; he was quite close against me; he might have seen me—this is true: "The de<lb/>fendant took no notice of me when I looked at him, he could see I was looking at him. I noticed no change in his countenance when I looked"—he was allowed a seat in the Court, and I went and sat beside him—I was not there above 10 minutes—I did not notice any change in his counte<lb/>nance; he took no notice of me; his is rather a peculiar face; I should net want to see a man's face more than once to swear to him—I believe I could swear to the policemen if I saw them—I said at Bow Street "I don't remember the policemen, "but that was a mistake—this is accurate: "I had a good opportunity of seeing him in the kitchen; his beard is different; I noticed nothing particular about his voice"—I did not hear much of his voice then; he was a foreigner, I believe; it is true that I noticed nothing particular about his voice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> As far as I know I have never seen those policemen since—I did not hear the defendant speak at all at Bow Street—I have never heard him speak since he was in Torrington Square—I saw him on the Sunday afternoon for some hours, and after that, on another occasion, for about an hour—I was told that the man who was in custody was the man that was in Torrington Square—I don't remember where it was that I was told that—when I got in Court I said I believed him to be the man that I saw in Torrington Square—he was sitting on a seat.</p>

I am a cabinet maker, at 14, Charlton Street, Euston Road—I know the defendant; I think it might have been in 1874 that I first knew him, it might have been before; I Knew him in 1875, I am sure of that—I don't see any difference in his general appearance now; he might have his beard a little shorter—he has had a long beard—I know once he had to cut it out in the centre, what you would call a concave.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wholesale cabinet maker of 30, Argyle Square—the defendant was once my partner from February to November, 1875; I think I saw him every day during that time, barring Sundays—his beard then was very much longer than it is now, it nearly covered his shirt front.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first knew him about May or June, 1874; he then had a beard about the same length as when I was in partnership with him—he wore it long the whole time I was in partnership with him——our partnership ceased in November, 1875—I remember meeting him one night in Euston Square with Mr. Dicke some 18 months or two years after the dissolution—I don't know that it was in 1875 that his beard was cut—I should think it is more than probable that I saw him in the earlier part of 1877, but I cannot call to mind any date—I would not swear whether it was 1876 or 1877—I was about to say that I met him one evening with Mr. Dicke in the summer either of 1876 or 1877, and then I noticed that he had shortened his beard—it might have been in 1878, I could not tell.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> During the whole of 1875, when he was my partner, he certainly had a much longer beard, and I may go a little further than that—I remember meeting him at Messrs.

I am a saleswoman to Mr. Blackrock at 252, Totten<lb/>ham Court Road, and I sleep in the bouse, and other persons sleep there—I take my meals there—on 23rd October, between 2 and 3 a.m., I was aroused by a constable ringing the bell, and from what he said I went outside and found one of the shop windows broken, and I missed two sewing machines—a man could get through it, but could not get inside the shop without breaking some glass doors which were bolted inside—the machines which were taken were in the window between the glass door and the window—I last saw them safe at 8 p.m. on the 22nd, when I closed the shop—this machine (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my employer's property—it is worth four guineas retail—I remember securing the window, and saw it safe.</p>

I am the wife of Walter Henry Chapman, carver and gilder, of No. 1, Florence Terrace, Kingston Vale; our shop is also the post office—on Saturday evening, 25th October, between 7 and 8 o'clock, I was in my shop—Terrett came in for two 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. stamps—I gave them to him, and he paid for them and went out—he came in again and asked if a letter would be delivered that night in London—I said, "No, not before Monday morning"—whilst I was speaking to him a man came in with a mask on—it was dark—it was moonlight outside, and the oil light indoors—the man with the mask presented 'a pistol at me—he said nothing at the time—I became alarmed and moved up and down the counter—he held the pistol as if it were to my breast, pointed at me—I said to Terrett, "Do you know this man?"—he said, "No, I have never seen him before"—the man still came near to me, and I said, "What do you mean"—he said, "Money or your life"—I said, "What is it?"—he said, "Money"—I said, "What do you mean"—he said, "Money or your life, quick"—Terrett was standing in the shop at the time only looking at him—I said, "If it is money you want, spare me," and I ran into the parlour and locked the door, and jumped down 12 steps into the kitchen—I ran out into the yard and called, "Murder"—there Were some flower-pots there, and I threw them at the neighbours' doors to call their attention—some people came to my assistance, and I returned to the shop, and found that the two men had gone—the postman was coming for the 8.15 to take the delivery, and I got him to go with me to see if the post-office cash box was all right—I looked at it and found it was all right—I then examined my private till—I had 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver in it, some coppers, pence, halfpence, and farthings—I 'don't know to what amount—I had seen that safe before the man came in, and I found it was all gone except three farthings, a penny, and a halfpenny—this mask produced by Inspector Shaw is the kind of mask that the man had on—the man was about the height of the prisoner Smith.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi> by Mr. Kelly.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman V</hi> 85). I live at. No. 15, Florence Terrace—on Saturday, 25th (October, between 7 and 8, I was at home—heard cries of "murder"—some one came to my house' and took the two prisoners, they were together—they were in the mam road, going in the direction of Wandsworth—I went up to them and said, "I am a police constable, have you been, in the shop at the bottom and demanded money, and threatened the woman?"—they said, "No"—they both spoke—I said, "Are you, not carrying a revolver?"—Terrett" replied, "No, we don't carry firearms," and he immediately fired—we neither of us stopped—he fired across to me—I should think, he was, three or, fouryards from me at the time—Smith was between the, two of us—neither of us had come to. a standstill. (<hi rend="italic">There being another indictment for shooting at the constable, Mr. Sleigh submitted that, the facts relating to that case ought not to be gone into on the present indictment.

I am a widow, and live at 36, Lancaster Street, Borough—the deceased was my only sister—on Saturday night, 8th November, at 8 o'clock, I went to the Duke of York public-house with the prisoner and my sister—there was a lead on there, a friendly meeting for myself—I lost my husband in nine days, and he left me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. when he left the world—there was a subscription for me to get up a few halfpence—the prisoner was there almost the whole evening, from 8 till about 11.30—a man named Harrington was there, my nephew—he came there about 9.30—the deceased was not drinking with me and the prisoner—I never wetted my lips that evening with my sister—Harrington did not drink with anybody else that I am aware of—he brought some beer into the room, and I drank out of it, and so did the prisoner—the deceased went downstairs two or three times with my nephew and Mary Ann Thatcher—she might have gone down a third time—I think not more—the prisoner noticed that—when we were leaving the room he looked sulky, and said to me "There she goes again n—I said "Never mind, Charlie, take no notice"—I don't think he seemed annoyed at the time—he did not appear angry at the deceased going down with Harrington—there was no threat used at that time—we left at 12 o'clock—when the house shut we wanted a quartern of gin—they would not serve it,—and we had to come out—we did not come home—the prisoner put my money that was gathered for me, 15<hi rend="italic">a.</hi> 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., into his pocket with the paper, and wo went towards home—before we left the house the prisoner said, "You b——, I will murder that one before I get home"—I said "Charlie, don't disgrace me"—I did not think for one moment that he meant it—the deceased did not hear it—we walked along Southwark Bridge Road about 12.5—my sister was inside, the prisoner in the middle, and me outside, nearest the kerb—no quarrel took place going home—there was never a word said one way or the other further than he said to her "You made yourself a b——foo," and he up with his list and struck her violently, as hard as he could, on the fore-head—I could not say how many blows, about three or four on the head—she reeled back right round and said Kate, help me"—she did not fall—I broke her fall—she laid on my lap—as she came against me I sat down with her—she bled very violently from the nose and mouth—she did not</p>

I am a cabinet-maker, of 13, Greenfield Street, Com<lb/>mercial Road East—on Saturday night, 8th November, about 12.5,1 saw a congregation of persons on the other side of the way; they were very quiet—I went across to see what was the matter—there were two or three females, and two or three men, five or six altogether—a woman was lying on her back on the pavement, bleeding very much at the nose and mouth—previous to that I said "What is the matter"—a woman said "It is only a family matter; nothing at all to do with you"—another woman said "What is it?"—I stood neutral for half a minute till I saw a piece of paper lit; then I saw the woman bleeding—I said "Who has been ill-using a woman like that?"—the prisoner said "I am her husband and I have punched her"—I said "Has not the poor woman got a drop of water or vine<lb/>gar?"</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, and live at 92, Borough Road—on the night of the 8th inst I was called to see someone in the Southwark Bridge Road—I there found the deceased; she was insensible, but not dead—there was blood on the pavement—she was bleeding at that time; I could not see the state of her face and head, it was too dark; I ordered her to be removed to my surgery—I examined her there; she was dead; she must have died on coming into my place, ox in being brought there—I made a post-mortem examination; there was a large contused wound on the right side of the cheek, and a smaller one on the left, a slight cut on the right side of the Hose—there was no injury to the temples; the bruise went up above the eye and eyebrow on the right side; that was. the large contused wound—they wen such blows as might have been caused by a man's fist—there were no other external wounds—I examined the inside of the head; the brain itself was in a healthy condition; there was a slight clot of blood on the surface of the brain, under the frontal and parietal bones in front of the head; that was a recent deposit, and I believe was the cause of death—I should say that that clot of blood was caused by the bruise rupturing one of the small vessels; I don't think it could have been occasioned by drink.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to a division of police, and live at Union Road, Rotherhithe—on Sunday morning, 19th October, after midnight, I was called to 14, Kenning's Buildings—I found Mrs. Rogers lying on a bed which was saturated with blood, and her clothing was saturated with blood—she was bleeding from a wound just inside the vagina—there were marks of kicks on the inside of her thighs—she had been kicked all about that region—the whole of the structures of the vagina had been divided by some violence, probably a kick from a boot—the wound reached to the bone, and was still bleeding—very great violence must have been used to produce such a wound—the woman was in danger of her life; it was two days before she was pronounced out of danger at the hospital, and a fortnight before she was able to leave her bed—it was scarcely possible to step along the room without putting your foot into a pool of blood—she was pulseless, and as near dead as possible; the place looked like a shambles—she is getting on since she has been attended by the hospital authorities.</p>

               <p>—he said "Nothing, my wife is all rightu—I went upstairs to the first-floor front, and saw Mrs. Rogers lying between the door and the table in a pool of blood, nearly insensible—I asked her in the prisoner's presence what her husband had done to her—she said he had kicked her—lacked her where—she said she could not tell me, but in the lower part, of her body—I ordered her to be moved, and as they lifted her up I heard the blood trickling from her—Mrs. Wand and her brother lifted her up—the prisoner was excited, and appeared to have been drinking, but appeared to know thoroughly what he was about—he tried to get away—I asked him to walk to the station quietly—he said he would not for any b——policeman in the neighbourhood; knowing him to be a very strong man I had to send for assistance—I believe he was quite capable of knowing what he was doing—we had a very severe struggle to get him to the station—I asked what matte him do this; he would not make any answer—I sent for Dr. Browning, who ordered the woman to be removed to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Equestrian, 124, Blackfriars Road—on 31st October, about 8.30 p.m., I served the prisoner with 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of rum; he asked for change for a sovereign; I gave him a half-sovereign, 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I then went to serve a customer, but he called me back, and said "Miss, will you give me silver for this half-sovereign?"—I said "Yes," but directly I took it I saw that it was bad—I am certain it was not the same as I had given him; it was much lighter, but I gave him the change to catch him—he was talking to a man and woman in the bar; they all three left together, and I went after them—a policeman was at the door, and I gave the prisoner in custody in the middle of the road, with the coin—I noticed it because I had taken two bad open a fortnight previously.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">To hear and determine fairly</hi>)—I appointed July 16th for the arbitration, and the parties appeared before me at the Surveyors' Institute, Great George Street—Counsel appeared on both sides—I took notes for the purpose of forming my opinion of the value of the premises and the amount the School Board were to pay Hay ward for the premises—Hay ward was in the room—I heard Counsel state the principal facts which he meant to prove—he claimed 1,062<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the value of the lease; loss by compulsory sale, 1067.4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that is 10 percent; trade loss, 1,805<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and for forced sale of effects, 91<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; total 3,065<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Hay ward was then called and sworn by me; these are my notes of his evidence (<hi rend="italic">The notes were put in and read</hi>)—he was recalled on the 23rd, when I took these notes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not put down everything that passed—Hay<lb/>ward said that he had an income of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; that he kept a memoran<lb/>dum book and ledger—he produced on cross-examination, a ledger, two day books, and some vouchers—he was asked if he kept a banking-account—he said "Not now; I kept one formerly" and that he had had no pass-book since 10th October, 1873—he had the ledger before him, and was asked if the transactions took place on those dates, and he said "Yes"—he was asked if the entries were correct; he said "Yes"—he was next to me and the book was between us, so that I could see—I remember his attention being called to the entry "Topp's Trustees," and he was asked whether he had any dealings with them between 1869 and 1878, and he said that deal<lb/>ings took place on those dates—I cannot recollect his particular words, but his general statement was that the accounts as appeared in the ledger were</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187911240147"/>
               <p>correct—he said that tie date 1870, on page 340, bad been altered to 1878—he was further pressed as to whether the payments had been made in that year, and he said that they were—it was suggested to him that there had been an alteration in the date, and he said on the first day that he had not altered it—his attention was called to folio 442, "Hubbard," and the entry 1876—he gave a similar answer that he had not altered the date; he also said that he had not made any alteration in the dates for the purposes of this inquiry—at the request of the School Board I adjourned the arbitration till the 23rd, a week afterwards, when Hayward was again in the box; his attention was again called to Topp's trustees, and he again said that the entries were correct—his attention was then called to the entries in the pass-book, and that under date of June 6th, 1870, there was an entry of "Topp 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and that the pass-book showed a cheque paid on June 6th, and the ledger showed some date or other with an equivalent amount; there had been an alteration—I think he said that it might be the same cheque—he was challenged with another cheque for 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 11th July, and gave a similar answer—he said "The dates were altered; I will not swear that I have not altered them"—his attention was called to 749, Damon's case, where 1876 was altered—he said "The date may have been altered; I can-not swear"—he was challenged whether the cheque of July 12th, 1871, was not for the same amount as that appearing in the ledger on July 11th, 1876, and he admitted it—he was taken through each of these entries of six different cheques, and I believe the question was put to him about them all—his attention was called to there being no pages in the ledger from 585 to 600; his reply was that he did not remove them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have acted as arbitrator in many cases—my experience of arranging values has been very great—it is usual in a claim of this kind for a witness to estimate the matter before the claim is sent in, and for an accountant to estimate the loss by forced sale and removal. (<hi rend="italic">The schedule of claim was here put in, which was for</hi> 3,065<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">solicitors' and accoun<lb/>tants' charges to be added.</hi>) I think I have known Mr. Kempster before; 1 believe he is a respectable solicitor—following the schedule of claim comes the inability to agree to the amount—Mr. Young acts for the Board in this matter—he would negotiate before the breaking off of the treaty—the first time I saw the parties was July 16th—I believe Mr. Kempster came to the first meeting—I do not know whether he was represented by Mr. Chaplin, who held Mr. Nasmith's brief—I do not think it was a different man on the first occasion to the second—Mr. Nasmith was there on the second occasion, but I think not on the first; there was only one Counsel on the first occasion—I am not quite clear whether the ledger and pass-book were brought into the room by Hayward or by the accountant, Mr. Jackson—it was my duty to sift the claim and the figures—I have very likely often awarded compensation to a man who had no books at all—the value of the evidence is for me, whether oral or written; I use my independent judgment—I can say that page 240, Topp's trustees, was put before me on the second occasion certainly, and I have very little doubt about the first, but I have no note of it—it was clear that there was an alteration—Hayward did not at once say when his attention was called to the 8, that it was an alteration—he said that he could not explain it—he did not say that the act of writ<lb/>ing the alteration was not his act—he said that he did not alter, but he said afterwards that he would not swear anything—the banker's pass-book was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187911240148"/>
               <p>produced at the same time in Damon's case—the alteration is a palpable one, and there are six accounts, I think, which correspond in their six dates to the banker's pass book—the defendant said that he could not account for the alteration, and that he would not swear that each entry under the date of 1870 were not the real entries—Mrs. Hay ward was examined on the first occasion as to the trade profits—Mr. Kennedy, an accountant, was called and swore "I hare had no information personally from Hayward"—Kennedy is Jackson's master, and was, I presume, employed by Hayward—Mr. Vulliamy, the surveyor, was examined as to the claim, which was for 1,168<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the lease, and 10 per cent. added—I allowed 227<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., including the 10 percent.—the lease was produced, and it having 12 1/2 years to run, it was the basis of the calculation—Mr. Vulliamy valued out the amount, and then said 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for the receipts—I did not disagree in that—he deducted ground-rent 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and multiplied it, and brought out 1,062<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; that is how it was done—I not only had Mr. Vulliamy's reckoning of the supposed value, but the evidence of Hayward himself with regard to the letting, and I took the two together—the profit rental of Mr. Vullamy's calculation was, I think, one of 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—the basis of the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was this: I took the rental at 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, from which I deducted 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Hayward said that some things were put down and some not—Mr. Nasmith withdrew the claim for trade losses after the cross-examination after the second day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi>. This is my award (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this pass-book was produced on the first occasion—I cannot say what Hayward said about it except that no further account was kept—on the second occasion his attention was drawn to the entries of payments to Damon and to Topp, and to the altera<lb/>tion of the dates—at the end of the cross-examination on the second day Mr. Nasmith said that he was satisfied the books had been altered—he said "After this I cannot ask you to look at these books, and I withdraw so much of the claim as refers to the trade"—Mr. Young was examined before me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant surveyor to the School Board for London—all the claims come to me before they are gone into by the Board, and 1 report on them and advise the committee what to do—when I advise a settlement they adopt it; if I am not satisfied they act on my report or refer it to a Jury or to arbitration—I remember Mr. Hayward's claim coming before me; it was a lump sum of 3,065<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw Mr. Vulliamy (Mr. Hayward's surveyor) about it, after which I put Mr. James, who is in the accountant's office, in communication with Mr. Hayward, and instructed him to examine the books and make out as far as he could a trade account—I ultimately received a report from him, after which I advised that the Board should contest the claim—it was referred to arbitration, and I was present at the meeting at the Surveyors' Institute on 16th July and heard the opening statement of the claimant's Counsel, who claimed 1,805<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as the net profit for the three years prior to 1878—Hayward was sworn, and the ledger, day book, memorandum book, and vouchers were produced—the pass-book was eventually produced, and Hayward then said that it had nothing to do with this claim, it was too far back—his attention was drawn on the second occasion to the entries of cheques to Damon and Topp, first in the ledger and then in the pass-book, and he was asked if they were the same transac<lb/>tions—he said that he supposed so—his attention was called on the first day</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187911240149"/>
               <p>to the lodger, and he was asked if the books were correct—he said that they were—his attention was called first to the entry "Topp's Trustees," and at tint he said that the date was accurate—he was asked whether he had any dealings with Topp's trustees between 1869 and 1878, and he said that he had had none, but that he had in 1878—with regard to the 1876, I cannot say whether it was as to Topp's trustees or Damon, bat he said that there had been an alteration; he had made an error at the time, and had corrected it at the time—I am speaking of the first hearing—he at first said that it was accurate, but he was under cross-examination for nearly an hour, and at the end he did not speak so positively as at the beginning—he was asked whether he had done business with Damon in 1876; he said "Yes," but I do not remember his being asked whether he had made payments to them—on the second occasion his attention was again called to the page in the ledger with "Topp's Trustees," and he was asked whether he made the alteration himself—I cannot say his exact answer, but he was afterwards pressed if he would swear that he had not altered them, and he said that he would not—the entries in the banker's book were then shown him, and he was asked whether they did not show a payment in respect to the very sums in the ledger—he did not appear inclined to answer at first, but afterwards he said he presumed they referred to the same transactions, and in like manner with regard to Damon—his Counsel said that he was satisfied there were alterations, and abandoned the claim after looking at the book with a magnifying glass.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. James met Mr. Kennedy, who would give me a statement upon which I should act—that was with regard to the trade claim entirely—Mr. James told me very soon after he had seen the books that he had noticed the alterations, and was going minutely through the books—I presume Mr. Kennedy had handed them to him—that was not before any notice to treat was given; it was before any arbitrator was appointed, and I told Mr. Vulliamy it was a very fishy case, but I could not come to any agreement with him—I did not refer to Mr. Kennedy with reference to the trade claims; it is not the custom—I did not communicate with Hay ward; when they appoint an agent it is not right to communicate with the principal—Mr. Vulliamy was appointed agent on September 19, 1878—I told him that it would have to go to a Jury or arbitration—Mr. Kempster, the solicitor, did not give evidence on the books; it was Mr. Jackson—Mr. Kempster was exonerated at the meeting from all blame because he had acted on instructions, but I do not know who from—the alterations were palpable upon the face of them—Mr. Nasmith said that still there was a trade, but he could not persist in that part of the claim because the books. had been altered—I did not hear Hay ward thereupon say "You need not take my word for anything, the books have been out of my hands; but I will call before you the farmers with whom I have done business"—I recollect Mr. Gardner saying "How do you prove you have a profit income of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year?" and Hayward said "There are lots that I never put into my books at all. I will give you every farmer's address. I don't ask you to take my word, I will give you their addresses," but he did not say that he would call them—the Arbitrator said "I understand the claim for compensa<lb/>tion for loss of business is given up."

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187911240150"/>
               <p>and Mr. Chaplin continued it—Mr. Vulliamy, a surveyor of good reputation, valued the claim at 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., hut it was cut down by the Arbitrator to 225<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., including 10 per cent for forced sale—it very frequently happens that claims made on the School Board are cut down in that proportion, hut this was rather a large one—it is the business of the School Board officers to test every fact put before them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi>. We settle 90 per cent of the cases after investigation—Mr. Kennedy was called in the first place, but he knew nothing about it, and then his clerk was put into the box—he vouched his clerk Jackson.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JAMES</hi>. I am a cashier in the employ of the School Board—I re<lb/>ceived instructions from Mr. Young to examine Hay ward's books—I went to his house and asked him for his books, and saw him and Mr. Jackson; he produced the ledger, day-book, and some vouchers—he did not produce the pass-book to my recollection—he opened the books and proceeded to explain them to me—I said that I could not examine them then, and wanted to take them home—he said "I don't like parting with the books"—I arranged with Jackson that the books should be sent to me, and went home—they were not sent, but I sent for them and got them—I made a note of 15 pages, between page 585 and 600, on which there were altera<lb/>tions; those pages were there then, and there were 50 pages altogether upon which dates were altered—I had the books about three weeks—he did not give me the pass-book with the other books—I returned them to Hay ward at Trigon Road; the pages were all there then, but on 23rd July pages 585 to 600 were missing—I have notes of alterations on those pages.</p>

That all that had been made out was at the most an attempt to affect the mini of the Arbitrator by false representations with the view of increasing the amount of an award which might be set aside or never be proceeded with, and that therefore an attempt to obtain money by false pretences had not been made out, and that an attempt to obtain by false pretences an award, the outcome of which might be money, was too remote to support the al<lb/>legation in the first count</hi> (See Reg. v. Evans, 9; Cox, C.

                  </hi>. I live at 18, Sturdy Road, Peckham, and am a cheese<lb/>monger's assistant—on Saturday, the 9th November, at 12 p.m., I was outside the shop (Mr. Tobitfs, 142, High Street, Peckham), serving cus<lb/>tomers—there were some 12 or 16 persons outside, most of them in the road—I saw a one-horse cart coming towards Camberwell from the direc<lb/>tion of New Cross—there were two men and a female in it—I could not see who was driving—it was coming at eight or nine miles an hour, but I am no judge—I should not call it a slow pace—it is a very narrow, thoroughfare; the width of the road is 25 feet, I think—there is a single line of tramway—Baker was standing with others in the road, some three feet from the kerb, looking towards the shop—as the cart came up Baker seemed to throw his body back or take one step back—I could not see whether he was sober—the wheel or the step of the cart struck him, and he was thrown to the ground and run over—the cart proceeded on its way—I afterwards saw it stoped—I don't know whether it stoped itself or was stopped—I did not observe any slackening of speed—a cab was</p>

I was a cheesemonger's assistant, of 43, Marlborough Road, Peckham, but have been discharged through having to appear as a witness, and am now living at Chelsea—I was standing near Mr. Tobitt's shop at the time in question with some others—I saw the cart coming from the direction of New Cross—I did not see who was driving—there were three men and a female in it—I saw it about 150 yards off, and remarked at the time it was coming rather fast—I did not notice Baker—I was in the road, and rushed on to the pavement as the cart passed—it passed about two or three feet from the kerb—they did not alter the pace as far as I know—after the cart passed I heard a cry of "Stop"—I saw the cart going on—I saw it stop 50 or 60 yards from me; I also saw a man lying in the road who had been run over—I afterwards found he was John Baker—I heard no cry before the man was run over—as the cart passed there was a Hansom cab also in the road passing in the opposite direction—the off-side wheel of the cab was about the middle of the tram lines—there was nothing to prevent those in the cart seeing the people—I am no par<lb/>ticular judge, but I should say the cart was going nine or ten miles an hour.</p>

               <p>three men standing in the middle of the road—two backed on to the kerb, and the other one in going on to the kerb stepped bark And fell on to the stock of the wheel—the stock of the wheel caught the man as he was stepping back, and threw him down, and that frightened the pony, and we could not stop for 10 or 20 yards—the prisoner stopped as soon as be could—the road was very greasy—it is a wooden pavement—just before the accident a cab met us going towards New Cross—one wheel was in between the line, and the other on the near side—after the cab passed we got more in the middle of the road—we had pissed the cab before the accident occurred, perhaps about 30 yards—we were three or four feet from the pavement when it occurred—the immediate cause of the accident was the man stepping back and falling against the wheel—it happened sud<lb/>denly—if he had taken a step forward instead of backward he would have been on the kerb—he faced towards the shop—we were all sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Forest Hill, and am superintendent in the service of the P. and 0. Company—about 2.30 in the afternoon of 21st October I was standing on the quay of Victoria Dock—I saw Mclntyre on a dummy between two vessels, the Pekin and the Denmark; I saw him in the act of taking Akook Ali up and swinging him into the water; the boy was passing him at the time on the dummy; he picked him up by the arms, gave him a swing, and threw him into the water, as he would have done a dog—I can't describe it in any other way—I think the boy was thrown out quite 12 feet from the dummy—he rose in the water—he was fully clothed, as you see him now—the water is about 28 feet deep in that part—I was standing probably 6 or 8 yards away from Mclntyre, on the quay, and I rushed down and took him by the collar as he was making his way to get on board his ship, which was just about to leave the dock—the boy was rescued by some other persons—I had not heard him say anything to Mclntyre before this occurred—I called some of my men and the quartermaster on board the Pekiu to come to my assistance, and I held the man until assistance was sent for—Hay ward was the quartermaster—I then saw Murphy take a knife from his pocket—I think he could have seen what the other man did; I don't exactly know where Murphy was standing at the time, he could not have been far away; when I first saw him he was by the side of Mclntyre, on the dummy—I saw him try to rescue Mclntyre on the dummy—he said "I will clear the way. for you to get on board your ship;" those were the words to the best of my recollec<lb/>tion—the Denmark was about leaving the dock, and Mclntyre's effort was to get on board to escape; the Denmark was the ship to which he belonged—Murphy produced the knife at the time he used the words that I have stated; he pulled it out of his pocket—he was secured by some of the men—the lad was taken to the doctor on board the Pekin and examined by my orders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I cannot say I observed the condition in which the men were—the first thing I noticed was Mclntyre seizing the boy and throwing him into the water, that attracted my particular attention, and I prevented Mclntyre from going on board his ship—I have not said that they were both drunk; I don't believe they were—Mclntyre may have been, but Murphy was certainly as sober as I am now—I did not know the state the other man was in—I did not then know Mclntyre was a sailor on board the Denmark, I afterwards learnt that he was once a fireman on board.</p>

I am quartermaster on board the Peninsular and Oriental Company's ship Pekin—she was lying in Victoria Dock on 21st October—a little after 2 o'clock I was standing on th) quarter of the Pekin, from where I could see the dummy on which Mclntyre was, quite plainly—I saw him take the boy up by the two arms and throw him in the water—I could not say whether there was any conversation before he did that; the boy had not been on the dummy exceeding three minutes—after throwing him into the water, Mclntyre made for the vessel first of all; he made a mistake, he ran up the accommodation ladder belonging to the Pekin instead of the Denmark—I saw Captain Angrove run on to the dummy; he made a communication to me and handed Mclntyre to me—at that time the boy was being taken out of the water—I held Mclntyre, a mob got round, I dare say there were nine or ten people—I did not see Murphy at first, till he asked me to let Mclntyre go; I told him to stand</p>

               <p>still and be quiet, and speak to the superintendent, but he became restless, and he stooped down and put his head underneath my chin twice in succession for me to let him go—Murphy came towards me with a knife; he did not do anything with regard to Mclntyre, he only came towards me and Mclntyre; I then let Mclntyre go—Murphy did not say a word when he came towards me—I have seen the knife produced, I could not swear to it, it was a knife similar to that; by the handle I should think that was the same knife—Murphy held it in this position by his side, underhanded—he ran off the dummy as soon as he found I had released Mclntyre—several people belonging to the Peninsular and Oriental Company then came to my assistance—Mclntyre tried to get away—he attempted to get up the accom<lb/>modation; it was put over to the Denmark, and I called out to them on top of the Denmark to haul the ladder up to prevent his going on board—they did haul it up—both prisoners were then taken into custody and taken to the police station—I accompanied the constable on the way at his request—Mclntyre got rather restless on the way, he asked me on one or two occasions what he had done—I said "You will know more about it by-and-by ":—he said he did not know what he had done—at the police station, when I told him what he had done, he said "I did not want to do any harm to the boy, I did it out of a joke"—he was the worse for drink.</p>
