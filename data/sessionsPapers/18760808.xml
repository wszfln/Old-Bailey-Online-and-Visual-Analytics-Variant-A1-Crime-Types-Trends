On 14th June, from information I received I watched the church of St. Martin in Martin's Lane, Cannon Street, with Tansey, about 7.50 a.m., I saw Hawksby and Richards leave the side door of the church, where they were at work—seeing that they looked bulky I followed them—they went to a coffee-house in Fish Street Hill, they stayed in there for about ten minutes; they then came out and I followed them on to London Bridge—I saw the lead inside their trousers before they went into the coffee-house, as I followed them, it was sticking out from the pockets; they had their waistcoats buttoned, and it was round their waistcoat, and their trousers had pockets like flap pockets, and I saw it outside from the pockets—they got on an omnibus at London Bridge; I and Tansey got inside—they got down at White Street, andas they were getting down I could see the lead between their trousers and waistcoat, just outside their shirt—when they got into White Street, Richards left Hawksby, and went in front of him about 6 yards, after saying something to Hawksby, that I did not hear—I saw him then go into Mrs. Jackson's, 22, White Street—Hawksby followed in about two minutes; the name of "Jackson, plumber and glazier" was over the door; they went into the shop, went through, and went into a little back parlour immediately at the back of the shop, a door with a glass window separates the shop from the back parlour; that door was half open—when I got to the shop door I saw the two prisoners go into the little room on the right hand side followed by Mrs. Jackson—this model (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I believe to be correct as nearly as possible—I was standing in front of the shop door when I saw them—they were in the little room a couple of minutes, they then came out and I observed that the lead was gone from their waist—they then went back to the church</p>

               <p>before their time—I followed them; about 11 o'clock I saw Richards come to the wicket door of the church; <hi rend="italic">he</hi> looked up and down the street a second afterwards Hawksby came out, I saw that ho had got some head between his trousers and shirt, underneath—he was then alone—I followed him, he got on a 'bus—Tansey got inside the 'bus and I followed in a hansom—I saw him go into the same place, Mrs. Jackson's, Tausey followed him in, and from what he told me I went into the shop immediately and saw Mrs. Jackson in the act of coming out of the little side room, and Hawksby inside in the act of buttoning up his trousers; I told him I was a detective officer of the City police, and said "Where is the lead you have just brought up"—he said "I have brought no lead in"—I looked down on the floor just where he was standing and saw this piece of lead (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>), it was just by the scales, and there was the exact weight of it on the scales, 65 lbs.Z; I have weighed it since—it was not lying open on the floor, it was just knocked off the scales and a rag was thrown over it—I told Hawksby he must consider himself in custody for stealing this lead—I also told Jackson that I should take her into custody and charge her with receiving it well knowing it to be stolon—she said "For God's sake don't take me," or some words to that effect—I saw a cupboard in the little room with a padlock on it—I said "What is there in this cupboard?"—she said "Nothing"—I asked her to open it—she said she would not, there was nothing in it—I said "I know there is because I saw Hawksby and the other man bring some lead here this morning; if you don't open it I shall burst it open"—she then took from her pocket some keys which she gave me and I opened it, and in it I found about 1 1/2 ton of lead, all done up in the same manner as this, consisting of piping with nails driven in it for the purpose of supporting it by their belts inside their trousers—it was all new lead—these are the straps or belts which the prisoners were wearing when they were searched; Hawksby had his round his shirt inside his trousers, and the nails on the lead came against the leather and held it up—I asked Jackson if she could account for this lead; she said she did not how she had got it—Hawksby said to me "There are good and bad amongst you, and feeling men as well; I will give you a sovereign to just let me slip out at the back door, and you can <hi rend="italic">square</hi> your mate afterwards; I promise you no one shall know a word about it; I will own I have taken that piece," that was the 65 lbs.—I said "I saw you bring some there as well this morning with the other one"—he said "You don't expect me to <hi rend="italic">round</hi> on my mate"—he said "I brought a piece myself, but I would sooner suffer five years than <hi rend="italic">round</hi> on my mate"—we then took him and Jackson to the station—afterwards, about 12.20, I met Richards coming from the direction of the Borough over London Bridge—I told him I was a detective in the City police and I should take him in custody and charge him with being concerned with another one in custody in stealing a quantity of lead from St. Martin's Church, Martin's Lane, the property of his master—he said "You will have to prove it"—I took him to the station and told him that I had seen him at 8 o'clock in the morning with the other one take some lead to Mrs. Jackson's in White Street, Borough—he said he had not been there and did not where it was—I saw Richards searched and this belt found on him; I afterwards saw the lead taken to the church, and the foreman compared and measured it.</p>

               <p>had seen the lead through their trousers; I knew they had got stolen lead I did not take them, because I wanted to get the receiver—I knew the receiver did not live at the coffee-shop, because I was inside the coffee-shop while they were there—I did not go in as soon as they did, but they had not time to part with it—I got in just about a second after them—they were in there about ten minutes; I waited till they came out and then followed them to Jackson's shop—I did not lose sight of them, only just going inside the shop—I knew they had got the lead in their possession then; I did not go into the shop then; I knew the shop before—I believe I have given the same evidence to day as I did before the Magistrate as nearly as I can recollect—I don't think I said then anything about Hawksby saying he would sooner get five years than round on his mate.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">SLEIGH</hi>. Tansey was not with me in the coffee-shop, he was outside all the time—I will swear he did not go in; I don't believe he did, I did not see him—I was not looking after him, I was looking after myself—I was quite close to the prisoners; I can't say whether Tansey saw what I did, they were sitting somewhere about the third box on the left hand side.</p>

The two windows that look out on White Street are windows you can see through; I swear that; I could see through them plain enough—the doors were open—there is a counter on the right hand side of the shop, and on the other side a lot of glass, painters' and plumbers' materials—when you get into the back room you have to go behind the door to get into the little side room, there was nothing in that room; the scales were there—the first time I got there was about 8.15; the transaction—inside did not take above two or three minutes—the second time I got there was about 11.30; Hawksby had just got in when I went in, he had just time to pass into the inner room; Tansey saw more of that than me—I was there about five, ten, or fifteen minutes before I took Jackson to the station—I believe she said "For God's sake don't take me, for the sake of my children"—Tansey said "You should have thought of that before"—she said "I did not know I was doing wrong, I only bought bits of lead"—she had got the key of the cup<lb/>board on a bunch in her pocket—I should like to say one word more; this model is not quite correct, there is a little side door which is the door Hawksby wanted to go out of when he offered me the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that leads round some passages, so that you can get out the back way.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detretive</hi>). On 14th June I was with Davis and I saw Hawksby and Richards about 7.50 come together from the church in Martin's Lane and cross King William Street—I noticed that they were bulky about their chests—I followed them to a coffee-shop on Fish Street Hill; they went in and remained there about ten minutes and another man with them; I watched at the door opposite, Davis was along with me—when they came out they went up the steps on to London Bridge, and got on the top of an omnibus, I and Davis got inside—they got off the omnibus at St. George's church and went down White Street, Richards about 20 or 30 yards in advance of Hawksby; they went into No. 22, White Street, Mrs. Jackson's—we remained there; Richards came out and Hawksby was going in at the same time, he subsequently came out, they were both very much thinner when they came out—they went to a public-house close by, and then went over London Bridge—about 11 o'clock I was with Davis in Camion Street and saw Richards look out at a door; expecting that he was</p>

               <p>coming out we watched, Hawksby then came out and went into King William Street, he remained there a few minutes, apparently waiting for some <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, he then went on to London Bridge and took an omnibus—I went inside, he got off the omnibus at Angel Court and went through the courts into 22, White Street, Davis was close by me in the street—I followed Hawksby up some" steps, through two glass doors and behind another door into a room, I looked through the aperture and saw Mrs. Jackson taking some lead from Hawksby, it was this large piece, she was stooping down apparently putting it on the weighing machine, it appeared to be put down by the side of the machine, Davis came in directly behind me and asked Hawksby where was the lead that he had brought—I referred to the machine, and said "It is down there," Davis stooped down and picked it up—Hawksby said he knew nothing at all about that lead—Mrs. Jackson was then questioned by Davis about the lead that was brought in the morning—there was a cupboard padlocked, Davis asked her what was in that cupboard, she said "Nothing"—after some little time the cupboard was opened, it contained a large quantity of lead wrapped up similar to this—Mrs. Jackson was told she would be charged with receiving this lead well knowing it was stolen—she said "Don't take me"—after some hesita<lb/>tion she was allowed to go upstairs to fetch her bonnet—I followed her up stairs—she there said "For God's sake don't take me, for the sake of my children"—I said, "You should have thought of that before"—she said "I did not know I was doing any thing wrong, I thought it was only a bit of cutting"—I said "You might be sure it was wrong for men to bring such things in their trousers"—she said nothing to that—we then took her and Hawksby to the station—I saw these belts, found one on each of the prisoners.</p>

On</hi> Wednesday, 26th July, about 8 o'clock p.m., in consequence of information I went to the footpath by the New River, near Enfield—I met the constable with the child in his arms, dead—I afterwards met the prisoner and took her to the station; I recognised her and called her by her name Emma; I knew her before—her husband is a coffee-house keeper, and a house decorator as well, living in Little Torrington Street, Torrington Square—she said "Is that you "Ser<lb/>geant Gould"—I said "Yes"—she said "Is the child dead, because I would sooner hear it was dead than alive"—I told her it was dead—she said "Thank God for it, I am happy now"—she produced a card with her address on it, and a letter addressed to her mother living at Southgate, which she opened and handed it to me—this is it. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Little Torrington Street, July 16. My very dear parents do not consider me entirely an undutiful child; although I know you feel that I have been very distant the last few months towards you, but I felt it was for the best to write to you, it may possible be for the last time, I have been several times accused of not keeping my honour before and since marriage, and that has caused an unhappy life, and rather than that it is better to end it by dying; give my best love to all my brothers and sisters, and accept the same from your ever affectionate daughter, E. J. Couchman. For God's sake please never blame my dear husband, but only blame me." I read the charge over to her and she said "It is too true"—the charge was attempting to commit suicide by throwing herself in the New River, also drowning her child, Ellen, in the same river—she afterwards said "I have never been right since the birth of the child."</p>

I live at 24, Ashley Place—I have been an officer in the Army—on Thursday morning, 22nd June, about 2 o'clock, I was walking down Grosvenor Place—I had proceeded as far as the Co<lb/>operative Stores, a man had been walking near me all down the street—I turned into a place to make water, when the man came up and accosted me—he continued to follow me—I got as far as Rochester Buildings when the prisoner came up from the same direction—I had come down an alley—it was a small alley where I had turned down—there was a gate there, and the first man said "If you will come inside this gate and give us all the money you have got, you can go"—he opened the gate with a key—I gave them the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that I had, and then they demanded a set of shirt links that I had, which I gave them—they then asked if I had any. more money or anything in my pockets, and I gave them a knife and a key and two or three cards, which was all I had—the prisoner kept on asking for money and threatened to call the police—he did not say what for; he said "If you don't give me the money I will call the police"—this went on for some time until the door was opened from without by a boy—I seized the oppor<lb/>tunity and struck the prisoner as hard as I could in the eye with my fist and ran out—the prisoner followed me some way down the alley, and I said to him "If you will come in the morning to Victoria Station I will give</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. About a fortnight before 8th July, the prisoner brought a child to me, it was emaciated and suffering from a skin eruption—I did not give her anything, but I told her what to do for it and told her to get a parish order for medical attendance—I am the medical officer for that district, she did not do so—I did not see the child again till four or fire days before its death; she brought it to me, it was in a very emaciated condition, more so than before—she afterwards came and told. me it was dead, and I gave her a certificate of death from inanition, but from what I heard afterwards I withdrew the certificate and informed the police and the coroner—I afterwards made a post-mortem examination; it died of starvation.</p>

On this night I was in company with Shrives and went to the scene of the disturbance in Poland Street—I went up to the crowd and saw Cross, the constable, holding the man Murphy in his right hand, and he had hold of the female Murphy with his left hand—as soon as Cross saw me he says "Take that man, that man did this" meaning the man he was holding with his right band, "he struck me on the head with the brick"—I then immediately took hold of him—I also took hold of the woman Murphy—after we got a little way up the street Cross fell back, and there was a person there that caught him or he would have fallen down in a fainting state—the female Murphy called out "Cave, come here, I want yon, come to me"—I had hold of her at the time, but I was not close enough—she knew me—I then called Shrives, who was with me, and asked him to go to her, but what she said to him I don't know, my attention was taken up with Murphy—then we went on towards the station—Cross was taken to the station, and subsequently to the hospital—he would have fallen again in Marlborough Street had not he been caught again by a person walking by the side of him—on the way to the station Murphy said "That policeman (Cross) is drunk"—he was shouting all the way to the station that policemen were d-d thieves and liars—I saw Maghan outside the station—he was drunk—at the station Cross kept on fainting off now and then—we could not get anything from him straight off, only a piece at a time—I fetched the doctor.</p>

Cross could give some explanation at the time, but only a piece at a time—I was not there the whole time—I was sent out for the doctor and for a cab to take him in—I didn't hear what he told the sergeant—all he said was that it was Murphy, that it was him that did it—that was at the station and also in the street when I went up—he did not use Murphy's name in the street—he was holding Murphy in his right hand when I got up—Miller was there, standing close by helping to support Cross—he might have heard what Cross said, but there was confusion, and he might not have heard all that took place—I should think Mary Murphy was sober.</p>

I was in Poland Street about 1 o'clock on the morning of this occurrence with the last witness—when I went up I found Cross being held up, and he had Murphy in one hand and Mrs. Murphy in the other—I believe a constable and Cave were holding him up—Miller was one—in consequence of something that was said I went to the woman and took her into custody—I was asked to go and speak to her—she said "For God's sake take me from this man"—I took her from him, and another constable arrived and I handed her over—I am not sure that I heard Cross say anything then—when I arrived Murphy was being</p>

               <p>held by Cross—I believe he said "Take that man; that is the man that done it," and some woman in the crowd called out "Yes, for God's sake take him"—I don't know who the woman was—I endeavoured to find her—they were then taken on to the station—in consequence of what Wallis said to me I took Maghan—he was following up the crowd, and when he arrived at Marlborough Mews I took him into custody—I told him he was charged with assaulting a constable—he said he didn't know anything about it—he struggled very violently—with assistance I got him to the station—at the station steps he caught hold of the railings and said he had not done anything, and he would not go—his wife came up to stop me from taking him—I pulled her out of the way, and some other constable arrived and we got him into the station—Murphy was very violent at the station, more like a madman—he was drunk—they were taken in before the acting inspector and put in the dock—he asked whose charge it was, and Cross said it was his, and he was asked to state what it was—he was in a very fainting condition—he was perfectly sensible at the time and conscious, but very faint—he stated that Mrs. Murphy was creating a disturbance in Cambridge Street, the corner of Silver Street, and he endeavoured to get her away, and finding she would not go he took her into custody; that a crowd followed him on the way to the station, and in Poland Street he was hit on the head by a brick by Murphy—the acting inspector asked him how he knew it, was Murphy, and he said "He was sideways to me and I could see him perfectly well"—he said he was kicked on the ground by some other person—he then became unconscious shortly after and had to be conveyed away to the hospital—when he gave his evidence he was quite clear, but faint.</p>

I am a porter and live at 5, Cross Street, Golden Square—on Sunday morning, 16th January, I was in Poland Street, Oxford Street, where I saw Cross, and I saw a brick thrown at him from the other side of Poland Street, by a young chap of the came of Barrett—when the brick was thrown Murphy was just behind Cross, close to him—Murphy was then thrown down and knelt on—the policeman got him like this and threw him down like that (<hi rend="italic">describing</hi>)—I did not see whether he did it with anything—I did not know the policeman's name—that is the man (<hi rend="italic">pointing to Cross</hi>)—I went to the police-station and led the constable there with Beattie—I am sure that Murphy did not throw the brick—I did not see him assault the constable in any way—he only got hold of him; tried to get him round the waist—the constable had hold of Mrs. Murphy—I am perfectly sure the stone came from Barrett—I have seen him close there—I have not seen him lately—I gave evidence at the police-court—Barrett is about as big as me; not quite so big as the last witness; a young man—I don't know whether he is an American, or Scotchman, or Irishman—I know him well by sight—I do not know his friends.</p>

I am a cordwainer, and live at 9, Bentley Terrace, Kingsland—on Monday, the 12th June I was at the Star and Garter public-house, at the corner of Ball's Pond Road, two or three miles from Lea Bridge—I saw the prisoners Williams, Lloyd, and Kingsland there—I had no conversation with them—I had known all the prisoners before to speak to—to the best of my knowledge I left them all three there—on my return</p>

               <p>home I saw the prisoner Williams again coming away from my house—my wife called my attention to him—she said "Father, that man has got our cat"—I did not see him take it—I said "Do you hear, what are you going to do with that cat?"—he made answer "All right, you see us at the Star," and with that he walked on—this was not five minutes after I had seen them at the Star—I recovered the cat the next morning by attending at Worship Street, where I claimed it.</p>

I live at 27a, Cavendish Street, New North Road, and am a glass lapidary—between 4 and 5 o'clock on the 12th June I was outside the Jolly Anglers by the river Lea—the Middlesex side—a short distance above Lea Bridge I saw four men pass me while I was sitting there—they were going up towards Tottenham—three of them were the present prisoners—one of the four said to some boatmen "Come and see a game that you never saw before"—Kingsland had a bag across his shoulder similar to this produced—neither of them spoke to me—one of them had something under his coat as if hidden—I did not see what it was then—I saw the deceased and another man (Turner) on the other side of the river—I had not known the deceased before—I saw four on my side of the river because there was one that is not here now—Turner asked the boatmen on my side of the river which way the others had gone, and they directed him "higher up, round the corner"—the river takes a bend there—I then fol<lb/>lowed Lloyd, Williams, and Kingsland—they went as far as the boat-house when I saw the man with the bag put it down on the ground and take out some rope in pieces and tie it, and one of the men with him hired a boat of Topley and took the boat across the river—Topley took Williams across to the Essex side—Williams had one end of the rope and he was landed and Topley turned back—I saw Turner on the Essex side when Williams landed and the deceased—Williams tied the rope round the deceased's waist—Kings<lb/>land, the man with the rope on my side, the Middlesex side, gave the signal by holding up a very small cat, quite a kitten—nothing was said on the Essex side—the man was shoved backwards into the water by Williams, and he scrambled back on to the bank again, and he was pushed in again by the same man-Lloyd and Kingsland pulled the rope three—fifths across the river, when it broke—the deceased was on his back with his head under the water—he sank and never came to the surface again—Lloyd and Kingsland walked away directly—Turner went away—in half an hour and ten minutes a man recovered the body with a boat-hook—there were several boats put out—while the rope was being tied in joints one of the prisoners said "He will be drowned," and the other made a foul expression and said "A good job too; his old woman won't miss</p>

I am the wife of William Jones, of 34, Clarendon Street, Harrow Road, we occupy the parlour—the prisoner and the deceased, Mary Ann Ebelthrift, occupied the two kitchens under us—I knew nothing of her before she came to the house, or whether she had been a widow, but she had a little girl between eleven and twelve, whose name was Hancock, and two sons, who are older—I was at home on Saturday evening, 24th June, when the prisoner and his wife came home between 7 and 8 o'clock—I saw them come home; they were both the worse for drink—a Mrs. Juskin and, her two children were with her—they went into the kitchen together—they seemed very happy together—that state of things lasted for a few minutes, and I saw the prisoner go out shortly afterwards—he came back and Mrs. Juskin went out afterwards—I walked with her; she went to the Closet, and I saw the prisoner go out after her without his shoes or coat, or anything—I saw him open the closet door and try to get in, and Mrs. Juskin who was inside at the time called "Annie, Annie"—that was to the little girl—the little girl came to the yard door, and Mrs. Juskin came out and came into the passage and went out—the prisoner then went into the closet—the deceased was then in the front kitchen—she could not see the closet from there—she did not come upstairs at all—I did not see him come out of the closet, but I heard him—he was there for a minute or two, and when he came out he went straight into the kitchen to his wife abusing her and calling her a b——something, and a b——whore—he said that he would do for her, and would cut her b——c——out that night; describ<lb/>ing a part of her person—I did not see him—he was swearing very dread<lb/>fully and accusing her—that kind of language went on for about ten minutes—Mrs. Juskin had then gone—I was afterwards in my room at the top of the stairs and heard the deceased cry "Oh," I then heard a scuffle and a scream from the woman—I felt very frightened and put on my bonnet and went round to the landlord who lives at 46, Amberley Road—he did not come back with me, but he came directly afterwards—when I got back it was all quiet—it was then 9.5 or 9.10—the landlord came in directly afterwards and went to the back kitchen and tried the door—he went down with a notice to the prisoner and told him to leave on the following Saturday—he then spoke in the kitchen far a minute or so and went away—after he had gone I heard the prisoner trying to get into the back-room; he had the handle in his hand and was pushing with his knee—I</p>

               <p>could not make out what he said, but he was speaking all the time in a low swearing way—that was about 9.30—he did not get in at the door, he went out—I then went out marketing with my husband, it being quiet below—it was a usual thing for the deceased to shut herself in when she had had words with him—when we came home it was quiet down below—we were having our supper about 10.30, and the girl Annie came in at the street door crying—she did not come into our room, she stood at the top of the stairs, and I asked her what was the matter—I saw her go down, her mother opened the door and I went into the room and found the deceased standing with a candle in her hand holding the door open for me to go in—she spoke to me—I did not look at her clothes or her condition—there were some spots of blood about, and she had a dark dress on which was wet—this was about 10.30—the little girl was in the room, but she came out with me and the deceased locked herself in again—the prisoner came back within a few minutes and tried the door—he seemed only just to try it by the handle, he did not succeed in getting in and he went out—I then went down and fastened the door into the area so as to bar him out—I then knocked at the door and received an answer from the deceased, but she did not open the door nor did she afterwards do so—that was the second time I went, as she called out—I then went upstairs thinking she would follow me up, but she did not, and I ran down again and knocked, but could get no answer, and the door was still fastened; I turned the handle and pushed hard, but got no answer; I heard a slight movement in the room—I next went to the back window which looks into their room and tried to get an answer—there was no light in the room and the blind was down—I rushed upstairs and spoke to my husband—her two sons then came in, one of whom is sixteen, and the other fourteen—they rushed down and called "Mother, mother," and <hi rend="italic">ray</hi> husband too—they attempted to get into the room by the window, but failed; my husband then broke the window and unbolted it and threw the window up, and she was lying with her head on the bed and her hands on an arm chair—her sons tried to arouse her first by calling "Mother," and catching hold of her, and with that she made as if she would rise and fell backwards on the floor—I was there when the surgeon came, but I came out—when the constable came there was a light, he came almost directly; he was at the street door—when he came in and we had the light I observed that the floor was very much splashed about with blood—the poor woman was dead but warm when the constable came—I could not see whether she had any severe injuries, but her clothes were very wet—I was very much alarmed—I have told you all I know about the matter.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FRITH</hi>. I have not said before to-day that he threatened to cut her person out or anything of the kind—it is not the fact that I was so alarmed and agitated that I am not certain what was said—I will swear exactly what he said in spite of my alarm and agitation—the lan<lb/>guage was so dreadful that I did not like to repeat it when the circumstance was fresh in my recollection before the Magistrate—I was in a dreadful state of excitement, alarm, and agitation—I have talked the matter over with my husband since—he was not there when those words were used—the deceased woman drank a good deal—when she was drunk she was not very violent unless she was very much upset—she quarrelled with her husband very frequently and I have heard her use threatening language to him—I did not hear her say she wished she had thrown a flower pot at his head; it was I</p>

               <p>who said that when I looked out of the window and saw him in the yard—I said that I had a great mind to throw a flower pot at his head—I have never beard her use threatening language—I have never seen her throw knives at him, or pieces of crockery—I have heard the crockery flying about, but don't know who did it—I have seen pieces of broken crockery about the room several times—the prisoner could not see woman go into the closet—after he went to the door and tried it the woman came out and he went into the closet himself—it was after I heard the row that was going on that he said he tried to go into the closet to the woman—she appeared to be very indignant and very jealous at that—it was immediately after the row that that was said, about 10.30—they appeared in good humour when they came home, but they had been on bad terms all the week—I have heard her say that she should either do for him or he for her—she was rather quorrelsome, I don't know about violent, I should not describe her as that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The deceased would go out washing when she had the work to do—she was not of a very violent nature, but when she got drunk she was quarrelsome—the prisoner was very quarrelsome when he was drunk—she was very stout and rather tall—nothing took place until after the woman went to the water-closet—it was then the language I have spoken of began—I was very much alarmed and agitated and went out—I have not the slightest doubt about the words being uttered which I have told you.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 34, Clarendon Street, Harrow Road, and occupy the parlour—I am a warehouseman—on Saturday night, 24th June, I went home about 9 o'clock, as near as I can tell—I went out soon after—I did not see anything of the prisoner, but I heard him from the top of the kitchen stairs about 11 o'clock, as near as I can tell—I heard him kicking at the back kitchen door, which was locked, and making use of most—beastly ex<lb/>pressions—he said "You b——old wh——, you b——rotten old cow, I will do for you to-night"—he did not get into the room—he left the house when he found he could not get into the room—some time afterwards" I went downstairs—my wife went downstairs first with the little girl, Annie—I tried to break open the door as I was certain something was wrong—every<lb/>thing was quiet—I went upstairs again and took the first thing I could get hold of to break the back kitchen window—I broke the bottom square in the bottom sash and unbolted the window and rose the bottom sash up—I pulled the blind on one side, and as I did so the woman fell on her back with her head slightly underneath the foot of the bedstead—she was rather on her right side—when I opened the window she appeared to me to have one hand on an old arm-chair and the other on the bedstead—I ran upstairs and met a police-constable at the door who got in at the window first and me afterwards in the presence of her two sons—the constable had his lantern and went up to the woman—she was quite dead. but very limp—we raised her and put a pillow under her head—her eyes were closed—she was quite warm—I found I was up to. my soles in a pool of blood—I had not got very thick soles on, but it touched the upper leather—she was dressed in all her clothes, including shoes and stockings—the constable opened the door and I left the room to fetch a doctor—the doctor ripped the skirt off her, and I saw then that the under skirt was saturated with blood, and I then left the room, as I did not think it was my duty to stop there—I left the doctor and the constable there—I was never in the closet with the deceased—I never spoke a dozen words to her in my life.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 25, Johnson's Place, Paddington—on the night of 24th June I was sent for to 34, Clarendon Street, where I arrived at 12.10—I found the woman lying in the back kitchen on the floor—her head was then on a pillow; she was quite dead—her body was warm—I formed the opinion at the time that she had been dead thirty or forty-five minutes—she was lying with her lower parts in a pool of blood—her clothes and underclothing were saturated with blood—I examined her to see what was the matter—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I found a wound on the right side of the private part 2 1/2 inches in length, which could be inflicted by some moderately sharp instrument—a knife like the one produced would be likely to produce the wound—it was about a quarter of an inch deep in one part, and in one part about half an inch—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187608080039"/>
               <p>it was just on the side of the <hi rend="italic">labia</hi>—I also found an incised wound about 1 1/4 or 1 1/2 inches in length, and not quite so deep, on the left of the <hi rend="italic">labia</hi>—it had been cut by a moderately sharp instrument—this knife would pro<lb/>duce it—it was about as near to the private part as the other—I found another cut on the right side of the <hi rend="italic">anus;</hi> that is the back passage—that was a wound 2 inches deep, rending very nearly the front passage into the back passage; from the <hi rend="italic">rectum</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">vagina</hi>—the <hi rend="italic">peritoneum</hi> was cut; that would be against the <hi rend="italic">anus</hi>—it was like the operation for lithotomy—it was a cut that might be produced by this knife—the cuts, whether the person was lying or standing, were from below upwards—there was a very large quantity of blood from the wounds—the clothes were not cut—she had no drawers on then—she was wearing her clothes, ordinary petticoats and a lindsey dress I think they call it—I should say she was about forty or fifty—there was a large bruise on the inner part of the right thigh, high up, of recent date, as big as my fist, caused by a violent blow; a kick perhaps—there was a slight abrasion on the brow, which I thought was caused by her sliding off the bedstead on to the floor—I made the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> exam<lb/>ination on the Monday—I found the breast-bone fractured; that could have been done by the knee—the cause of death was hoemorrhage in cones<lb/>sequence of the wounds inflicted and fracture of the breast-bone or steruum—that would help to produce death by causing a pressure on the lung and the large vessel that leads from the heart—the knife produced was shown to me on the Monday—I examined it and found a portion of hair which had been broken off in the top of the haft, I think they call it the hinge, and there were a few broken portions of hair in addition to the portion I have already spoken of—it was; human hair, not from the head, but from some part of the body—I was also shown a shirt and a pair of trousers—I examined the shirt and found the right wrist band stained with blood—I examined the trousers and found marks'of blood down the front part of the legs—they were handed to me by the inspector.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was impossible for the lacerated wounds to be caused by broken china—a lacerated wound is net exactly jagged, but it is not such a clean cut as would be made by a very sharp instrument—it was as if the instrument had been moderately sharpened—there are other instruments besides this knife that might have caused such wounds—such a wound would not be caused by the body coming into contact with such an instrument as I have described, I am sure—I have told your learned friend that the cuts were from below upwards—if the body had come against a rather blunt instrument, the edges of the wound would be turned inwards, but the wounds inflicted by drawing an instrument would be very different—I have been called upon to judge of hair for years with the microscope—it is human hair—I did not examine the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Magistrate for the County of Sussex and live at B Park—I took an active part in the Tichborne case, in favour of the defendant, and gave my evidence at both trials—I am president of the Central Belief Association—Mr. Harding is secretary—in May of the present year it came to my knowledge that an application was likely to be made for the prosecution of Lady Radcliffe for perjury—upon that I wrote letters to Mr. Kinder, Mr. East, and Mr. Guildford Onslow to protest against it—I was about to go out of town and I instructed Mr. Harding, the secretary, to attend the police-court, and if such an application should be made to remonstrate against it; and upon a second occasion I went personally in order to protest against it—the Magistrate would not hear me, saying that it was <hi rend="italic">sub judice</hi>, I could not speak—on the following day I sent to the daily papers this letter; it was inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Telegraph</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Morning Advertiser</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi>—in the letter I stigmatised the proceedings as a cruel persecution—in the daily papers of 2nd June I saw an account of the proceedings—in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Telegraph</hi> and other papers I was represented as appearing through Mr. Harding, and protesting against the proceedings—on the 7th June there was a report that a summons was to be granted—application had been dismissed, and I was represented as being amongst other gentle-men upon the bench—having taken those steps my attention was called shortly afterwards, on the 10th June, to this reply in the <hi rend="italic">Weekly Register.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "The wretched clique of conspirators, as cracked-brained as they are malicious, the congenial friends and supporters of the thrice-perjured villian, Orton, have been doing their little worst still further to persecute one of the most amiable of gentlewomen, one who is a model of every Christian virtue as a wife and mother, but happily," &amp;c. "The Magistrate before whom they made their unseemly exhibition, with badly-suppressed indignation, scouted their application, and they withdrew," &amp;c, &amp;c.) I am a member of the Tichborne family there alluded to—upon that I wrote a letter to the editor and sent to him also a copy of the letter which had been inserted in the morning papers, and extracts from the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> showing him that I was amongst those who opposed the application—those letters and extracts were never inserted—on the 17th a paragraph appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Weekly Register.</hi> ("'Tell me what company you keep and I will tell you what you are is a saying as old as the hills, and Mr. Biddulph would do well to remember it. That gentleman writes complaining," &amp;c, &amp;c.)

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mrs. Foy was not at all angry on this morning, no more so than Mr. Cole; she did not abuse him or use bad language, she was speaking quietly, like a decent, respectable woman—when Cole was down I saw her raise her foot and stamp, I did not see her kick him—we have talked this matter over since—she told me that she stamped her foot and called him a brute—I said before the Magistrate that I saw her make a kick—I did not go to sign my deposition, as my husband had given me a black eye, and I could not go—no one but Mrs. Foy helped Foy up—lam sure of that—Mr. Shellard helped Cole up.</p>

I live at 1, Glasshouse Street, and the prisoner lived in the same house, the bottom room and the middle room—she is a widow—on the 12th July, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I was passing by her door, where she was standing, and she said "Joe, you stand me a pot of beer"—there were two other women there, one sitting down and the other on the bed asleep—I said "I can't afford it," and she said, as I was going upstairs, "You old b——r," and she knocks me down and knocked me silly—she had a glass in her hand—I ran to get a policeman and gave her</p>

I am a lamplighter of Lower Sloane Street—on Sunday morning, 25th June, I left my house at 1.15 to put the lights out—I went into Lower George Street to call my brother, who is also a lamplighter—on my way I saw a disturbance by the George public-house—there were about five or six people there; they were very noisy—I saw Goodgame there; he asked them in a polite way to go away, they would not—then the fireman came up; the constable was pushing the people away—the fireman said "You shan't take them into custody while I am here;" with that the constable tried to get away from him to take one Of them, and the fireman pushed him down—I saw Ryan there and saw him strike the constable with his fist on the neck, rather forcibly—this happened opposite the George Inn, not at Union place—I never knew Ryan before, I am quite sure he is the man who struck the policeman on the side of the head with his fist—several others kicked at him—I saw no more blows or kicks there—the only blow was one which Ryan gave him near the George—the con<lb/>stable got up again; the policeman was not down when struck—it was before he fell that Ryan struck him—he did not fall from that blow, he fell by the fireman pushing him before that—he got up again and then he was struck—they all ran away but Boydell, who did not move—the constable got up and ran after the others, I followed behind—they ran down Union Place; about 150 yards off; I came up to them—when they got together again, about four of them, attacked the policeman and threw him down and kicked him—I saw Ryan there; the other three ran away and Ryan with them—in Union Place the whole of them kicked him, about four of them—I</p>

I am a physician living in St. George's Square, Pimlico—between 5 and 6 o'clock on Sunday morning, 25th June, I was called to Goodgame's house, and I found him bleeding from three contused wounds in the head, two in the forehead, about 2 inches long, and one on the top—I did not consider them at that time to be dangerous; he was covered with bruises nearly all over his body—the right side of his neck and jaw, his ear, his arm, and his right knee were bruised—his helmet and clothes were covered with blood—the injuries were such as might have been produced by kicks—I examined a boot taken from one of the prisoners, and the heavy nails on the toe corresponded with the wound upon the policeman's forehead—on the left ear there was a bruise which might have been caused by the blow of a fiat, and another on the right side of the neck which might have been caused by a kick or a blow—I saw him again two or three times a day; erysipelas set in about the second day; he was then in a very dangerous condition, and congestion of the brain came on, and he was in a most comatose state for some time, and delirious, and then he had congestion of the lungs, and continued in a very serious state, and he is—still under treatment, and will be for five or six months—he is not fit for duty, nor likely to be for a considerable time—I think he is out of danger—a Magistrate attended when he was in that serious state to take his deposition, and I considered it necessary to have another opinion—Ryan was before the Magistrate, but not Boydell—the examination was taken at the constable's house.</p>

He complained that his identification was unfair, as he was put between five or six tradesmen, respectably dressed, he being the only roughly dressed man amongst them.</hi>

I am one of the directors of the company—I know the defendant—I was present at the board meet<lb/>ing on 16th March, when Mr. Anstruther attended—Mr. Williamson was also present—it is not true that in my presence William Williamson in<lb/>formed Mr. Anstruther that the British Guardian Life Assurance Company, Limited, was in a flourishing condition—it is not true that he informed him that the company was perfectly solvent—he did not tell him that the sum of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Consols were invested in the names of Thomas Nicholas and Whitehorn Lawrence as trustees of the said company—Mr. Williamson explained to Mr. Anstruther that the money was wanted for the use of the company—the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was a sum which he was to deposit before he could be made secretary—he was advised by Mr. Williamson not to purchase shares in the company, for fear the company should not be satisfied with his services as secretary, but to deposit it at three months' notice, for fear he should not be pleased with the company—I cannot remember exactly, but the general import of the conversation between Mr. Williamson and him, was that the books were open for inspection, and he could make himself conversant with them—he said that he was perfectly satisfied—he had other information about the state of the company—a short time afterwards the company went into liquidation—I received before that a summons to attend at Bow Street police-court—I attended, and it was adjourned to to the following week—I attended the adjournment with my solicitor—the summons fell through—I had nothing to do with paying money to Mr. Anstruther, or in any way stopping those proceedings—subsequently, on seeing the information Mr. Anstruther had sworn, I applied for &amp; summons for perjury against him—it was granted by the same Magistrate.</p>

               <p>implication, and I believed it myself—this prospectus (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the books of the company—it was true that" 50 per cent of the premiums paid upon whole life policies is invested in the names of trustess in the British Government Securities, for which purpose there is a quarterly audit of the income account, and when the board hand to the trustees one half of the Life Assurance premium the amount is remitted to the brokers who invest the money sending to the trustees the Bank of England certificate; that the account is kept in a ledger especially designed for this system, and is so arranged that any policy holder can at a glance see his position in the company."—I swear to the best of my belief that 50 per cent was invested in Government Securities at that time—I do not think anything was invested there at that time; I was told so, but I do not know—I, believe we had out about 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we referred him to the books—the money was ready to go into Consols—it was in the managers and traveling director's hands; I suppose—it was through them I got my information—I cannot tell whether the money has gone in—the company is in liquid<lb/>dation; undoubtedly we had at that time as much as 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I lent them 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. three weeks before—I do not know what became of it; that was not as far as I know the whole capital of the company—I know there was more than 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be called up—I cannot tell how much available money there was to hand at twenty-four hours' notice—supposing a life had fallen in we should have had three months' time in which to get the money to pay it—I cannot tell how much we had; I had lent them 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that is all I know of their capital—we had three winding up petitions at that time to the best of mo knowledge—I was not in the country, so I cannot tell how many—the London and County were our bankers; I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> not know what balance we had at the time—I should think the reserve was more than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have no means of knowing; I should think 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am not aware that this table conveys a deliberate lie—I did not understand it to convey a deliberate falsehood—I believe there would have been a reserve fund if the company had gone on—the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid away for debts—I was not in the country and do not know what was done with it—I made no inquiry at the time the secretary was advertised for—I do not know a gentleman named Hyman in our establishment; I never heard the name before; in connection, with the office—I do not know that he was employed there as a clerk at 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I did not know at the time the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in that there was a sheriff's officer in possession of all our goods—I believe it now—I never heard that he was there for no less than ten creditors—I never heard of him before by name; I know that the sheriffs officer was there, but I never heard of Hyman—I lent money myself to the company—the company was certainly not insolvent with 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to fall back upon—I have no knowledge of Mr. Anstruther wanting discount on the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have never heard that he was given a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe he had a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. given him by the company which was dishonoured—I know it to be a fact.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I am a director of the com<lb/>pany—I was present at the board meeting on 16th March when Mr. An<lb/>struther attended—it is not true that I told him the company was solvent—I did not allude to it—it is not true that there was 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. invested in consols in the name of the trustees—I never told him so—as far as I recollect what passed was this, I said "Don't take shares in the company, but leave your money on deposit that you can get it back again if you wish to leave, or if we quarrel"—his reply was that he had seen the editor of the "World," who had been writing a severe article against us, and he said "I probably know more about the state of the company than you yourself"—I never at that or any other meeting told him that any sum was invested in Consols—to the best of my knowledge there was not anything said about what the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for—I was subsequently served with a summons to attend at Bow Street police-court—this is my handwriting (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that personal guarantee was prepared by his solicitor, brought to us, and signed by us—it makes us personally liable to return the money if the company fail to do it—I appeared at Bow Street and the matter was adjourn<lb/>ed—we repaid the defendant the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash and bills—I was aware that Mr. Stacpoole attended at the adjournment; I was there—we had no communication with him at all about the money—we were legally bound if we did not pay the money; that is the reason we returned it—it was no use fighting for a thing we were bound to pay—I have money in the company myself—with monies that we have paid, and are bound to pay, subject to be recouped by the company, I believe something like 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the company is in liquidation—the amount of new capital to be called up, to the best of my belief, is something like 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the debts do not exceed 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to the best of my belief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I recommended him not to take shares in the company, but to pay the money on deposit; the reason for that advice was that he might get it back again if he wished—I know we have not very much at the bankers; I could not pretend to say how much—I cannot say if I gave the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque; I did not give any cheque at all—as a director I might have signed a cheque and my signature would appear to it; I have no knowledge of it—the question of the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque and the payment of the deposit were different—money was coming in daily and hourly—I know that Mr. Anstru<lb/>ther said that a cheque was dishonoured; I know no reason to doubt his statement; I did not doubt it; I do not doubt it now—I was served with a summons—I never saw the information at all, because the summons was not served upon me, it was left at the office and never delivered to me; I never saw it, I was told of it—the other directors had seen the information—I was told what I had been charged with—I had got to pay the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I was legally and morally responsible—there is only one bill due and that became due the day before yesterday; I do not know where it was payable, I had no opportunities of making inquiries—notice was lying at my cham<lb/>bers and for two and a half days I have been dancing attendance here wait<lb/>ing to be called upon—I shall pay my own portion; I have paid a great deal for other things—I agreed with' Mr. Walker that he should advance my share; it was not convenient for me to pay it—Mr. Walker is one of the trustees—I do not want to borrow any more—I did not pay anything out of my own pocket—I was only bound for a rateable portion—I borrowed my</p>

               <p>parties and asked them at Mr. Oakley's request whether they would be prepared to discount the bills—I saw Mr. Oakley again and told him what the various parties had said when the bills were handed to them—I think the parties communicated with Mr. Oakley; I had no more to do with them—one of them was named Callisher; he was mentioned to me by the defendant; he lived in Sackville Street, Piccadilly, and carried on the business of a money lender—Dr. Good sent for me in 1875 to 12, Queen Victoria Street, and asked me in Mr. Oakley's presence if I had any objection to become the accountant of the Co-operative Bank—I said that I should have no objection to do so, and he said that I must be very particular in all matters connected with the bank—I was then and there appointed to the office of accountant—my salary for the first three months was at the rate of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, or 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum; I was only to give a small portion of my time—my salary was afterwards raised to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and later to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and about four months before the bank stopped it was raised to 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—offices were allotted to me at the bank, and I engaged clerks who were employed there, and paid by me with money which I drew from the bank to pay them—the defendant also employed separate clerks to carry on the banking business—current accounts were opened and some deposits and acceptances were received.—I did not take part in any bill discounting business; the different clerks kept books of the business done,. and I made up my books partly from their books and partly from the vouchers—tellers, or cashiers' books, were also made up by the bank clerks—my books were made up from the paying in slips and the cheques—it was the practice for my books to be compared with the teller's books at the end of each day—the accountant's and the cash department were kept quite distinct—the defendant occupied a room on the same floor as my office, the ground floor—the name outside was "The Co-operative Credit Bank"—the defendant was also proprietor and editor of a journal called "The Co-operative and Financial Review," the expenses connected with which passed through my hands, and I had a separate clerk told off to keep the accounts relating to it—the issues of that paper were circulated throughout the country—a staff of young women clerks was also kept for the purpose of folding the numbers of the "Review," and for issuing the prospectuses of the 'bank and the balance-sheets—I occasionally saw the articles in the "Review," and had conversations with the defendant relative to some of them—he never told me that any of them were his own composition—I prepared this balance-sheet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in March, 1875, partly from the books and partly from the vouchers, and partly from information received from the defendant—I submitted the manuscript to him before it was pub<lb/>lished—it was published with hissanction and approval—I see here the amount, by commission, from the Imperial Life Association, Limited, is 6,750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which is placed here as a realisable asset—I placed it so by Mr. Oakley's directions, he said that he was entitled to that amount from the Imperial Life Association as a commission—I made no further enquiries about it, I took his word for it—I did not learn from him at that time that it was a disputed amount—I got this other item, "Commission 861<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," from Mr. Oakley; I believe it was made up of three entries, but I have not the par<lb/>ticulars here—I have a draft here made out at the time I was making out the balance sheet—800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for the patent safety lamp assignment; I know nothing about that, and there are two others—those amounts were given to me by Mr. Oakley, who said that they were amounts due to</p>

               <p>the bank—I did not ask him any questions on the subject; he gave me the particulars which I put into the balance-sheet—I said "Can those amounts be realised in case <hi rend="italic">of</hi> emergency? are they available securities?"—he said that they were—deducting the figures 6,750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the account, a loss would be shown instead of a profit—the balance-sheet with this foot note was circulated among the subscribers by Mr. Oakley's directions. (<hi rend="italic">The foot note stated:</hi> "The amount of the profit must depend upon the realization of the claim of the bank from the British Life Association, Limited.") I also prepared this balance-sheet for the quarter ending June, 1875—I see on the side of assets "Securities 8,611<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" those securities consisted of the Keokuk and Kansas Railway 7,750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the Patent Safety Lamp as<lb/>signment deed as before 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Alfred George commission 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Tennant 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the Keokuk and" Kansas 7,750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. does not, I believe, appear in the books; they were to be inserted on my return from my journey—I obtained the particulars from Mr. Oakley—I asked him whether the Keokuk and Kansas securities were available, and he said they were; he said, to the best of my recollection, that they were given him for the purpose of pro<lb/>moting the Keokuk and Kansas Railway—I made no inquiry at the office of the railway—the defendant said that he had advanced money from time to time for the purpose of advertising, printing, and so on—I also brought forward again as a separate item, by the defendant's direction, the 6,750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as due from the British Imperial Life Insurance Company, Limited—that balance-sheet was submited to the defendant before publication and approved by him—in treating those assets as realisable, I make the profit and loss account for that quarter, inclusive of the previous balance of March 31, a profit of 10,821<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—if I had struck them out from the aasets there would have been a loss shown of 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,; that balance-sheet was printed and circulated by the defendant's direction—no reference is made to the suspense account in that balance-sheet—it is customary for auditors to have the value of shares certified by stockbrokers, but I did not do so in auditing and issuing these balance-sheets; I took Mr. Oakley's word for it—I had every confidence in him, and believed that what he stated was true—I also prepared this balance-sheet for the quarter ending September 30, 1875, under Mr. Oakley's direction; it was submitted to and approved by him, and I obtained from him this figure "Securities 21,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." among the assets, with the items of which it is made up: there are the Gilbert and Chaudiere preferential shares 2,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Gilbert and Chaudiere ordinary shares 7,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Warrington Bottling Company 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Oxford Building Society 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Credit Fongier 5 Debentures, 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Australian Tin Mines 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Woollen Trade Association 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Keokuk and Kansas Railway 8,550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a foreign bill for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making 21,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I got these particulars and and values from the defendant—I observed that the item for the Keokuk and Kansas Railway, which at the time of the previous balance-sheet was 7,750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was taken at 8,550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I believe the defendant told me that the value of the shares had increased, but I cannot possibly say—he told me that the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due from the Warrington Bottling Company was the money paid to the company for shares in that company—I cannot tell whether the amount has since been paid—I have no further information what the 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the Oxford Building Society was for, but I believe it alluded to shares in the society—the defendant showed me the five Credit Fongier debentures, and said that the value of them was them 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know how they came into his possession—those securities making up the 21,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>do not all appear in the company's books; I stated before that my absence at various branches occupied several weeks, and I desired that they might be left till my return—the shares in the Oxford Building Society and the Credit Fongier were never in my possession, and I made no inquiries, except of the prisoner, of their value—I saw documents relating to the Australian tin bonds in Mr. Oakley's hands, but I do not know now what has become of them; I made no inquiry of their value except from Mr. Oakley—the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the Woollen Trade Association was, I believe, an advance, but I have not the means of saying whether it was for commission; I cannot say whether that claim was ever paid—I see a foreign bill for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I cannot say whether it was subsequently met—the item "Co operative and Financial Register "5850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. represents the expense of printing and carrying on the "Register"—this item, "Reserve fund 2,016<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." on the debtor side is represented by securities; I learned nothing from the defendant respecting them—those were handed to me for safe custody by Dr. Good in a sealed packet—the defendant said that the 2,016<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be carried forward to the reserve fund, and he should hand securities for that amount into the hands of the trustees, but he did not say what securities—I received them from Dr. Good a month or more after 'the balance-sheet <hi rend="italic">was</hi> issued—at the time the balance-sheet was being prepared the defendant told me he should portion off part of the Keokuk and Kansas bonds to represent that sum—the 2,016<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. consisted of profits in one shape or other; the gross profits for the quarter are put down at 8,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the 2,016<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is part of the gross profits which are put down at 10,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—in that balance-sheet the claim on the British Imperial Association is not. brought forward as an asset, but it was placed in the suspense account because the defendant said that in consequence of the dispute with the British Imperial we must take that amount out and put it with the suspense account—I had not heard of a dispute previous to the March and June account—assuming that the securities were struck out amounting to 21,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there would be a very large loss instead of a profit—this balance-sheet was issued and circulated in the same way as the previous ones, and the defendant again said that the securities could be realised on an emergency—it was part of my duty to go down to the country to audit the bank agencies; I had done it before September, 1875—there were, I think, just over sixty agencies established over the country—he also employed lecturers to go about the country lecturing about the bank—I did not go down to the country in December, 1875, to audit the agencies, on account of the finances, of the bank being so very low, and I proposed that we should take the weekly returns from the branches as granted, and audit them afterwards—there were not sufficient funds in the bank which could have been spared for the purpose of my going down—I called Mr. Oakley's attention to the state of the bank, cheques, promissory notes, and acceptances being dishonoured as early as Christmas, 1875, and also sent off money to the various agencies—I told the defendant about the beginning of January that he was not justified in receiving money from the public, that the bank was hopelessly insolvent, and he had better call his creditors together and make a statement—there was at that time an execution in the bank for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; a man was in possession; the defendant replied that there would be plenty of funds coming in and we should tide over the pressure—I asked him what the execution was for, he said that it was on account of an acceptance he had given for shares in the</p>

               <p>Gilbert Gold Fields Company; there were no funds in the bank to pay that, but he said that he had money coining in and everything wouly be quite right in a day or so—I told him he was not justified in receivnd any more money from the public, he would render himself criminally liable if he did so; he said "Oh, no such thing, we have plenty of money coming in, and we shall be all right again"—I said "We are using all possible dispatch in getting the balance-sheet out, but you had better call your depositors together and mention the state of the bank to them"—he said that the depositors would increase their subscriptions—on the day we had that conversation there was no money in the bank to pay the clerks their salaries, and I told Mr. Oakley so, he said "We shall be able, possibly, to pay their salaries in a day or two"—the execution remained in the bank till Tuesday. 18th January—on loth January I had a conversation with Mr. Snelgrove a depositor and one of the trustees, and again on the Thursday before the defendant was arrested—the defendant sent for me and, said that he had received a letter from Mr. Snelgrove's solicitor, and asked me why Mr. Snelgrove did not come to see him, I said that he declined to do so; he said "I hope you have not opened your mouth too wide"—I said that if the depositors asked me any questions relative to the state of the bank I was bound to reply to them—he said that it was no business of mine, my business was to attend to the books—I said "I shall certainly reply to them, I have always done so, and shall always do so as I am their accountant"—he then told me he would have none of my insolence—while we were conversing, his assistant, Mr. Kemp, who is now deceased, brought him a cheque for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Mr. Oakley said that it would be paid presently—Mr. Beddy was the secretary and head cashier—Mr. Oakley's private clerk, Mr. Spooner, succeeded Mr. Beddy—they were engaged by Mr. Oakley and under his orders—supposing I had made up the December balance-sheet there would have been a considerable loss, but I am not able to say what would be the amount of the deposit and current account at the closing of the bank, the receiver has done that, it is entirely out of my hands.</p>

I have been in business as an accountant eight or nine years; before that I was with the Millwall Iron Works ten years, and I was on casually in the office of Mr. Lewis, an accountant in a large way in London; he is also a trustee in the bankruptcy—I have had considerable experience in accounts; I carried on business at 23, Martin's Lane, Cannon Street, as an accountant for about four and a half years before I superintended the books of the bank; I had no partner—I was asked to take the appointment by Dr. Good on behalf of the depositors—I was, in fact, appointed as a check on the manager, and to give a full account of the business, separate and distinct from the manager's department—I had a distinct appointment and engaged my own clerks, they were under my sole control, I paying them and drawing the money from the bank—I made out the March balance-sheet from the books and vouchers, and if I had not been satisfied that different amounts had been paid and received I should not have placed them in the balance-sheet—the vouchers for all the amounts appear in the balance-sheet—putting aside the sum due from the Life Association, the whole of the items in that balance-sheet were true and correct, to the best of my knowledge, from the books and vouchers—I cannot say whether Mr. Tennant, a mining agent, paid 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in March, it could not have been paid at the time, but it stood in the books as a debit balance against Mr. Tenuant, he may have paid it subsequently—it is a matter of public</p>

               <p>notoriety that on 21st March we were sueing the British Imperial Life As<lb/>sociation for this commission at the very time I placed it in the balance-sheet—Mr. Borlase was the solictor to the bank at that time, and I heard him explain to the defendant and to the depositors that Mr. Oakley had a claim to that 6,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the foot note to the March balance-sheet was sug<lb/>gested by Mr. Oakley himself, and he told me at the time that that foot note was to prevent people thinking that it was actually cash in hand—I know that the amount expended by the Co-operative in endeavouring to float the Imperial was as much as 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Oakley told me that some person had been sent out to America to make inquiries about the Keokuk and Kansas Railway, and he showed me an agreement with the directors with regard to floating the railway—I cannot give you the amount Mr. Oakley spent in advertisements and other expenses in endeavouring to float the railway, but it was considerable—with the exception of the valuation put upon the secu<lb/>rities, every item in the June balance-sheet was correct, to the best of my knowledge; I made it up, and I and my staff compared it with the vouchers, except the securities—I kept four clerks—I superintended it, but a great portion of my time was occupied at the branches—the defendant told me I might see the engineer of the Keokuk and Kansas Railway with regard to the valuation, but I did not see him—there were several branches between March and June, and very considerable expenses were incurred in establishing them—Mr. Oakley showed me the assignment of 861 shares in the Helm Signal Company, and perhaps the amount of them is referred to in the 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the March balance-sheet; he showed me the assignment of the 861 shares—The Patent Lamp and the Helm Signals are the same thing—before the amounts were placed in the balance-sheet the securities were either handed to me or shown to me, they were brought to my knowledge and I could have examined them if I had chosen—I imagine that Mr. Oakley advanced con<lb/>siderable sums in bringing out the Canadian Gold Company, but I cannot tell you the amount; he informed me that he gave four acceptances of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I was told that the five debentures of the Credit Foncier, valued at 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., were sold for 360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I do not know—I believe the amount remitted to Australia in regard to the Australian Tin Mining Company was 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot say whether a sum was actually paid for the Woollen Trading Com<lb/>pany's securities, but I paid 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them, and it is put down as an asset of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I submitted the balance-sheets to Mr. Oakley, and he gave a general approval of the form in which they were drawn up; the items of the expenditure were left to me, they were taken from the books—large sums were expended in advertising—he said that he believed he should receive large sums in January which would tide over his difficulties—the papers had been attacking the Keokuk and Kansas Railway and the Co<lb/>operative Bank, owing to which the subscriptions had fallen off very considerably—as late as 31st December I was of opinion that although the funds were very low, I was able to report a better state of things, and trusted that with a little forbearance on the part of the depositors all would be well—the well-known principle of the bank was that there was no capital to start with, and I told everybody so who asked me—I put out the prospectus.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE SOLICITOR-GENERAL</hi>. The bad condition of things which I referred to was that there was 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd in the bank coffers on the 14th December—I talked about things looking better because it was reported to me by one of my clerks that money was coming in—I do not know what the amount was or from whom, but it was</p>

               <p>from new depositors I should say—I should treat as my own knowledge, information received from my staff—I cannot say whether the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the Woollen Trade Association was paid by cash or by bills—I had nothing to do with the financial department—I cannot say that those shares were treated as profits, I was given to understand by Mr. Oakley that they were realisable—that is how I was an independent accountant between Mr. Oakley and the shareholders—I got the amount expended, from the various vouchers scattered through the books—I might or might not see the four bills of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, they were passed through the office—when I assert that that is true which is on the balance-sheet I mean that the bills should appear in the bill-books, and I have every reason to believe they did—I ascertained how much money had been paid into the branches from time to time by subscribers, and the expenditure was entered in the balance-sheets—all the money that was paid into the bank was passed through the books in the usual form,. and the money was handed to Mr. Beddy for Mr. Oakley, it never passed through my hands—enquiries I believe were made as to what had become of the money, part went for Mr. Oakley's private account, and part for the use of the bank, the books will show a portion of that—the amounts were passed through the books and handed over to the secretary who acted as cashier—if you deposited 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it would be in the books, and it would be handed over to Mr. Oak<lb/>ley—the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would remain in Mr. Beddy's hands, and he might pay any body, either Mr. Oakley's private account or not—the March balance-sheet says "Balance" so much, and they all run in the same way—I do not include among the expenses and disbursements all the money that has gone into Mr. Oakley's pocket for any purpose whatever; he drew money for his private purposes—that does not appear in the balance-sheet—it is a charge in Mr. Oakley's accounts—it was kept open for explanation by Mr. Oakley; he drew cheques for various purposes for his private use and it went through the books—I know that the statement in the prospectus is that he received nothing for his private services—this balance-sheet would disclose that he was receiving nothing, but he acknowledged that he was entitled to a certain sum for conducting the "Co-operative Review"—he has not been credited with that—he was to be credited with it in the December balance-sheet; he suggested that he should have 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for that, and that is not included—the balance-sheet ought to disclose to the shareholders what had been received and paid, and I believe that amount is shown in the balance-sheet as "Loans outstanding 1,077<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I cannot say whether Mr. Oakley's receipts are. included in that—we account for the cash in hand at the head office and branches—it is not under the heading "Cash in hand," that was the actual cash in the hands of Mr. Beddy, and also at the branches—I assume that that cash was in the till in Mr. Beddy's possession because I saw the money counted; I cannot say that I counted it, but I had every reason to believe that it was correct—in auditing the branches I assumed the amount of balance—I cannot say that Mr. Oakley's account appears in the balance-sheet, it was to run over to December, and therefore the receiver will be able to account for those items—I cannot remember if Mr. Oakley's account was included in these items or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in holy orders and rector of Stratford St. Andrew, Suffolk—I was trustee of the reserve fund of the Co-operative Credit Bank, but not a trustee of the bank—I first heard of the bank by means of an advertisement, and I wrote this letter to the defendant on 25th December, 1873—(<hi rend="italic">This requested to know or what purpose guarantors were required, as advertised for in the Daily News</hi>). I got an answer, but I have destroyed all the letters—the answer was an account, of the scheme which he intended to carry out, and I wrote to him for a reference,. as I knew nothing about him—he referred me to the town-clerk of the City of London—I have not got the letter—about 19th March, 1874, I gave him a guarantee for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which has been returned to me and destroyed—it stated that I would guarantee to any person to whom that was given, the amount of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think I had seen the defendant before that, at a meeting at the London tavern, at which he explained the scheme—I gave another guarantee in April for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think, and that has been returned and destroyed—I then deposited 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash—I got the defendant to sell for me twenty-five shares in the Credit Fon<lb/>cier, which realised 181<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and let him have the amount—in June, 1874, all the guarantees I gave him were returned to me, and I accepted bills to the amount of 188<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and on the same date I paid him 211<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in cash—on 19th July, 1874, I deposited 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 19th August, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 8th October, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 19th October, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on 19th November, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on 1st November I gave him 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of acceptances, as he was very much pressed for money because he was getting out the stock of the British Imperial Life Insurance—I gave him those acceptances most relunctantly, he could not have gone on if I had not; he could not have advertised, and it was with the understanding from me that they should be taken up and returned to me in a fornight's time—there was no arrangement about the renewal of that 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I understood that if they were not taken up they would be returned; that was the understanding with all the acceptances I gave him—three or four bills of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each did come back to me, nearly the whole amount, and I had to meet them—the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was in five 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills at three months, drawn by Mr. Oakley and accepted by myself; I think they were payable at my bankers at Newton, but I am not quite sure—on 30th April, 1875, I deposited with the</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read—From the witness to the defendant, dated March</hi> 15, 1875. "My dear sir,—What is the use of your writing and bothering me about money. I have told you over and over again that I have not any, and that you have been keeping me for weeks past with scarcely a shilling in the house, and my Christmas bills unpaid. I must tell you plainly that, unless you shortly remit me some money, or if you allow any more bills to come back to me for payment, you will compel me, however reluctantly, to give you notice to withdraw from the concern altogether," &amp;c, &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">The letter afterwards stated:</hi> "I enclose a letter I received' this morning from a brother clergyman. What can I say to him after the manner in which I have been treated? If, however, you will promise me faithfully to employ one-half of any investment that he may make with the bank, in taking my bills off the market and returning them to me, I will write as favourably as I possibly can. Let me know whether you agree to this, because if not I must leave his letter unanswered, as I could not recommend him to join it" <hi rend="italic">The enclosure was:</hi> "Rev. C. H. Robertson presents his compliments to Rev. Mr. Good, and begs to have some information as to the working, &amp;c, of the Co-operative Credit Bank, of which he is a trustee. Smeeth Rectory, Ashford, March 12, 1875." <hi rend="italic">A notice from the witness to the defendant was here put in, stating that at the expiration of thirty days he should demand the payment of all money and interest of any kind, and the return of all bills not retired or withdrawn. Dated March</hi> 13, 1875. <hi rend="italic">This was enclosed in a letter from the witness to the defendant, demanding</hi> 102<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">for which amount he had been served with a writ.</hi>) It was true that he had been bothering me for money for weeks past—he wanted me to sell other things to meet these bills, which I did not choose to do—it was an understood thing that if I gave Mr. Oakley the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. acceptances he was to take them up with the first money he received—I think this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the letter I wrote to my brother clergyman who wrote to me for information, but I have not got my spectacles; I wrote what I felt—I was annoyed at the bills coming back, because Ooakley promised to take them up in a fortnight, or with the first money he received.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Mr. Hudswell hare stated thai he received the parcel from Dr. Good.</hi>) The first deposit appears to have been made on 2nd December, 1874, by one individual, according to the book—the entries show that 18 per cent was paid on deposits—the book does not show whether interest was paid on bills on deposit, I have had to ascertain it from entries scattered through the books—the interest on bills on deposit was at the rate of 12 per cent.—I also found that 5 per cent, interest was paid on the minimum monthly balance—I found claims against Oakley for advertisements—the total amount expended in advertisments and claimed is over 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., about 6,313<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of which has been paid, but I cannot trace it exactly on account of the irregularity of the books—I am telling you from the books, and from the accounts rendered—2,977<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is owing to Mr. Gee, the advertising agent—there was a staff of gentlemen clerks at the head office, and a staff of <hi rend="italic">ladies</hi>, and three lecturers—the books show that the payments to the lecturers were continued almost down to the stoppage—the last payment entered to a lecturer is in January this year—the amount returned 'to customers is, I should say, under 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the bank had about sixty branches, and some branches were in course of formation on the Continent—there was furniture at the majority of the branches—I have since had numerous claims for the rent of the branches, and there was a distress in several of them when I. came into possession—the exact amount of liabilities according to this March balance-sheet is 724<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the liabilities on 30th March were 4,584<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the balance-sheet, and the defendant had 2,740<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to meet then, consisting of acceptances on hand, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. amount due by customers, 315<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; office furniture, 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; commissions, 861<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; those commissions were put in as assets but they were not assets—that 2,740<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is irrespective the 6,750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. put down as due from the Imperial Life Association and irrespective of all commissions—I have no agreement between Oakley and the British Imperial—I have seen papers in the case which purport to give the substance of it—I found documents in the papers which came into my possession showing that there was a dispute between him and the Imperial Company—the action was commenced in January, 1875, I think—no part of the 6,750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been paid by the British Imperial—the</p>

               <p>defendant has spent 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in advertising the Imperial Associa<lb/>tion—I believe these figures are correct; I have the amount in my notes made by myself when the case was before the Lord Mayor, and they have been corrected since—I have every material book here, but it would take several carts to bring them all—that is all my own writing, it is extracted from the books before me—as a matter of fact, no profit was realised, and if the 6,750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not reckoned the account wound have shown a loss—as to the 861<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. commission, 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. arose in respect of an agreement between Mr. Oakley and two parties named Nicholls and Crewe—I have found them out; Mr. Nicholls is the patentee of some signals which he endeavoured to impress upon the Admiralty and which were not accepted—no part of it has been realised—it is a patent lamp—I have had correspondence with Mr. Nicholls and have his last letters—that was with a view to realising it—I have not realised anything, nor is there any prospect of anything being realised—I cannot say whether these sums of 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. have been realised or not—in my opinion the 6,750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was improperly put forward as an asset—the total gross profits shown in the June balance-sheet from the beginning of the year is 14,373<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and on the other side I find 8,611<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. securities, which are composed of 50 bonds of the Keokuk and Kansas Railway, and come to 7,750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the commission of 861<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the former balance-sheet—I cannot remember whether this is one of the docu<lb/>ments delivered to me in the brown-paper parcel—the defendant had not at that date expended any money in placing the bonds of that railway—they were brought out in October, I think—I have endeavoured to realize those bonds but have not succeeded, I cannot find a market, and, therefore, I cannot find a market value—I find the gross profit for the quarter ending June put down at 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I do not find that any profit was realised—I have been speaking of thirteen bonds, I have traced the rest of them to Mr. Frederick Adderley and Mr. George, an advertising agent, as security for a debt—Mr. Adderley has made large deposits, and he also lent 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the security of these bonds as a special loan—this 922<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is not set down as an asset, though it is under the head of assets, some banks do that; other banks put down the expenditure on the credit side to bring out the gross profit, it is not correct to put it down under the general heading of assets; I cannot remember such a case—a loss of between 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. ought to have appeared on 13th June—a balance-sheet could not have been made out from the books—the securities, 21,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in the September balance-sheet are made up of 9,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the Gil<lb/>bert Mining Company, fifty bords at 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and other items—there was an expenditure of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to float the company, but that is not a security, it is a contingent asset—if he had succeeded he would have got the money back—Nicholls, 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., is not an asset, it is an agreement for the patent signals—Mr. Oakley acquired a twelfth part of the patent from Nicholls, who was to have the power of purchasing back at any time—he had expended nothing on the patent signals; in the event of the patentee electing to re-purchase it, he was to pay him 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and in the meantime Mr. Oakley held one-twelfth—I think the Oxford Building Society shares were deposited by Dr. Stannard with the acceptances as collateral security—I do not find that the defendant has paid any money in respect of those shares—the 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is taken on the credit side and on the debit side of the balance-sheet; that forma, I believe, part of the 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have been in correspondence with the Gilbert and Chaudiere Mining Company, and find that the defendant</p>

               <p>them—I am not aware there is an error in Mr. Oakley's private account, and that a balance of 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is due to him; I should say the amount I have given from the ledger is less than I have analysed from the cash-book; I think Mr. Oakley has already given some evidence before the Bankruptcy Court; he has tendered himself for his examition, I thought fit not to examine him, with a criminal charge hanging over his head; the examination was adjourned till after this trial.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Ivy Bridge, near. Plymouth—I am a General in the British Army—in consequence of an advertisement of the Co-operative Credit Bank which appeared in February and March, I wrote for a prospectus, and in answer I received a circular and prospectus; I do not remember the date—this is it. (<hi rend="italic">This was a printe circular, dated February</hi> 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">signed R. B, Oakley, accompanied by a letter, requesting the witness to become a trustee of the reserve fund, with an honorarium of</hi> 100 <hi rend="italic">guineas per annum, and stating that no pecuniary liability attached to the office. The prospectus was also read</hi>)—I became a trustee of the reserve fund only, never of the bank; the reserve fund was represented to consist of Consols and Government Securities—in the first instance I provided a guarantee of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received this letter from the defendant. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 13<hi rend="italic">th March</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">announcing that subscriptions would be received, and stating that the trusteeship would not involve personal attendance, and that the investments were made in Consols, and transfers would be forwarded for signature as required. Other letters, dated 14th and 18th March respectively were also read, announcing the names of the proposed trustess and enclosing a prospectus</hi>). During the year 1874, I provided a number of acceptances for carrying on the business of the bank in the terms of the prospectus, altogether to the amount of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—those acceptances were ultimately taken up—there was a good deal of difficulty in taking them up from time to time they were renewed—I wrote to and received a great many letters from the defendant in relation to them. (<hi rend="italic">Letters from the witness dated 17th April and</hi> 21<hi rend="italic">st April were put in and read referring to to these acceptances, and expressing annoyance at the manner in which they had been presented.</hi>) At the time I wrote that last letter I do not think I had received the balance-sheet of 31st March—I do not think that balance-sheet was published till May or June—I received this letter from the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187608080081"/>
               <p>defendant on 14th April. (<hi rend="italic">This explained that the delay of the issue of the balanee-sheet was owing to domestic affliction in the family of Mr. Hudswett.</hi>) This letter of mine of 2nd May acknowledges the receipt of the balance sheet (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—on 13th May, 1875 I Bent Mr. Oakley a further accept<lb/>ance for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I afterwards received the balance-sheet for the quarter ending 30th June, 1875, in due course, I read it, and afterwards wrote this letter of 6th August, to Mr. Oakley. (<hi rend="italic">This alluded to some anonymous letters containing unfavourable remarks about the bank.</hi>) I received the balance-sheet for 30th September, 1875, and read it—on 29th October, 1875, I wrote this letter to the defendant. (<hi rend="italic">This also alluded to the persistent attach on the. bank both anonymously and by the public press, but expressing confidence in the undertaking</hi>). During the year 1875 I received regularly the "Co-operative and Financial Review," I subscribed to it six months in advance, according to the terms printed on it—the balance-sheet was never published till about five weeks after the date—I had further correspondence with the defendant about the attacks made upon him in the newspapers—I was asked by him to guarantee a sum of 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the prosecution of "The World "on the part of the Keoknk and Kansas Railway Company, and on 10th December, 1875, I wrote to him this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This agreed to the request for the</hi> 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">guarantee.</hi>) I received this little pamphlet from the defendant, I can't say when, I presume when it was published—my first interview with the defendant was on 29th January, 1875; I then asked him about the bank, how it was progressing, and he spoke of it most favourably in every way—I might have had two or three more internews with him after that, I think one was in May, 1875, and one on 1st December, 1875; there might have been one between May and December, but I don't remember the date, and I am not sure that there was one—at those interviews I always spoke to him in reference to the bank; he always assured me that everything was satisfactory and in a most flourishing state and that it was sure to prosper; he inspired me with full confidence at every interview—the interview on the 1st December was at the bank, I spoke to him then about the condition of the bank, and he assured me that it was most prosperous and everything was well in spite of the attacks in the different papers—I had at that time seen the balance-sheets for March, June, and September—I paid in 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the name of one of my daughters as an investment at that time, and just as I was coming away, he said to me "By-the-bye, General, I have no acceptance of yours now, it will be of use to me," and I had such confidence in him that I gave it immediately, dated 1st December, for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at three months, that acceptance ought to have been renewable by the bank, but the bank was closed, and of course I had to pay it when due—I never received any part of the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the bank—at the time I invested that money and gave the acceptance I had no idea of what I have since learnt as to the real state of the bank; I had confidence in the state of the bank, not only from the assurances of the defendant, but from the balance-sheets; I trusted entirely to the balance-sheets being certified and signed by public accountants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw Mr. Hudswell's note at the foot of the balance-sheet: "We hereby certify that we have examined the books and find it correct"—my first interview with the defendant was on 29th January, 1875—there were continual attacks made on him by the press, more so towards the autumn of last year; they were very violent then—Mr. Oakley informed we in the first instance that he had been a bankrupt, but I did not under<lb/>stand</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187608080082"/>
               <p>the different degrees of bankruptcy; he said it was upon Stock Exchange transactions; I have not seen anything of the bankruptcy pro<lb/>ceedings, I was satisfied with Mr. Oakley's explanation that it was some Stuck Exchange affair, and I did not think so much of it—from time to time anonymous attacks were made upon him and sent to me, and on one occasion I replied to those attacks in the local papers—on one occasion I required 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the bank advanced it to me, as a matter of business; a portion of it is still due, a portion is paid, the rest will be paid when due; it was to be repaid at intervals of six months, I pay it as it falls due—the 100 guineas I was to receive as trustee of the reserve fund was placed to my deposit account, I suppose 18 per cent, interest was given upon that—I must have received it, I think, for six months; and the other 12 percent, on the bills—I gave a guarantee, in the first instance, in the terms of the prospectus for the purposes of the bank; I did not inquire what it was for; it was to provide capital for the bank—I was not consulted as to the investment in the Keokuk and Kansas bonds, I was told after it was made that that was the reserve fund, I think that must have been in September or October last—the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced to me in August, 1875—there was no pressure put upon me by the Naval Bank, they asked me for the money and I settled it; the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced upon terms for that purpose, as it would have been by any other bank—in July and August I did not, that I am aware of, offer to subscribe another 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was always applied to, I did not offer—I am not sure whether the defendant declined and said he did not want it, I think there was something of the sort—my offer must have been in writing; in April I reduced my acceptances from 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; there was some correspondence about it, I had confidence in the bank and I think I offered it, and it was refused; it was not required, the funds of the. bank were so good—this was about July or August. (<hi rend="italic">A letter of 9th May from the witness was read, stating:</hi> "I have to acknowledge cheque for 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as the amount for interest on 15th inst. on two bills you have of mine, reaching maturity. I am quite willing to give acceptances to the amount of my guarantee.") That was 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether, not 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in addi<lb/>tion; it was 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in addition to keep up the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which I had given guarantee; I knew the general principles of the scheme and I believed in it entirely; I thought it very good and feasible, I believe it could be worked out—I did not know what sums were being paid for advertisements and different things, I knew it was considerable, it must have been very large—I knew that a considerable outlay must be incurred to establish the bank.</p>

                  </hi>. I am rector of Smeeth, near Ashford—in consequence of seeing an advertisement I wrote for and subsequently received a prospectus of the Co-operative Credit Bank; I observed on it the names of the Rev. Dr. Good and General Gascoigne—I wrote to both of those gentlemen and received answers from them—in consequence of those answers and what I saw in the prospectus, I made a subscription to the bank, to the extent of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at first—that was at the end of March, 1875—I received a deposit receipt for my advance—I forget whether I received any letters from the defendant before I sent my 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had no personal interview with him before then—on 22nd April I received a balance-sheet for the quarter ending 31st March, 1875—on that day and on 24th I wrote these letters to the defendant.

               <p>Mr. Oakley's answers with me, I have simply brought such letters as I thought of importance—they explained exactly as was done at the general meeting, as to what the nature of the claim was, that it was not yet realised, but that he was sure to get it in point of law—I was present at the general meeting, and that was what Mr. Oakley himself said—there was a report of the meeting published in the "Co-operative Review;" it was to the effect that the company wished to issue some new shares, and he undertook to issue them at a certain percentage, and that before he had been able to issue them a mistake was found in the prospectus of the company, which led to the shares not being able to be issued; but as the fault was due to the company, he said he had still a claim for his commission, and that his lawyer said he was sure to get it—he said that the company had issued names of directors without the sanction of the persons whose names were there, and this was discovered and exposed—I have here a copy of the report. (<hi rend="italic">This was put in and read.</hi>) I made a speech myself, it is sub<lb/>stantially reported <hi rend="italic">there—</hi>—he told me the British Imperial claim was disputed; I did not know that it had got into litigation before the bank was started—I was not aware that a bankruptcy would have intervened and prevented his transferring to the bank any money that was receivable upon it—on 9th June I wrote a notice of withdrawal of 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was from no doubt of the solvency of the bank, I simply wanted the money, I may say that <hi rend="italic">it</hi> was not' carried out. (<hi rend="italic">The letter and notice of withdrawal were read.</hi>) On the 10th I wrote to him this letter explaining my notice of withdrawal (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—I received an answer to that from the defendant on 11th June, 1875, I have not got it; it pointed out that it was necessary to give six months' notice, I. had—forgotten that, so I managed otherwise and left the money in the bauk—I think the letter was from Mr. Hudswell on the part of the bank; I think he said that in spite of that he would arrange it if I wished, but I declined—on 17th June I wrote again (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had received from the Archbishop of Canterbury and others representations against the bank, to which he felt it difficult to reply unless furnished with information for the purpose.</hi>) I got an answer to that; I have not got it. (<hi rend="italic">The reply was read from the defendant's press letter book, it was dated</hi> 18<hi rend="italic">th June</hi>, 1875, <hi rend="italic">and stated that these attacks were parts of an organised raid against the bank, which, in spite of all, was certain to succeed. Two other letters from 'the witness, dated June</hi> 23<hi rend="italic">rd and July</hi> 23<hi rend="italic">rd</hi>, 1875, <hi rend="italic">were read, calling attention to injurious reports as to the state of the bank and the character of the defendant; a letter from the witness of December</hi> 27<hi rend="italic">th, gave notice of the withdrawal of</hi> 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">to which the defendant replied on</hi> 28<hi rend="italic">th December, staling it was out of his power to accede to the demand, as nearly all the available cash had been drawn out, and if, instead of withdrawing, he could pay in a few thousands it would be of material assistance; another letter from the defendant of</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">st January</hi>, 1876, <hi rend="italic">suggested that the witness should receive the</hi> 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">in Gilbert and Chaudiere shares, which were of a most satisfactory character. On</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">th January the witness replied that the shares 'could be of no use, and expressing his willingness to take monthly instalments of</hi> 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; <hi rend="italic">in a letter of January 6th, the defendant suggested that the witness should take the lump sum at the end of the month, to which the witness wrote an assent.</hi>) In one of my letters I spoke of the June balance-sheet as removing all doubt as to the feasibility of the scheme; I perfectly believed the statements in that balance-sheet—besides the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I handed over, I paid another deposit of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think, on 4th May, and I once or</p>

                  </hi>. I formerly lived at Exeter—I first heard of the Co-operative Credit Bank by advertisement, and applied to the defendant for a prospectus—I received a letter in reply and a prospectus—I cannot say whether I also received a copy of the "Review "then or subsequently—I made an application to Dr. Good, and received this answer—I then wrote this letter to the defendant. (<hi rend="italic">Dated</hi> 29<hi rend="italic">th May</hi>, 1875, <hi rend="italic">and enclosing a crossed cheque for</hi> 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)

(<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th December</hi>, 1875, <hi rend="italic">from the defendant to the witness requesting him to combine the office of trustee, with that of agent at Exeter, which he could do if he invested</hi> 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.) There was some little difficulty about my combining the offices of trustee and agent, but I was ultimately appointed both trustee and agent for the. Exeter branch, and I carried on the Exeter branch until the collapse of the bank in January last—I afterwards wished to resign the trusteeship and received this letter from the defendant. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that it would be very unadvisable to change the trusteeship at that time.</hi>) On 1st October, I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187608080087"/>
               <p>received a letter from the defendant enclosing a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank-note for the branch—the book will show what other sums I received—I wrote this letter to the defendant. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated October</hi> 13<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1875, <hi rend="italic">referring to an article on the bank in the</hi>" World" <hi rend="italic">newspaper, and requesting permission to horsewhip the author of it.</hi>) At that time I had the most implicit belief in the defendant and in the bank—I applied early in January for more money for my branch, and after several applications received a cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Dated January</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1876.) I acknowledged that cheque on January 11th, by this letter, and on the following day I wrote this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This requested the defendant to inspect the general balance-sheet of 1st January, and he would see the reason why the</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">and the</hi> 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">had failed to put the bank in comfortable circumstances.</hi>) On 14th January, I wrote this letter to the defendant. (<hi rend="italic">This requested the fullest particulars about a returned cheque of the day before,. and asked for notes instead of cheqes in future.</hi>) That returned cheque was one which I had given him, which when handed in for collection was returned—I paid the cheque into my bank and they returned it, and Mr. Oakley sent me some post-office orders to pick up the cheque—it was not paid on presentation and I then wrote the letter of 14th January—I then got this letter from the defendant (<hi rend="italic">This was dated January</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">th, and stated.</hi> "The reason why your cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was returned was that at the moment we had no money to meet it, we therefore did the next best thing, which was to send the money to pick I it up.") In consequence of the alarm I felt at the position of the bank, I came up to London on Monday night, 17th January—I did not see Mr. Hudswell till the Wednesday—previous to my coming up, I think it was on the 13th, I had written to Mr. Oakley resigning my position as agent. and trustee, and this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is his letter acknowledging the receipt of mine—I saw Mr. Hudswell on the Wednesday, and after that put myself into the hands of my lawyers, Messrs. Trauley and Crauford, who applied at the Mansion House for an information—I have not had my 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. returned to me—I am sure that I wrote the letter resigning my trusteeship before I saw those gentlemen, it is dated from Exeter—the letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was written subsequently to the other—the reason I gave for resigning was that I was in business as a surgeon at Exeter, and I found I was likely to suffer a great deal through my connection with the bank, I could not carry the two on consistently with public opinion—I offered to write a letter saying that I was resigning simply on account of that—that was on Saturday 15th—I also proposed to appoint my clerk, Bloxam, in my place—my lawyer told me that if I did not lay an information I was open to an information being laid against me—he said "You are under a very great difficulty if you let the business go on, and you must lay an information or take pro<lb/>ceediugs, or you will be proceeded against"—I probably received 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for' carrying on the bank at Exeter in January, but the book will show that.</p>

I am a wire worker at 475, Mile End Road—in the early part of last year I saw the prospectus of the Co-operative Credit Bank, and called at the office and saw the defendant; I told him I had received a prospectus and the treatise respecting the scheme of the bank, and if it was what it represented I had occasionally a little money which I should be very pleased to deposit—he said "I have no doubt, whatever business you feel disposed to do with the bauk, it will be quite satisfactory to you," and I said that I would leave a deposit of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on current account; that was in April, 1875—on several occasions when I called for my book he said that the bank was a <hi rend="italic">bond-fide</hi> affair, and he always represented that it was doing a most excellent business, and that nothing could prevent it being a very large concern—on the last occasion he said, respecting the bank and the safety of it, "It is a <hi rend="italic">bond-fide</hi> affair, for the occasion that other parties are speaking so much against us, is that we are doing a larger business, and they are only cross and vexed to. think that they are not with us"—besides, the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am a Justice of the Peace for the county of Carmarthen, and I live in South Wales—in October last I received a pamphlet relating to the Co-operative Credit Bank—it had a balance-sheet printed at the end of it, to the quarter ending 30th June, and to the best of my recollection there was a prospectus of the bank; I read some of the prospectus and perused the balance-sheet, and about 29th December, 1875, I sent the defendant a cheque for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and received an acknowledgment from him—this is his letter (dated 31st December) in which this formal receipt was enclosed—I had sent with my cheque the prospectus which I had received, filled up, and about 5th January I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This requested the witness to become a trustee.</hi>) This is my reply. (<hi rend="italic">This was a consent to become a trustee if there was no. pecuniary responsibility.</hi>) I then received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was from the defendant, dated</hi> 7<hi rend="italic">th January, stating there was no pecuniary resposibility,' and requesting to know if he had any quality or profession which he would like added to his name.</hi>) A few days after I received this letter, dated 10th January. (<hi rend="italic">This stated thai two other large depositors desired to join the trustees.</hi>)' I believed the statements contained in the balance-sheet, and in the several pamphlets which I read—after I had invested the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received the "Co-operative and Financial Review" every week—I judged from the last balance-sheet that the bank was genuine—I did not know that oakley had been bankrupt—I knew nothing of the balance of cash in the bank in December—I did not know that the balance on 30th December was only 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have not. received any of my money back.</p>

I did not think it very large—the 18 per cent. was the chief thing that operated on my mind—I wrote a letter to Mr. Robertson, I have not got his reply, I think I tore it up soon after—a letter from him was enclosed with the pamphlet—I don't think his letter had. much to do with my placing my money in the bank—I thought I could rely on his word, he being a clergyman, but he was an entire stranger to me.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was a request to be informed whether money deposited could be withdrawn as in savings' banks.</hi>) I received a reply from Mr. Beddy, in consequence of which I deposited 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the bank on 30th September, and got a receipt, signed by Mr. oakley—on 13th November, I deposited a further sum of 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and received a receipt, these are my three receipts—I went to the bank-about the end of November, or the beginning of December, to receive the monthly interest on my deposits, but I do not think I saw the defendant then—I had a conversation in November or December, in Mr. Beddy's room, and Mr. oakley came in; I spoke to him about disposing of some Munster bank shares; he undertook to do it for me, and I sent him thirteen shares in the Munster Bank—I told him what I wished to get for them, and he said that I could receive the proceeds at a-certain time; I sold them for 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and went to receive the proceeds and told Mr. Beddy that I wished to keep 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and to deposit the 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the Co-operative Bank—I wrote this letter to the defendant—these other letters were written to Mr. Beddy, because I would not trouble Mr. oakley—I dare say I had seen the September balance-sheet when I deposited the Munster bank shares, but I do not understand balance-sheets—I understand the difference between profit and loss, but there is always something else to make it difficult to understand; I have so often received them from other quarters—I saw Mr. oakley in January last, in reference to three 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. shares in the Fourth City Building Mutual Investment Society, and asked him whether they were saleable; I think he said that they were not, and that I must get them cashed at Queen Street at the office of the building society, if I wished to change them—I knew that I should have to give notice—I afterwards received this letter from Mr. oakley. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated January</hi> 7<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1876, <hi rend="italic">enclosing a formal notice, signed by the witness, of the withdrawal of her money from the building society at fourteen days' date.</hi>) I gave him the certificate of the shares and he prepared for me this notice: "Dear Sir,—I hereby request you to pay over to Mr. R.

Taylor, of Chancery Lane, cut out of a newspaper; I do not know whether it was a statement that somebody had been made bankrupt—I know it was something about Mr. oakley which was put into the letter in which that was enclosed—I showed the letter and the newspaper paragraph both to Mr. oakley—they must have made a statement about him, I cannot recollect what it was, it was something to warn me—I was to send it back by return of post and that was the reason I went down with it—I do not recollect whether it also stated something about a Mr. Patterson—the letter I signed was not written by me—I did not approve of employing a lawyer—Mr. oakley dictated it, but it is not his writing—I think Mr. Edmunds was present—I had a conversation with the defendant relating <hi rend="italic">to selling</hi> some Union Bank shares, I told him I would not sell them till Christmas, because I wanted the Christmas dividend to make a present which I promised to one of my nephews—after Christmas Mr. oakley wrote this letter at the Co-operative Bank and I signed it.

About 2.45 on the morning of 14th July I was on duty in St. George's Road, and was called by the prisoner to No. 58—he said there was a woman down the area—I asked how she came there—he said she came down after a glass of water—I asked who she. was—he said a prostitute—I asked what he wanted to do—he said he wanted to <hi rend="italic">get</hi> her away—I said he had better go and turn her out, and if necessary I would help him—he went down the area—I waited some few minutes and saw the prisoner return and the woman—she was coming up the steps, and when she was about half way up I saw him stab her—she appeared to be in a hurry; she was not resisting—he had this bayonet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the top of a rifle and he pointed at her in the back—I only saw that once—she came to the top of the steps as fast as she could—he followed her to the area gate and went back again—the woman"' did not scream till after she fell down—she stood on the area steps a minute or two and then fainted—I saw a great deal of blood—she said she had been stabbed by the prisoner—Collingbourne, another officer, got a. cab and took her to St. George's Hospital—while she was lying on the ground I called to the prisoner to come and open the area gate—he came and unlocked it but did not come outside—he saw her on the ground—I told him he had stabbed the woman with the bayonet and she was fainting—I then went down with him to the area and found this bayonet in the scabbard hanging up on a belt behind the door—I took it out and ex<lb/>amined</p>

I live at 42, Cumberland Street—I am an unfortunate girl—on the morning of 14th July, about 1.30, I met the prisoner in St. George's Road—he asked where I was going—I said "Home"—he said he would come with me presently, and asked me to come to his house—I went with him to the gate and he brought me some sherry—afterwards he said "I find I shall not be able to come home with you, will you come down' with me"—I went down the area with him—there was a bed there—I was with him in the pantry there about five or six minutes, and had a little more sherry with him—after that he said "You will excuse me for going upstairs"—I said "Very well"—while he was gone I heard loud talking outside—he returned in about ten minutes and said "I don't live here, I live a little way down below if you like to come down with me, if not I will come home with you"—I said "You have not given me what you promised me"—he had promised me a half-sovereign before I went in—I had a few words with him he said "Are you ready to come out?"—I said "Yes," and I went out with him from the pantry along a passage, and when I got a little way from the area I saw something flash like lightening—I said "Oh!" and ran to the top as hard as I could—I was stabbed, and I don't recollect any more—I called "Police! murder!"—I was bleeding and fainted and was taken by the officer in a cab to the hospital, where I was twelve days—I don't know how it was done; it was done so quickly—I was quite sober—I did not go before the Magistrate at first, because the prisoner's mother came to me and paid me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I live at 16, Upper Charles Street, and was with the last witness and saw the prosecutor, and the prisoner struggling with his arm round the prosecutor's neck—there were some others near them—prisoner threw Mr. Dyer—then a gentleman threw the prisoner off to give Dyer, an opportunity of getting away—the prisoner ran across the road—Dyer got up and followed, him saying "That man has got my watch"—May and I followed the prisoner and did not lose sight of him up to the time he was given into custody—I asked him if he had got the watch, and he said he had not—I did not see him throw anything away.</p>

I am a pianoforte key maker—on 6th August, I was returning from Kingsland Gate, about 12.45 in the morning, when I saw a cabman that I knew, and a horse that had kicked out of the shafts, and while speaking to the man a cry was raised "They have stolen your whip"—there was a crowd of about fifty people—my friend gave chase and stopped the man who had the whip and brought it back—I heard several voices say "There's one of the b——, and there's another"—pointing to the cabman—some of them being in light dust coats were distinguished from the others—they came in the road towards us—I said to my friend "We had better run," and. we ran as far as Richmond Road, Kingsland—when we were surrounded by seven young men and girls—the four prisoners, and one caught hold of me and asked what was the matter—I said "Nothing is the matter with me, I am all right" and struggled to getaway—they said "We will see you righted"—I said "If it's money you want I will give you some," and I gave them 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I was then pushed across the road and I felt the ring go off my finger—I afterwards found the ring at 4 o'clock in the morning where it was dropped—my pockets were emptied—I could feel that—I saw <hi rend="italic">my</hi> money roll out on the pavement—my waist-coat pocket had been cut—then my watch went—I bad my coat buttoned—two ounces of tobacco in<lb/>paper, a few odd coins, a ticket case with two pawn tickets in it—Moxey took a more active part in it than the others—I picked up my hat and ran away—I next saw them all four at 10.30 the same morning at Hackney Downs Station, and gave information at the police-station at about 2.15—I have no doubt that the prisoners are the parties—it was Moxey who held me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the Assay Office of the Gold-mith's Company—on 7th April, in consequence of information, I went to the prisoner's shop in New Oxford Street, and saw this coffee-pot in the window, labelled "120 years old"—I went in and asked to see it—the I prisoner showed it to me'; he told me that the price was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that it was an antique—I was instructed to purchase it—I also looked at this ewer, I and found on it an old mark, the Roman letter I, which is the hall mark of I 1744—I had received instructions that there were two bottoms, and I judged so by the thickness; the prisoner said that the price was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10., I and I purchased it right off, and asked him to let me take the coffee-pot I on sale or return within two days, which he did, and on further examination I found that the letter M on the coffee-pot represents 1747—I was instructed to purchase it, and went and paid 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it next day—I have made an assay of the coffee-pot, and it is 2 dwts. in the pound under the standard; it would not have been marked at Goldsmith's Hall on that</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The difference in money value between this and standard silver would be about a 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per ounce—the prisoner told me I could take the coffee-pot on approbation, and if I did not approve of it I could exchange it for anything else, but I said "No, I will take it on sale or return within two days," and he was quite content, and for all I know he would have let me have the ewer on the same terms—the information.I had was from Messrs. Prideaux &amp; Son—I had had no communication from Price—a record at Goldsmith's Hall of all the marks; a stranger would not know without referring to me or to a book which is published—I was pretty certain that the coffee-pot was a new manufactured thing, but I knew it was an old mark—I saw one or two other articles in the window, and my doubt was whether it was the thing I was instructed to purchase.</p>

                  </hi>. My father is a solicitor, and is clerk to the Goldsmith's Company; I am assistant clerk—we received information from a man named Price, in consequence of which I directed Harman to go to the defendant's shop and purchase certain articles—we had received minute directions from Price—on 7th April Harman brought these articles to Goldsmith's Hall, and under my directions they were fully tried and tested—the Court never meet oftener than once a month, but the interval is sometimes longer—the information Price gave me also implicated Brown—inquiries were made, and on 5th May we had a writ issued against Gooch, which was served next day, Saturday, and on Monday, 8th May, he came to Goldsmith's Hall and saw my father in his room—we never allow clerks to be present on these occasions—he said he had called in consequence of the writ with which he had been served, that it was a very unfortunate thing for him, and asked us what we should advise him to do—we pointed out to him that the 4th section of the Act enabled him to clear himself by giving the name of the person of whom he bought the article; that he at once and without hesitation expressed himself unable to do—he said that he had bought it in the course of trade, but from whom he could not tell; he repeated that several times, and asked what we should advise him to do—he was told that we could give him no other advice, and that he had better consult his solicitor—he asked if the articles were destroyed; we said no, they were at Goldsmith's Hall, and we were not in the habit of destroy<lb/>ng things of that sort—he gave us further explanation, and my father told him pretty plainly that he did not believe him, and that he must know of whom he bought them—this is the writ (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) Gooch left, and next day a clerk from Messrs. Dobree called and paid the two penalties in the accustomed way—Brown was apprehended on the 16th May, and taken before a Magistrate on the 17th and remanded—he was brought up again on the 24th, and Gooch appeared and gave evidence against him—after the 17th the Magistrate issued a summons and directed it to be served—Brown was represented on the 24th by Mr. Alsop, a solicitor, who cross-examined Gooch; his statement was taken down in writing and signed by him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My first interview with Price was as near as possible on 31st March last—I did not get the information then; I got it within a week—I did not see him on the first occasion, but on the second I did for some</p>

               <p>considerable time—we are absolutely prohibited from issuing a writ without a written order of the Court—a meeting might be convened, but it is a large body—the prisoner did not make a clean breast of it at first—I did not contemplate any criminal proceedings against Gooch when I saw him on 8th May—I did not think there was sufficient evidence, although I had seen Price a quarter of an hour before—I did not inform Gooch that I was in communication with Price—Brown was given into custody, and Gooch was examined on 8th May—Price was re-called by Mr. Also after Gooch had been examined—the proof in such cases is upon the person who is found in possession—Brown is not. sentenced, he is awaiting his sentence now—we have taken no steps against Price.</p>

I sold it, it was brought to me by the prisoner, and I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per ounce for it; I assumed it to be old; I looked at the mark. A modern one would be 9?. per ounce. I have had the coffee pot; I sold it. I bought it of the prisoner, not at the same time as the others. I gave him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per ounce; I bought it as being old. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I bought the coffeepot first, it was brought to me in my shop by the prisoner; it was produced to me at his house four or five days before; it was then plain. He said he was going to chase it, there was another one with it; it was sold about the middle of March. I bought the coffee-pot about the 7th or 8th February. I entered the sale in my books, this other one was marked; I sold it for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I gave 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I sold it as old; I did not know if it was; I bought it as old. I bought the cream ewer about 25th March of the prisoner, that was the first time I saw it. I bought it as an old article, at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per ounce; it was a cash transaction. I paid 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., it is entered in my books. There was no invoice for making it, there might have been a bill for polishing; I have not got it. I generally destroy the small receipts as soon as I have entered the amounts; I have known prisoner, about three months. The cream ewer was not taken by me when it was only a half-pint, I did not take it to prisoner's house. Price was in the shop when it was shown to me. I never said anything to Price about the ewer; I never said to Price they would be very nice things if made antique. I spoke about the chasing. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> This coffee pot was complete when I saw it; I believe prisoner showed me the pot. Price was present. I only saw the coffee-pot at Brown's, it was perfectly clean. David L. Gooch."</p>

               <p>previous to this—in January this year I was passing his shop and he was standing at the door—we both said good morning and he invited me in—I asked him for work, and he said "You see how it is, I have got a good man who does my work and a thoroughly experienced man in old-fashioned work, he has had hundreds of pounds from me"—he then stepped behind the counter and said that his man was getting very saucy and he did not like it—he brought up a small piece of silver and asked me if I thought I could make a sugar basket of it—I said "Yes, but it will be a very small one"—he said "You are <hi rend="italic">greener</hi> than I thought you were, this is for a foot," and he showed me a hall mark on the piece of silver and told me to be very careful with it, not to hurt it—he said that old-fashioned work sold better than new and that all he should have to do with it when I brought it home would be to take it down to Goldsmith's Hall and register it, and they would charge him 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an ounce for it, and he said "That is my business"—it was a small piece of silver about two-thirds of the size of my hand—I took it home and thought I was very fortunate—I made the sugar basket and took it back to him and charged him 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per ounce—I found the rest of the silver he then said "I forgot to weigh the piece of silver again, suppose you charge me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce," because I had not allowed him for it; "that will make it straight and there is your money"—I did not get any other work from him then, I was very ill and had to go home—he came to my place two days afterwards, but in the interval I had received a note from Thomas Price—he brought a pint tankard, two milk ewers, eight salt spoons, and a half-pint tankard; they had old marks on them—he told me he wanted the two milk ewers to be gilt inside and polished and the salt cellars also; the pint tankard was to be made into a beer jug, the spoons were to be reduced to the size of a pattern he brought, and the half pint ewer to be made into a pint ewer, with the silver taken off the spoons—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the pint ewer which I made from the half-pint—he had seen some coffee-pots which were being made when he called while I was away ill; he afterwards told me that he would have them and gave me two old salt-cellars with hall marks on them which I was to put on the bottoms—the old hall marks on the bottoms of these coffee-pots came from Mr. Gooch, they were on the saltcellars he gave me and were transferred in my shop—that was early in February—I have no doubt he saw the work while it was going on when he called about another job, a beaker, which I have omitted to mention, and which I sold to him in the rough for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the ounce; I asked him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at first—I took home two of them, they were a pair, but they were chased differently—the cream ewer was not done then, I was removing and it was delayed and was sent home afterwards—this work was done by Price a chaser in my business, another workman soldered the bottom in—in May after I had removed to Princes Street—Gooch came and said that he had been served with a writ from Goldsmith's Hall concerning the coffee-pot and the pint ewer—I said "Did not you register them?"—he said <hi rend="italic">Register</hi> be d—d, you talk like a fool"—nothing took place then, because; I was very busy, and he went away very vexed and agitated—he came in a Han-som's cab—I went to his place on the Monday to know more about it, and he said that he was going to Goldsmith's Hall, and he should have to say that I had made them for him and tell my name—I said "You need not tell my name, because they already know"—every man who works in silver and has it assayed at Goldsmith's Hall has a mark, but you misunderstand me—I told him that they knew of this affair, because Price had told me he</p>

               <p>should go to Goldsmith's Hall—he and I had some words and I thought they would not have come to him without Price having told them—Gooch said "I shall go down and pay the fine," and I left him under the impression that he was going to do so—I saw him about 5 o'clock next day at his shop and he said "I have been to Goldsmith's Hall and they refuse the money unless I give you up"—I said "You may as well, because I am sure they know"—he said "To-morrow I shall send the money down," and next evening at 10 o'clock or 10.30 he came to my place and knocked us up, we were all in bed—he told me that he had sent the money down and they had accepted it, and he had not told my name—on the next Saturday he brought me some work to do, but I do not remember that anything took place about this—I was taken up on, I think, the Wednesday following, and next day, the 17th, I was taken before the Magistrate and remanded—on the 24th I was brought up again—Gooch appeared as a witness against me and I was committed for trial—my solicitor communicated with the Goldsmith's Com-pany—he advised me and I acted almost entirely on his responsibility.</p>

I did pawn it to get a little money—with the exception of pawning that waiter there is nothing that I have been in trouble about—when the sugar basket was made, Gooch told me to register it, and that he should have to pay 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an ounce for it—that is what I was, alluding to when I asked him if he had registered it—I very seldom had to go to Goldsmith's Hall, it was generally jobbing work and electro-plating that I was engaged in, but I had an order and took that there, and they told me I must have a punch made, and I did—my stock consisted of articles being, made up, and my tools and plant—Gooch brought me a little thing with a spoon upon it, which he wanted made into a beaker and he complained of the chasing on it, he wanted it taller, and he said "I wanted to make it taller, but Brown would not let me"—the date of the pawning of Attenborough's plate was about 4th March, 1876; of course it was my intention to get it out of pawn, that had caused me extra expense.</p>

Cooper, of Birmingham; my first transaction with Nowick was on March 9, 1875; that was for cash—the first transaction for credit was April 12, 1875, 96<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there were several transactions between April and September for drafts and cash, and previous to the last transaction in September, 1875, he was indebted to me about 330<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on bills current; I said to him "I hear that your brother is very likely to smash, he owes me a lot of money, and I cannot afford to lose any more if he were to go"—he said "I can assure you you are perfectly safe, whoever loses you shall not lose; I have received 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with my wife, and I shall be perfectly able to pay every one"—he was married in June; this was before I parted with 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>" worth of goods, and I did so believing I should be paid for them—I believed his statement about the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was the last transaction I had with him—his acceptance given me for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the goods fell due on December 22nd, and in consequence of something I heard I went to 70, Hatton Garden, about December 4 or 5, with Mr. Gustav Wild—I told the prisoner my bills were coming due, that he owed me 390<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I must have security—after some time he handed me over a parcel containing 1,200 pearls, which he said were worth 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but they really were only worth 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I subsequently gave up the pearls for the general body of the creditors; they were sealed up in Mr. Wild's presence, and the seal was broken at the meeting of creditors—the prisoner's debt to me was 399<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he has paid no portion of the last let I attended the first meeting of creditors at Mr. Louis Lewis', in Hatton Garden, on February 1, 1876, when the creditors resolved upon liquidation. by arrangement, and I was appointed trustee—the resolution was duly registered and confirmed—questions were put to the defendant at the meeting of 19th January by the chairman, Mr. Evans, my solicitor, in the presence of Mr. Eagle, who took down the examination—I applied for the keys on 2nd February, the prisoner sent them, and I took these books (<hi rend="italic">pro-duced</hi>) from his office, the ledger, day-book, cash-book, bill-book, and banker's pass-book—I have gone carefully through them—the entries in the cash-book are tolerably regular to October, 1872—the capital entered at starting is 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in July, 1871—he wrote down for his private expenditure at first 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—it is sometimes 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—the first credit transaction is a bill of Keller &amp; Hahn, on November 4th, 1872, of 429<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the end of 1873, there was a balance of about 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. against him—on March 25th, I find credit F.

I live at East Ham, and have been in the service of the London and St. Katherine Docks Company for eleven years—in May last I was gatekeeper in their service, and on May 23rd I was on duty at the south gate of the Victoria Docks when,—between 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning, I saw Carter at the gate—he asked me if I would like to get 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for beer—he said my mate did, not the man on last week, but the week before—he said "I will give you ten passes extra to what had passed dur<lb/>ing the day, that would be 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for you and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for me"—I said there was some one tallying below—he said there was not, and if there was there would be two to one—I declined, and he went away—I saw him next day between' 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon at the same gate—he said "There is no occasion to take so many as I said yesterday, take five which will be 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, or as <hi rend="italic">few</hi> as you like"—I said I had my wife and family to study—he said he had the same, "I wouldn't ask you if it was not all right;" he then went away—I believe on the 6th June I made a communication to Ellis, the chief constable,—it had been the practice of Carter to give me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day for keeping the cart-road clear and giving right information, a check, in fact, on his own carmen for the quantity of loads that passed in and out—the Dock Company did not know that I got that 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day until I reported—the name of the man at the gate the week before the 23rd May, was Fair-weather, and the man who preceded the week before that was the prisoner Griffiths.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GILL</hi>. I should think I have been the gatekeeper about seven or eight years, during which time I have seen Carter, I cannot say particularly often—I do not know that he has constantly had contracts with the Docks—he came up to me as usual and paid me the ls. and asked me to take ten passes—he came to give me the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. every day—there was a good deal of traffic that day when he made the proposition about the ten passes; I refused it—I did not make any communication that night—he gave me the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. five days that week—there was nothing doing on the 6th day—I kept my information to myself till 6th June—I have never had</p>

               <p>any quarrel with Carter—I <hi rend="italic">hare</hi> never said I would do him an injury if I could; I should be very sorry to do so to any one without provocation—I made the first communication to Mr. Ellis, the head constable, when I think, I was on the principal gate—I went to the office and made the com<lb/>munication.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SIMS</hi>. Griffiths and I were both gatekeepers, and I have known him for some time; I have never had anything unpleasant with him—I subscribe to the same benefit lodge, the Beehive—I have been sick and taken round a petition to be signed to obtain me some benefits which Griffiths refused to sign—I did not tell him I would be even with him and do him an injury; I cannot say how long that is ago—I don't know that I said before the Magistrate that of my own knowledge I knew Griffiths was the second week before Fairweather at the south gate—I might; they didn't ask me that question—I believe Carter told me that the man who was at the south gate the second week before him had taken some tickets—I did not say who it was before the Magistrate; I would not tell a lie if I knew it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My reason for delaying giving information from the 23rd May till the 6th June was that I did not like to hurt my fellow-mates; I was going to state that just now—the matter of the paper I have spoken of relating to the lodge I rather think was last year; the head constable will tell you—I had no resentment against Griffiths.</p>

                  </hi>. I am head-constable to the London and St. Katherine Docks Company—it was the 5th June that Homeyard made a communica<lb/>tion to me; on the Monday, Bank holiday—it was the duty of the gate-keeper who took these tickets to bring them to my office every night, and I handed them on to Mr. Adamson, the engineer—on the 29th June, Griffiths would be the gatekeeper, on which day he returned to my office these twenty tiekets (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was also part of Griffiths's duty to make an entry in a book he kept for that purpose of the number of loads brought in, and I took this book from him on the 29th June (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that entry at the top of the page "29th June" is in his handwriting; "Thursday, 29th June, 1876, loads of rubbish brought in twenty, William Griffiths"—I com-pared the entry in the book with the account sent in by Carter to Adamson, and found the number of loads charged in the account corresponded with these tickets—I afterwards examined these tickets that Griffiths brought, and found eleven of them folded in a peculiar manner; the other nine appeared to be quite fresh—Griffiths was gatekeeper from May 8th till I May 13th; Fairweather the next week from the 15th to the 20th, and then I Homeyard, and then Rudkins, and then Prowse—Griffiths came on again I the week ending the 26th June—this is the book from the south gate—I can speak to my own knowledge as to the gatekeepers at the gates.</p>

I am employed by the London and St. Katherine Docks Company at the Victoria Docks—on Thursday, the 29th June, I was instructed to watch the south gate of the Victoria Docks I without being seen, in a shed—I could see the south gate from the shed, which I should say was 200 yards off—this was the road over which the carts taking rubbish for the purpose of filling, passed—I was there from 6 o'clock in the morning till 6 o'clock in the evening—eleven carts of rubbish went in at the south gate that day; I reported to Ellis the same evening, and I made an entry in a book at the time, which I gave to Ellis—that is the book (<hi rend="italic">produced);</hi> I marked the minute that each had passed in.</p>

I did not know what I was put there for except to watch—I wasn't by the gate, there is a swing bridge which is lifted up to let the ships go through—there" is. no shed between that one and the gate, only one shed—I am sure you can see the gate from the shed that I was in—there is nothing between—the engine-house is a little wide of it—it would not prevent your seeing the gate—the shed is 100 yards from the gate, it is about 40 or 50 yards from the nearest point of the road where I could watch the carts passing—I was inside the shed sometimes—I was there from 6 in the morning till 6 in the evening, I swear that I never left—I looked through the chinks of wood to see the carts pass—I was not there the day before—I passed it occasionally—I was there the day after—there is not much traffic along the road—when the swing bridge is up a good deal of traffic accumulates—after it is let down a good many carts have to come in and go out occasionally, not always—the carts going in the left side of the gate would go the left side of the road—the carts passing in, would pass the off side of the road, and those going out would pass nearest to me—I did not see any man in the shed on the Friday, and no horses during the whole day—I stood with my face to the chink, with <hi rend="italic">my</hi> eye watching from 6 in the morning till 6 in the evening—I went to the door sometimes—I spoke to no man there—I did not say to a man on the Friday afterwards that I wanted to go away, but could not go because my governors were near the gate—the shed is not divided, no horses in it, nothing of the kind—I did not notice any carts with the carter's names on them going in.</p>

I measured the distance from the shed to the gates—there is a long shed where horses are kept—you can discern something from the shed to the gate, but not anything that comes in the first gate because this shed intervenes at that gate "where this man stood—you can see the road along which the carts would pass—the nearest point of the road which Palmer could see from the shed is 57 yards—I have measured it from the crown of the road, the centre—there is a shed that intervenes between the place where Palmer would watch, and the gate—it is where they keep the cradle to take the dead—a mortuary you might call it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Brewhouse Lane, Greenwich, and am a coal porter—in the morning or midnight of the 17th July, I was standing in Billingsgate Dock, talking to a young woman, named Elizabeth Hudson, when both the prisoners came down the street, one on the path and the other in the middle of the road, when Strodt indecently insulted the young woman, and Oltaus called her a b——whore—the young <hi rend="italic">lady</hi> turned round and asked him what he called her that for, and then he insulted her by calling her so again—I asked him why he insulted the young woman, and he made use of the same expression to me—I asked him why he did so, and he come behind and kicks me off the path, which caused me to fall on my back, and Strodt jumped on my stomach—I laid there two or three minutes till I gathered myself up again—Oltaus jumped down and struck me, and I struck him and knocked him down—both of them were on at me—I struck them as long as could for about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, when I felt a knife plunged into my back by Oltaus—I hit on to them till they dragged me 20 or 30 yards, when I fell down from loss of blood, and I think Tasked the female to take off my coat—I became insensible, and they made their escape—I was taken to. The Seaman's Hospital—I still feel the effects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was well enough to appear before the Magistrate on the morning of the 19th—I stopped at the hospital for three or four days there had been a regatta or race on on the 17th, and I had not been to my work, but had taken part in it—I had not been successful in the match—there had been a little dancing and that sort of thing going on—I was suber—there was a little liquor going on—in the thoroughfare where</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187608080135"/>
               <p>this occurred there is the dock wall on one side, and houses on the other—I had been chatting with Hudson about a quarter of an hour—I had not known her before, merely picked her up for the night—I tossed up whether I should go home with her or not, and I was not to go home with her—I had not called out to her to give me my b——cap—there had been no dis-pute between us about a cap—some shingle was thrown up there—I had not retired with Hudson inside the gate close there—it is not the fact that Oltaus went inside for natural purposes, leaving Strodt outside, and that while he was waiting for his companion, Hudson went up and accosted him, and that he not being able to answer in English, she became a little bit rude to him—I struck Oltaus violently in the face after I got up from being kicked—we scuffled up and down the road for about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—he did not go up against the gates leading to Mr. Noakes' yard, or Mr. Allen's yard—I know the gates—I do not remember knocking his head against the wall, and his crying out "Oh, my poor head"—there is a gate into Mr. Wood's yard, but we were not up there—it is not protected with iron spikes—it is 10 yards too far up—I have been bred and born there—I have been in custody for having goods in my possession twice, and had seven days and two months, I believe—one was about some wood belonging to a gentleman named Andrews, and the other a little coal stolen from a barge in the Thames—I was locked up on suspicion—I have not been before the Magistrate on a charge of assault—my father gave me a month once for enlisting as a soldier—I might, after he knifed me, have run after them and said "Let me get at them, let me return it"—I don't remember following up and shouting out "Oh, you have got a stone in your hand" and their stopping and showing me they had no weapon in their hands—I don't know where the German ship Europa was lying that night—the road leads down to the Billingsgate Dock.</p>

I am single, and live at 3, Arthur's Row, Greenwich—I remember talking to the prosecutor about midnight, on the 17th July, and seeing the two prisoners—Strodt was in the road, and the other was on the path, and he went to make water, to tell you the truth, and began to behave indecently—I said You might go round the corner, not stand before a young <hi rend="italic">lady</hi>"—they asked me who I was talking to, and Oltaus called me a b——whore, and then Mr. Dyett turned round, and said "Who are you insulting?" and Oltaus turned round and knocked him in the road, and Strodt jumped on his stomach—upon my screaming, the other witnesses came up, and because I screamed Strodt knocked me in the mouth with the handle of a knife, and one tooth broke off and another went down my throat—I called out "Murder! help!" and the police came—I. heard Mr. Dyett say "I am stabbed, I am a dead man"—he was bleeding when the police came up, and he said to the other witnesses "Take off my coat"—the police took him into their charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had known Dyett before this for some time, and had keen with him ever since 3 o'clock that afternoon—I don't know of any arrangement or tossing up as to whether we should spend the night together—it is not the fact that one prisoner went inside the dock wall and left the other outside, and that I addressed him, and that in consequence of his not being able to answer me, the elder prisoner came out and stood waiting there for him—when we were together the struggle took place—it was about 11.40 when they first came up—it was about the time we came out the Music Hall together—it lasted till about 11.30.</p>

I am a widow, living at 6, Billingsgate Dock, Greenwich—I remember hearing a noise on the 17th July, about 11.40 or 11.45—I went out and saw Dyett struggling with the prisoner—my daughter wont out with me—we went in between them and took Dyett away—he said "Let me go, let me go, I must return this"—Oltaus knocked Dyett down and Strodt jumped upon his stomach—they ran away and Dyett followed them and they knocked him down again, and Strodt jumped upon his sto-mach again—Oltaus said "If you don't go away I will knife you," and Dyett said "I am stabbed"—Oltaus did something to Dyett's back directly he said "I will knife you"—they ran along the wood wall—I assisted Dyett up and ran and fetched his father, and we assisted him to the seamen's hospital.</p>

I am a surgeon at the Seamen's Hospital, Greenwich—at. a few minutes past midnight on 18th July Dyett was brought there—I did not see him till the following morning—I examined him and found he had a wound at the back of the left shoulder; it was a cut that went just through the skin and then extended between the skin and the muscle for about 4 inches; it did not go into the fleshy part of the body; it must have been inflicted with some force—it might have been inflicted by many things, not a sharp instrument, but a blunt instrument driven forcibly—it was such a wound as might have been caused by the point of a knife. <hi rend="italic">Witnesses for the Defence.</hi>

I am a waterman and live in Billingsgate Street, where I was standing when I see the two prisoners come up, and saw them making water—I afterwards saw Hudson; she said "That man you have been knocking about is my husband, I don't like to see that"—she stood there going on when Dyett was hitting the big man—"Oh," he said, "kick me, that is what you mean, do you?"—I thought he was going to knock his fist through his body; I was close alongside Dyett—I was not there when his coat was taken off; I went after the men—I heard Dyett say he was stabbed—I saw no weapon—I should say I went a quarter of a mile after the men; that would be the way that would take them to their ship lying in Deptford Dock—I asked which way they had gone, as I lost sight of them—I called out "Hi, hi! Is that the police?" they said; "We want our hats"—they remained till the police came—it would be possible that a man could be stabbed by going up against the spikes—it would rip you up altogether—the height of the gate is about up to my chest.</p>

I am house-surgeon at St. Thomas's Hospital—about 8.30 on the 9th July the prosecutor was brought to the hospital—I found that he was suffering from several punctured wounds about the body—one wound on the face was more of a scratch, and one on the arm—the chief wound was one in the lower left part of the abdomen, just above the hip; that wound penetrated the cavity and from it was protruding a small portion of the contents of the abdomen about the size of the top of one's finger; it was an absolute proof that the cavity of the abdomen had been entered; it was a very dangerous wound—he had two wounds near the middle line of the back, in the muscular structure of the back, not very deep; one wound in the interspace between the tenth and eleventh rib, that I also judged not to be penetrating; another one higher up on the left side of the back, and a small cut in front of the abdomen; that hardly did more than draw blood, it was quite superficial, and one penetrating wound of the left fore-arm—the majority of the wounds were over the region of vital parts; they would be caused by a small sharp-pointed knife, such as the blade of a largish sized penknife—I was shown the prosecutor's trowsers at the police-court, and found a cut which would correspond to the wound on the abdomen—to produce the wounds through the trowsers it would take considerable force.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "London, 22nd May, 1876, Messrs. Coutts &amp;Co., Strand, pay Mr. E. Joseph or order one hundred and ten pounds, Elcho.") Lord Elcho keeps an account at our bank—upon that cheque being presented to me I looked at it; I did not like its being on such thin paper, and I knew that Lord Elcho usually used our printed forma, at least that was my impression—I therefore imme<lb/>diately said "This cheque is not tilled up by Lord Elcho"—I believe <hi rend="italic">the</hi> prisoner is the person to whom I made that observation—he said "I will tell you about that; there was a sale of pictures on Saturday last, Mr. Joseph purchased some, and Lord Eloho has since bought one of Mr. Joseph"—I</p>

               <p>then doubted its being Lord Elcho's writing—I communicated with my principals, and was with them quite a quarter of an hour—afterwards I returned to the prisoner; he was still where I had left him—I said "Well, we cannot pay this cheque; we must communicate with Lord Elcho and Mr. Joseph before we can pay it, we will do so as speedily as possible and send up to Mr. Joseph—he said "Oh, very well," and left—we ascertained that it was not Lord Elcho's signature—I went out of town and did not see the prisoner until the 23rd of June at the Lambeth police-court, with three other prisoners—only one other prisoner was dressed similarly to himself—I picked him out readily; I believe him to be the man.</p>
