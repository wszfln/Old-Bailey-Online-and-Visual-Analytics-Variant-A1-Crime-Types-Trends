I am a widow and reside at 94, Abbey Street, Bormondsey, S.E. Saith: Ada Ellen Shackells White is my grand-daughter, and in December of 1903 was living with her mother, Mary Ellard, at No. 33, Hamilton Buildings, Long Lane, Borough. About a week before Christmas of above year James Carpenter, a man my daughter, Mary Ellard, was living with, brought Michael O'Connor to my fruit stall, at the corner of Denman Street, between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. and said, 'This is Ada's young man.' I replied, 'Why, Carpenter, she is a married woman; you can't walk out with her neither can you many her,' turning to O'Connor. Michael O'Connor, replied, 'I don't care; I will take her and marry her, and will look after her.' I replied, 'If you do, you will get into trouble over it' He replied, 'I don't care,' and walked away with Carpenter. I next saw Michael O'Connor on or about the 23rd of December, 1903, when he called with Ada about 1 a.m. I came down and opened the street door, when O'Connor stated that James Carpenter had turned her out, and won't let her sleep there any more. I then took Ada in and gave her a bed. The following evening O'Connor called at my house and asked for Ada. I said, 'You are carrying on a fine game with my grand-daughter, you will find it will end very serious. You are leading her astray informing her that you can marry her when you know that she does not know whether he is dead. O'Connor then replied, 'It is all right, I shall marry her.' Ada came up to us at this remark, and she replied, 'Oh, Mike, don't get me in trouble, because I am married. I have not seen my husband for two years, and I don't know if he is dead or alive.' O'Connor then said, 'Come along, Ada, you will be all right; you will never see your husband any more.' They then both left the house. On the morning of February 1st, 1904, O'Connor called at my house, and said, 'Is Ada ready? I asked him in the pas<lb/>sage, and said, 'You are going to do a nice thing for yourselves.' He replied, 'She will be all right, don't worry; it is nothing to do with you.' He then called out, 'Ada, are you ready?' and they both left the house to get married at St. James' Church, Bermondsey. I followed shortly after to the church and found that they had been married"—he said, "That is all right," or "Quite right"—the prisoner was charged and made no reply—I obtained the marriage certificate of Harry Shackells White and Ada Ellen Ellard before the registrar at Romford on September 1st, 190I—the witnesses were Mary Gibbs and J. A. Ellard—I also obtained the certificate of marriage on February 1st, 1904, between Michael O'Connor and Ada Ellen Ellard at St. James, Church, Bermondsey, and the witness James Ellard was present.</p>

Did her get the hump because I hadn't written, and is she getting jealous? Well, you may, for I far away prefer Miss Simpson, and the quicker you get a divorce the better we shall be pleased you know the divorce I mean. If I were you I should stay where you are for a bit, or at least till they give you a hint to go, for there you are among friends and safe, besides saving your money and I mine. If you are bent on leaving, you shall come to Aldershot as soon as I get there. I saw Cowley last night; at least, he came to barracks to fetch a pair of boots I promised him and to get a pint. I treated him to the whiskey and soda; he hasn't treated me since. I knew him and I asked</p>

               <p>him if he would have you down there for a month or two and he said they would be only too pleased. You see, the reason I asked him was that when I leave England I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that you are in good hands and I should also know where to write to for certain, and where nobody could come and worry you, for no one need know where you were except Cato's, and they wouldn't tell anyone. It may be another six weeks before I can get away, but all in good time. Slow but sure, you know, like the tortoise and the hare (not the one you eat). It is a good job you haven't heard from home; they will do you no good and don't want you. Have you got your clothes with you? If not, get them so that if you come with me to Aldershot, or when you come down here your mother won't know where you are. Get everything were you are now, and if I were you I would cut myself off from her altogether and have nothing whatever to do with her. She has lost all claim of mother to you, and besides, being known to all the people of Trying for what she really is, they won't think one quarter of you so much as if you kept away from her. Perhaps as you haven't heard from her she has done what she told me she would do; that is, take a flat in the West End If so, she won't let you know where she is. I wish that I was with you to-night just to celebrate November 9th, 1902. Now mind and be care<lb/>ful of your money and not spend it in waste, as you never know what might happen"—I never saw this letter: "Caterham, 28.11.04. My dear Owen,—Thanks very much for your long letter, which I received this afternoon, so I expect it is a day and a half post. It's a bad job about you, don't you think so, quickly getting rid of all the good things I give you, so if it occurs again 1 shan't give you any more (mind that). I have quite made up my mind to do what I told you, but I don't know when it will come off, not before I get a month's leave so as to get clear. I don't know yet when I go to Aldershot; sometime yet, I expect, as the superintendent is still on leave. I don't expect your ma will come down and kick up a row; if she does I would take no notice of her, and not see her. Ethel Kingham would be your sister in-law, not cousin. I am glad you are happy down there, but are you still looking out for a job? Don't forget, my girl, if ever you get into trouble of any description come at once to me, don't matter where I am, and I will look after you. Don't you sometimes wish I were with you in the bed?

I am a akin dresser, of 94, Chapman Road, Hackney Wick, and I am employed by Mr. Peachy, a farmer, of Chilman's Farm Hackney Marshes—on March 21st I met Lotcho, who asked me to get the pony and cart to take some stuff up to a rag shop, and to give him a hand—he lives in the neighbourhood, and I know him by sight—I took the pony and cart, and went with him to a heap of dung—concealed in it was a bag which contained copper wire—we put it on to the cart together, and 1 drove him to Wood's shop—he is a marine store dealer, of 35, Leytonstone Road—Lotcho asked me to lift the bag up, and he took it on his back, went into the shop, and put it on to the scale—Wood came in almost directly, and took the weight of it—it weighed throe quarters, fourteen pounds—Wood paid Lotcho £1in gold, 12s. and some odd coppers—I got Is. for my trouble and the loan of the cart.</p>

If you want to search you can do so"—I searched, but found nothing—at 9 p.m. the next day I went there and told him I was still making inquiries about the copper wire and that I had reason to behave that he had another shed—he said, "No, sir, you are mis<lb/>taken</p>

While you are here you had better look at the shed"—we had a look at the shed, and, failing to find anything else we left—at 12.30 pan the next day I went there with P.O. Stacey another officer, and I said to him, "We are still making inquiries about that wire, and we have reason to believe that you have received that wire"—h said, "No, I tell you again I have not had it"—I then sent for the two witnesses, Peachy and Barnes, and in his presence they said, indicating him, "That is the man who purchased wire on several occasions from Page, Brooks and Lotcho"—I said to Wood, "Now I must caution you. I am going to arrest you for feloniously receiving a quantity of copper wire, and I shall take you to the Victoria Park police station"—he said, "You have made a mistake; it is a put-up job. There is a spite against me because I refused to buy their stock some time ago"—I took him to the police station, where all the prisoners were put in the dock and charged—Wood said, "I plead not guilty. I know nothing about it. I have not had it"—Brooks said, pointing to Wood, "To save any further trouble, he did buy it, and gave us 4d. a pound for it"—Lotcho, also pointing to Wood, said, "He knew. it was stolen property and gave us 4d. a pound for the first lot, and 3 1/2 d. a pound for the second lot"—Page made no reply—on searching Wood I found a small book showing entries of goods purchased, which was handed to the Magistrate marked "A"—I think there is one receipt in it for metal.</p>

I live at 37, Compton Street, Church Street, and am a leather cutter—the deceased was my wife—we occupied two rooms at that address on the second floor—I have two daughters living with me, Mary and Elizabeth, and a married daughter, Mrs. Cooper, who lives away—I first made the prisoner's acquaintance about four or five years ago—he became engaged to my daughter Mary—he was in a Militia regiment, and went to the war about February, 1902—he was away for about nine months, and when he returned towards the end of 1902 I saw him from time to time, and was quite friendly with him—he continued to be engaged to my daughter until it was broken off soon after Christmas, 1904—I was present when it was broken off, and also my daughter and wife—my daughter said she did not like to go out with him if he attended boxing clubs—he seemed to take it all right—I saw him perhaps once or twice a week after that—he called to see me—I saw him, I think, on Friday, March 3rd—he appeared to be all right and friendly—I went and had a glass of ale with him, and parted friendly—that night we were all <hi rend="italic">abed</hi> about 12.30—we heard a noise on the landing—I got out of bed, and saw the prisoner on the landing—he did not lodge in the house—I said, "Halloa, Alf, what are you doing here at this time of night? Your place is at home, not coming here and frightening me out of my life. You have been drinking; why don't you go home to your right place?"—my wife was there, and the prisoner wanted me to light the gas, which I would not—he said, "All right, then, I will see you to-morrow"—next morning I went to work in the usual way, and just before two o'clock I was fetched from the works to go home—I heard my wife was dead—I did not see her—I was asked if I would see her, but was advised not to.</p>

I have been walking about all night in Islington and passed several policemen, and saw about this on the papers. I am ready to swing when the time comes."</p>

                  </hi>. I am Deputy-Coroner for Central London—on March 8th I was present at an inquest opened by Mr. Danford Thomas on the body of Mrs. Ballard—I saw the prisoner sworn as a witness—he was cautioned that any evidence he gave, would be taken down in writing—he elected to give evidence—I took down what he said and read it over to him, and he signed it (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "I am aged twenty-two years, and am a labourer. I live at 4, Dyott Street, St. Giles. I am a labourer and have been in the Militia. I at once admit inflicting the injuries that caused Mrs. Ballard's death. The cause of this matter was not for the murdered woman keeping me from her daughter, for as determined as I was to murder her, so was I determined to keep away from the girl. I came out from doing a month's imprisonment, and while I was in there, I heard that the murdered woman had inquired when I was coming out, and when she heard I was coming out she turned round and said to somebody who knows her well, 'Let the bastard stop there.' Before I heard this I was on good terms with the woman on account of her being good to me when I was out of work for five weeks. Her husband happened to fall out of work later on and I stuck to them, trying to lift them up and find him work. Those who told me that, can speak up if he likes. Well, I got myself ready to start work on the Mon<lb/>day, and got my clothes out and bought myself out of the Militia, £4, before I earned it. Before that I had heard what the woman had called me was a bastard. I said, 'When I am done with work I will kill her.' In answer to the Coroner, I have no question to ask the witnesses; what they have said is correct."</p>

               <p>for paying my men—I was living at that time at 8, Hendon Park Villas, and had been lodging there since a week after Christmas—since Christmas I was always in the habit of carrying this bag of money on Saturday mornings to pay the men—I sometimes might vary about ten minutes in the time, but it was always on the same day of the week—I used to get the money on the Friday evening and take it to my lodgings, bringing it to work next morning—I worked at the Golder's Hill Tube Station, which is north of the crematorium—my route every morning would be along Finchley Road—on this morning I was walking towards London to my way from the north as usual—it was a windy and blowy morning, and I had my open umbrella in one hand and my bag in the other—opposite the crematorium Brown passed me—I just turned my umbrella on one side in case I should collide with him and I saw him for a few seconds—the next thing I knew was that I was struck—I did not see him turn round—I was knocked insensible, and I now know that Stratton came up and took me to the place marked "Tube Works "on the plan, which is not far from the cross roads—I have been attended since by the sur<lb/>geon—the next day I went to the Albany Street police station, where I saw a row of about twelve men, from whom I picked out Brown at once as the man who had struck me, and I say now that he is the man—it was a brown leather bag, and the money was in two paper bags marked like this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>).</p>

The prisoner, who goes by the name of Brown, is my brother; that is the name he went under on account of not disgracing my father and mother; he has been called Brown before—I am married and live at 105, Bemerton Street, Caledonian Road, King's Cross, and am a painter—I was living there on March 11th, and my brother was lodging with us—he was arrested on March 12th, about 1 a.m., and we were both taken to the police station—they never charged me with robbing Lewis—they never told me what we were charged for—in the evening I made a statement to the police as to what I knew about Lewis—on the Friday evening, I think a week before March 11th, it may have been in a public-house, or at home, he said to me he was going to do a job at Golder's Hill—I do not think there was anybody else present at the time—he said he was going to rob a navy foreman of a bag—of course he did not know how much money was in it, but he said that it contained money that was going to pay the navvies at the Tube, and that some<lb/>body else put him up to it—I said, "Pray, Bob, don't go"—he said a man named Hinton was going with him—I saw him the next morn<lb/>ing and he said he could not do it on account of two navvies being behind this man—I said nothing more to him then—the next I heard of it was the afternoon of the Friday before March 11th—he did not say anything to me until I saw Marshall, the other prisoner, call him out of a public house between 9 and 10 p.m.—I was in there with him—I did not go out with him—my brother came back again alone and said, "Me and Billy is going to do it," meaning Marshall—Hinton had been arrested two or three days before this—my brother asked me to call him at 4.30 the next morning, but I refused to do so, and he said he would not come in all night—he came in with me to have supper about 10 p.m., and afterwards he went out—I do not think there was anything said about this at supper—I saw him next between 4.20 and 4.30 next morning—I was waiting for him to come in; I could not rest—I was looking out of the window and</p>

               <p>I heard him come upstairs and I said to my <hi rend="italic">missus</hi>, "There he comes, thank God"—I was very upset at the time—he came in and sat in the armchair—I said to my wife in his hearing, "I think he has had a drop of tea," by that we mean beer, "If he goes to sleep let him"—he kept looking at the clock, and about 4.40 a.m. he went over to call on Marshall on the opposite side of the road, No. 66—I was looking out of the window, and I saw him go over there and knock at his door, and Marshall came out and went round by the stables with him—they went round the corner of the street to the stables—I could not see the entrance to the stables from where I was—I then saw them come driving by the place up Bing<lb/>field Street, about fifteen or twenty minutes afterwards—they turned round by the Pembroke Castle towards Camden Town northwards—my house is about ten minutes' walk from Kings Cross—I know Marshall's pony which he was driving—it is a brown one, but I did not notice what marks it had on it; I was too much upset by my brother to take any notice of them—it was an ordinary costermonger's cart—I had not seen it before; it was the first time I had noticed it coming out—I know Mar<lb/>shall drives that pony and curt with Joe Beach in the ordinary way—between 7 and 7.30 a.m. my brother came in and said he had done the job, and slung about £40 in gold and silver on the bed; he said he had hit the man on the neck with a bar of iron; he never intended to hit the man at the back there, but meant to hit him on the leg—he said, "We hit him with a bar of iron"—I know this iron bar (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), but he did not say he had hit him with that—the first time I saw it, was on the Friday evening that he and Marshall went out of my brother's room, but I did not know where it came from—he said, "He got up of his knees and tried to come after me; I jumped in Marshall's cart"—that is as far as I can remember what he said when he came home—of course, I was a bit upset—he did not tell me anything more about it at any other time—he gave me two sovereigns in the afternoon, and I did not ask him where he had got it; I guessed—that morning the bar of iron was not in my house—he said he was sorry, but they had left it behind.</p>

I am a general dealer, of 23, Risinghill Street, Penton<lb/>ville, and have worked in partnership with Marshall—we used a pony and cart in the business, which we hired from a Mr. Green, at 5s. a week—I drove it to the Albany Street police station on March 12th, with Mr. Powell—the pony is a chestnut mare, with a white star on the forehead and a splash of white on the off-side of the nose, and two white marks on the hind fetlocks—it is stabled at the corner of Freeling Street, Cale<lb/>donian Road, which runs into Bemerton Street—the yard is mostly locked up at night, but the stable is always open—I have got a key of the yard, but there is no key to the stable—Marshall had the key of the yard on Friday night, March 10t—between 7 and 7.30 p.m. I saw the pony bedded down, Charley Rich and Marshall being with me at the time—at 7.45 p.m. Marshall bid me good-night at his lodgings—I made an arrangement to meet him at the Midland Railway sheds about 7 the next morning—I got there about 7.45 a.m., but Marshall was not there—I met him at the Great Northern sheds—I thought he had mis<lb/>understood me, so I went there—it is more than 500 yards off—you have to cross in front of Midland Street and Great Northern Street, and turn up York Road to the left, to get there—it would be about 8.20 or 8.30 a.m. when I met him—the pony looked wet, because it had been raining very hard, and I noticed the reins had not been done up in the proper way—they were put through single rings instead of the double rings—I said to Marshall, "Who harnessed the pony?"—he said, "I did"—I said, "Why did you not do the bit ap properly?"—he said, "Look how pouring <hi rend="italic">heavens hard</hi> of rain it was"—I noticed the traces also were not done up level; they were longer one side than the other—I also noticed that the pony seemed to go a bit sluggish, which I put down to the traces not being level and it had a nasty cold at the time—I left Marshall on the Great Northern, and I went and cleared half a ton of potatoes with the pony and cart—about 9.30 p.m. the same day I said to Marshall, "The pony went very sluggish. What do you say to giving him a bran mash?"—he said, "Well, I will give him a good rest to<lb/>morrow "—he gave me £1 0s. 6d. and we bid one another good-night.</p>

I live at 32, Rochford Street, Kentish Town, and am a pony driver at the Tube Works, Golder's Hill—at 5 a.m. on March 11th I left home to go to work in company with Bullard—we went <hi rend="italic">up East Heath Road to get there—about 5.30 a.m. in East Heath Road</hi> I noticed a chestnut pony and a cart with two men in it—the pony had a</p>

I am working in partnership with Joe Beach. I used to own a pony, but I sold it to Mr. Green, Arlington Road, Camden Town, for six guineas. Since that time Beach and I have hired it from Green with a barrow and harness, for 5s. per week. We rent a stall in a stable at the corner of Freeling Street and Bemerton Street. On Friday evening I left some time between 7 and 8 p.m. Before leaving him it was arranged that I should meet him at the Great Northern of Midland Potatoe Market at, I think, 7 a.m. on Saturday. It might have been 7.30, and I am not certain which potato market he said I was to meet him at first. I cannot say what time it was when I got up on Satur<lb/>day morning, 11th inst., but it was dark. I did not look at the time. As soon as I got up I had a wash and then went and fed the pony. I believe this was before 7 o'clock, but how much, it is impossible for me to say. It might have only been a very few minutes, and it is possible it was after 7. It is impossible for me' to say accurately. I had no light in the stable; it was light enough for me to see what I wanted to do. There are no windows in the stable; they are all broken, and some sacks are nailed up there to keep the draught out. After feeding it I went back home and told the landlady I would have my breakfast after harnessing the pony. I then returned to the stable, harnessed the pony, put it in the barrow, and went and had my breakfast. I did not notice that the pony was wet. If it was I should not have taken any notice of it, as it is in the habit of kicking the bedding from underneath and laying in its own water. Sometimes it rolls over and gets smothered. After having had my breakfast I drove to the Great Northern Potatoe Market, which is five minutes' drive, and waited there about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before Beach arrived. I do not know what time he arrived, and if he says it was half-past eight I should not dispute it. I know I had only been there about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes when he arrived. As we could not buy any potatoes to suit us it was arranged that Beach should go to Enfield New Town station, and take half a ton of potatoes from there to Mr. Hieber, High Barnet, which he agreed to do. I did not go with him as I had rheumatism in the ankle, and I had to wait to see if there were any potatoes cowing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190504030057"/>
               <p>up from the country. I did not see Beach again until about 10 o'clock on Saturday night. I have known Bob Fitts for some years. I also know that his brother lives almost opposite me. I last saw him (Bob) last Thursday or Friday, I did not speak to him, but nodded. I was present this afternoon when he was identified. If he took out my pony and barrow on Saturday morning, he did so unknown to me. I did not let it out to anyone on Saturday morning. Mrs. Pegg is my landlady."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—he is a boiler-maker, and a most sober and respectable man—I have been married to him for fourteen years—since about eight years ago he said I was giving him poison in his food—he was really bad—I went to the police station with him, and he accused me there of poisoning him—there was no truth in it—before March 24th last he had not been well—that day I went to Dr. Debenham because my husband was very restless and could get no sleep—he followed me in what I was doing and could not stop watching me—he ate his breakfast, and after that he accused me of poisoning him, rinsing his mouth out, gurgling, and wringing his hands—that was about 10 a.m., after he was up and had had his breakfast—I asked him what it was for—he said, "To wash the poison out"—he went out for half</p>

               <p>an hour or an hour in the morning, but except for that he never left me—he was with me while I was preparing dinner, walking up and down, but he would not eat his dinner—he said it was poisoned—I cleared the dinner away, and we sat down on the sofa, trying to have a little sleep, with his arms round my waist—I said, "A little sleep will do us both good"—he was very affectionate—there was no quarrel—we never had any quarrel—he never raised his hand to me till then, when we were sitting with his head on my shoulder, but all at once I felt a knife in my throat—I did not see it—I screamed; I slipped on to the floor; I could not get up—we have rooms in Mrs. Cook's house—she is the land<lb/>lady, and she came and said, "What is this? What is this?"—my husband got up in an instant, left me, and stood still—I went downstairs and ran to the nearest doctor—I knew there was nothing fatal—the landlady ran for a policeman—the doctor stitched my throat up—when I slipped on to the floor my husband was still trying to cut my throat—he had his arm round my neck—he took hold of my chin and pulled my head back, but I put my hands up to my throat—my fingers were cut—I am sure he did not know what he was doing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was always a good and affectionate husband—I have lived happily with him except for his delusions—I have done the best I could for him—the doctor told me eight years ago to humour him and said he would never get better—my husband said something about what he thought I had done and that he had forgiven me, and hoped that it would not happen again—both eight and six years ago he accused me, then he got better and then went on about the same; still, I had no fear that he would hurt me—at intervals he had these things on his mind—on the day of this occurrence when I put his vegetables on his plate he said, "Let me have yours"—he thought mine would be all right, but he did not eat it—he has frequently done that—at meal times or immediately after breakfast that idea was most pronounced—when we were resting after dinner we were expecting Dr. Debenham, he said he was not going to work—the doctor said he would call—the knife is an ordinary pen knife, an old one, and the point was broken—I did not see it, but I know it was his knife—he was taken bad about a week be<lb/>fore this happened—he became mad after reading in the papers that a man he had worked with and had known for years had committed suicide on the Wednesday or Thursday week previous, by cutting his throat—he said, "I cannot realise it," and subscribed to the collection for the widow—one delusion was that his nephew in South Africa and I were trying to get him out of the way in order to get his property—that delusion came on suddenly—he told it to the police and I heard of it—he asked Mrs. Cook's daughters what their door was closed for—I asked him to go and open it and look in, but he would not do that—I heard that he had said I had locked a man in the room for the purpose of taking his life and that I had been to get a man next door to help him take his life—he never said that to me—only that morning he said I had been poisoning him—he would not take the doctor's medicine—and he said there was poison in that—he said, "If it is good for me it</p>

               <p>is good for you; if you will take a dose I will take one after you"—I took a dose, but he would not take any—he did not mention the word "poison"—he has never raised a finger against me—he has always borne a good character and his discharges from ships were very good.</p>

I have only got twenty-four"—I came upstairs to count them and I counted twenty-four on the kerb—I noticed there were some empty crates by the side of the window close to the wall, which had been brought back by the prisoner's van—I did not inspect those at all at that time—I then went downstairs and sent him up four more.</p>

He put his hands up and made a dart and I let go," meaning he fired—I saw marks of blood on the passage and down the street—the gun was standing in the kitchen—it had been recently discharged.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector P.</hi>) About 5.30 on February 23rd I saw the prisoner at Knight's Hill police station—I cautioned him when I read the charge to him—he made this statement to me shortly afterwards: "My wife took some of my things away and we had a few words over them. She then left home and went to live with my daughter, Kate Barrett. A fortnight last Saturday Fairbank and another man got into my house and when I came home he took off his coat and wanted to fight me. At a quarter to twelve last night I was in bed when I heard some<lb/>one knocking at the door. I called out and Camplin shouted, 'Come and see.' I was afraid of him. He tried to push the front door open. I heard him say to someone outside, 'I will put his b—light out'.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190504030071"/>
               <p>I got my gun and when I unlocked the door I rushed behind the table in the kitchen. He followed me. I told him if he came nearer I should stop him. He made a dart under the table, and, thinking he was going to catch hold of my leg, I shot him and the candle went out"—after that I went to the premises and found spots of blood leading from the path outside the house into the passage of the house through the passage into the kitchen, on the right-hand side of the kitchen, and half way along the back of the kitchen—I found shot marks on the table covered by a pool of blood, on a chair just inside the kitchen door and on the side of the passage immediately outside close to the floor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I know both the prosecutor and the prisoner—the prisoner has been convicted once for assault in company with the prosecutor—the prosecutor, I believe, has been convicted some six times—the family are all fairly respectable people, but the men give way to drink and become quarrelsome.</p>

                  </hi>; I am a registered medical practitioner at 42, Central Hill, Norwood—at 1.30 a.m. on February 23rd I saw the prosecutor at the Cottage Hospital, Norwood—he was suffering from gunshot wounds on his right forearm—it was severely lacerated—on his left hand there were several smaller shot wounds and there was one shot wound on his chin—the skin was blackened, showing the gun was fired at rather close range.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> it must have been within a few feet—I did not notice that he smelt of drink.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> As far as I could see, he was sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence on oath, said that the prosecutor was very rough in his conversation; that he ran in after him, saying he (the prisoner) could do what he b—well pleased; that he (the prisoner) took the gun in his hand and fired it to frighten him, but had no intention of hurting him. He received a good character.</hi>
