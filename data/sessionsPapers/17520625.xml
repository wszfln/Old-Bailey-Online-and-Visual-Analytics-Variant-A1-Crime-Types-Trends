I went down into the cellar, there I saw five parcels of lead rolled up, there was 162 pounds weight of it, we could not find any Tools.

            . I am a watchman in Cow-lane; after I had beat my rounds on Thursday morning. coming up to my stand about a quarter after 2 o' clock, turning to go into St. John's court, there stood a Man about ten yards from a cellar window: he said, come-up, but he pushed off directly. I saw a head out at the window, and he saw me, and drawed back again. I said I'll have a knock at you. Then we got the key and went to the house. The rest as the other two, with this addition. The prisoner said he and the other Man that ran away came there to sleep, and that a brewer's servant found another piece of lead in the street, which was compared also and fitted as the rest.</p>

               <p>John Alien. I saw my shop shut up about 10 o'clock at night, the 25th of Feb. It is part of my dwelling house. My servant called me up about four; I found my shutter had a hole cut in it so as to get in a hand. It was fastened with two iron pins within side. I missed four silver watches, one of them had a shagreen outside case, a hanger mounted with silver, a silver salt, and two silver tea spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen them last?</p>
               <p>Alien. I saw them over night about 8 o'clock, they hung on small hooks in the window. I advertised them twice ; after the second time some body knocked at my door, my servant open'd it, and in going to shut it there lay two of the dial plates to two of the watches. Produced in court and sworn to, having the maker's name upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to suspect the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Alien. One Mr. Philipson had taken him up on some other account ; he brought him to me, there he confessed, and also before Justice Chamberlaine that he put these plates at my door; that he and another person cut the hole in the shutter, and took the things mentioned, and that the salt had a crest on it, for which reason he beat it, and the silver hilt to pieces, and sold them in several places.</p>

            , The prisoner was in New-prison about a fortnight or three weeks ago. He desired me try to get Justice Chamberlaine to admit him an evidence, telling me he had broke open this gentleman's shop, and that he had pawned the watches in Grubstreet. I went and acquainted the Justice with it: he gave me an order to take him out of New-prison and go with him to where the watches were pawned. So I and the keeper went with him to the house of Mr. Belomey; the prisoner asked for the shagreen watch which he had pawned in his own name for 7 s. 6 d. He brought the watch down, and we paid for it. Then he asked for a silver watch in another name, that was also produced; then we told the pawnbroker he had broke open a shop and stole them, and if he'd go along with us he might be satisfied about it. Then the prisoner took us to Mr. Alien's house, we asked him if his house had been broke open, he said, yes, and that he should know the goods he lost could he see them. We shewed him the 2: watches, he owned them. Then Mr. Alien asked the prisoner how he could do such a thing ; he answered, the watchman was coming by once in the time, and that he stood with his back to the hole that he might not discover it.</p>

               <p>I asked the keeper of the prison if he would buy such things, for they told me I should be either hanged or transported for what I was taken up for. He went to the pawnbrokers and looked at the watches ; he said he knew they were stole by the advertisement, so he carried me to the prosecutor's house; he wanted me to be evidence against another young lad: I cleared him. I found these two watches in Spittlefield's market tied up in a handkerchief.</p>

They laid down their arms on the beach as usual. There was a boat brought tubs and oilskin bags from a cutter, which were thrown on the shore, and the men loaded their horses with them. The tubs were half anchors of brandy. I went for one for my master, that was brandy. I went away before the rest.</p>

There were 14 or 15 of them at our house armed in general with pieces slung across them. The prisoner had a piece flung when he went away towards the sea, which was on the 11th about 12 o'clock, having an account brought that the cutter was come in; there were others at Royal's house went with them.</p>

I went out of town the 21st of May for Dorsetshire ; when I returned on the 24th I was told my box was gone, and it was found in the Park in a pond, and two letters in it directed to me, by which means it was brought to my lodgings. The prisoner was gone out to dress a dinner on the prince of Wales's birth-day. When he returned I had him taken up; the constable found 66 guineas in a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175206250006"/> purse in his pocket.

The prisoner had several times been at my shop; after which we had missed some vierges; we having a suspicion of him laid a trap for him by counting what were in the box. I had counted them on his account on the third of this instant, but before he came on the 5th that number was altered; he came about seven in the morning under pretence of buying vierges as before. My servant called me down stairs; he had bolted him in, and said, there is the man that has got some of your vierges. Then I collared him, and said, you are the chap that has robbed me several times before (I believe I had lost a gross in a week.) He denied it boldly, so I sent for a constable. There were two dropped down under him, and one fell on the compter; that one I don't charge him with. We found a hole in his waistcoat pocket through which they must have passed, in the lining of which there were 15. (Produced in court and deposed to.)</p>

            . The prisoner came to my master's to buy some vierges about seven or eight o'clock the 5th of this month. I knew him before by his coming; he used to sell my master vierges; I shewed him some, and turned them out as usual on a paper for him to chuse; he said there were none of the height he wanted. Another person came into the shop that wanted some other things ; I went to serve him; the prisoner had got the paper in his hand to pour them into the box which he then held in his hand; I saw him pour some aside and shut his hand; I did not see him put them into his pocket; he was going out, but I bolted the door and called my master down. I had counted them over night, there were ten dozen and two in the box. I counted them in the box; at this time there were eight dozen and eight. My master sent for the constable, and he searched him; there were found 15 in the lining of his waistcoat pocket, two dropped on the floor, and one on the compter, which made up just the number.</p>

               <p>James Mills. I happened to go into the chamberlain's office between one and two on the second of June; coming out again the prisoner was between Mr. Pilgrim and I; I, being behind, saw him run his hand into Mr. Pilgrim's pocket and take out his handkerchief. When I detected him he threw it down on the ground. The prisoner wanted to run away. Mr. Pilgrim came back and owned it, I had it in my hand when he came back. He insisted that the prisoner had taken it, but he denied it. I believe I laid it upon his hand.</p>

               <p>As I was going home I saw several people going into Guildhall, so I went, thinking to pass a quarter of an hour there. They were making free several young men. The office was ordered to be cleared ; a great number went out together ; going down stairs there lay a red handkerchief, and I was going to pick it up, but a man said, it is none of your's, and I said, it is none of your's; he then said, I suppose you picked somebody's pocket of it. A gentleman came out and said, you ought to carry him to the alderman, because a gentleman has lost several bank notes in a pocket book. Then this gentleman said he had lost his handkerchief ; so they took me before alderman Chitty, and he asked the man whether he was a housekeeper, and he said he lived in Bear-and-Ragged-staff-yard Whitechapel. I sent a person there, who said no such person lived in that place.</p>

            . I keep a haberdasher's shop. The prisoner came to my house the 9th of June about nine in the morning for some children's apron strings. She bid me half price, after which she went out of my shop into Mr. Finch's. I went to see what she wanted to buy, having a mistrust of her, and made an excuse to change a guinea. I saw her take up that parcel and go out. I went after her and took it from under her arm, and led her back.</p>

I suppose by my turning up my coat he saw my watch, which he demanded, but I was unwilling to part with it. (My wife pushed forwards.) He thrust the point of his sword against my rib, and fearing it would have went through my cloaths, I took hold of it with both hands, and argued with him in a soft manner, saying, I had more money in my left hand pocket, which I would give him if he would not have the watch. I strove to break his sword, but he was too much for me. He pulled his sword out of my hands, and tumbled backwards down the hill, and I fell a little on one side. He recovered and attacked me again for my watch, holding the point of his sword towards me. Then I pulled the watch out of my pocket, which he took and ran away with. I saw him as he ran the best part of the field with the watch in his hand. I advertised the watch, and Mr. Walbank. a pawnbroker, sent for me the very day I advertised it, being the 9th of May.</p>

I saw him afterwards standing with his back against the rails that we were to go through. He held down his head and drew his sword by degrees, saying, I want your money, give me your money, as fast as he could speak, and pointed his sword to my husband's breast. I expected nothing but murder. I pushed on, and went three fields before I found any body. I did not see the robbery committed, but am sure this is the very man that stopped us.</p>

               <p>Dorothy Philips, On the 11th of Aug. I lost the goods mentioned. I had information she had been seen in my room: I took her up near the Meuse gate ; there she told me she took the things, and sold the handkerchiefs and pawned the petticoat in Masham street, near the Horse ferry. I went and saw it there. It is there now.</p>

               <p>William Norton. The chaise to the Devises having been robbed two or three times, as I was informed, I was desired to go in it to see if I could take the thief, which I did. On the 3d of June, about half an hour after one in the morning, I got into the post chaise, the post boy told me the place where he had been stopped was near the <placeName id="t17520625-20-crimeloc95">half way house between Knightsbridge and Kensington</placeName>

(He produced the tinderbox) I said don't frighten us, I have but a trifle, you shall have it. Then I said to the gentlemen, there were three in the chaise, give him your money, &amp;c. I took out a pistol from my coat pocket, and from my breeches pocket a five shilling piece and a dollar, and held the pistol concealed in one hand and the money in the other. I held the money pretty hard, he said, put it in my hat. I let him take the five shilling piece out of my hand: As soon as he had taken it I snap'd my pistol at him, it did not go off; he staggered back, and held up his hands, and said, O

             Lord. I jump'd out of the chaise, he ran away and I after him about 6 or 700 yards, and there took him: I hit him a blow on his back, he begged for mercy on his knees. I took his neckcloth off and tied his hands with it, and brought him back to the chaise; then I told the gentlemen in the chaise that was the errand I came upon, and wished them a good journey, and brought the prisoner to London.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him in the pursuit?</p>

I drove the post chaise, I took Mr. Norton in the chaise at Hide Park Corner, and told him if we did not meet the highwayman between Knightsbridge and Kensington, we should not meet him at all. I saw him coming, and said, he is coming, get the pistol ready. He came up to the chaise, and said, your money, make haste, your money. I heard the pistol snap. the prisoner said, O lord, and ran away and Norton after him. and took him.</p>

I missed 300 yards of ribband and upwards, two sheets that we lay in, one pair of stockings, a pretty large quantity of thread, buttons, and other things.

            . Between 12 and one last Friday was 7 night at night, the two prisoners at the bar and I went to the prosecutor's house, Lane got over the pales, Burgen next, and I next. Lane took three or four panes of glass out of the window, we could not get in there; then we got up on the roof of the house, Lane got up first, and handed the tiles to me, and I to Burgen. Burgen had a great stick, which he handed up to Lane, who punched a hole through the ceiling, and called to me, saying, you have done nothing, you ought to come and jump in, which I did, after pulling off my clothes. Then I unbolted the back door and let them in. Then I went over the pales again, and three stood and watched, fearing any body should come. Then I put on my clothes, and they rifled the house, and took away ribbands and all sorts of hardware, some mettle Buckles, and a great many knives. Burgen hid some in a hay cock, some were taken upon us; we were all taken together. There were two pair of scissars sold to a person in Chick-lane. I confessed the whole, and was admitted an evidence. Burgen confessed he was concerned in it before the justice.</p>

            . Richard Lane is my brother, he brought this bundle (producing a handkerchief well filled with hard-ware) and left them at my house, saying, he would call for them. He came no more; I was out on business, there came two gentlemen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175206250011"/> to inquire for a parcel in a red and white handkerchief, in which they said were ribbands and hardware; and I was told there was an officer gone for. I was afraid I should come into trouble, so I took them without opening them to a lane beyond Islington, and put them down by a bank side among some nettles and left them. I believe this to be the same bundle by the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. How came you by that bundle?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. A gentleman and his wife walking out for the air found them in the place where this evidence said she hid them. They hearing a shop had been robbed they left them at the Angel. I was sent for, and there I found them, they are my property.</p>

We came back again, I was very much in liquor; then he asked me to go with him, he shewed me this man's shop. Then he said he'd get over the pales, and shew us the way to get in. It is not a dwelling house, it is only a hosier's shop.</p>

They went to bed about a quarter after ten on Sunday night. There was a woman that lay on the same floor came down stairs and followed the prisoner between two and three on Monday morning, who came into my room, awaked me, and said, that the prisoner told her he had killed his wife. Before I had struck a light I heard him say so, he was at my bed's feet. I asked how he could talk so; he said he had almost cut her head off. My wife lighted a match, and I saw the blood run off his arm to his breeches; he was bloody as high as his elbow. I made my wife lock the door while I called the constable. When I came back he was sitting where I left him. We carried him to the Roundhouse. When we returned we went up into his room, and there lay his wife on her back on the floor, with her face on one side near the chimney ; her throat was cut, her head almost off, and a bloody knife was lying in the window. She was quite dead, dressed all but her bodice, cap and apron.</p>

            . I am a watchman. [He produces a clasp knife all bloody.] I came by Undershill's door and saw two women crying about three o'clock in the morning when I called the hour. I gave them a piece of candle. Then the constable and Undershill came back, and I went with them up two pair of stairs, where I saw a woman lying on the floor, one hand upon her breast, and her head almost cut off. The prisoner told them he had left the knife in the window, where I found it.</p>

            . I am constable. Undershill came and knocked at my door and told me, there was murder committed in his house. I went and found the prisoner sitting in the house, his right arm and left knee were both covered with fresh blood. He told me he had killed his wife; that he would very willingly die for her, because he loved her. He told me the knife was in the window in the same room. After I came from the Round-house, I went up and saw her lying on her back among blood in the condition as has been mentioned.</p>

               <p>John Hall. Last Thursday se'nnight I had been in the Borough, staid late, and was in liquor. I could not get into my lodgings in Grey's-Inn-lane. I was going from thence to Westminster to an acquaintance there, and passing by the new church in the Strand this woman came cross the way to me and asked me to go with her and drink some Dorchester ale. I went to a place which she said was the Black Swan between the new church and Exeter Change. I drank but one glass of beer. She then asked me to give her some shrub. which I did, and a bottle to take home with her. I staid there about half an hour, and paid three shillings for what we had, I changed a guinea, and I believe in pulling out that she saw another which I took out with it. She wanted me to go home with her, which I did to a house <placeName id="t17520625-33-crimeloc145">next door to the red house in Exeter Court</placeName>

I sat down in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175206250013"/> a chair, and she asked me what I would give her, I gave her four shillings. She seemed to speak as though I should not have to do with her for that; I said I did not desire it I only wanted to go to bed for the conveniency of the bed, and said, give me my money again. Presently she said, you shall give me half a guinea; she slapped my face and gave me several blows. Then I came to my senses. She said, I will have your money, and there are them in the house that will prevent your telling tales, if you don't give it me, and affected a hem, calling Dick. She put her hand into her pocket and said, if you don't give it me I'll rip your guts out directly. I told her I was as strong as she; upon which she said, I should be murdered if I did not comply, so I pulled out all I had in one pocket, which was half a guinea and four or five pennyworth of halfpence, and laid them on the table ; she scrabbled it up, put it in her pocket, and said, she would have more, and that I had a guinea more. I told her I had not, and desired her to give me the halfpence again for a breakfast, but she still insisted upon having a guinea more or I should never go out of the house. At last I got out by swearing I never would take her before a justice or meddle with her. I immediately got a watchman, who talked to her as she looked out at the window. She told him he was no constable. Then came a beadle, to whom an old woman opened the door. They took the prisoner to the Roundhouse. The woman of the house offered me my money again.</p>

The dyer brought in 9 half pieces of popinger green, about 21 or 22 yards each. The prisoners took 9 yards from the nine head ends, and when it came to the India house the inspectors did not find it out.</p>
               <p>Q. What is popinger green sold for per yard?</p>
               <p>Richardson. It is worth about three shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Do others trade in popinger green besides the India company?</p>
               <p>Richardson. The Turkey company did formerly, but latterly they do but very little.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to suspect the prisoners at the bar?</p>
               <p>Richardson. When we have measured pieces, we have found them short before this, but the evidence Briggs, who was recommended to me for an honest man from Yorkshire, and I think he is an honest man, he'll give you an account of the affair.</p>

            . I was bred a clothworker in the town of Wakefield in Yorkshire, and had not worked at my business in London before last November. When I came to Mr. Richardson, the two prisoners were employed as journeymen with me. We had some half pieces about six quarters wide, and 21 or 22 yards long; the two prisoners measured them over to see what length they would come to, and what was over 21 yards they tore off from the head end. There was a yard taken from each half piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Who tore it off?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175206250015"/>Briggs. Barnes did, but Keeling was assisting, then they were all thrown together. After that Barnes gave me three yards and Keeling three, and kept three himself. He said it was a thing done in all clothworkers shops throughout London, that all their aprons were made of the same, and cut off in that manner. After they were cut off, they then being wet, are put upon the tainters, and stretched out to the length, so as to seem to be as before.</p>
               <p>Q. Must not this stretching be detrimental to the clothes?</p>
               <p>Briggs. It is to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it usual to do so, where you have worked before?</p>
               <p>Briggs. I never worked in London above six weeks, but I never saw the like before.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with your three yards?</p>
               <p>Briggs. I kept mine about a month, and thought to have given it away; but meeting with a Yorkshire man, one Bothman, whom I knew, he asked me if I had got any cloth, I said I had got three short yards, which I thought to give away; he called me a fool, and said he would dye them of a Saxon green, then I might sell them. I let him have them to dye, which cost me sixteen pence; after which he got a taylor to go along with me to sell them in Shoemaker Row, which I did for 3 half crowns to a piece broker.</p>
               <p>Barnes's Defence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Richardson knows we have of these popinger greens which come in that are not thirty nine yards long in the whole cloths, and the half cloths must run in proportion to the whole. It is impossible to pull these from thirty nine to forty eight if we pull them bit by bit.</p>
               <p>Keeling's Defence.</p>
               <p>Let me ask that evidence whether he saw me cut any of that cloth?</p>
               <p>Briggs to the Q. No, he did not, but he was aiding in it, in holding the cloth as it was wet.</p>
               <p>Q. from Barnes. I desire my master would speak what he knows of my character.</p>
               <p>Richardson. I can't say I discovered any villainy in Barnes, except this. He knows I have threatened him many a time, as I had often suspected him.</p>

Then the prisoner came up and took five pence halfpenny out of my breeches pocket. Then he asked me if I had a watch, I said I had none. Then he unbuttoned the waistbane of my breeches, and took out of my fob pocket a crack'd farthing and a cane head studed with silver.</p>

I did not chuse to deliver my hat, then the prisoner said, d - n your blood, why don't you deliver your hat. Then I let go my hand, upon which the other man said, perhaps it is a felt hat, if it is let the poor man have it. The prisoner felt at the corner of it, and said, d - n my blood, it will do for me; I was looking at him all the while. When they left me I went down to the bottom of Old Gravel lane to see for somebody. I saw a watchman at a distance, I told him I had been robbed, he answered, you may rob and be d - d. Then I went to the watch house and inquired for the headborough; he asked if I knew<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175206250016"/> the thief; I said, yes. Betwixt 5 and 6 o'clock that morning I was drinking a halfpenny worth of sallop in Rosemary lane, the prisoner went by and could not forbear looking at me; there were two others in company with him.

The prisoner went down Gravel lane, and two men with him, looking behind them now and then; we overtook them at the end of some broad stones.

            . About a fortnight or three weeks ago, on a Monday morning about 6 o'clock I saw Wiseman as drunk as a man could be, he said he had been robbed that night by three men. I said, you have been to a bawdy house, and the whores have robbed you. I asked him what time of the night it was; he said about twelve o'clock. I asked him if he thought he should know them again; he declared he should not.</p>

The prisoner presented a pistol to my breast, and said, d - n you, stop, or he'd blow my brains out. I struck him on his thumb with my whip, and repeated my blow a second time, and he dropped his pistol out of his hand on the ground. Immediately after that he unbuttoned his coat and pulled out another; but calling for assistance, he went off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he demand your money?</p>
               <p>Milbourne. I was in such a fright that I cannot say whether he did or not. After he was taken he owned his intent was to shoot me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go to the side of the coach?</p>
               <p>Milbourne. No, my lord, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance of time was it between his bidding you to stop and the time you struck the pistol out of his hand?</p>
               <p>Milbourne. It was 7 or 8 minutes. He said before the justice he came out on purpose to rob; that he came along Sion-lane with some chaises and intended to rob them, but upon seeing us, and thinking to have a better booty, he passed the chaises to rob us. We passed them chaises and him.</p>

The prisoner passed by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175206250017"/> me on horseback the 19th of May, and went up to the coachman. He swore an oath and bid him stop, or he'd blow his brains out directly. The coachman immediately stopped. The prisoner presented a pistol to his breast; as he was cocking it the coachman stood upright and gave him a lick on the arm, which he repeated, and the second blow the pistol dropped from the prisoner. Then he clapped his hand to the other pocket and drew out a second pistol, upon which the coachman drew back and called out a highwayman, so the prisoner made off. We went to secure our master and mistress into the town, and then returned with a good many people in quest of him. A man that was coming over Sion-field hearing the coachman call highwayman, and a gentleman's servant who saw the action assisted in taking him. Before we returned we took him before a justice of peace; he said he was very sorry for what he had done, and that it was the first time he ever attempted such a thing, and owned he went out that day with that intent.</p>

I was willing to try him from the Thursday morning to the Monday morning following, and put it in his way to make acknowledgement of it. I asked him if he had called at Mr. Aires's as he had been that way; he said he did call, but was told that he should not want any thing for ten days.

            . I was called up in the morning of the 28th of last month and told that my stable door was broke open. I went and found the lock, was wrenched. I missed two saddles and a saddle-cloth, two girths and a surcingle. There was a large piece of wood standing by the door. At the same time I found the two prisoners in the custody of the watchman. I had them before the justice; as one of them was a suspicious person, they were both committed. In a day or two after there was a black apprehended, whom justice Chamberlain thought sit to admit as an evidence; he confessed the fact. The saddles were advertised, and the old one was found by some schoolboys and brought to me; then Philip Edgerton confessed that he and the black (William Coffe) broke open the stable and took the things.</p>

About one in the morning on the 28th of May Edgerton came to me and said, pray, Mr. Smith, give me leave to light my candle; I asked him what he wanted it for, he said he was going to do his Mrs's horse that was going to a fair; he lighted it. As I was beating the hour 2, I found a piece of wood standing by the stable door and the door open; then I went into the hay lost in the next yard and found the two prisoners there; I secured them. After that I took the black, his master desired me if I saw him to secure him, which I did, and he confessed the fact.</p>

I saw him the next day at ten o'clock there, which was the second time I ever saw him; (the first time I saw him he was detected in stealing an anchor) he told me he must first see the vessel before he could raise money, and then he would endeavour to raise money soon. The vessel was then at Woolwich taking in sugar to bring up to the Keys as a lighter. She made three voyages in the time he was consulting with Wilson in Tower-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Lundin. I saw him go into Wilson's house, and he shewed me Wilson, but I did not go in with him. After he came out he said he'd go and see the vessel, after which Mr. Wilson will tell me how to proceed, and then I will let you know whether he will advance money or not. When the vessel came up to the custom-house key and was delivered of her cargoe, Manoury went on board her; he viewed her and said she was a very fit vessel for some purpose which he would let me know when we came to be farther acquainted. The vessel was carried to Mr. Horn's Way according to Manoury's directions, to be repaired. After that he said to Mission and me, I'll soon show you a person that will direct you how to get money, and said, make an inventory of what is building, make it larger than the things that are on board. He made one, which came to 120 l. (the builder did not know but there were all the materials, but in fact they were not half made use of.) He carried<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175206250023"/> it to Wilson's ; then he left me without the door. After this, Manoury brought an order from Mr. Wilson for Mr. Horne to repair her; I went with him. He told Horne, in my hearing, he was a grocer in Tower street, and he would pay him. Misson, Manoury and I were once at the Bell in Tower street, Manoury there said, gentlemen, if you'll not discover a secret.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Lundin. This was the latter part of Aug. or the beginning of Sept. I can't be particular as to the day of the month or the week. After Manoury had drank a little plentifully (he at such times is not close minded) he discovered the whole secret, he told us that he would get a charter party drawn up, and after that a bill of sale made, and Mr. Horne had valued her at 120 l. which was to be put up at 6 to the half. His first proposal was to ensure her in Holland, saying there is no danger, they can't try us there for any fault if we are in England, After that he got a charter party drawn up in

            . After which a charter party was prepared, I did not see him write it; he brought it to the Bell alehouse. Mr. Greenwood that keeps the alehouse witnessed it. This was afterwards consulted, as there is an act of parliament, that no vessel under 70 Ton shall take in tobacco and snuff, for which reason Manoury contrived to get liberty to touch at Cork, for the act says, none shall carry tobacco, except to Ireland. &amp;c. After this was consulted the names were torn off. The next step was they cleared her out from the custom house for Cork and Gibraltar. Then they proceeded to have her put up upon the Change, as a general ship to make things look well. This Moravia and Manoury proposed at the Bell alehouse, it was likewise talked of at Wilson's two houses in Tower street, and at Moravia's own house in Sep. All of us talked of this matter, that we would clear her out as a general ship, and put her up upon Change.</p>
               <p>Q. Who proposed it first ?</p>
               <p>Lundin. Moravia proposed it first; Manoury said that is a very artful man, and readily agreed to what he had said.</p>
               <p>Q. How often might you have meetings with Moravia and Manoury before your lading was put on board ?</p>

               <p>Lundin. Yes, he did. Moravia desired me to call at his house one morning, and said Manoury had been with him at his house in Aliff street, No 5, and told him if we would carry on the affair in sinking the Elizabeth and Martha he'd make it as good as 300 l. to Misson and me. I told him I would not do it, but I would keep the secret. Then on or about that time there was notice given of the first fifty pound note given, to borrow money on

             part of the time she lay in the river. We had locks to the hatchway, he generally kept the key; he was to take care of the hatchway and receive the goods, but he knew nothing of our secret. He took on board 33 barrels, which we called snuff, from Moravia's, but by the head of one of these casks of snuff tumbling out, when it was in the hold, it appeared to be dust; I believe it had been snuff, but then it was good for nothing. There were 4 bales put on board, marked 1. S. No from 1 to 7. on the 3d of Oct. to the best of my remembrance. Wilson and Moravia said, if we would reland those bales and boxes, they would give to Manoury. Misson and I 12 l. each for so doing; he said they were his property. Wilson generally threw it upon Moravia.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you reland them?</p>
               <p>Lundin. We did. Manoury came with an order, as he pretended, from Wilson, for 3 boxes, which he said was to pay one of those 50 l. notes, that was become almost due. Kepling was then on board, and Manoury desired me to send him out of the vessel to look for Misson, which I did. When he was gone I said to Manoury these goods will be detected by the custom-house officers. Said he, I'll say they are for

             in Tower street, he is a man in great repute, church-warden of the parish ; and he said, if I tell any man that, they will really pass. After which there came an order wrote by Manoury, and signed by Misson, for me to deliver 3 of these bales to a waterman; they were safe at Ratcliff highway, as I heard Manoury say, and carried to Wilson's or Manoury's, I can't say which. I know nothing of what became of them afterwards. Wilson and Manoury went and conversed together, after which there were brought in a waterman's boat on board the vessel three other boxes, about the same bigness with the mark and number, I think, 5, 6, and 7, I. S. on them, as those had before, by Wilson's servants; Wilson said Moravia will give you the 12 guineas for so doing. I heard Manoury give orders to Wilson's servants to fill them up with brickbats and rubbish. They were put into the cabin and locked in, that Kepling might not go down to take any notice for fear of a blow. Wilson seemed very angry when I went there one day, saying, I wonder Moses does not get the bales on shore, they seem to trifle with me, and that he would take the vessel from Misson if the bales were not relanded soon. Misson came on board with a waterman, and cut the package of the fourth bale and took out ten pieces of cloth and carried them to Wilson's tallow-warehouse. Wilson bid us call at Moravia's, and we should be satisfied for our trouble, for they were about pawning these goods to raise money. We went to Moravia the latter end of Nov. or the beginning of Dec. and we received 12 l. each. When I came first to Wilson's house he desired me to go to Moravia's, in the mean time came Misson, so he desired us both to go and tell him one of the boxes had been stopped in a case by the searcher. Moravia seemed uneasy at it when we told him, so likewise was Wilson before he sent us, fearing: the thing should be discovered. Moravia desired us to go and inquire for Manoury, because he could rectify things better than they. Moravia dined at Misson's house on the Sunday, and I with him; he said then to Manoury I know how to manage that affair, and desired we would come up to the Bell alehouse the Monday following. I did; there they all consulted together what to do; there was Wilson, Manoury, Moravia, and my self. Moravia insisted upon going to the custom-house: Manoury said you must not go down to appear about these goods, saying, his character was too bad and would cause a suspicion. Said he, endeavour to get a man of clear character to own them, and he must say he had bought them of a gentleman that had defrauded him, and he'd return them from whence they came; then perhaps the searchers will take no farther notice, and which will cause no suspicion. That was resolved upon by Moravia, Manoury and Wilson, they mentioned several names that I have forgot; at last they mentioned

            , I had never seen him in my life. Then they said he had a clear character, and was not known in any scenes of villasny, as Moravia was known to have been guilty of. Carolina came first to the Bell alehouse, and then went on the key and claimed the box. He said the man he bought those goods of had defrauded him, for he thought the whole quantity of stockings were in the box which he bought. A gentleman at the custom-house told me it was some die, but Manoury said it was only sawdust of wood. One Butler, a waterman, had them to carry on board.</p>

               <p>Q. What became of them?</p>
               <p>Lundin. They never came on board to my knowledge; I saw some Guernsey stockings of little or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175206250025"/> no value on board; they were moth-eaten, and Manoury said they were of no value, we need not take them out again. Manoury got credit with paying some money that he got upon Wilson's note from one Evans in White-chapel for 31 l. worth of stockings, which were brought down in two boxes to Wilson's tallow-warehouse ; he opened the boxes and pawned some of them by the Tyger in Tower street, the rest went on board as a venture of Manoury's, marked J. M. No. 1 and 2. The next thing that Manoury ship'd was a cask of rhubarb, so called at London; it was a large wine pipe from Moravia.</p>

Manoury asked Stannerd, in my hearing, to make him 4 ton of cordage upon Wilson's credit; he stammered and said, I am not in circumstances to make so large a quantity, I shall make no more than I think to send on board your ship as a venture, as you say you can bring it to so good a market. He shipped 23 coyles.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any application made to Wilson to see how much you were to have for your reward?</p>
               <p>Lundin. The policies and every thing were to be lodged in Wilson's hand till we came home. Wilson referred us to Manoury, saying, what he said he would stand by. We all met, Moravia, Misson, Manoury and I at Wilson's house, there our proportions were ascertained, the lotment was thus; Misson to have a half part of a policy, which is under wrote by

             and Moravia said he knew how to do things in a better manner than either of us. He appeared as a passenger and to have cargoe on board as a merchant to Cork. He broke bulk at Gravesend, and sold 7 or 8 dozen of stockings to one Mr. Blake. He went from thence to London, and ordered us to put in at Sheerness and wait his coming. We got there in 2 or 3 days; he came on board and took out a pretty many doz, of the same stockings, which he called his own, and sold there. He said it is unnecessary, as we know the design we go upon, to link any thing of value in the vessel, let us make as much money as we can. One coile of cordage was carried on shore at Queenborough, and he said to me, you being mate of the vessel must say it is a little venture of yours. I gave the receipt for the money made of it, and it was divided among us 3, Manoury, Misson and I. Manoury said on board I think the safest way to destroy the vessel, and not to endanger our lives would be to buy some pitch and tar, and get some ignorant man on board, and we will put some nastiness in the pitch pot and say some quantity of pitch near and she'll take fire, and that will recover the money the same; so there were some bought by his directions. We shipped another hand at Gravesend, one

There were 20 of them to be broached in the hatchway, saying it was his property, telling the innocent man the carpenter, he was a merchant bound for Cork, he passed for the owner of the greatest part of the cargoe.

            . There was a barrel of stinking anchovies and some cheese, which he carried to him, and he shipped the 13 coils of cordage which we had on board a ship going to Wales. Moravia came to Dover to us, he had a consultation with us at 2 different houses; there his pretence was to go over to France to take the benefit of an insolvent act; the chief of his intent was to take in more ballast. We have on board 7 or 8 ton from off the wharf on the top of our cargoe, that she might surely go down; he hoped he would not do as Cowey did, who undertook to sink a ship (wherein he was before concerned,) that rose up in judgment against him, by which means he lost 5000 guilders. We had taken 7 ton of ballast before, at London, by his directions. There were some watches brought down by Misson to pawn,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175206250026"/> the property of a gentleman in London; the gentleman has them again. We had twelve chests of tea. Moravia said, you had better go over to Guernsey and dispose of that there; the others said it would make a blow if that was done, that it was a bulky commodity, we had better let the rabarb, that is not worth 40 s. and the tea sink together in the vessel. We went from Dover to Stokes Bay ; when we came there a little boy (one

             was by Manoury's directions, discharged, saying he was an artful cunning boy, and he might discover things if he was continued on board. There was a case brought on deck and opened by Misson and Manoury, which were snipped as cambricks on board ; (it was set in the after hatchway on the top of all, there are three hatchways to the vessel) this was carried on shore and sold to one Mr. Briant at Portsmouth ; and also a cheese was given to the gentleman by the direction of Manoury. I received part of the money; Misson and Manoury had the rest. Manoury sold all his stockings, some at Portsmouth, and some he brought to London; I saw them in his house where he lived in the upper part of Rosemary-lane. There was nothing belonging to him in the vessel but a bed, which is all he lost for his 300 l.</p>

            &amp;c. for the gentlemen at London ( the under-writers) that sit in their white lined chambers, don't know how the wind lies at sea. He went to Portsmouth by land from Stokes-Bay two or three times ; there he left us, and said, what is the reason you don't go on board? I'll not go on board to indanger my life, for Misson must destroy her now to compleat his bills of laying, for he will have nothing to shew at Cork of any value when he comes there. The next port we were at was Cowes, where were some pieces of cambrick sent on shore and sold. Manoury got no part of that money. When the wind came fair at Cowes we proceeded to do as Manoury had directed Misson in my hearing in Stokes-Bay. If in case he would not give consent to set her on fire, said he, I believe your best method will be to take a crow and go down into the lower scuttle, (there were two good crows on board) and get the sharpest pointed and heaviest, and endeavour in the after part of the vessel to cut the double of the vessel up, and then to drive the crow plum through, so as to make many holes to let the water in, will do it as well as with an augur. When we went from Cowes we had a saint wind, and were from the Start the next morning a little to the eastward of Plymouth. Misson endeavoured to get all the people to the forecastle that he might do it. I heard him try at it, but he could not do it with the crow. Then we went into Catwater at Plymouth, pretending the ship had sprung a leak; our intent was to get an augur and gimlet to make holes in the ship. There Misson bought an inch and quarter augur, and a large gimlet which would follow it; he had it lengthened by a smith to go between the timbers, with which he bored six or seven holes; he bought two sir-mop-sticks, which he cut in pieces for plugs, that I saw him make. We were all on shore when he bored the holes in the bottom of the vessel. We hauled her on shore at Cutwater, pretending to look for a leak, for him to do it. When the wind permitted, we proceeded. We had not been many hours from Plymouth, nor above two or three leagues from shore, the wind at E. S. E. but there he pulled out the plugs, and she was not above 15 or 20 minutes before she sunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the holes after they were bored?</p>
               <p>Lundin. I saw the plugs in the holes, there were six or seven of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when he pulled out the plugs ?</p>
               <p>Lundin. I was at the helm, he pulled them out at once. The carpenter was boiling some victuals at the fire, he knew nothing of the affair; he came up and said the vessel had sprung a leak. Then we pretended to get the pumps to work. Presently up came the dogman, who was affrighted and jumped into the boat ; he endeavoured to get the casks or boxes that he had, and dogs into the boat, which he did, and they were carried safe. We also got a sail into the boat; we got to shore in our boat and went to a little village to the westward of Foy in Cornwall, from thence to Foy to make protest to a notary-publick ; then we came to Plymouth, and so to London.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there an oath made to your protest?</p>
               <p>Lundin. There was, but not at Foy. At London we applied to

Wilson would have the protest in his own hand, on purpose to recover some cloaths that he had bought of one Mr. Whitwood, as he said, Wilson and Moravia desired it might be delivered to them. Manoury scrupled that, being jealous of them. I got a copy of it and delivered it to Misson ; then they trifled with him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175206250027"/> and would not give the policy nor bill of sale into Misson's hand till they were sure of it. Misson and I threatened to make a blow of it.</p>

               <p>Lundin It was in Wilson's warehouse. Wilson, Moravia, and Manoury asked us, is the vessel sunk ? Moravia said, I hore you have not done as Cowey did. They asked us if we saw her sink, or if we were sure she sunk. Misson said, I saw her mast-head go under water, and she never will rise again, except the world turns upside down. The policy that I had was in an innocent man's hands, a friend of mine, and I had nothing to shew for it till I had a bill of sale from them; then Manoury filled up my bill of sale.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you receive a letter from the fleet?</p>

               <p>Lundin. No, never in my life till I was acquainted with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether or no, before you knew him, you did not persuade people to put goods on board the vessel?</p>
               <p>Lundin. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever declare you was to have 500 l. to give your evidence here?</p>
               <p>Lundin. I have said to people that came to trouble me (to make them easy, and myself too in my confinement ) that I was promised 500 l. but it was all false, for I never had a promise of any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the secret at the Bell alehouse, that was there divulged ?</p>
               <p>Lundin. Manoury said, that as the vessel was in bad repair we'll get her repaired on Wilson's credit, and held soon contrive means how to get money.</p>

               <p>Q. Who used to keep the key of the hatchway?</p>
               <p>Kepling. I mostly had that; I used to be on board alone. I remember Lundin came on board, and I was sent on shore to see for Misson, and Lundin ordered me to leave the key of the hatchway with him, which I did.</p>

            . I served part of my time to a ship carpenter, and was shipped on board this ship the Elizabeth and Martha at Sheerness on Saturday the 20th of December; I was shipped on shore and carried on board at night; I saw only a boy there; in the morning I saw Manoury; after we were under sail he went down to Dover with us, where we took in some ballast at the Pier, the mate said there were about seven or eight tons of it, which was flung upon the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Manoury give any directions about it?</p>
               <p>Salmon. No, I did not. We got in the Downs that night. He went as far as Stokes-Bay with us; there was some cordage taken out in Dover-Pier, which was carried in a boat by Manoury's order; he said he had an order out of the custom-house. There were many coils of it carried on board a Welch sloop. There were also two horses, or small boats cables, went I believe the day before, or the same day Manoury left us at Portsmouth; I can't exactly say what day. We lay in Stokes-Bay I believe three or four days.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the wind at going in!</p>
               <p>Salmon. They said the wind was not fair; I am no great judge of it. Two or three days after that we failed into Limmington-Creek. Manoury was to have come to us there. Misson went on shore to look for him, but he did not come. After we had lain there a day or two there came a little fair wind, so we got our anchor up for Ireland, and just as we came by the Needles the wind blew very hard; the mate said to Misson, don't let us go out, it will be all our deaths. We sailed back again to Cowes, and from thence to Plymouth to stop a leak; she was pretty leaky ; we pumped her in Stokes-Bay, where we staid five or six days; I stopped the leak as well as I could; we came to anchor by the side of a custom-house sloop. From thence we went out to proceed on our voyage ; we pumped her when she went out of Catwater ; she made little or no water then. We had not been at sea above four or five hours before she sunk.</p>

               <p>Q. How many leagues were you got?</p>
               <p>Salmon. I am no judge of that. The mate said to the master, at twelve at noon, go to sleep, I'll call you at four o'clock. The mate said to me, Tom, go and look after the kettle; we had a pudding and a piece of meat boiling; I went according to his order. There was a passenger, a gentleman's servant, on board. As I was looking after the kettle I thought I heard a great crack as if it had been a breaking of a cask in the hold. Presently, Lord God, said the passenger, what is the matter? there I saw the water just in the platform of the forecastle; I jumped up to the foremast pump; said the mate, what is the matter? I replied, here is water in the forecastle ; I believe there were about four or five feet water. While we were pumping the water put the fire out; then the master said it was time to take to the boat. The gentleman's servant and Misson got their trunks into the boat. Said the master to the young man, as you have been to sea before, you know the affairs of the sea, if you don't save something that is in the vessel you'll have no wages, lend me your knife, so they cut the mainsail and took it into the vessel; we got into the boat, and in about four or five minutes we saw her go down with her crotchet-brace and jib up.</p>
               <p>Manoury. The master and mate had some words; the master was for going back to Dover, and I hoisted a flag of distress up. I reconciled them as well as I could.</p>

I went down to the Tower and called one, Moravia bargained with the coachman to carry them to Gerrard street. I saw Moravia have a paper in his hand with the direction, but I did not see the gentleman's name where they were to go. I helped to put them in the coach. There were 3 empty ones brought in their room the same evening that the 3 full ones came. Lundin desired me to get them, which I did, of the same size as the 2 big ones; Lundin told me he'd make me a present of half a crown (Manoury being much in liquor he agreed to it ) if I'd put in some dirt and stones. When I had filled them Lundin took one and carried it a little way, he took up some dirt to rub over them to make them as dirty as the others were. Manoury paid me the money at the alehouse for filling them.</p>

Then Lundin desired me to get 2 porters, but I could not, so I carried one and my fellow-servant another; Lundin and Manoury went with us, we put them into the boat, and my fellow-servant went and fetched the other, while I was sitting by the water side. The waterman asked him where he was to go with them, he ordered him to put off, but gave him no directions before he went from us. Manoury and Lundin went in a boat with him, and Manoury said he'd take care and deliver them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Manoury, Lundin, and Moravia at Wilson's ?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I have at different times. I have seen Manoury, Moravia, Lundin, and Wilson at the Bell together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Carolina there?</p>
               <p>Taylor. No, I never did. I have seen him come into Wilson's shop, and make his obeisance. He was an acquaintance of Moravia's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you take notice of these boxes being filled by their order to any body?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I mentioned it to my master Wilson that evening, but he gave me no answer.</p>

            . I live in Gerard-street St. Ann's, I keep a publick office, and lend money upon goods for the loan of money. The 28th of Nov, Moravia borrowed 150 l. of me. He left with me at that time 16 watches and some hard-ware, contained in 3 boxes, No 1, 2, and 3. These I marked myself.</p>
               <p>Q What letters were there?</p>
               <p>Sherrard. The letters were scraped off. On the 5th of Dec. 51 he had 200 l. on 30 pieces of cloth, they were brought, I think, in 3 bales, but they were taken out in order for conveniency of carrying them up into my ware room. Two of the bales came first, and the other he brought either in a cart or coach himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the bales marked!</p>
               <p>Sherrard. They were, but with what I cannot say. I have some pieces of the cloth here. I thought it would answer the end as well as to bring a large bundle. The bells of parcel, are shewn him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these bills given to you when these goods were pledged?</p>
               <p>Sherrard. They were. It was from Messieurs Lane and Lewis, I never transact any thing in my office without bills of sale. He points to a gentleman and says, that is the gentleman to whom the 30 pieces of cloth did belong. He looks at the bill of parcels, under the hand Littlepear and Co. This is the bill of parcels I took of Moravia.</p>
               <p>Q. How much is it for?</p>
               <p>Sherrard. It is for 250 l. 12 s. 3 d.</p>
               <p>Q. to Littlepear. Do you know any thing of this affair ?</p>
               <p>Littlepear. Moravia told me and Mr. Whitehead that he had pawned the goods to Mr. Sherrard, and if we would advance him a sum of money, he'd give us an order to receive them upon paying the money that was advanced upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he tell you this?</p>
               <p>Littlepear. This he told me since he has been in Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Whitehead. You have heard what Mr. Littlepear has now said, did he make the same proposal to you?</p>
               <p>Whitehead. He said he had 150 l. upon the goods, and if we would advance the money we might have them again.</p>
               <p>Q. from Moravia. Did I not say Mr. Wilson received the money from me after I had pawned the goods ?</p>
               <p>Whitehead. He said something about Mr. Wilson accusing him of something, but I don't know what.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Whitehead. It was in Newgate after Moravia had demanded the insurance money as his own goods from the under writer.</p>

            . I keep an insurance office and am a Police broker (he produces a police.) This was brought by Carolina. We commonly go to Change about 12 o'clock. When I returned I saw an order for 400 l. for Solomon Carolina, I asked who this Carolina was, said my clerk he is recommended by Manoury, he desired it might be done upon the Eliz and Martha, and the police may be sent to Mr. Wilson's, a grocer in Tower street; accordingly it was executed, and I believe it was paid there the 29th of Nov. After the loss Mr. Moravia came into my compting house and demanded satisfaction for a loss. I said he was mistaken, for I never would have transacted any business for him. Yes Sir, said he, you have done business for me, and introduced the police signed Carolina. I asked him why he sent Carolina, &amp;c. he said he did it in order to cover some debts he owned, and added he was an honest man; finding he was at the bottom of this transaction, gave me some suspicion. Then I asked him where the bills of lading and invoyces were, and bills of parcels, of whom bought and affidavits to them. He procured every thing, and said it was very fair that gentlemen should see before they paid their money. We put it off from time to time till we had a general meeting at Lloyd's Coffee house. He brought vouchers and papers, in order to clear his loss, pretending, that these goods had been all lost, and affidavits that they were all sunk with the ship, one from the captain that there was nothing taken out of her. I put the initial letters of my name to all the bills of parcels he produced. After a time we got intelligence of these goods being pawned as has been mentioned here.</p>

               <p>Q. to Littlepear. Look at this bill of parcels, do you know it ?</p>
               <p>Littlepear. This is the bill of parcels that I delivered to Mr. Moravia, when I sold the goods. It was the same bill which was lodged with the goods when pawned, and had the initial letters on it of Mr. Gyon, marked by him, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>(There were evidences in court which were called to prove the box of stockings, and sawdust which was stopped at the custom-house, was claimed there by Carolina, as his own property. But Carolina admitted it to be truth so they were not called.) There was an affidavit of Carolina's, that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175206250032"/> made in order to be laid before the gentlemen of the Insurance-Office, to this purport.</p>

            . The waggon comes from Stratford-upon-Avon. Mr. Stafford came to inquire for the box and produced a letter; I shewed him the box, it was almost a yard long, and directed to him; I employed Holmes as a porter to carry it where he lives, having a pretty deal of business at that time to do myself.</p>

            . I am a ticket porter; I was trusted to carry the box; the 12th instant I set out from Snow-Hill about nine o'clock; there was the name Stafford on the bottom of it, directed to the Three Balls in Buckingham-street for him. I went to Tottenham-Court-Road with another parcel; coming with that box along Monmouth-street, so down Drury lane, then into Russel-Court, across Covent Garden, I had the box on my knot; I asked for Buckingham-street; a man passed by me with white stockings on and said, this is the street, pointing to King-street, as I know since.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Holmes. It was then about a quarter after ten o'clock; then I asked for Mr. Stafford's; the man said, that is the gentleman's house, and that is his servant standing at the door; I went up to the house, it was the prisoner that stood in the passage at the door; said he, d - n it, where have you been all this while? are you not come from the Saracen's-Head on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175206250034"/> Snow-Hill with this box? I told him, yes: he made me believe he put his hand in his pocket to pay me, and then said, I have no halfpence, my master is at the Shakespear's-head tavern in Covent-Garden, he'll make you drink. I left the box upon a bulk at the door, and the prisoner clapped his arm upon it and said, I might take it with me. I went to the Shakespear's-head and inquired; the gentleman at the tavern said to me, young man, there is no such man here, go and look after your box, you are defrauded out of it. I have many such persons sent here. I went back again, and the box was gone off the bulk where I set it and the prisoner taken I was telling people how I had been served; the prisoner came up again and said, what's the matter here? I looked at him and said, you are the person that robbed me of my box. This was about eleven o'clock, it was quite a light night; he had a black stock on, and I also took notice of his face. I seized him as he was going in at the door; I found he lodged there; I carried him to the Roundhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Was you not much in liquor?</p>
               <p>Holmes. No, I was not, I was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the same cloaths on when you saw him the last time as he had before?</p>
               <p>Holmes. He had, my lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>As to the charge against me, I am intirely innocent. As I was coming home to my lodgings I saw a mob of people and the porter amongst them; so I went up and asked him what was the matter? he said he had lost a box, and that he had left it with a footman on the bulk while he went to the gentleman, which was gone when he came back; there were several people laughing at him, telling him he was a drunken fellow. He charged seveveral others with it; I blamed him for his ignorance ; then he seized and charged me.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>- Holloway. I am a watchman in King-street Covent-Garden; I took the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the evidence (Holmes) fuddled or sober ?</p>
               <p>Holloway. He was in liquor very much. When I first saw him he was standing against the wall without the box; he said, watchman, they have stole a long box from me; I went half the length of the street and came back again; then he said a man had told him he was a gentleman's servant that owned the box; the prisoner was going into his own lodgings. The evidence said he delivered it to a man dressed in livery and white stockings; as the prisoner was going into his own door he said, this is the man. I never saw the prisoner before.</p>

            . I live in that street; as I was going home the prosecutor was making a noise about a box; I said to him, what is the matter, friend? he answered, the man that took the box away was dressed in footman's cloaths, and had white stockings on; said I, where was you directed to? he said to Buckingham-street; I told him, this is King street, so he was going to fight with me; then I thought he was drunk. When we were before the justice on the second examination, the justice ordered me and the prisoner to change cloaths, we did, and I was brought up instead of the prisoner; the justice asked him if I was the man; he swore to me twice. When he found he was mistaken, he then swore to the buckles in my shoes.</p>

I agreed for a bed, and paid 2 shillings for it; we had two pints of wine afterwards; after which I took the key of the waiter and locked myself and her in, and put the key in my fob and went to bed with her. When I awaked, which was between four and five o'clock. I looked about and saw my breeches on the floor, the prisoner was gone; I stretched out my hand for my breeches, then I missed my ring off my finger, it was a gold one with a stone in it. I searched my breeches and found nothing but two farthings left.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you before?</p>
               <p>Jenkins. I had ten guineas and a half in gold when I went with her, but I had changed the half guinea to pay my landlord. I had then ten guineas in my fob, and the key of the door upon them when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>John Hill. The prosecutor and prisoner came into the Salutation tavern near Temple bar (I am a waiter there) they called for a room a little before twelve at night the fifteenth of June, I shewed them one, there was a bed in it; they called for liquor, I carried it them; they had 1 s. 6 d. in punch, and two pints of wine, he paid me for that and the bed, in all 5 s. 6 d. and giving me half a guinea I carried it to my mistress to change, and returned him five shillings out of it. In the morning he called me up a little before six o'clock, and told me he had lost ten guineas in gold, and 4 s. 6 d. in silver, and three gold rings. We went in search of her, and looked in every room about the house, but could not find her. We have a pair of folding doors, which go into a yard; these I fastened before I went to bed, and found them open when I was called up in the morning, as I did likewise the inner door, and there were marks on the wall about six feet high, where she had got over; it goes into Sheer lane. We found her in Peter's street near Saffron hill. After we found her, and I had charged her with taking three rings from the prosecutor he then recollected but one. She confessed before justice Fielding she took the ring and 4 s. 6 d. in silver, but denied that she either saw or knew of any guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the Salutation in London or Middlesex?</p>
               <p>Hill. The front is in London, but that room where they lay is in Middlesex.</p>

               <p>The man met me on the other side Temple bar, and asked me if I would go with him, I said I did not chuse it; he said I should go to the Salutation Tavern ; we went and had a negus, and two pints of wine. He gave me the ring and 4 s. 6 d. before we went to bed. I saw no gold about him. <rs id="t17520625-56-verdict249" type="verdictDescription">

About the latter end of May, I can't tell the exact time, when I went to clean the rooms, I used to leave the door open, it was usual for me to go down to empty a bason for the space of two or three minutes. The first that was missed was the cloth coat, waistcoat and breeches. Last Monday I lost a flannel and duffil coat and waistcoat. The prisoner was seen to go out on Monday. On Thursday I went up again about three o'clock and found her; she had hid herself in an empty chamber above ours. I sent for a constable, she then confessed that she had gone up into that chamber, and when I went down to empty the bason, has slid down to my master's chamber, and took these things up to the room where I found her, and when I had locked the door and gone down she then has come down and carried the things away; and that she sold the first things in Rosemary lane. Mrs. Dean stopped the second parcel when she came with it. I went and found the clothes. The goods produced in court by Mary Dean, and deposed to by the prosecutor.</p>
