I felt tired and went towards Brick Lane for a lodging. I had some beer and was getting into a 'bus when a man took me into the Liverpool Arms, and we then went to Poplar. We called in and had a drink at another house. By the time we got to Knewstubb's it was 10 o'clock and I had 1s. 8 3/4 d. in my possession. The man paid for the drinks there. I never tendered any money nor paid for a drink there. At 12.20 the man took me outside, gave me a shilling and told me to get one and a half pints of ale in a can and get a drop for myself. He said he would be back, but never returned. When I called for the pennyworth of bitter I tendered the shilling the man gave me. My purse was in my pocket. John Knew<lb/>stubb said it was bad and I said I did not know it, nor anything of the other bad shilling found in the till."</p>

I will f—well kill you"—the other man with him had gone away—Susan Sills came to the back of me and caught hold of me by the neck while Alfred held on to my feet and pulled me to the ground—he then jumped on my stomach with his feet twice while Susan punched my head, holding my arm—Alfred snatched my whistle and threw it away—he then ran down Emerald Street some fifty yards—Susan was still behind me and I shook her off—I picked up my whistle and ran after Alfred—I blew it as I ran along—I overtook him and caught hold of his.</p>

With that I pulled the coins out of my pocket and jingled them, saving, 'I am advertising for "Smith's Weekly."' The prosecutor was very excited and caught me by the arm and said, 'I will give you in charge. These are bad coins.' I said, 'It is very foolish to give me in charge for a thing like this.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector E.</hi>) On July 15th, about 12.30 a.m., the pris<lb/>oner came to Gray's Inn Road police station while I was in charge—she was carrying an infant, and said, "A woman, whom I do not know, gave me this baby to hold and she has gone away"—I said, "I will write down what you wish to say and it may be produced in evidence against you—the baby looked weak and ill and had a red mark round its throat, al<lb/>though the clothing round its neck was quite loose and free—she made this statement, which I took down, and she signed it (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "Jenny Lang, no home, third-class prostitute, says: About 10 o'clock this morning I was walking along Gray's Inn Road towards Holborn, when opposite Clovelly Mansions a women whom I had never seen before, age 28, height 5 ft. 2 ins., white blouse, black skirt and black sailor hat, pale thin face, asked me to hold the baby while she got something to eat in an eating house close by. I took hold of the infant; the woman went in the shop. I waited outside until 12.30, but the woman did not come out again. I have not seen her since. I did not go to any lodgings last night. The night before I went to an hotel with a man; I do not know where. This has been read over to me and is correct"—I sent for Dr. Edwards, who examined the child, and I then told the prisoner that she had been found in possession of the child on whom murder had been attempted, but she refused to give any account on which enquiries could be made—I said she would be charged with attempting to murder it—she said, "It was just as I received it from the woman, but I did not do anything to it"—I afterwards said to her, "Would you like to be examined by a doctor, and you will understand the result of that examination may be important for your case"—she said that she would like to be examined and I then called in Dr. Edwards, but on his arrival the prisoner said, "I will tell you the truth; that is my baby. I had no home and no money, only one penny. I did not know what to do with it; I am very</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.P. I live at 23, Brunswick Square, and act as police surgeon—on July 15th I was called to Gray's Inn Road police station about 1.15, where I was shown a baby—I examined it and found a red mark or narrow weal round its neck which, in parts, was somewhat abraded—it was about 1/8th inch wide—a narrow string or band or tape would have caused it—it had been done during the last two or three hours, I should say—a considerable amount of tension must have been used, the effect of which would be asphyxia or choking—the other effects would be fracture of the bones of the larynx—I diagnosed that there was such a fracture—the child was in a very bad condition; it breathed with difficulty and seemed in a state of partial collapse—it was well nourished—I attribute the partial collapse to the effects on the larynx—I could not say if it would have fatal consequences or not—it was sent to the infirmary—I saw it fed, but it would not take the bottle, and I thought perhaps it had not been accustomed to one—it took a certain amount of food from a spoon; it made violent efforts to swallow, which I connected with the injury to the neck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The child was not particularly clean; it had been neglected for the last two or three days—I cannot say if it had been taken about from place to place—the injury might have been caused by a sudden jerk or by a cord fastened tightly round the neck or by con<lb/>tinuous pressure—the jerk could be applied by some string—I do not think it could have been caused by a string not tied too tight and then suddenly pulled—I do not think that would be sufficient to cause the weal—it would be continuous pressure which would cause the weal, not a jerk—pressure would have to continue for fifteen or thirty minutes, and would have to be severe—I do not know anything about a jerk—the injury to the larynx might have been caused by a jerk—I do not think that a cord which was tied tightly round the neck would cause the</p>

               <p>injury to the larynx when it was released—increased pressure would cause it, but I do not think pulling at a knot to untie it would do so—the marks were not the same all the way round—they had shown no signs of disappearing; they were of three or four hours' standing—it would depend on what substance was used as to how soon the child would be suffocated—the thicker the cord, the more dangerous.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical officer at the Holborn Union Workforce, Shepherdess Walk, and I was there when the prisoner's child was born on June 22nd—it was apparently a full-time, healthy male child—it suffered from no complaint with the exception of a slight discharge from the note—the prisoner remained in the workhouse from June 22nd till July 10th—I cannot say how long before she went away I saw the child—there was no complaint made about its health, so I passed through the ward and paid no attention to it—I vaccinated it on June 30th; the vaccination marks afterwards appeared to be quite well and the discharge from the nose was gone—on July 15th it was brought to the workhouse at 3.15 p.m.—I did not recognise it—I examined it and found round its neck a red mark, apparently recently made—it was not quite complete at the back of the neck, an inch or an inch and a half having no mark—it had been inflicted two or three hours before—a cord tied round the neck would cause it, but the mark not going right round would indicate that something had been tied round and had been pulled from behind—the child was in a collapsed condition—we tried to feed it with milk, but it made no effort at swallow<lb/>ing—there was some inflammation round the navel and some redness round the buttocks—this bootlace might have caused the mark; I thought the child was in a dangerous condition—it lived until July 29th—it was under my observation and care during that time—it developed inflam<lb/>mation round the larynx, and also there were two small patches of in<lb/>flammation</p>

               <p>in the mouth—those disappeared after three or four days, but the larynx continued inflamed and the child showed signs of congestion in both lungs—it got weaker and died on the 29th—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination and found that both lungs showed signs of congestion of three or four days' standing—there was a clot on the right side of the heart and the larynx showed a crack—the cord round the neck would cause that if the pressure had been very great—the membrane lining the larynx was inflamed; the other organs were apparently healthy—the cause of death was failure of the heart, following the congestion of the lungs, which was brought on, I think, secondly to the injury to the throat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think a tape such as you would have in the neck of a nightdress would cause the mark—I do not think the mark was con<lb/>sistent with the tape not having been tied too tight round the child's neck in the first place and its having been further jerked in trying to untie it—I do not think that would cause the fracture—my idea is that the injury to the larynx was caused by a jerk from behind—if a finger was inserted at the back of the neck under the tape, that would tend to make the pressure very great—if the string had been tied tightly round the throat the skin would have been injured very much, and there was no evidence of that—pulling at a knot would give a distinct jerk—at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination the baby was heavier than it was when it—left my care—apart from the shock, I found nothing the matter with it—it would be carefully attended to in the workhouse—when it came in the second time it did not look as if it had been exposed to bad weather—I do not think the injury to the lungs could have been caused by the treatment it had received, as I saw no signs of it when it first came in—this kind of congestion takes a few days to show—I think it is very improbable that the congestion came from anything else than the injury to the larynx—I do not think the child was in as good con<lb/>dition when it came back as it was when it left.</p>

I am a labourer, of 5, Framley Place, High Street, Homerton—I have known the prisoner for about twelve months—I did not know the deceased—on Saturday, September 2nd, I met the prisoner in the High Street between 3.30 and 4—he was sober, but had had some drink—as we were going into a beershop the deceased came out and rolled up against the prisoner, who asked him where he was going to—the deceased turned round and made use of a filthy expression and then struck the prisoner on the nose—the prisoner returned the blow—the deceased fell backwards into the road—I said to the prisoner, "Come away, you don't want to have any bother here"—with that we walked away.</p>

                  </hi>. I went through the ceremony of marriage with the prisoner on June 12th last—I asked him last February whether he was married and he said, "I am like you"—I am a soldier's widow—I believed him to be a widower; he said his wife was dead—his first wife was dead and I did not think anything about his having a second, wife—a woman giving the name of Mrs. Nunny called on me and I took her to the bedroom to see the prisoner, who was not well that morning—he looked very bad when his first wife was there—he did not deny she was his wife—he admitted it, I think—he said, "Oh, Mil!" or "Oh, Amelia!"</p>

On August 11th, at 11.45, I was in Chatham Place, just over Blackfriars Bridge, with Detective Wag<lb/>staff—a large crowd of people collected, as it was the day of the visit of the French naval officers to the Guildhall—I saw the two prisoners in the crowd—I saw Kearns place his hands in the folds of ladies' dresses, his movements being covered by Hill—I and Wagstaff followed them along the Embankment on the river side—the prisoners made similar attempts, Kearns placing his hands in the folds of ladies' dresses, and Hill covering him—at Carmelite Street they forced their way through the crowd, and Kearns put his hand in the pockets of two young ladies, and felt their dresses, Hill covering him—then Kearns placed himself in front of an old gentleman wearing a gold watch chain exposed—Hill, standing on his left, placed his left hand under his right arm and got hold of his chain; the old gentleman at that moment moved away, and the prisoners failed—Hill then placed himself in front of the prosecutor, Mr. Ebden, who came there with his hands in his pockets and his watch chain exposed—Kearns placed himself immediately in front of the pro<lb/>secutor and Hill pushed himself up close on the left-hand side, and with his left hand under his right arm he withdrew the gentleman's watch, switched it off the swivel, and left the chain hanging—the prisoners were going off, but saw us getting off some railings where we had been keep<lb/>ing observation, and tried to back through the crowd, but I seized one and Wagstaff the other—the watch was dropped in the crowd, or passed away; it was not recovered—no watch was on them—I was not in uni<lb/>form—I arrested Kearns and told him I was a police officer and he would be charged with stealing a gentleman's watch, and picking pockets along Chatham Place—Kearns replied, "I have not been picking pockets"—Hill replied, "You won't find it on me"—we lost sight of the prose<lb/>cutor, but he followed to the station and reported the loss of the watch; he was the man we had seen in the crowd—Kearns was searched at the station and the rim of a watch was found on him; it is nothing of great importance; it is not gold—I saw Kearns the night previous and had him under observation at a shop in Fleet Street, where they were playing games of chance—he was then trying to pick pockets, but was unsuccessful.</p>

On September 1st, at 6.10p.m., I was called to 73, Blantyre Street, Chelsea—I found some people in the parlour putting out a fire which was there—I did not go in then, but spoke to the prisoner, who stood amongst the people outside the house—I was there a few minutes after the fire broke out—I then entered the house—I asked the prisoner if he had any matches upon him—he produced a box with one match in it—subsequently I went into the room where the fire was and the prisoner came in and in his presence Mrs. Fluskey said, "I saw that gentleman," pointing to the prisoner, "enter by the open street door and walk out not a minute after; I then saw flames come out of the window; he stood the other side of the road, looked at the house, and then walked towards the World's End"—I said to the prisoner, "What do you say to that?"—he said, "I deny what she says; I have not been in the house"—I then examined the premises—the window curtains were burnt, the bedding was burnt, the mattress was turned over by somebody and scattered over the floor—there were no means of ignition whatever in the room, no gas jet, no matches, nothing that would account for the fire; there was a small paraffin lamp that had not been lighted—the sides of the window frames were charred, the curtains burnt and a pane of glass broken—the prisoner was arrested—he was drunk—in reply to the charge he said, "Very good"—I then searched him and I found some loose matches upon him, cigarette papers and tobacco.</p>

I am a lance-corporal in the Army Service Corps, stationed at Millbank barracks—on August 10th, about 1.15 a.m., I was on picket duty—I was standing in the guard room—the prisoner's wife came to me—she said something to me, in consequence of which I went to the prisoner's quarters—the prisoner was there—he had a, carbine in his hand—he said to me, "Clear away from me or I'll fire"—he then presented the carbine at me—as I stepped aside he fired—I then stepped to the square to call for an escort and saw Mrs. Cooper fall to the ground—I went to her assistance—the prisoner followed me, re-loading the carbine—when I reached her I assisted her to rise—the prisoner was behind me and said, "What are you doing here?"—I said, "Stop your nonsense; she has fainted"—the prisoner then threw the carbine on the square, saying, "Do as you like with it; it is loaded"—he ran to the back gate as I picked up the carbine—after raising Mrs. Cooper I went and informed the police—I extracted an unexpended cartridge from the carbine—I then went to the prisoner's quarters and found a fired cartridge case which I handed with the unexpended cartridge to the sergeant-major—I saw where the bullet had struck—it was about fourteen inches above and in a line with my head.</p>

                  </hi>. I am House Surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital, Gray's Inn Road—Walter James Allen was admitted there on August 1st—he was in a semi-collapsed state—he was conscious when spoken to—I examined him—there was no evidence of external injury, no bruising—I performed an operation on him next day to see what had occurred in the abdomen—I found the bladder was ruptured 2 1/2 inches—we sewed it up—he died the same evening—death was the result of the shock due to the rupture of the bladder—his condition was consistent with injuries received by blows or kicks in the region of the abdomen—it might also have been caused by a fall on some projecting surface.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">M. GRAIN</hi>. A kick in the testicles would not account for the rupture of the bladder, nor a blow from the fist in the testicles—it would have to be a blow somewhere above the pelvis—it is difficult for anybody to kick that part standing in an upright position—when the deceased was admitted to the hospital he was suffering from alcoholism—his organs were all healthy.</p>

The tear in the bladder was transverse—it would have to be partially full to cause a rupture in such a position—I cannot draw any conclusion from that as to the sort of blow that would cause such a tear—if he had fallen on a corner of a chair it might possibly have caused a rupture, but such a fall would not be so severe—he would not have so far</p>

               <p>to fall—if a blow or kick was administered in the lower part of the abdomen it is not likely that any pain would be felt in the testicles—as a matter of fact, the distance between the testicles and the lower part of the abdomen is only a matter of inches.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 29, Clarence Road, Canning Town, and am a messenger—previous to July 20th this year I lived at 149, Percy Road, Canning Town, with my wife, who is the female prisoner—I was married to her in December, 1898—there are two children of the marriage a boy five and a half years old, and a girl seventeen months—in July 1 left London to go to Oxford on business—I knew of it three months before—I have to attend the officers of the Thames Conservancy on their inspection of the river—I left a list of the different places I would have to visit on the dressing table in the bedroom and it remained there some weeks before I went on July 20th—I made Langham's acquaint<lb/>ance in November, 1903—by my invitation he visited my house—he says he is an electrician—he spent Christmas of 1893 with me as a friend, and he visited us from time to time—in November, 1904, I forbid him the house, because I found that he was not the company I ought to as<lb/>sociate with—I could see he was too familiar with my wife, and I thought the sooner I got rid of his acquaintance the better—I did not then suspect</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190509120036"/>
               <p>any improper intimacy between them—I told my wife that he was no friend of mine, and, therefore, he was no friend of hers—we had lived very happily until he came across our path—on January 3rd, 1905, I saw them by accident near Canning Town station—she was going down a side turning with him—I asked her what it meant—he said to me, "Yes, you can see, and there is no law in this land to stop me walking with your wife"—I said to her, "You come on home, and I will speak to you when I get home"—when I got home I asked her the meaning of it—she told me she met him casually, and asked me to forgive her—I said, "I do not think I can believe you"—she said, "You can, and you can trust me," and I forgave her—she promised me and her mother she would never speak to him again—on July 20th when I went away I had no reason to believe that promise had not been kept—her mother lived near—my wife and I were on good terms—she brought me up a cup of tea, and packed my bag, and kissed me before I went away in the morning, and got my breakfast—I returned home on the 22nd in the ordinary way, arriving from 8 to 8.30—I did not find anybody in the house—I got in with my key, and, looking round, I saw that the linen was gone, as well as her clothes, the two children's chairs, a mail cart, some presents I had brought home for the children, the children's bath, a saucepan, and one or two other small items—these things were given for the home, therefore I take them to be my property—some were given by her mother, and some I bought myself—I got the mail cart with my own money—the linen supplied at the time of the marriage had worn out and we bought fresh with my money; we replaced it from time to time—she brought some linen to the home when she was married—my wages were 34s. 6d. a week—I found this letter on a bracket over the table in the kitchen in her writing (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "You will see by this when you read it that I have left here; you never want me or my company if you can get anybody else. I am rather above being only a convenience. I think I am worth a little more. You have told me to go a good many times if I did not like things as they were, so I am taking you at your word. You need not trouble to look for me at all, or ever think of me; I am as if I were dead to you. That is all I have to say, except take care of the boy. If you do not, may God deal with you as you deserve. I would not leave him if I could help it; I shall be sure to look after Ethel all right"—I had never told her to go—I had never quarrelled with her all the while I was married—both before and after the intro<lb/>duction of Langham I used to speak to her for her good—if I thought she was going wrong I endeavoured to check her—she would not listen—"Mind your own business": that is the kind of answer I would get—on July 22nd, when I found a quantity of property had gone, I put the matter into the hands of the police, who discovered she was at 36, Meeson Road, and on August 2nd I went there with Sergeant Stephens, where I saw her and my things mentioned in List B (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>); the linen is similar to mine, but I cannot swear to it—some of these articles were presents to the baby—this silk scarf I gave to the boy—I have him in my charge—this loose lace ruffle I remember buying for her—the baby's</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Ralph said, "Mr. Thompson, I have got a tin of sugar for you"—it was unopened—I know now it was promised to my wife; it was not f given to her—when it was found at her lodgings I left it in her possession—I at first charged her with stealing it, but not since I knew it was hers; that was a misunderstanding—I never had quarrels with my wife about this man beyond what I have mentioned—I never told her that if she wanted him she had better go to him, nor anything of that kind—when I saw them together I did not tell them that the best thing they could do was to give me a chance to get a divorce—she earned money on her sewing machine occasionally by doing work for a friend—I cannot say if it was paid far out of a loan, or whether I paid the loan off—my mother-in-law went security for a loan, but the loan was some time after—I did have a loan, but for what I cannot say—I paid it off—she did not pay for it out of her own earnings, nor any part of it—the two babys' chairs were given by my mother-in-law—I paid for the baby's bath—the saucepan was given by my mother-in-law as a Christmas present—the lace ruffle I gave her to take her out in—she said it was mine, therefore the police took it—I did not charge her with stealing it—I claimed all her clothes—I bought them to accompany me in, and not anyone else—I bought the bag—I do not think I claimed a pair of lace curtains—only an old pair was left in my house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 45, Dove Row, Shoreditch, and am a fountain pen manufacturer—I have known the prisoners for several years—about 12.15 on Saturday, August 6th, I was in Whiston Street by myself—I was struck from behind; I do not know by whom—Why Wheeler came up and said, "Come out of it," and at the same time he got hold me round the waistcoat pocket—I said, "Come out of it; you are one of them"—I meant he was one of the men who were going to set about me—he pretended to assist me—he said, "Come out of it," that was all—I gathered he meant come away from these fellows—he then demanded</p>

               <p>that he should be <hi rend="italic">weighed out</hi> for getting me out of this scrape—he said, "I want <hi rend="italic">weighing out</hi>"—that was practically a demand for money—I said I should not think of anything of the sort—he then struck me a savage blow in the eye, and wells and Wheeler got me round the neck and I was thrown to the ground; I felt their hands going round my pockets; I was kicked about the legs and body, and in the eye; although it is five weeks ago the scar and discoloration have not quite gone—I was unconscious when Mrs. Norton picked me up—I have since found out her name—there were several more fellows there; I only recognise the prisoners—Sawyer was among those who struck me when I was on the bridge—I lost my pin and a rather old silk handkerchief—I fetched two policemen and we went after the men, but they ran and disappeared into a house by the side of the Canal, and the policemen did not care about going into the house after them; it was a place where they can go through and come out into another street—on the following Monday I met Wheeler and Wells when I was going out for a cycle ride—I did not wait to hear what they said—I said, "I do not want to have anything to say to you." and I rode away to keep an appointment—I next saw the prisoners at the police station—I saw the police on Monday and mentioned the prisoners' names to them and the police knew them—I had no fight with Wheeler; I was carrying a parcel.</p>

I had just left my young lady's house; we had been for a walk; we paid no visits—I spoke about the second attack at the Police Court—the first thing that happened was a severe blow at the back of my head—I have the straw hat I was wearing at the time in Court—the blow staggered me; it did not exactly knock me down; I was just able to recover from it—it shook me a good deal—I do not know who delivered the blow—that was all that happened on the first attack—after that blow was struck I saw near me a tall fellow who looked as if he had had a military training, Sawyer, and Harry Brett—I gave Sawyer's name to the police, because I saw him after I was struck on the first occasion; there is no doubt about that—Wheeler then spoke to me, and shortly after I asked him who struck me—I did</p>

I heard last Friday that you wish you had not started the charge, and you would like to get us off only you have got to prosecute. You know, George, that we are innocent of the charge of robbing you. I would not have minded if you had charged me with assault. We now come up at the Old Bailey next month and you know Sawyer was not there at all, It will be five weeks we have done when we leave here. You know how our defence stands; we have not got much change and I hope you won't try and send us to prison for a long term because we are sure to get it if you don't try and get us out of it. George, if you had listened to Frank on that morning you would not have gone any further. Though I have lived in the same turning five years I never knew your name was Hanmer: I thought you came from Shoreditch when you said you knew me and all my brothers, else it would never have been like this. I had a drop of beer else I should have had more reason, and you know Frank had a drop. You can believe me or not when I say I did not know you, because Tom Harvey told me after<lb/>wards who you was. You can ask him, and no more did Frank till after. I thought I was doing good when I took you away. You know I never asked you for money if you speak the truth. I would not have cared, George; it won't do you no good to see us go to prison innocent, and I hope you will think it over and let me know good or bad. You can visit me if you like</hi>

I am the agent of M. de Gesne, who is a private gentleman in Paris—the prisoner is my representative there—I introduced him to M. de Gesne in March last, who had an antique commode for sale—the prisoner called upon me on March 7th with a gentle<lb/>man and asked to see it—the prisoner said he (the gentleman) was a customer, but he did not buy the commode—he then said he had another customer in London and that in order to show the commode to the customer it ought to be sent to him in London—I arranged to send it to my packer, which I did—on March 11th I received a letter from the prisoner saying that he had seen it—I arranged with him that if he sold the commode he was to have 5 per cent, commission—I asked 15,000 francs for it—I received a letter from the prisoner saying he had just declined an offer of £600 for it—I received another letter from him in which he said the commode was always at my disposal—I asked him to return it to me—that was on May 22nd—I had no idea that two days before that he had pawned it with Mr. Attenborough—I came to London and dis<lb/>covered that the prisoner had pawned it with Mr. Attenborough for</p>

I live at 47, Rue Blanche, Paris, and carry on business in Paris as a manufacturing chemist—I have a branch business at Great Titchfield Street, London—the prisoner was in my employment as manager of my London office during 1902 and 1903—the arrangement was that cheques received were to be paid to the Societe Generale here and I remitted as much money as was wanted to the Lon<lb/>don, City &amp; Midland Bank, Tottenham Court Road branch, for all expenses—as manager the prisoner had the superintendence of the col<lb/>lection of accounts due—beyond the money paid into the account at the Societe Generale I have never received any other moneys from the pris<lb/>oner—among my English customers there were two firms, namely, the American Dental Manufacturing Company and Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am employed by Dr. Bengue &amp; Co., at 91 Great Titchfield Street, and have been there since 1900—I produce our petty cash book, cash book and ledger—most of the entries are in my writing—the practice with regard to cheques used to be that the letters were opened by the prisoner; the cheques were handed to me, I entered them and the cheques were handed back to the prisoner—these entries represent all the sums I have received from him—the prisoner paid the cheques into the bank—I never paid any in—I have looked in the books for entries of the nine cheques in question—they do not appear there—they never came into my hands—I do not find any trace in the books of the three other cheques—I used to send all the accounts out, but the accounts to Mr. Porto and the American Dental Company were handed to the prisoner, as he wished to deliver them himself—he asked me to do so—in July, 1903, whilst I was away on my holiday, there was an amount of £27 6s. 3d. entered by the prisoner in the books as having been received from Mr. Porro—when I came back I crossed the amount out, as I had a doubt about it—no comment was made as to my doing that—on one occasion I found an account for the American Dental Company made out by the prisoner when I had already made one out and it did not correspond with mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have not got that account; it has got mislaid, not destroyed—it was not given to the prosecutor—the account as made out by the prisoner was for a period of two months, whereas mine was for quite a year—I kept the books—there was no other book-keeper—there was a Frenchman sent over; he was there a fortnight and I was there the whole time—he might have been there for a month: I have forgotten—he would write in the journal and make out invoices—he did not keep the cash book—at that time I was discharged on a Saturday at lunch time and asked to return to my duties on the following Monday—I believe I had a telegram on the Saturday—if the £27 6s. 3d. had been a correct amount, the prisoner should have entered it in the ledger—it is my duty to post up the ledger—if we received stamps and postal orders, the stamps were used for letters and the orders paid into the bank the same as the cheques—it was very seldom that postal orders were cashed and used to pay accounts with—it was done, but not always—it was for the purpose of petty cash for parcels post—in that case they never found their way into the bank account—on one or two occasions customers' cheques were, I believe, used, but not recently; it was never done to pay the firm's creditors with the money—the prisoner instead of paying the cheque into the bank would give me the money and cash it himself—that was not done frequently—I entered the amount in the cash book as "Cash received"—there were custom dues payable on some of the goods—the prisoner gave me the money to pay these—I cannot say that cheques were turned into money to pay these—I can only say that on two or three occasions customers' cheques were cashed by the prisoner for the purposes of the business generally—it is so long ago I can hardly remember—the largest amount paid to the customs would be about £4—I cannot remember one as big as £10.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). I have examined Dr. Bengue's books since the last hearing as to the inhalers—during 1902-3-4, twelve were sold at 65s.—that would be £39, less discount, roughly about £31—about four dozen were bought from the makers at 35s. each—the twelve would cost us about £21—I have also looked into the expense for printing the pamphlet that was produced last time—I find there is one receipt for £6 10s. and 18s. 6d. for the printing—that was paid by Dr. Bengue—I have looked all through the books and can find no trace since the new Arrangement of 1902 of an odd amount being received by me in cash and corresponding with any cheque entered in the books—where sums are entered in the receipt books I find corresponding entries in the cash book—moneys received by me in cash are always entered in the cash book—when I received petty cash from the prisoner I find from an ex<lb/>amination of Dr. Bengue's pass-book that moneys were invariably drawn out to the same amount at or after the time—the customs were all paid out of petty cash—I mostly had a balance of petty cash in hand.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Sergeant, Criminal Investigation Department</hi>). On Satur<lb/>day, July 29th, about 2.15 p.m, I went to 41, Dean Street, Soho, which is a newspaper shop occupied by Barberi—I saw him in the back room of the shop from which he came—on the counter I saw this copy of "L'lnsurrezione" (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I bought it—Barberi charged 6d. for it—I asked him if he had any more and he said, "That is the last for the present"—I was in plain clothes—the same day with Constable Kirchner I went to the shop about 2.45 and on the counter I saw thirteen copies of "L'lnsurrezione"—Barberi was behind the counter—I seized the copies and said to him, "Have you any more?"—he said, "No"—I said, "If you sell any more of these you will be prosecuted"—next day I went to 20, Manor Street, Chelsea, about 12.5—it is a barber's shop—I do not remember if there was any name over the door—I spoke to a woman in the passage—shortly afterwards Antonelli came to the door of his room at the back—in the room was a woman whom I now know as Delfina Rutizo—I made as if to go into the room and Antonelli put his arm across the doorway and prevented me, and Delfina stayed close to him—Detective Fitch was with me—I said, "We are police officers and we are making inquiries respecting this paper," showing him the copy which I had purchased the day before; "Are you the editor and the publisher of it?"—he replied, "Yes, I am"—I asked him where he had it printed and he replied, "In Switzerland and Geneva"—I asked him how many copies he had had printed and he said, "Two thousand"—I asked him to show me those still in his possession—he replied, "I distributed them all among my friends yesterday," and added that he had one copy left—I asked him to show it to me, which he did—I took it from him and, saying that I should keep it, I handed it to Fitch—Antonelli said, "You must not take it; that is the last copy I have left for myself"—I said, "Now you say you are the editor of this paper; where is your name on it?"—he said, "There," and pointed to the last column at the top of page 8—these other copies (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) are what I have seized—I said to him, "Then you are Adolfo Antonelli?"—I was reading from the paper and he said, "Yes, I am"—I said, "Where are the manuscripts relating to the articles in this journal?"—he said, "The printer has them. I have sent them all to him"—I said, "Which articles did you write in this paper?"—he replied, "I did not</p>

               <p>write any; I only corrected the grammatical mistakes and the printer's errors; the articles were all written by persons in Italy"—I asked him how much the paper had cost him, and he said he had not paid any<lb/>thing yet and that he did not know how much it would cost him for printing—I said, "How many copies did you leave with Barberi?"—he replied, "I do not know; I gave some to him and some to my friends who were in the shop yesterday"—I asked him for their names and he would not give them to me, but subsequently he said, "I gave some to Ranieri"—I again asked him to show me the copies which were in his possession and he said, "I distributed them yesterday in the anarchist centres"—I did not go into his room—he said he knew some<lb/>thing about the law and that I could not enter the room without his permission—on August 7th, about 11 p.m., I went to 41, Dean Street, with other officers and saw Barberi behind the counter—we said to him, "We have got a warrant for your arrest"—he requested it to be read, which was done by Sergeant Macbride—I spoke in English to him—he speaks English well—he said, "I am innocent. I have done no wrong"—we took him to Bow Street and he was detained until the following day—on August 8th I went to 20, Manor Street, and searched the premises—I did not find anybody there—the whole of the people with whom Antonelli lived had left, and the premises were entirely empty.</p>

I got my instructions to make enquiries from Scotland Yard—I have not yet visited the Italian Embassy or the Consul-General—when I had this conversation with Antonelli at his house I had no intention of arresting him—most of the conversation was in English, but I spoke a few words to him in French respecting his birthplace—I never warn persons when making enquiries—I had seized a great number of these papers on the previous day and had seen his name as a person to whom communications could be sent, but I knew it long before then.</p>

Barberi's shop in Dean Street is an ordinary newspaper shop; I suppose about 16 ft. by 12 ft in size—it was filled with all kinds of papers; there might have been ten or fifteen kinds of Italian papers there and about the same number of French, "Le Petit Journal," "Le Matin" and other harmless papers—some English papers were there also—Barberi has been there since the end of January—to all appearances his shop was a genuine one—I spoke English to him, which he speaks very well—the paper which I took first was being sold on the counter—when I told him that if he sold any more I should prosecute him, he knew that I was a police officer, but I told him that I was a police officer to make certain—I told him I should prosecute him if he sold the papers because I was carrying out my instructions—I did not tell him what I should prosecute him for, but he understood that distinctly—I did not hear him say that, as far as he knew, there was nothing wrong in selling the papers—I did not point out to him any objectionable or offensive parts—I did not tell him why he should not sell the papers.</p>

On Saturday, July 29th, between 11 and 13 a.m., I commenced keeping observation on Barberi's shop up to about 5.40 p.m.—I passed the shop several times—I did not see Riley go in—after about 2.45 I saw about twenty persons leave the shop with copies of "L'lnsurrezione"—about 6.30 I went to the shop with Riley and others and saw Barberi—I said to him, "Can I speak with you privately, Mr. Barberi?"—he said, "This is private enough for me. I know who you are"—I said, "I must speak with you"—he came to the back of the shop—I said to him interrogatively, "You have been selling a paper called 'L Insurrezione'"—he said, "Yes, but I have no more of it"—I said, "Who is the editor or printer of this paper?"—he said, "I do not know his name; you will find it in the paper, and your colleague, indicating Sergeant Riley, "has got one, I think"—I said, "But I want to know from you"—he replied, "I will tell you nothing"—I also said, "I want to know who brought the papers for sale"—he walked behind the counter—I said, "Since you will tell me nothing, I will find out for myself," and seeing that he appeared to be trying to hide something with his back, I looked in that direction and saw a number of the papers on a shelf behind the counter as if for sale, with several other lots of differ<lb/>ent papers—I took them—Barberi tried to prevent me reaching them, but as he saw I was determined to have them, he did not offer any strong resistance—I found that there were forty copies of the paper—I searched the shop and afterwards the rooms—on searching the shop Barberi did not appear to like the trouble the search would cause and said, "Now</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190509120059"/>
               <p>I will tell you. Antonelli brought the papers here, and about an hour ago he took them away"—it was then 7.15—he said that Antonelli had brought them at 2 o'clock—I said, "How do you account for the posses<lb/>sion of those I have just seized?"—he hesitated an instant and said, "Antonelli brought them all here"—I asked him the price and he said, "Some pay a penny, others twopence, others sixpence and some a shilling. There is no price. Since I was cautioned to-day I have sold very few, perhaps five or six"—I said I had seen several leave the shop—he said, "They were distributed by Antonelli"—there was a man named Ranieri in the shop—he had some papers in his hand—I said, "What have you got there?"—he did not wish me to see them—I said, "I will see," and he let me see them—they were five copies of "L'Insur<lb/>rezione"—he said he got them from Antonelli—on August 7th a warrant was granted and a communication made to the Southampton police—on August 8th I went to Southampton with Sergeant Macnamara and there found Antonelli detained—I said, "I have a warrant for your arrest"—he smiled and seemed rather pleased to see me, and asked if I was about to take him to London—I said "By and bye"—before I did so I saw Emilie Sala at 17, Council Buildings, Southampton—on her table there I saw a letter, the envelope being addressed to Madam Sala—it was partly opened and "Caro Antonelli" was showing—the letter had an address on it which I took a note of, 87, Patshull Road, Kentish Town—after I saw the letter at Sala's I went back to Antonelli and took him up to London—in the train I said, "Do not you wish to have the warrant read?"—he shrugged his shoulders as if with an air of indifference and said, "Yes, read it"—I did so and he said, "All right, I understand what you have read" or "what you are reading. I do not know whether the immorality or incitation comes to assassination in my paper"—he said that in Eng<lb/>lish—he afterwards said that the paper was printed in Switzerland; the proofs were sent to him by post, he corrected them and returned them by the same means—he did not say how he came to be in Southampton—he said that two comrades came to London on Sunday and he passed the day with them, but he would not say their names—the Southampton police handed me some property—Antonelli was taken to Bow Street police station—on the 9th I went to 87, Patshull Road, and found this trunk (<hi rend="italic">Pro<lb/>duced</hi>) and took possession of it—I was present when the two prisoners were charged at Bow Street—Antonelli made no reply and Barberi said, "I do not know anything about it. I only put the papers in my shop. An<lb/>tonelli brought them"—I searched the trunk and found in it a number of documents and papers, including Exhibit No. 1 and a passport in the name of Adolfo Antonelli, which purports to be signed by him—also a number of photographic negatives from which Exhibit a was printed—I was not there when it was done, but I have the negative—it shows the two prisoners—I also found this portrait, which purports to be of Gaetano Bresci, headed July 29th, 1900: "Who, comprehending in his heart all the tears and the hatred of the mothers, wives and children of the massacred by the royal lead in the butchery of Sicily and Milan, taught the cowards how the murderers of the people ought to be punished"—that is in English</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">admitted that Exhibit No.</hi> 1 <hi rend="italic">was in Antonelli's writing</hi>]—the letter beginning, "Delfina mia" is in the same writing—the writing on Exhibit 3, which is part of an identifica<lb/>tion certificate, resembles that of Antonelli, but I will not speak to it with, certainty; the signature on the other side is undoubtedly his—the photo<lb/>graph to Delfina also bears Antonelli's writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 13, Walcot Gardens, Kensington, and am well ac<lb/>quainted with Italian—I have before me prints of "L'Insurrezione" which I have made a translation of—on page 20 of the translation there is a pas<lb/>sage, "July 29th, 1900-1905. To Gaetano Bresci, who by the spontaneous sacrifice of his own liberty, freed Italy from that crowned monster Humbert I. To Gaetano Bresci, who alone amongst the general cowardliness knew how to rise and strike the murderer of the starved ones of Italy. To our heroic companion, barbarously murdered in the prison of St. Stephen by the order of the deformed Emanuel III., we send to day—the fifth anniversary of the event—our sincere salutations as fighters with the ardent desire, the firm determination to follow him, as quickly as possible, on the way, by him so brightly marked out—to rebellion. Hail!! The anarchists of the Insurrection"—to the best of my knowledge that is perfectly correct—on page 1 I find the English heading of the paper, "London, July 29th, 1905," and the motto, "The future we are Thought and Dynamite," then "The Insurrection." "A single number issued by a group of anarchists. Price 10 centmi, to go to funds of revolutionary propaganda"—then follows the translation of an article called Insurrection, and on page 4 I find, "It is necessary that, taught by experience of past abortive move<lb/>ments, by all those sad episodes in which the flesh of the children of the people was torn to strips by the bullets in the service of tyranny, the people should be taught that to the arms of the soldier a more intelligent answer should be given than cobblestones"—a little lower down, "To</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190509120062"/>
               <p>reach all this we have need of efficacious means and of firm and daring deeds. Those who are willing must arm themselves and be of one accord as to the work to be undertaken, so that when the people, pushed by hunger or by any other reason to enter the public squares to make their usual protests, may be found ready to face the situation and to initiate with decision the action against the class which detains the social riches. Arms and every ex<lb/>plosive material must, under these circumstances, be furnished to the people, teaching them by word and example, where and how the employ of such means may have useful results for the revolutionary cause"—on page 5, "Let the monarchy of the thieves of Savoy be removed from the bloody throne of Italy, and with her also fall the monarchies of other States, by the violent action of the people made to rise by the spur of the anarchists. Let us begin by throwing down the first obstacle when we have overthrown the thrones and trodden under foot the altars, then we shall think of the rest"—on page 6 there is, "Procure arms, have at your disposal all the most modern discoveries of science which may secure you the victory in the struggle against the bulwarks of the <hi rend="italic">bour<lb/>geoisie</hi> tyrants. And when the hour of the final rising will strike, when we shall feel strong and decided, let us descend on the squares, arms in hand. Let the streets be again barricaded. Let dynamite help in the work of destruction and annihilation by being employed in blowing up every edifice which would afford a shelter to any man belonging to the class that reigns and despoils us; and also every man who forsakes our class to become a puppet of the other party. You who are willing to work, wherever the spark may come from, be it from frozen Russia of the gal<lb/>lows and of the knout, from Spain of the modern inquisitor, from the hypocritical Republic France, or from Italy, made miserable and sad by the tyranny of the brigands of Savoy, wherever the mass of workers which rebels against the yoke which oppresses it, wherever begins the resurrection of the people, wherever the insurrection may break out, there with arms in hand we shall be found. (Sd.) Those of the In<lb/>surrection"—then follows an article called, "An Open Letter," and on page 9, "If under the leaden yoke of servility, which weighs on all and everything, if in this great and servile tragedy, within which generous hearts are suffering in vain oppressed by the cowardice of the many, if from time to time did not shine the flash of the dagger, or if the sound of the menacing bomb was not heard, or if a handful of men did not hoist the red flag where, being stronger than opposition, they could use the rifle, then indeed would our souls be desperately deprived of every thread of hope"—I have missed out in the translation some words; it should read, "Or if a handful of men did not hoist the red flag where oppression is most atrocious and rather than to delay the use of the rifle, then in<lb/>deed would our souls be desperately deprived of every thread of hope"—later on I find an article headed, "To thee, O Soldier! "and on page 25 I find, "The army serves to defend the masters, the capitalists, and the idle from the recognised representations of the workmen who have been despoiled, and from the wretched starving people"—on page 26</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190509120063"/>
               <p>I find, "On that day, the day of the Insurrection of the people against their tyrants, you know what you must do if you wish us to again con<lb/>sider you as a brother: Desert the ranks—unite yourself to those whom with you have a life of common miseries, and fire—yes, fire—but remember that those on whom you must fire are not those insufficiently covered by rags, but those wearing gold lace and decorations; they are not your brothers, but your tyrants. Soldier, in front of the rising people, before the advancing future, to-day, to-morrow, for ever, on every occasion your sole duty is to desert the ranks and fire on your officers, and on the enemies of the people. Soldier, up with your rifle—grasp the hand which your fellow worker extends to you and shout with us 'Hurrah for the Social Revolution'"—I think "Up with your rifle" means "Pointed in the air"—the next article is headed "War—Country and Social Democracy," and on page 29 I find a paragraph, "And the coun<lb/>try? Who knows it? Ask all those dead from hunger and bullets, the homeless, and the wanderers in all lands in search of that bread which their country denied them. They alone can tell you. We pride our selves on being those who have given up all; we know no country we consider as much as a brother a man born in Italy as one born in Russia or Patagonia"—on page 35 I find, "To those comrades who receive this sole number we warmly recommend—to circulate it especially in Italy—to let us know at least with a post-card that they have received it, so that we may know that their address is of service, and to send us at once the amount realised, if the propaganda initiated by us can be useful, and if they wish that we should continue it with other numbers, by pamphlets, open and otherwise, of frankly revolutionary propaganda. For all matters concerning the editing and administration of this num<lb/>ber, the address is Adolfo Antonelli, 20, Manor Street, Chelsea, London"—amongst the list of subscribers I find "Southampton, E. Sala, 3, 6"—at the very end of the paper there is a kind of general invitation by the companions, interested in the anarchist propaganda to attend a pri<lb/>vate meeting on Thursday, August 3rd, in the meeting place of the P.S.I. in Charlotte Street, "The editor of 'L'Insurrezione' will be present from 8.30 to 12.30 of the same evening"—there are two slips relating to the circulation of "L'Insurrezione" through Italy—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is a letter to "My Delfina" from Southampton, dated August 6th: "I left this morning at 8 and arrived here at 10.30 and was pleasantly received by these comrades. They tell me that I can easily and quickly embark. Have courage, then, and hope that your Adolfo will be able to get a situation and have you again by his side. For my part I earnestly desire it and anxiously await the moment when I shall be able to embrace you tightly. As these comrades had not sleeping room for me in their house I hired a room at four shillings and although they wished to pay for it I paid myself. I have my meals, and good ones, with them, but I wish, if possible, to pay my own lodging. Perhaps to-morrow I shall go to work as extra hand in a kitchen for a week, and thus be able to earn at least a sovereign. Send me as soon as possible clean handkerchiefs, socks and my shirt; if I can I will buy some things here. I hope that by now</p>

Wish me well as I wish you well, be calm and accept a good kiss from yours always, Adolfo"—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is a portion of a newspaper "II Grido della Folia" dated March 18th, 1905, which reads:". After the tragedy of Monza. bourgeosie—reactionaries and social reformers—sang the praises of the deceased and railed against Bresci. The newspaper 'I'Avanti' said, 'As individualist anarchists are wild beasts they must be treated as wild beasts'. But if Bresci was a wild beast for having killed a man, we do not know what epithet to apply to the Czar."—those are extracts and not in sequence—there is another extract from the same paper, "Under the auspices of a few anarchists in London, will shortly be published the sole number of 'L' Insurrezione' which, putting aside every question of theory and tendency, will wage a vigorous war in favour of revolutionary tactics, preaching the necessity for action and the conceptions which will inform it.

In August last I was staving at the Golden Cross Hotel, Charing Cross—on August 10th, about 9 p.m., I met Mabel Fyson in Piccadilly—she was a stranger—I took her to supper—subsequently I drove her in a cab about the West End—I parted from her about 11.45 p.m. at my hotel—I had £15 in gold in the hip pocket of my trousers or about £17 altogether; also a watch, and a chain, and a cigar cutter, attached to the chain—the watch was of rolled gold, worth about £5, and £3 the chain—when I got back to the hotel I missed the watch, chain, a cheque book, and a bag—I had spent in her company roughly about £2 after 9 o'clock, and during supper at a West End hotel, near the Pavilion, in Coventry Street—the gold was in a London &amp; South Western Bank bag—I had silver and copper in my trousers pocket—all these things were missing when I got back to my hotel—I had not given them to her, I gave her a sovereign—my cheque book was in the same pocket as the money—I never took it out of my pocket—it was removed feloniously—I never felt it go—the money in my other trousers pocket was not taken—I had spare cash I used for payment for the supper, etc., and a sovereign—I next saw these articles when the police showed them to me—when I had supper I was not drunk—I drank whiskey and soda—I had not been drinking during the day more than what I had had at lunch; I had taken very little during the day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the licensee of the Phene Arms, Phene Street, Chelsea—about 7 p.m. on Friday, May 19th, I was in my bar parlour with my wife when I saw through the glass panels of the door the prisoner walk downstairs towards the kitchen—I went to the top of the staircase and shouted to him, "What the devil are you doing down there?"—he turned round, and fell down the remaining part of the stairs—he did not make any reply—he afterwards said that he was sorry, but he had made a mistake—I told him he had no right there, and to get out of it—the next thing was I received this plaint note (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) for injuries received, and I attended at the Brompton County Court on July 25th—I heard the prisoner give evidence, when he was afterwards cross-examined by my solicitor, who asked him if he had ever been in trouble, and he said, "No"—being hard pressed, he admitted he had done two months for felony at the Middlesex Sessions in 1887—he was asked if he had been sentenced to two months at the Westminster Police Court, which he denied—he was then asked if he had been convicted in 1891 at the North London Sessions, when he had got nine months, and he said, "No"—he was then asked if he had been in trouble in 1892, when he had got sixteen months for stealing lead at the North London Sessions, and he said, "No"—he was asked if he had been convicted at the North London Sessions at all, and he said, "No"—he also said he had never been in trouble nor in prison since 1887—the case was completed that day, and there was a verdict for the prisoner—it was tried by a Jury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was a verdict of £40 and £31 16s. 6d. taxed costs, which money has been paid into Court and remains there—I cannot tell you what Mr. Humphreys, my solicitor, has done with regard to applications for a new trial—I believe at the conclusion of the case my solicitor asked for a new trial and the Judge declined to grant one—on a subsequent day another application was made by counsel on my behalf, but that was refused—I believe it is already settled that I am to have a new trial—I am desirous of obtaining one—I know I should get my money back if there were a new trial and the verdict were in my favour—I am here to get a conviction against the prisoner for perjury in order that I may get a new trial—I do not know if I will get one—the main object of this prosecution is to prove that the prisoner was on my premises for an unlawful purpose, and to get a conviction—I swore in my information that I heard the prisoner swear he had not been convicted on December 29th, 1892—I believe it was December 19th—I have not refreshed my memory since—I</p>

I am an accountant, of 8, Sarsfield Road, Balham—I attended the Brompton County Court on July 15th as an expert in drawing plans—I drew plans of Mr. Hamilton's premises for the purposes of the action—I heard the prisoner give evidence and cross-examined as to his past by Mr. Humphreys, Mr. Hamilton's solicitor—he was asked if he had ever been in trouble and he said, "No"—he was asked if he had ever been convicted of any offence and he said, "No"—he denied being convicted in December, 1887, but after repeated questions he seemed to recollect it—he denied being convicted in January, 1890, at the Westminster Police Court, when he got three months, in 1891 at the North London Sessions, nine months, and in 1892, at the same Sessions, sixteen months for stealing lead—he was asked if he had ever been con<lb/>victed at the North London Sessions, and he said, "No"—the last question Mr. Humphreys put to him was whether he had been convicted since 1887, and he totally denied it—Mr. Moyses put the same question to him in the re-examination, and he emphatically denied it.</p>

I happened to pass by several persons walking into Leaden-hall Street and when a young fellow suddenly turned round and dashed into me, we both fell over. He did not seem to take any notice, so I turned my head to see who it was; no sooner did I turn my head than the lady catches hold of me and accuses me of stealing her purse. I told her she had made a mistake and showed her my hands. She be<lb/>gan to shout and I was frightened I should get locked up for nothing, so I ran away. When I was brought back the lady said the gentleman picked her purse up in an opposite direction and gave it to her. The constable asked her to charge me and she said she did not want to, two or three times. The man who caught me said he was there when the lady accused me of stealing her purse, but he said he never saw me with <hi rend="italic">no</hi> purse, and he ran after me when he saw me run away. He caught me and said he never saw me drop a purse, but he was close to me; and the lady herself says she never saw me with her purse. She suspected me because I was closest to her. I never had the purse in my possession."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence on oath, said that he was going down Ald<lb/>gate when he passed by several persons; that a man turned round suddenly and dashed into him; that on turning his head the prosecutrix accused him of stealing a purse and, on his denying it, screamed; that having just done three months in prison, he thought he was going to be arrested for nothing and ran away.</hi>

I should like a clean glass. I have dropped a crumb or two in this and I do not like it"—I said I would wash it, and took it to the kitchen to do so—the moment I got in there he was in there too, and grasped my mouth with his hand, so that I could not make a noise—the other one then came in and they tied my hands with this piece of green cord (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), and with this piece of white cord (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) they tied my feet—there was no cord like it about the shop—I did not notice anything put over my mouth but the man's hand—they said they would cut my throat if I did not tell them where my money was and I said, "I will, if you let me free"—they went away and left me bound on the floor—I reached and got a knife and cut the cord round my ankles, and freed myself—I went out into the shop and into the parlour, and missed a sovereign that I had left on the parlour table; it was not the sovereign that the men had given me—I found this piece of calico (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) hanging on the inside handle of the door, which was open—I think the prisoner is the man who came in first and went out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am agent to Mr. Tildersley, of 108, Great Western Road, Paddington—he was the trustee of 24, Portsdown Road, of which Mrs. Tabor became the tenant at Michaelmas, 1896—she occupied it up to September, 1902, when my connection with the premises ended—the rent was £63 a year, and I think it was a five or seven years' agreement—I went to the house from time to time, when I saw her, her daughter, Miss Tabor, her husband, and occasionally Garner, who was a lodger there, I imagine—Mr. Tabor was an invalid to a great extent; he was very infirm—Mrs. Tabor told me she had lodgers—the rent was paid up to 1902 by quarterly instalments, sometimes in arrear—in 1902 the property was assigned by the trustees to a person who ultimately became entitled to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corn merchant, of 3, Brookfield Road, South Hackney—in June of this year the prisoner came to me, and I entered into a verbal arrangement with him that he should sell hay and corn for me on commission, the orders to be brought to me, executed and invoiced by me—he was to collect at the end of the month after the bill was delivered, and hand the payments over to me—for that he was to receive 1 1/2 d. per quarter for oats, and 2s. 6d. for each load of hay of from thirty-five to forty trusses, when the customers paid the accounts—on July 8th and 18th I received two orders from Mr. Izzard amount<lb/>ing to £16 4s. 2d.—I sent the invoice to him at the end of the month with my name upon it—on July 12th the prisoner gave me another order to the amount of £12 to Mr. Bruce, in consequence of which I supplied the goods and sent the invoice—on July 17th I received another order from the prisoner for £4 3s. 9d. from Mr. James—that was executed, and I sent him the invoice—on June 22nd I executed an order to the amount of £10 1s. 7d. to Mr. John Wood, and sent him the invoice—I have never received any of the money either from or through the prisoner—on August 8th I received from the prisoner a cheque for £4, and a note saying he would see me the following day, Wednesday—it was in his writing—I was at the seaside at the time, and, thinking it was of no consequence, the note was torn up—between that and August 11th I wrote to him two post-cards asking him for immediate attendance at my place, but they were not replied to, nor did he call—on August 11th I went to his house and saw him—I asked him the reason he did not come to see me—he made no satisfactory reply—he said he declined to go into business that night—I then asked him whether he had received any money, and I went through each of the four accounts with him—he said he had received no money from either of them—I told him that I had called upon one man, Izzard,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190509120083"/>
               <p>and had seen the receipt—I asked him if he had taken the others, and he said, "No"—that was all that I knew of anything wrong at that time—when I said, "I know you have Izzard's, because I have seen the re<lb/>ceipt," he still denied it—he said he would see me the following Saturday at 4 o'clock—he neither came nor wrote, nor did he send me any money—I then placed the matter in the hands of my solicitor—I received this post-card on the 17th, which is in his writing, by the first post, he having been arrested the previous day, I think: "Please send on statement of account between us"—there had been no question of account be<lb/>tween us—the things were sold by me to the customer whose name he gave me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know that the prisoner had been a corn dealer on his own account—presumably he had a connection of his own—he told me he was a commission agent—I did not know that he had been in business for himself—he gave the names of James, Wood, and others as persons who had been customers of his—some previous accounts were paid, but they had nothing to do with this account—I wrote this post-card to the prisoner, dated April 7th, 1905: "Dear Sir,—Send all hay orders direct to my carman, Grover; he has orders to execute them promptly. Oat orders you must forward to me"—may I explain that? I was out at the time, and we had trucks of hay ready for delivery which my carman had instructions to deal with, but the oats he knew nothing about, and required instructions from me—that was an exception to the role that all orders were to be sent to me—I wrote that from Margate—there was no exception to the commission being due when the money was paid—there Was a book which the prisoner used to bring to me to make up—you have it—it was produced at the Police Court—I produced it to the prisoner every time he asked for it to-make up his commission account—on August 11th I went to see him at his house in Shacklewell Lane—I went to tell him that he had received money which I had not got, but it was not necessarily an angry interview—I cannot remember any temper being shown—I do not think we had disagreeable words—you may be sure I would not be very pleased with him, but I cannot remember being very cross with him; I taxed him with the facts, and left-him very quickly, but nothing very serious took place—I did not go out of the house and say, "You are a thief"—I put the matter into the hands of my solicitor on the 12th or the 14th, and got the post-card referred to on the morn<lb/>ing of the 17th, and I gave it to my solicitor—I do not remember the prisoner paying me £16.</p>

Dear Sir,—I shall be able to resume work Thursday morning. Yours obediently, W. Anderson"—I had one letter before that that got burnt—he left on Saturday, the 13th, and I got a letter on the 15th, saying that he had seen the doctor, and that he should not be able to attend business yet—the letter produced I received about the 17th—he did not return, nor again communicate with us—no reason was given—about a week afterwards I found plated chains placed in the window amongst the gold ones—they were substituted to nil up the gap—in consequence of what I found I communicated with Mr. Spikins—stock was afterwards taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, of 305, Old Kent Road—Anderson was in my employment as assistant in July and August, 1904—in consequence of a communication I received on August 25th, 1904, I went and examined my stock—I missed 33 silver watches, 18 gold, 275 rings, 38 gold chains, 31 gold brooches, 8 metal watches, 27 gold charms, and 21 gold bracelets—the total value of the stock missing is £434 14s. 3d.—I have been shown a diamond ring, a chain ring, and a gold watch—they are my property, and down in the list as having been stolen—the chain ring has my stock number and the cost—it was made for me, and has my initials inside—the diamond ring has the number and the cost roughly filed out of it; I applied acids to it, and that brought</p>

Tanner, and says, "Please supply 12 reams 48 lb. D. Demy, as sample. For C. F. Hodgson &amp; Son, A. C.

I am a doctor, practising at 17, Compton Street, Highbury—about 5 p.m. on August 7th I saw the prosecutor at the Upper Street police station—I examined him and found a deep cut over his left eyebrow—there was a slight incised wound across the eyelid, a slight cut on the left ear, and two or three slight cuts about the finger—I stitched, the big wound—I could not then tell whether the eye was destroyed—great, force had been used—the prosecutor was under the influence of drink when I saw him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cashier to Richard Mills and Company, Ltd., of 19, Liverpool Street, fishmongers and poulterers—on May 26th I was in the office, at the desk part of it—there are two clerks, my sister Nessie and myself, and we both act as cashiers—on that day the prisoners came in and each made a small purchase of fish—it is the practice in the shop that when a customer makes a purchase the salesman calls out the price—the customer then comes to the desk and pays; there is no bill—Patrach came to my desk, the salesman having called out the amount of her pur<lb/>chase—I do not remember what it was—it was less than 1s.—she tendered a sovereign and put it on the desk, and I put 19s. odd on the desk and picked up the sovereign—both prisoners then started speaking to me in French—they had both come to the desk window—I do not remember what Ferrai's purchase amounted to, but the amount had been called out—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190509120095"/>
               <p>it came to 2d. or 3d.—I do not understand French—all I could understand the prisoners to say was, "Take for two, take for two, we pay <hi rend="italic">sil</hi>, give back gold"—they were, excited and waving their parcels about as if to confuse me, and one nearly touched my face—I put the sovereign back on the desk; the change had not then been taken up—in the confusion Patrach paid me for both in silver—I do not recollect if any change was given to her then—I got confused and they took up the sovereign and the silver and went out—directly they had gone I realised what had happened and I asked Mr. Mills if I might check the till and I found that it was 19s. and some pence short—the till is a National Cash Register—when the prisoners were arrested I was away on my holiday—I went for my holiday on August 14th and returned on the 28th—upon that day I was taken to the Guildhall—I there saw the prisoners among ten other women and I at once recognised them as the two women who came in on May 26th—all the women there were dark—I think they were English.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. O'CONNOR</hi>. I suppose they were in the shop on May 26th for three or four minutes—I took no notice of them until they came to the desk—they were at the opening in the front of the desk for three or four minutes—there was a lot of confusion—ours is a busy shop—about 300 people come to the counter every day—there is plate glass in front of the counter with wood work under the counter—in the glass there is an opening through which I speak to customers and pay back change—when I picked up the sovereign I put it into the till—Patrach did not pick up the change at once, not until I had given her the sovereign back—I did not see her pick up the change—I did not notice what she took up, but I know she took them both up, because I put them both down—I did not think everything was right until after they had left the shop—I felt confused about it—there was nobody else in the shop at the time—I spoke to Mr. Mills directly they had left the shop—it took five or ten minutes to make up the till—We communicated with the police three or four hours afterwards—I could have recognised the prisoners through the glass, but I saw them through the opening—I do not know how many pence the till was wrong—we do not keep the records—the till is wrong 1/2 d. or 1d. on three or four days a week—some days it is short, some days it is over—on occasions it is 1s. or 2s. or 2s. 6d. wrong—the till has keys in a row for 1/2 d., 1d., shillings and pounds—if a person purchases something which comes to 7d. and I press the 9d. key it would be 2d. wrong—mistakes might arise by my pressing the shilling key instead of the penny key, but I should see it registered 1s., because the register comes up—a key could not be pressed by my leaning across them—the mistake can only be a question of touching the wrong key—if the machine gets out of order it is no good—the women who came into the shop on May 26th could not make themselves well understood in English—I understood what they said in English—they said a great deal in French which I did not understand—the amount registers itself inside the till and at the end of the day we check the money to see if we are short—the money ought to agree with the register except for a £5 balance which we start with—it is very seldom as much as 1s. out—the till does not close itself—I have to close it, but I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190509120096"/>
               <p>did not do so because Patrach started talking before I had time to do so—when you press the key you open the till, but if you want to open it without registering any money you have to make a no-sale—I cannot close the till until I have given the change—I close it directly I have finished with the customer—if a person came in and paid a sovereign, the amount of the purchase being 6d., I should want to give them 19s. 6d.—I should press the 6d. key and the till drawer would open—I should take the change out, pick up the sovereign, put it into the sovereign box in the drawer and shut it—I did all that on this day except close the drawer—the sov<lb/>ereign drawer is locked and I have to get a key to open it—the key was hanging on the wall just at my back—you cannot unlock it by pressing the sovereign key again—I always make a rule of taking out the change before I pick up people's money—at the Police Court on August 28th I did not notice that the prisoners were very much darker than they are now—I think they wore ordinary hats; I have seen plenty of them in the East End—all the women were dark when I identified the prisoners—I should think they were all English, but I did not look at them—I recog<lb/>nised the prisoners at once—I heard their solicitor protest in Court that it was not fair to identify dark women from among white women—[<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. O'CONNOR</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">stated that he thought the prisoners were Spanish</hi>]—I knew the prisoners at once because they are very peculiar looking, and I had a bother with them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LYONS</hi>. I saw the prisoners in the cells with their hats on, but they were not the same kind of hats which they were wearing in May—I do not know what kind of hats the other women in the cells had on—I do not remember what the silver coin was that Patrach gave me—we did not keep the record at the end of the day—I do not have to touch any pressing down key to unlock the sovereign box, only the key to the box—I always close the till after each purchase.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Except on this occasion I have never known the till to be 19s. wrong or anything like it—when it is a few pence wrong it is because I have given the wrong change—it does not show any fault with the till.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sister to the last witness and in the service of Messrs. Mills &amp; Company—I was in the cashier's office on May 26th, when I saw the prisoners come into the shop—they came to the desk to pay, Patrach coming first—I do not remember how much she had to pay, but it was less than a shilling—she offered a sovereign, which she put on the desk in front of my sister, who registered the amount in the till and took the change out, which she put on the counter in front of Patrach—my sister put the sovereign into the till—Patrach said, "No, no," and asked in broken English for her sovereign back, which my sister gave her—I understood Patrach to say sovereign, but she did not say it like an English person would—I saw Patrach pick up the silver and the sovereign Do—Ferrai was standing by at the time—they both flourished their parcels about a good deal, but Patrach paid for both purchases—Patrach said, "Take for two; take for two"—they both went away with the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190509120097"/>
               <p>sovereign and the change—on August 19th they came in about 6 p.m. and made a purchase and came up to the desk—I did not see them come in—when I looked up they were standing in front of my desk—I recognised them as the two women who came in on May 26th—I spoke to Mr. Mills at once, who stood up in the office, and when they went away he went outside and stood in the shop—the women stood outside the shop and then went away, and Mr. Mills followed them—I next saw the prisoners at the Guildhall on the following Monday—I gave evidence against them.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. O'CONNOR</hi>. I saw Patrach take up the sovereign and the silver on May 26th—I saw the women through the opening in the cash desk—my sister was sitting there, but I could see through too—they stayed in front of the desk for a minute or two—I cannot say if there were any other customers in the shop at the time—my sister and I had a very strong suspicion that the prisoners had stolen something before they left the shop, and we appealed to the till to be positive—I said to my sister, "Has that woman got your sovereign?"—she went on giving Patrach the change—I do not know if she made any answer to me—she was doubt<lb/>ful although I warned her of the woman—I did not tell Mr. Mills; I did not hear my sister tell him—I do not think he heard what I said to my sister—if I am talking in one direction people in another cannot hear—we were both suspicious of the woman having the sovereign and the change, but it is not safe to turn round and swear people have taken money before you are certain—the amount of the purchase was called out; my sister registered it on the till—the sovereign was taken, but not tested—she would put this sovereign in the till and take the change out, but she would not then necessarily close the till—we never touch the money at our place until we have given the change—supposing a sovereign is put on the desk, we should register the amount, take the change out, put it down, and then pick the sovereign up—the till was not closed on this occasion because we should have to register "No sale" to open it again, and we did not have to do that—I do not know if a key was used to unlock the drawer—the sovereign was put into the till by putting it through a little slit, but it can be taken out by being unlocked with an ordinary key kept on the wall—I cannot say if it was used on that day—I think I said at the Police Court, "I realised she had got the silver, but I had not realised that she had got the sovereign"—I was doubtful and did not realise it sufficiently to make a strong point and keep her—immediately after the woman had left the shop the till was made up—it had previously been made up over night and checked—when I saw the prisoners in the shop on August 19th I was certain they were the same women who had been in on May 26th—I was in the desk; they were outside—I cannot say how they were dressed in May—I do not remember the colour of their clothes; I recognised them by their general appearance—I have never identified anybody before at a Police Court—we have 460 or 500 customers in the shop daily—I think I am very good at identification—I have no idea of the height of the two women who came into the shop in May.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing director to Richard Mills &amp; Company, Ltd.—I was in the shop on Friday, May 26th, when the prisoners came in—I recognise them, undoubtedly—I was in the office—I saw them come to the cashier's desk—Patrach put a sovereign down to pay for some goods she had bought and stated in broken English the amount the cashier was to take, but I do not remember how much that was—the sovereign was picked up by the cashier, Miss Kate Loughton, and the change put into her hand or on to the indiarubber mat—at the same time Ferrai came along and in broken English said, "Take for two; take for two"—they were both waving their parcels in the office before the clerk's face—Patrach said, "Give me my <hi rend="italic">sov</hi> back, I pay you <hi rend="italic">sil"</hi>—in the confusion the clerk handed back the sovereign, apparently neglecting to ask Patrach for the silver, and she immediately paid for what they had purchased with a silver coin, and they both went out—immediately they went out we had some conversation and Miss Kate Loughton asked that the till should be checked, which was done, and to the best of my belief it was a sovereign wrong—it is very often a halfpenny or a penny short or a few coppers, through giving wrong change—on one occasion I believe it was 7d. out, but undoubtedly never a sovereign—I saw the prisoners again on Saturday, August 19th—I was sitting in the office when I was asked a question by one of my clerks—I immediately got up and saw two women, whom I recognised as the prisoners—when I went to the police station on May 26th I gave an exact description of them—on August 19th they were at the cashier's desk—when they left the shop I waited until they got a little way up Liverpool Street—I spoke to a constable, but seeing that they were likely to get away I crossed Liver<lb/>pool Street, got in front of them and spoke to a second constable—while I was doing so they arrived opposite where we were standing and saw me speaking to the constable—they turned round and ran down Bishops<lb/>gate Street and turned down Camomile Street—the constable was in uniform—the prisoners ran fast—I ran after them and when I came up with them two constables were just behind me—the prisoners had run 200 or 300 yards—they were stopped by the police—they said nothing in English—they were charged for stealing this money on May 26th—at the station there was an officer who understood French.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. O'CONNOR</hi>. I gave a description of the prisoners at Bishopsgate Street station on May 26th—I do not know the difference between foreign and English garments—I have been in France and seen the headgear in country parts—they were not wearing that sort of thing—I do not know by their clothes whether they were London made—I do not remember the costume they were in when they came to the shop—I sat in my seat at the counter the whole time they were there—there</p>

               <p>is thick plate glass directly in front of me, but I saw them through the opening—I was sitting about 5 feet from them—the desk intervened between myself and the plate glass and I was about 3 feet from the window—the opening at the pay desk is about 18 inches wide and 18 or 24 inches high—I stood up directly the confusion began and examined the women closely through the opening—I do not remember Miss Nessie Loughton saying to her sister, "Has that woman got your sovereign?"—if I had been listening I could have heard anything she said to her sister—at the time the conversation took place I had no idea anything wrong was going on in the shop—I did not see the sovereign actually put down, but the moment the confusion was caused I looked up—the sovereign may then have been in the cashier's hand or on the desk—I do not remember what was being done when my attention was called, but there was a lot of confusion and bad English and patois—I heard the woman ask for the sovereign back and saw it handed to her—the first thing I heard was the "Take for two" business, then I saw the waving parcels and so on—I will not say I was suspicious, but my attention was called to it, and I stood up to see what was going on—the next thing I saw was the pay<lb/>ment by a silver coin—I do not know what the coin was—I saw the prison<lb/>ers at the counter for about a minute; it may have been two or three—I leaned forward to see what was going on—I do not know if the sovereign was ever put into the till; I do not know that the cashier stood up—there is a key for the till in my possession, or hanging on a nail, or pinned on my desk—if Miss Loughton wanted to open the gold drawer she could take the key down—having my full confidence, she uses it—both the Misses Loughton have my full confidence—I do not know if either of them took the key down—if she wanted some half-sovereigns to give change she could take them out of the till drawer—I do not know how often she takes down the key for the gold box; it is her business, not mine—she may do it once or a thousand times a day—I do not know if anybody was being served in the shop at this time—there may have been one or two, but certainly not thirteen or fourteen—if you suggest that it is impossible that Miss Kate Loughton could take the key down without Attracting my attention, I most emphatically deny it—she does not have to leave her seat to take the key down—both ladies have been in my employ two years—it is owing to their great integrity that they both have my full confidence—they deal with something like £500 or £600 a week, and there has never been anything wrong—immediately after the sovereign was taken the change would be given—I am certain that I saw the change put down—I do not know how much it was—I do not know if I have said that the first thing I saw was the cashier giving back the sovereign—I do not remember if the till has ever been wrong to the extent of 2s.—it may have been in years gone by—if the sovereign was put in the till the cashier would get it out with the key hanging on the wall—if Miss Kate Loughton says the till has been 2s. wrong I should say yes; she has more knowledge than I—tapping the key for the pounds would not register the amount wrong—it would take a lot of tapping—there is a special lever for opening the till—on August 19th the women used no English</p>

I am a hairdresser, of 5, Southampton Row, W.C.—I married the prisoner's sister and have a son named Harry, who looks after the business behind the counter, generally as well as myself—he has control of the cheque-books, pass-books, and account-books—until No<lb/>vember, 1904, I banked with the London &amp; Westminster, when I changed to the London Joint Stock Bank, Holborn branch—I paid in about £100—this is my pass-book (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), and this my cheque-book (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), which was issued to me at the beginning of February this year—on looking</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190509120105"/>
               <p>at it about April 14th I found that the first cheque and counterfoil were missing—this is the cheque No. B. 000403, for £33 13s., dated February 11th, 1905, "London Joint Stock Bank, 120, High Holborn, W.C. Pay Mr. George Seymour, or bearer, £33 13s."—then there is the stamp of the bank, "Paid, February 11th, 1905, Signed, 'Julius Brauner'"—on the back there is, "George Seymour, The Fines, Ealing"—the signature is a forgery, and I know nobody of the name of "George Seymour, The Pines, Ealing"—I did not give authority to anyone to draw a cheque in my name—this cheque-book (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) was issued to me by the bank about the beginning of April—I find that cheques Nos. B. 000465, 000466, and 000467 are missing, with their counterfoils—I discovered that fact a few days after they were drawn—this is the cheque No. B. 000466, dated April 3rd, 1905—"Pay Mr. Philip Wagner, or bearer, £37 17s."—then there is the stamp of the bank, "Paid, April 7th, 1905"; signed, "Julius Brauner"—on the back of it is endorsed, Philip Wagner, Mount Pleasant Road, Lewisham"—the signature is a forgery and I know nobody of the name of "Philip Wagner"—I opened my account with a loan of £1300 made to me by the bank on my securities, which I paid on June 24th or 28th last.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I paid it off from the proceeds of the sale of my business—the manager of the bank did not complain to me about the state of my account till after April; he was not continually calling attention to it between February and April—I did not make an actual promise that I would keep £100 in the account; he said as long as I kept about £50 that would do—sometimes I had £50 in and sometimes I had not—I began 1905 with a balance of £16 11s. 8d., and on January 16th, there was £34, January 80th, £82—I had not always got £37 in the bank—up till April they always honoured my cheques whether I had money in there or not—I only had my pass-book at home between February and April once; that was for only a few days; in March it might hare been—I ticked these entries in it—this cross against the item of "Seymour, £33 13s.," was made in March when I had the pass book—I was very busy on that day and was called away, and I put the book in the safe—on the following day my son took it to the bank and I did not see anything further of it—I think I made this pencil mark underneath that item, but I cannot swear to it; I simply made the tick, and bore the item in mind—I made no mark against it at any time—I did not take any steps about it until the middle of April—I cannot tell you whether on March 25th a cheque drawn by me for £25 presented through Glynn's was dishonoured by the bank—I do not wish to swear whether it was so or not; I am not quite sure—if the bank says so, it is so—on March 16th my credit was £905 15s. 5d. and my debit £897 16s. 10d., so I had less than £8 in the bank—I do not think after the cheque of February till April 18th the manager was continually calling my attention to the state of my account; I swear he was not—I had my pass-book out on April 12th—I do not remember the manager calling my attention to the state of my account on that day; I will not swear he did not—I remember he did draw my attention on that day to the fact that my account was over drawn—that was because the cheque for £37 17s., which was not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190509120106"/>
               <p>mine, was honoured—on April 11th a cheque for £38 12s. 6d. was not dishonoured—I cannot tell you whether the manager told me so on April 12th—I believe after my interview with him it was re-presented and met—the cashier did not continually come across to my shop to speak about my account—I know the cashier, Mr. Appleyard—I do not know the sub<lb/>manager, Mr. Grout—Mr. Appleyard has never been in my shop; it was another clerk; a young man whose name I do not know—he has only been about twice—it might have been in February or March—I cannot tell you whether when the manager told me on April 12th that the cheque had been dishonoured on April 11th, that I said I would make it all right and pay more money in; I am not positive about it—it might be the next day he paid the cheque on that understanding although there were not funds to meet it—when he was talking to me I had the pass-book before me—I did not say anything about the cheque on April 3rd—I did not look at it on that day; I looked at it in that week—on April 18th I went alone to the bank and complained about that cheque for the first time—the manager asked me to let him have my paid cheques—I am not quite sure whether he called my attention to the fact that the endorsement on the cheque of February 11th seemed to be in the same handwriting as that of April 3rd—I told him it was not my cheque and said I would find out who had forged it; I did not mention whom I suspected at that time—I am quite sure I said that the signature on both cheques, "Julius Brauner," was not mine—on the 19th I instructed my solicitor, Mr. Negus, to write a letter dated the 19th—I left the matter entirely in his hands to do what he thought best—I might have instructed him to write to the manager, "With reference to the cheque in February to which you called his attention in favour of Mr. Seymour, he is making enquiry, and I therefore reserve for the present any claim with regard to this cheque"—the manager did not tell me on the 18th that in his judgment the signature on April 3rd cheque was in my writing; he said he thought it was not a forgery—I never spoke to Mr. Appleyard on the subject—I cannot tell you whether the manager said the cashier was of the same opinion—it was with reference to the February cheque that the manager said he was not quite sure about the writing; he did not say definitely that the cheque was not forged—he also said that about the April 3rd cheque—after April 18th he did not press me about my account; there was always plenty of security there—he might have said something to me about my keeping my account in better order——the April 3rd cheque, "Wagner," is underlined and has a cross beside—I did not put it there; it may have been mine—directly I saw it in the pass-book I went off to the bank at once—I put that tick by the side about April 18th—I did not look at it before the 18th—I did not make those ticks on the 12th—I first made the charge against the prisoner towards the end of July—almost immediately after April 18th I told the manager that I suspected the prisoner—he asked for some of the prisoner's handwriting and I gave a post-card to my solicitor to give to him—my solicitor gave him this envelope addressed in the prisoner's handwriting to my son (<hi rend="italic">Pro<lb/>duced</hi>)—I cannot swear whether I gave the manager the envelope myself or not—Mr. Appleyard was never present at my interviews with the man<lb/>ager</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190509120107"/>
               <p>—I am not sure whether my solicitor was present when the envelope was produced—it was handed to the manager in my presence—I will not swear I did not hand it him—I do not know the gentlemen at the bank by name—I did not know Mr. Appleyard's name; he was not present—nobody spoke to me about the pencil marks on the envelope—I cannot say whether at that interview I said I had put those pencil marks—I cannot tell you whether they were there at the time; I do not know anything about them—I do not remember if they were there when I handed it to my solicitor—it was the only specimen of the prisoner's handwriting we had at that time—I will not swear the manager did not ask me who made them, nor that I said I had—I may have made those pencil marks myself, but not to my recollection; I cannot swear to it—in my opinion the "J" in pencil on the envelope is not like the "J "in the signature on the cheque of April 3rd—I have no idea why I wrote those pencil marks, if I did do so—I do not know anything about the envelope except that we handed it to Mr. Hughes, the manager—I did not tell the manager that I had been practising that writing, or anything of the kind—I told him that I knew nothing of Seymour—I cannot remember whether he asked me if I had ever paid Seymour any money; I do not think he did; it might be so—I have never paid a cheque to Seymour—I do not remember him warning me to be careful about it, nor that I said, "I do not remember"—I was not in difficulties all this time—after I sold my business a Receiving Order was made against me on August 23rd—I got to know Kendal first two months ago through the prisoner's late employer—I cannot tell you whether my son bets—it was not through my son that I got to know Kendal—I have never been to the Court for being drunk in my life—I have never been to the bank drunk; that is quite new to me—I have not many account books—I do not remember telling the manager I had none—I have none referring to about these dates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have always borne a good character and have never been in trouble of any sort—I have been carrying on a hairdresser's business for twenty-six years—about June the manager said to me, "If you find out the man to whom we paid the money, we shall make the amount of the two cheques good for you"—I tried everything to find out who cashed those cheques and one day Isaacs, the prisoner's late employer, called at my place, and it was in consequence of that that I discovered Kendal—I told him to go to my solicitor and give him all the information he could—at the time of the interview of April 18th I thought the bank was liable to me for the amount of the two forged cheques—I think it was about the end of April that I put the whole matter in the hands of my solicitor—there might have been a cheque dishonoured about March 15th, but I cannot remember—I cannot remember a cheque for £38 being dishonoured on April 11th, nor any conversation with the manager with reference to it—there would have been sufficient to my credit in the bank to have paid that amount, had not the forged cheque for £37 been honoured—all my account books are in the hands of the Bankruptcy Court.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Julius Brauner and I assisted him in carrying on his hairdresser's business in Southampton Row—it was part of my duty to take charge of the cheques and cheque books on the London Joint Stock Bank—I kept the cheque-book and the paying in book behind the counter in a drawer—I had charge of no other books—the pass-book was in my hands in February, March and April, but I cannot say as to what days or weeks—I remember having a cheque-book on the London Joint Stock Bank issued on February 9th—the prisoner, who is my uncle, would come three or four times a week to see me in the shop for the last twelve months—between 5 and 6 p.m. on February 10th he came and remained until we closed—it was my business to lock up the cheque book and the money in a drawer at night—on February 10th I took the cheque-book out of the drawer and left it on a chair behind the counter—I then went upstairs, leaving the prisoner in the shop alone—on my return he was still there—I took the cheque-book and money and locked them away in the safe, and went out with him—this is the cheque-book I left on the counter (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 3)—I did not hear that a cheque was missing from it until the middle of April—the prisoner came to see me between April 5th and 8th—I had then in my possession this cheque book issued on April 5th (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 4)—I heard that there were three cheques and counterfoils missing about the same time—I know the prisoner's handwriting—this postcard (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 6), signed "Uncle Peter," to me is in his writing—these two letter-cards and letters and envelope are in his handwriting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The reason I remember February 10th is that he did not come for a long while after that—I left the prisoner about five minutes, or longer, in the shop—I did not tell him afterwards that if my father won the case against the bank he had promised me £12—I have a brother who bets occasionally—I have betted only once or twice—I do not know Kendal as a betting man—I know Mr. Gurrin was con<lb/>sulted about these forged cheques in April, I think—I do not think he is a witness here to-day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private enquiry agent, of 22, Cottage Grove, Clapham—I have known the prisoner for eighteen months or two years—I met him first at Mr. Isaac's, a barber in Gray's Inn Road; I have been in the habit of going there to be shaved and he was an assistant there—he left the employment in December, 1904—I saw him several times after that—I received this post-card, dated February 10th, from him [<hi rend="italic">Stating that the prisoner would be glad to see him at Finch's at</hi> 10 <hi rend="italic">a.m. on Saturday morning to make some arrangement, as he fully expected to be in hospital for a month. Signed "P.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190509120109"/>
               <p>then handed me a cheque like this one (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 1); I cannot say it is absolutely the same cheque; it was for £33 13s.—I took it to the London Joint Stock Bank, and got the money, and returned to the prisoner, who was waiting in the street—we went to a public-house for a drink, where, I think, I handed him the money—he treated me and gave me half a sov<lb/>ereign—this letter-card was sent to me by the prisoner [<hi rend="italic">Dated April</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">th, making an appointment for Wednesday about the same time and place</hi>]—Wednesday would be April 6th—I met him at Finch's, our usual place for meeting, and he gave me, I believe, this cheque (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 2); it was for £371 7s.—I cashed that for him at the same bank and gave the money to the prisoner, who was waiting outside—we went to a public-house and he gave me a half-sovereign with which to pay for drinks, and he told me to keep the change—I saw the bank clerk give evidence at the Police Court—I pointed him out as the man who had given me the money for the cheques.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I introduced the prisoner to a bookmaker—I work for myself; I have no connection with Slater's—I have not backed a horse for eighteen months—I did not ask the prisoner where he got the cheques from; I did not even look at the drawer or <hi rend="italic">endorsee</hi>—it did not seem odd to me that he should have a banking account, as he led me to suppose he had private means of his own as he did his employer—I cannot tell you whether they were bearer cheques—I thought most de<lb/>cidedly that it was a legitimate transaction I was lending myself to—I met him on February 11th from 12 to 1 or 2; I cannot say the time—after the cheque was cashed he asked me to put £5 on a horse for him—I introduced him to a bookmaker and he put it on—I was not certain of the date before the Magistrate; I said in February or March, but I am sure of the date now; it was a Saturday—on the second occasion an ex-detective from Scotland Yard, Harris, saw me give him the money—he is not here to-day—he got a half-sovereign out of it also; we were really at that particular time in business together; he was a partner in the transaction in a sense—the prisoner said he was short of money, and I had implicit confidence in him on both occasions—one cannot look at it as an honest transaction from the bank's point of view, but I did not regard him as a dishonest man.</p>

I am a cashier at the London Joint Stock Bank, High Holborn branch—this cheque (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 1) was presented to me on February 11th and I paid the amount, £33 13s., at once—I believe Kendal is the man I paid it to—the amount was charged to Mr. Brauner's account—on April 7th this cheque (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 2) was presented to the best of my be<lb/>lief by the same man—I looked up the signature and referred it to the manager, Mr. Hughes, and we paid it, £37 17s., feeling quite sure it was all right—that amount also was charged to Mr. Brauner's account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been fifteen yean in the employment of the bank and I have a good deal of experience in the comparison of signatures—I should say Mr. Brauner signed both cheques—Kendal is slightly different from when I saw him, but I hear he has been ill—I will not swear he is the man who cashed them; I saw him for so short a time</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190509120110"/>
               <p>—the reason I hesitated over the April 3rd cheque was that it is a finer writing, and has evidently been written with a finer pen—I was present at the interview when the envelope was given to Mr. Hughes when the prosecutor, and Mr. Grant, the head cashier and deputy man<lb/>ager, were present—Mr. Hughes was talking to the prosecutor, when he noticed the envelope in his hand and said, "Which is your writing, the ink or the pencil?" and the prosecutor said, "Oh no, the pencil is my writing; I wrote those 'J' s'"—I have compared the pencil 'J' s" with the "J" in the signature on the April 3rd cheque and I should say they were written by the same person—the prosecutor had his pass-book out several times in February, March and April—I passed it with the ledger when it came back—the ink ticks are made by the bank—the paid cheques were put in the pass book and we noticed on its return they had been taken out—I have personally called the prosecutor's attention to the state of his account—I have been to his shop to speak about it—in February and March I have been across to his shop to advise him before paying a cheque—sometimes when he has been to the bank he has been very merry; I have not seen him absolutely intoxicated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> We should not have cashed the cheques unless we were absolutely certain of the signatures being genuine—the son at times took out the pass-book—it was the bank who produced the February cheque, in whose custody it was on April 18th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the High Holborn branch of the London Joint Stock Bank, Ltd., and have been employed by the bank twenty-four and a half years—during that time I have had great experience in testing signatures, and I have acted as a cashier—the prosecutor opened an account in December, 1904, by giving us certain securities in consideration of which we placed £1,300 to his credit—he told me that the average balance he kept at the London &amp; Westminster Bank and which he was prepared to keep with us was between £200 and £300—that was quite satisfactory and I agreed to that—I have a state<lb/>ment here of his balance every day this year (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—he began the year with a balance of £16 11s. 8d.—at the close of his business, February 9th, it was £61, and on February 10th £133 odd; on February 14th £28, on February 17th £33—at no date from February 14th till the end of March, except on February 17th, was there as much as £33—on April</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190509120112"/>
               <p>3rd he had a loan from the bank of £100; his credit before that had been £23—it was given on the condition that he fulfilled his bargain of paying £50 every quarter—on April 7th there was a credit of £49, but from that date till May 22nd there was never as much as £37 to his credit—these two cheques in question were presented at convenient time to ensure payment—we certainly would not have cashed them if there had not been money to meet them—this is a certified copy of our returns book (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—on March 14th a cheque was presented for £25 when his credit was £14—on April 11th there was a cheque to a Mr. Thorne for £38 12s. 6d. when his credit was £14—I sent Mr. Grout for him and he came to see me on the same day about it—I have frequently called his attention to the state of his account and we had to send over to his shop to ask him what he was going to do about the cheques that were presented—I cannot say whether he brought his pass-book with him on April 11th—he was very anxious that the cheque to Mr. Thorne should be paid and that if I paid it next day he would see that the account was put in credit again—on the next day I honoured the cheque, leaving the account overdrawn £17 odd—on April 13th there was £5 overdrawn; on the 14th £7 in credit; on the 15th £6 in credit; on the 17th £7 overdrawn—on the 18th I was advised by telephone that this cheque for £37 17s. the prosecutor claimed to be a forgery—he was waiting in my room when I got to the Holborn branch and I asked him again, and he said it was a forgery—the cheque dated April 3rd, and presented on the 7th, was the only one mentioned—Mr. Appleyard showed it to me when it was pre<lb/>sented and I formed the opinion that it was genuine and ordered it to be paid, and I still think it is genuine—I asked him what reason he had for saying it was forged and he said as he had not written it himself it must be forged—I asked him where he kept his cheque-book and I understood him to say he kept it locked in a drawer behind the counter, outside the barber's part of the shop—I asked him who had access to it, and he said no one but himself and his sons—I asked him if he suspected anyone and he said a relative—I said I must think the matter over, and that ended the interview—he told me the first thing on the 19th that he sus<lb/>pected his brother-in-law, the prisoner, and I asked him then for a speci<lb/>men of the prisoner's handwriting and to give me all his (the prosecutor's) paid cheques—it was on that day that he gave me the envelope—Mr. Grout and Mr. Appleyard were there, but not Mr. Negus—there were some pencil marks on it—I asked whose writing in ink was it and he said the prisoner's—I then asked him who had written the pencil marks under-neath it and he said he had written them himself—I said, "Do you mean to say you wrote these yourself?"and he said, "Oh, yes; I was scrib<lb/>bling on it"—I say the "J "of the pencil marks and the "J "of the signature of the cheque are identical—his old cheques came over in one or two batches and amongst them was the cheque of February 11th—I noticed that the cheque of April, although a bearer cheque, bore an endorsement with an address, which is very unusual., and as the cashier stated that he knew the man who cashed it I thought I should find a previous cheque with a similar endorsement on the back of it—I found the February cheque</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190509120113"/>
               <p>and asked the prosecutor if he knew a man named Seymour and he said, "No"—I then asked him to think again, as I thought I could prove that he had paid Seymour money and he still said he did not know any<lb/>thing about him—on showing him the February cheque first he would not say whether he signed it or not—Mr. Negus was present at that time—I had a letter from him dated April 20th (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "Referring to my inter<lb/>view with you this morning, I beg to make formally the claim on Mr. Brau<lb/>ner's behalf for payment of £37 17s., the amount of the cheque in favour of Mr. Wagner, which you cashed, and the signature of which Mr. Brauner denies to be his. With reference to the cheque in February, to which you called his attention in favour of Mr. Seymour, he is making enquiry, and I therefore reserve for the present any claim with regard to this. Mr. Brauner will be happy to give you every possible assistance that may be necessary to enable you to trace the forgery. Yours faithfully, William Negus"—we placed the matter in the hands of our solicitor—the claim for the February cheque was made on the 26th—in my opinion the sig<lb/>nature on that cheque is genuine—the prosecutor has come to the bank once or twice the worse for liquor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not pretend to be an expert, except as regards my professional duties—we generally go by the general character of the handwriting—I have not compared the different letters in the signature, because in analysing the letters it is very difficult to form an opinion—if it had not been for the cheque of February being honoured, the £25 cheque on March 14th would have been honoured and the same as regards the cheque for £38 on April 11th if the April 3rd cheque had not been honoured—on comparing the prisoner's writing with the endorse<lb/>ments on the two cheques, there is some similarity, but I should not like to say they were the same writing; the "P "is not the same to begin with—I do not think "P "in "Peter "is like the "P "in "Pines"—I am more dissatisfied with the endorsement on the April cheque being the prisoners writing than I am with the February cheque—I suggest the prosecutor is mistaken in denying the signatures.</p>

I live at 64, Elizabeth Road, Upton Park, and am manager to Mr. Shaw, a provision merchant, of 328, Green Street, Upton Park—on August 12th at midnight I saw the premises closed—all the bars and bolts were fastened; nobody was left on the premises—I next saw them again at 11.30 p.m. on August 13th, when I was called by the police—I found great confusion there and a large quantity of property had been disturbed—the value of the property taken away was between £17 and £18—the police showed me a horse and cart, and in the cart I found our provisions—I have known Holmes for three or four years—he had been on our premises on several occasions to get straw for his father—he probably would know the back part of the premises, as he would come in that way.</p>

I went down the country and bought 200 barrels; I was working for him last week. Someone has put you on to me for this; is it Joe?"—I said "No"—Joe is the brother—he said to the prosecutor, "I shall have you put away for this; I shall open what I know about you. You are doing a fine thing for me"—in answer to the charge he said, "That is right."</p>

I had permission to take it out at the time, and not, "I shall tell the Magistrate he lent it me; that will do him."</hi>

I am a registered medical practitioner—about 8.15 a.m. on August 26th I was called to the prisoner's house, 6, May Road, Plaistow—a woman had died there—on getting there I thought it right to send for a constable, and Fisher came and searched the house—there was a smell of acid in the place and I thought we would see where the poison with which she had poisoned herself was—in the back room upstairs on the top of the cupboard there was a bottle labelled "Oil of Vitrol"—a small parcel containing twenty-seven counter<lb/>feit shillings, a mould for sixpences, and a bottle of ammonia—I took the parcel to my surgery, where I found the twenty-seven coins altogether.</p>

"Oh, my poor Polly"—he was detained in the house while Hulton and myself searched it—I afterwards took him to the police station, when on being charged he said, "I know nothing of them; they belong to the lodger"—I searched him and found these two counterfeit shillings in his inside breast pocket, dated 1892 (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>).</p>

I am fourteen years old and lived with the prisoner, who is my stepfather, and my mother at 2, Sandringham Buildings, Walworth—there were also living in the house my sisters Lilian, aged twelve, Ada, aged eight, Violet, aged four, and Gladys, aged two—the prisoner and my mother occupied one room and we children another—Lilian and I slept in one bed with one of the other children at the foot of it and the others in separate cots—the prisoner was engaged as a driver by Mr. Cornell—we were all at home on August 5th and went to bed as usual—on the early morning of August 6th I was waked by Ada crying, who was in a separate bed—I do not know what time it was—I saw the prisoner leaving the room—he had only his trousers on—I did not see him do anything in the room—I got out of bed and saw Gladys with her throat out and I saw her breathe her last breath—my half sister Violet was dead with her throat cut, and Ada also had her throat cut—I screamed out and my mother came in—I ran into the passage and saw the prisoner in the scullery trying to out his throat with a razor—shortly, afterwards a policeman came.</p>

About 5.30 a.m. on August 6th I heard screams coming from Sandringham Buildings—I saw the prisoner in his scullery with a razor in his hand cutting at his right arm at the elbow—I took the razor from him and noticed that blood was coming from his neck—he said, "It is all right; I have killed my three children. I will go quietly; I did not want to see them starve"—he spoke very quietly—I was in uniform—he had a slight cut on his neck, but was able to walk to the station—at the station he said, "I have been out of work for a fortnight. There is no prospect of any more until September. The old razor would not cut butter. I wish it had been sharp; I would have cut my own head off.

                  </hi>. I am a medical practitioner at 129, Cam<lb/>berwell Road—on August 6th, about 6.45 a.m., I saw the prisoner at the police station—I examined his neck and found a long superficial scratch on the right side 3 1/2 inches long—in the front of his neck there was a wound 2 inches long just through the skin—on the left side there were five</p>

               <p>scratches, all superficial—blood had not come from them in any quantity—inside the bend of his right elbow there were two skin scratches about 2 inches long, and on the left arm there were five wounds from 1 to 3 inches long, all in the bend of the elbow, all recent, and they all might have been caused by this razor—he did not seem conscious of his position—he was dull and rather apathetic—some one was cutting a bandage and the scissors were very blunt—they remarked on it, and the prisoner said, "It is only fit for the scrap heap, like my razor"—he was quite sober.</p>

I live at 11, Jessop Road, Herne Hill, and am foreman to Robert Cornell, who has stables at Loughborough Junction—the prisoner was employed there for about twelve months ending on July 22nd—he was employed in driving a traveller named Mr. Barnes—I discharged him, telling him that Mr. Barnes would not have him to drive him any more, but if he showed up for job work on the Monday he could have it—that was on July 22nd—he did not come and I never saw him again—he had a week's notice on the 15th—he was earning 25s. a week—he was a sober man, punctual and a good workman.</p>

Cornell—about 8 p.m. on August 5th last I saw him one of our yards in the Borough—he came to give an order for a wedding carriage—I believe he came rather to apply for the engagement—I asked him in a jocular manner if he was going to get married—he said, "No, I should rather be buried"—he then asked if I could give him employment—I said I could not as a coachman—he then applied for employment in the stables as a horse-keeper—I said that even in that respect I could not promise him anything, although if there was anything going I should see he had it—he said that in a short time his children would be starving—the wed<lb/>ding order would not bring him any commission and would not smooth his path with us, but it gave him an opportunity of getting into conver<lb/>sion with me—I did not mention any date when there would be em<lb/>ployment in the stables.</p>

               <p>used to worry about the future when there was no necessity, and he had an idea that he thinks his wife is responsible for his actions, but I do not think he said anything about that to me—the natural instinct of self-preser<lb/>vation is inborn—in my opinion nearly every one who attempts to commit suicide must be insane—if a man was about to be burned I should say his suicide would be justifiable, but except in cases where a man is avoid<lb/>ing death I think if he takes his own life he is insane—I mentioned inci<lb/>dentally that the prisoner felt he ought not to leave his wife burdened with the children, but I do not attach much importance to that, and I did not mention the fact that he had said that he did not intend to kill his children until the last minute, as a sign of insanity—I regard his sleeplessness as a symptom of insanity—anybody who is overworked or underworked may suffer from sleeplessness, and not be insane—it is a mental disorder and one would not call it insanity or a symptom of insanity; no one would use it in signing a certificate—I have heard more than once of men who are about to commit suicide resolving to murder their children—it is a thing which occurs with much far too great a fre<lb/>quency—if a man says, "I am going out of the world and I think it is better for my children that they should die at the same time," he is insane already because he intends to commit suicide; the two instincts are inborn—I should say that a man who does not resolve to commit suicide, but resolves to murder his children because he thinks they are better out of the way, is insane, and a man may do that without being responsible in law, if he takes that view.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical practitioner, of 1, Poynders Road, Clapham—on August 24th I was called to see the deceased at 42, Honeybrook Road—she was sitting in an armchair in the kitchen—she complained of great pain in her left side—I examined her and found four bullet wounds; one in the middle line of the body just below the throat, on the level of the upper border of the chest bone, another an inch and a half above the bend of the left elbow, and another on the left elbow, and the fourth on the top of the right buttock—I was unable to find any bullet in the chest wound by probing—it appeared that the two wounds on the left arm had been caused by the entrance and exit of the same bullet—the wound behind was rather a scrape than a serious wound—bullets the same as this might have caused the wounds—round the wound in the chest and also near the wound on the arm I found marks of burning, and from those appearances I should think the pistol was dis<lb/>charged</p>

I am casualty officer at St. Thomas's Hospital—I saw the deceased on her admission about 11.15 on August 24th—I have heard the description of the wounds given by Dr. Edwards, which is correct—I probed the wound in the chest, but was unable to find any bullet—I did not at first consider her injuries to be serious, but a little later there was a swelling on the side of the face and a pain in swallowing, and next day she spat a small quantity of blood—she got weaker, and was in a state of collapse, and on the 25th, about 3.30 p.m., I communicated with the police—her condition was serious at that time—it could not be said definitely whether she would recover, but her condition was obviously a serious one unless she made a turn for the better—I last saw her alive about 4.15 p.m. that day—the police arrived after that and she died about 1 o'clock next morning—a few days later I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and found that she was a healthy woman generally—I traced the course of the wound in the chest, and found that it had passed through the gullet, struck the left side of the spine, grazed the top of the left lung, injuring it sufficiently to create difficulties in breathing, and just behind the lung I found this ballet (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—the cause of death was directly traceable to that wound, and was the immediate cause—the wounds on the left arm were the en<lb/>trance and exit of one bullet—from the position and the direction that wound took I think her arm was held up to protect herself, and I think the shot was from behind; there was scorching at the back—the other wound must have been from the front—when I had last seen her she was quite conscious.</p>

On August 24th I was at the Balham police station when the prisoner was brought there in custody—after he had been charged he said, "I want a letter produced by Mrs. Mackintosh, 44, Honeybrook Road, because I want to see the contents. It was addressed to Mrs. Stephens, 45, Honeybrook Road, delivered by hand. I do not know the contents of that letter, but I want it produced in evidence at my trial. The letter I put two half-penny stamps on and posted it. It had a printed address on the back. I rubbed out the address in front"—next morning Mackintosh came to the station and I received from him this letter and envelope—it was sealed down, and had originally been addressed in pencil to Mrs. Stephens—on the 25th I went to St. Thomas's Hospital in consequence of a police telegram—I saw the house surgeon and the deceased, and took a statement in writing from her—she was in a very collapsed condition and scarcely able to speak.</p>

               <p>"This man has shot a woman in Honeybrook Road with a revolver"—I said, "Where is the revolver?" and the prisoner took a box of car<lb/>tridges from his coat pocket behind, handed it to me and said, "I am very sorry," and then after a pause, "I threw the revolver away"—I went to Honeybrook Road, made some enquiries, and then returned and charged the prisoner with attempting to murder his wife by shooting her with a revolver—he made no reply—he gave his name as Walter Stephens, known also as Cyril A. Desparde, of 45, Honeybrook Road—he sad he was a commission agent—I received this revolver from another constable and took from it five discharged cartridges—in this box there are forty-five undischarged, which make up the fifty which the box contained—I searched the prisoner and found upon him a gun licence, a receipt for the revolver, this pawn ticket marked D, dated August 24th, 1905, showing that Mr. W. Stephens pawned a chain on that day for £1 with Mr. Bravington, of 27, Wardour Street—I found a quartern bottle nearly full of brandy, (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) and also this letter and envelope—it was then sealed down—the prisoner opened and read it (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "62 Ormeley Road, Balham Dear Madam,—I came up this morning at 10, then again at 1 o'clock, but you were not in. Will you kindly let me know if I am to come to-mor<lb/>row, Friday, and what time, and oblige, Yours respectfully, H.

               <p>the inspector to take certain evidence and statements and then wishing them to be erased—finally the inspector, having completed his work, asked me to see the prisoner—I began to put questions to him, but he objected to answer me because of the publicity of the position—I thereupon took him into the corridor of the cells and spent a considerable time talking to him and examining him—I found him suffering from chronic alcoholism, but it that moment he certainly was not drunk in the ordinary accepted term—he showed the usual signs of deep drinking—he was very deaf with one ear and partially so with the other—he answered all my questions slowly and rationally, with the exception of those relating to a letter which he alleged he had received that day addressed to his wife—to this letter he attached great importance, at the same time admitting that he did not know its contents—he mentioned Mrs. Mackintosh's name, but made no statement concerning her beyond saying that the letter had emanated from her residence and he said the letter would explain its contents—I then left him and made my report in the book—I enquired into his sleeping habits because I suspected mental trouble, he said he had slept during the last few nights and told me he had been drinking during the day and had spent some hours riding about on tramcars—he volunteered the statement that he had had a disappointment that morning in business which had not gone well—he became very communicative and told me a great deal of his past life—we did not refer to the charge against him except that he said the letter would explain all this trouble.</p>

I am the medical superintendent of the Constance Road Infirmary, Dulwich, in Camberwell Parish—I remember the prisoner being admitted to the lunacy ward there on August 15th, 1898—he was first placed in the padded room on the night of the 20th at 10.30 p.m. and remained there until 7 a.m. next morning—the next night he also was in the padded room from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m., and he remained there the whole of the next day and the next night—on the morning of the 23rd he was taken out at 9 a.m.—he was under my care from the 15th to the 29th, when he was discharged—he was sent there by two Magistrates and they considered that he was not mad enough to be sent to an asylum—I recommended that he should be sent to a lunatic asylum and I marked the register, which I have here, when he left that he was not fit to take his discharge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the head medical authority at Brixton prison—the prisoner has been under my care since August 25th—I have not found direct evidence of his suffering from delusions, but he was evidently suffering from the effects of prolonged drinking—since he has been under my care the physical signs have passed off to a large extent—he told me that he had been sent to observation wards three times—long intemper<lb/>ate habits would weaken a man's mind—he would not discuss the letter with me—I cautioned him, as I always do, that I did not want him to give me anything in confidence, as I might be obliged to use it in the witness box—I asked him about the letter, and the purchase of the revolver, and the disappointment in business, and he said he would rather not discuss those with me—he said in a vague way it was all due to drink—I have heard Dr. Needham's evidence and without coming to the conclusion that the prisoner had mental delusions it is difficult to explain his con<lb/>duct, and nothing I have heard in the evidence has shown any ordinary motive for his act—I said in my report, "It is impossible to deny that the prisoner may have had mental delusions"—that would be due to drinking—the letter which Dr. Needham mentioned struck me as a delu<lb/>sion of suspicion, which is very common in alcoholics.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If the prisoner believed in what he said about this letter I should consider it a delusion—delusion of suspicion is a common term used with regard to mental diseases and a very common form with people who have such delusions—they suspect others of conspiring against them to hurt them in some way—in the case of husband and wife the delusion frequently is that of infidelity or trying to poison—that is not an uncommon delusion in alcoholic insanity—I think that on August 24th the prisoner was under the influence of delusions, the result of prolonged drinking.</p>

Many a person has a false idea that another person has done him some injury, but I should not necessarily call that person insane, but with the insane their ideas take a much stronger hold and frequently guide their actions—in judging of insanity you must make up your mind first of all whether the patient's belief is false and baseless, and if you find there is such a false and baseless belief on the part of the patient, it gives rise to the idea in your mind that he is insane; it is one of the leading and chief symptoms of insanity—I have not detected any insanity in the prisoner while he has been under my observation—as to this hallucination, he declined to discuss it with me altogether, and I had no opportunity of arriving at an independent opinion upon that, and I had no right to force him, as I might be trying to force a confession of guilt—on August 24th from the mental condition he was in I do not think he knew the difference between right and wrong—I think he knew the nature but not the quality of his act—chronic long drinking blunts the moral sense to a very great extent.</p>

I had the child Echler from Mrs. Brown on June 8th when it was four days old and she gave an address at Norton Folgate, City, and she agreed to pay 7s. per week, but I only received three payments altogether. The child was very delicate then, and had a discharge from the eyes and ears and its lower parts were sore. I did not take it to a doctor. I fed it on barley water and Nestles milk. On July 21st the child was taken with con<lb/>vulsions and I gave it to Mrs. Wright, who took it to St. Thomas's Hospital, where it died on the 29th. I saw the mother once, but I don't know where she lives"—the next day I saw her again and said to her, "I have received information that you have had another nurse child, aged eleven months, and I want to know where it is, as it is alleged that it has been neglected"—she said, "It is untrue. I have not had another child since I have had, he child Echler"—a few minutes afterwards she came to me and said.</p>

               <p>I have had another nurse child called McLay, aged eleven months. I had it from the mother when it was three weeks old, but she took it away a fortnight ago. The child has been ill and it has been under Dr. Meyler"—the same day I went to 3, Caledonian Place, Homerton, where I saw the child McLay—it was extremely thin and emaciated and the buttocks were red and sore, and there were several sores on the back, all form neglect; the child's head was also sore and very verminous—on the 6th I told the prisoner that I had seen the child McLay and described its condition—she said, "It must have got like that since it left me. I did not neglect it"—I saw the children's bedroom; it was in a very filthy condition, and also the bedding—the walls were covered with fly papers with hundreds of dead flies on them and the air was very foul.</p>

I am a bookmaker and employed the prisoner, who had to pay each man according to the list I gave him, I giving him the total amount—on July 29th I prepared a list of the people to whom I owed money, which I gave to Budden, a messenger of mine, to give to the prisoner, with £9 13s. 10d.—on the list there was a name of William Liddey, whose name appears as "W. L." for 17s. 6d., and also Chester Potts for 2s.—those gentlemen came to me afterwards for their money and I had to pay them again—the next I heard at the prisoner was on the Tuesday morning, when I learnt that no one had been paid—I sent to his house to see if he was ill, and his wife said she had not seen him since the Sunday morning—on the following morning I got this letter from him (<hi rend="italic">Ex.

               <p>starting of my trouble was a bet got in the corner of my pocket in the name of 'Tiny' and I never found it until the next morning. It came to £15 odd. I did not come to you about it because it looked very fishy, so I tried to pay the man out. In doing so I got worse into it. I had to keep bets to pay him. It became worse still the Saturday I ought to have paid it. I went home after I had done taking money. My wife had a few words with me, so I went out and had some beer, which got over me. I got my money off Tiny and went up the road again, after which I remember nothing more again until I woke up on Sunday morn<lb/>ing. I then counted my money and found I was £4 16s. short, which you sent on my bet. I could not remember a little bit of where it went to, so what with being in a mess and being short of a day's paying-out money I did not know what to do. I tried to borrow it, but could not. I did not want to run away with the money. If I wanted to do that I could have done it when I ran back. I have had as much as £60 in silver. It was because I had no money to pay out with, so I hope you will forgive me. I hope to live long enough to pay you back. I am not drinking no beer now, and am working all kinds of different stuff to try and get it"—I cannot say for certain whether this letter is in his handwriting—I paid him 35s. a week—I have only employed him on this work for six weeks; previous to that he was employed by me as a messenger.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Tanser Road, Hampstead, and am manager to Bennett Son &amp; Company, Ltd., tripe dressers, of Lambeth Walk—on July 28th they had a brown horse in their stables; the head ostler saw it there; I saw it one day that week—on Saturday morning, July 29th, I was telephoned for and missed from the stables a coat, a horse and cart and five sets of harness—the horse was a dark bay, standing about sixteen hands high, which had originally cost the firm thirty guineas—we reckoned it worth quite £20; we had to give thirty-seven guineas to replace it—I saw it about a month afterwards in the possession of the police.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have not had much experience in selling horses—we had had this one for about four years; it was about twelve years old—there was a very slight sore just under the saddle—when I saw it again there were two or three slight marks on the legs—I saw no mark of other sores—it had not been fired on the right hind leg, I swear—I have looked at it since—I do not think July and August is rather a cheap time for horses—I have bought a good many horses; I cannot say exactly the month when I have bought them, but I have always found that if we wanted to buy a horse for working we had to pay a good price for it.</p>

I am a coal merchant, of 54, Spray Street, Plum<lb/>stead—Cohen keeps a clothes shop not far off—four or five weeks ago I lent him a trolley—he brought a horse which has since been shown to be Bennett's and put it in the trolley—he said it was too big for him and asked me whether I would buy it—he said nothing about how he had obtained it—he asked £25 for it, and I in a joke said I would give £5—he would not accept that.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective L.</hi>) On August 29th I went to Cohen's stables at Charles Street, Plumstead, and there found Messrs. Bennett's brown horse—next day, about 2.15, I saw Cohen at Woolwich police station—I told him I was a police officer, that I had traced a stolen horse to his possession and had taken possession of it—he said, "Well, sir, I will tell you all about it. I bought the horse about a month ago from a short man in Beresford Street, but I don't know who he was; he is a stranger to me. I gave him £4 for the horse, and he gave me a receipt, which I gave to my solicitor this morning. Mr. Morris at a public-house in High street sent the man to me, and my boy Sam went back with the man, and Mr. Morris said he knew him well, and the horse was straight, or I should not have bought him. Mr. Morris gave him ink and paper to write out the receipt"—after that statement I went to Morris and made enquiries there, and on my return I said to the prisoner that from the result of my enquiries I should take him into custody for feloniously receiving a horse—he made no reply—when charged at the Kensington Road police station, he said, "£20, and it had sores on it!"—it was said it was worth £20—I said to the prisoner, "Mr. Morris denies sending a man with a horse for you to buy; he says, 'Cohen's son, and a man came to my house; the man said Mr. Cohen had sent his eon to see if you know me. I replied, 'Yes, by seeing you come into the house three or four times; they asked me or paper and ink and a stamp; the man wrote out what appeared to be a receipt'"—he made no reply to that.</p>

Detective-Sergeant, Woolwich Dock Yard</hi>). I produce a conviction under the Army Act of 1881 and a second one under the Public Stores Act of 1875—I was present at Woolwich Police Court on November 11th, 1903, when Cohen was fined £2 or twenty-one days hard labour by R . Kettle, Esq., Magistrate, for unlawful possession of Government stores, a wooden ink box with three glass bottles with brass tops, value about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he had it at his shop—I was present at Woolwich Police Court on September 24th, 1901, when he was charged with the unlawful possession of Government
stores and fined £3 or twenty-one days hard labour by E. Baggallay, Esq.; there were fifteen pairs of mili<lb/>tary boots, twelve shirts, four pairs of socks, and one pair of serge trousers in his shop, all military stores—military clothing we always charge under the Military Act, and when we are not certain it is military clothing we charge it under the Public Stores Act—Cohen lives at Woolwich.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cohen, in his defence on oath, stated that he was a general dealer, and called himself a carman and contractor; that he had had his shop and lived there for fourteen years; that his son first spoke to him about buying this horse about the last Saturday in July, between</hi> 12 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 1, <hi rend="italic">and then Bishop came with the horse in a van, and wanted to sell the horse because he had no work for it; that in answer to questions Bishop said he had bought the horse at the Barbican for</hi> £10 <hi rend="italic">ten months back; that he (Cohen) said if Bishop could name anybody round about who knew him he would buy the horse; that Bishop said Mr. Morris, the publican, knew him very well; that he (Cohen) arranged to pay</hi> £4 <hi rend="italic">and sent his son Sam, aged eighteen, to make enquiries; that Sam on his return said that Morris said he could buy it all right, as he knew that chap; "that Sam gave him the receipt which had been made out with the paper, ink, and stamp which Morris had supplied, and which Moon (which was the name Bishop went by) had written; that he (Cohen) paid the money; that he found afterwards the horse was not the right size for his cart, and offered it to Baldock; that when he bought it there were three sores on each side down the neck and a sore like a half-crown under the saddle on the back-bone; that he dealt in horses and everything that turned up; that this was the first time he had seen Bishop; that he considered</hi> £4 <hi rend="italic">was a proper price for a horse with pads and sores; and that he did not know the horse was stolen.</hi>
