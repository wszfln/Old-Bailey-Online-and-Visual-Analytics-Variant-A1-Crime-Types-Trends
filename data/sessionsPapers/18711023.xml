                  </hi>. I am a dentist, of 127, Westbourne Grove—I rent a portion of the basement and the upper portion of the house, at 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—last November I hired some furniture of Bartholomew, who is an upholsterer, at 7, Westbourne Grove—I signed this agreement, marked "A," and gave an acceptance for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., at three months—when that became due, I paid 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—he subsequently lent me 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I signed this paper, marked "B"—I received this letter, marked "C"—he subsequently threatened to take the goods away—on 4th August some men came to my house—they took up my carpets, and put them in a van—while doing this, Bartholomew came up, and I had a conversation with him—a solicitor came up, and said that Mr. Bartholomew was not justified in doing what he was doing; and there was an agreement made that I should give an acceptance of a friend, Major Gray, at one month, to complete the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the hire of the furniture—10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was due at that time—upon that, the carpets and other goods were put back again—Major Gray went with me to Bartholomew, and I left the acceptance with Acres, Mr. Bartholomew's managing man—I afterwards received this letter, marked "D" (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—on 14th August, about 8.30 in the morning, I heard a noise, went down, and found that all the things had been taken out of the drawing-room—it was</p>

               <p>the rattling of the stair-rods near my bedroom that awoke me—I found several men of Mr. Bartholomew's, several of the prisoners—I went to the station, and when I came back, they were gone—to the best of my belief, this authority to remove the goods, marked "E," is Bartholomew's writing—that was given to Mr. Vincent, my solicitor's clerk—they had removed the goods that belonged to Bartholomew, but they had not room to take away the goods that belonged to me—Jones and Walker were there—Mr. Vincent came and had some conversation with them, and about 2 o'clock in the day Acres came, and withdrew all the men—during the evening, in consequence of information from a person named Graham, I had the chain put up on the front door, and bolted it, and the drawing-room window was bolted—there were no shutters, merely a spring bolt—at that time, my man-servant Rumley, my wife, and family, were in the house—about 9 o'clock I heard a great noise in the street, crowds collected, and we heard shouting, and a few minutes afterwards two men fell into the room, through the window, followed by two others—I made a rush at the men, to try to keep them back, when two or three men followed immediately after them, up a ladder, which was placed at the window—Beer was one, and Green; and I think Walker, or Jones; I am not quite certain which—I had a sword lying in its scabbard, on the ottoman—it was there quite accidentally—it had been knocking about the house in one place and another—Spooner followed up the ladder—Beer made a grab at the sword, and Rumley also made a grab at it—he caught hold of the sheath, and Beer of the handle—the sword came out—Beer flourished it about in a most extraordinary manner—I got a clip on my temple—I succeeded in warding off a slight gash, but I got a second in my hand—Spooner came to my assistance, and Beer tackled him, and wounded him very severely, and he had to be sent to the hospital—they rolled from the top of the stairs to the bottom—I rushed down to see if I could get the police to assist me—I managed to take the sword from Beer, and handed it to the police, and Beer then made his escape—the front door was opened, and then in they poured, and we were attacked both ways—Bartholomew, I believe, got into the passage—he was taken by the police—my drawing-room floor was spotted all over with blood, and on the stairs, and everywhere—I recognize the whole of the defendants as being with Bartholomew on and off during the day—Beer and Green were in the room, and either Walker or Jones.</p>

I live at 6, Westbourne Park Place, Padding<lb/>ton, and am brother-in-law of the prosecutor—about 7.30 on this night I saw Bartholomew and Acres outside the prosecutor's house—I and Vincent had a conversation with them—I showed Bartholomew the paper marked "E," the authority to enter, and asked if it was his signature—he said it was, and that he had authorized the proceeding—he asked us to go to an hotel with him—we led him to believe we would, but suspecting he had an object in taking us away, I went back to the house and told them that the raid which they had expected was about to take place—I heard Bartholo<lb/>mew, as he was passing in, say to some men, "Don't know me;" or "don't notice me, but get in;" or words to that effect—I saw a number of men coming towards the prosecutor's house—at one time there was a very great</p>

               <p>crowd; they tried to force the door, but it was shut and bolted—I recognize Beer and Walker, Galloway and Jones, as being there when the attempt was made to force the door—I had seen Acres a few minutes previously with Bartholomew during the conversation I have just mentioned—I heard Bartholomew say, "Fetch the ladder"—a ladder was brought—at that time I should think there were 800 people there—the ladder was placed against the house, and I saw four men go up—Beer was one—there was a pause at the window, and I heard the window go up, and they went in—the ladder was then taken down by the crowd, and broken—there was then a rush at the hall door—Bartholomew was the foremost one—he struck me, and tore my coat—he was immediately taken into custody—I saw Walker push the door, and he struck me—when I afterwards went into the house I found the banisters broken, and blood in the hall, and all up the stairs—the place was utterly wrecked, the lamps broken, and the place covered with blood.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The assault was the matter I went before the Magistrate upon—the Magistrate did not say he should dismiss it; he suggested to the attorney that I should withdraw the claim, so that Bartholomew should be included in the indictment—I did not employ six or twelve men in the afternoon—I heard that Mr. Vincent paid them—I don't know how many there were—they were not roughs—they were trades<lb/>men; working men—before these men were employed I had not resisted the removal of an ottoman from the house—Vincent had—I was present—I heard Vincent tell Acres if he attempted to remove the goods, which did not belong to Mr. Bartholomew, he would be resisted—I did not see any attempt to remove the ottoman, it was too large to move—after the resist<lb/>ance was made, Acres said he would withdraw the men—I did not strike Bartholomew—I was not guilty of any violence whatever—I was outside the house when the entry was made—I don't know whether our party took away the ladder and broke it; it was the crowd—I assisted in removing the ladder; it was broken in the struggle—I am agent for a gentleman of property, to look after his property and attend to his business generally—I, have been-in a spirit business, that failed—I have known the prosecutor fourteen years—I have not been living with him.</p>

I live at 10, John's Place, Fulham—I know the prisoner—on Friday, 11th August, I saw her go past my door—I knew that she was ill—I took her by the hand, and asked her what was the matter with her—she said she had diarrhoea,—I said "Eliza, I fear it is not diarrheoa, it is something else"—she said "I ought to know"—she had a small bottle in her hand—I asked what it was—she said "Castor oil"—I said "The best thing you can have to take, but beware how you take it if you are in labour, which I am sure you are"—she said she was not—she was then living with her mother—I offered to go with her to the Union if she would go—about 8.45 next morning I went to her mother's house, and found the prisoner lying on a wooden box in a room up stairs; there was not a particle of bed or bed clothing in the room—I said "How are you, Eliza?"—she said "I am better"—I asked her if she had had a child—she said "No"—I observed that her dress, which was hanging up, was very much stained with blood, and I asked her how it came there—she said after she took the castor oil she had vomited a great deal of blood and likewise passed a great deal—she positively asserted that she had not had a child, she wished the Lord might strike her dead, so help her God she had not—I told her I would fetch a doctor—she said I could—I fetched Mr. Staples, the chemist, and her mother fetched a midwife—I went in with them—the prisoner was then washing the tea things—I asked them if they thought there was a child—they said "Yes," and I said "Then I will find it" and I did find it in a small coal cellar under the stairs, rolled in a piece of sacking; it had the after birth firmly pressed into the mouth—I had a hard job to pull it out, and blood flowed from the nose and mouth</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Walham Green—on Saturday, 12th August, about 12 or I o'clock, I was requested by Weller to examine the body of a female child—I found it fairly formed, fully nourished, quite cold, very blanched; there was an abrasion and bruise over the left eye<lb/>brow, the navel string had been cut, and a piece of thread tied loosely</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187110230028"/>
               <p>round it—by order of the Coroner I made an examination of the body on 13th August—on removing the scalp I found effusion of blood underneath, corresponding with the abrasion and bruise outside; the membranes of the brain very much congested with dark venous blood, but the substance of the brain blanched—the chest was fully filled by the lungs—I put the lungs and heart together into water, and the whole floated—I separated the heart from the lungs, and they floated separately—I divided the lungs into small pieces, and every piece floated—all the large vessels were drained of blood, the heart only containing a small quantity of fluid blood on the right side—from my examination I should say the child had certainly been born alive—there had been a separate circulation—the lungs had been fully inflated—if the after-birth had been placed over the mouth and pressed, the effect would be congestion of all the internal organs, of the brain especially—the effect of it would be to produce a certain amount of suffocation, but the body being drained at the same time there could not be that congestion of the internal organs—hemorrhage contributed to t*he death, bleeding from the cord—the cause of death was partly hemorrhage and partly suffo<lb/>cation—I believe both causes were in operation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The bleeding was from the cord not being tied—I should say the lungs would not present the appearance they did if the child had not had a separate existence from the mother—a child may breathe thoroughly, without being separated from the mother—breathing would fill the lungs with air—if the cord was broken, or partly severed in the birth, hemorrhage would go on, and that would, of course, fearfully weaken the child—that would occur after the child was actually born—I have had a large experience, and I have never met with, or read of a case where it has been severed until it was out of the womb.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. This cord was clean cut—the child had unquestionably been born alive, or the lungs could not have been so fully inflated—the child must be in the world for the cord to be cut—it is a medical man's first duty to tie the cord—until the cord is tied, the child has not a perfectly separate existence from the mother—the after-birth is the last matter that comes away in the act of parturition—if the after-birth has come away, the child must have been fully born.</p>

At the time in question I lived at 6, Scarsdale Villas, Kensington, the house of the prisoner—he and his wife (my sister), and my father also lived there—on the evening of 4th October I was in bed with my sister—she was very ill at the time, in a decline; she died the week after—my father was also there—the prisoner came into the room—I was fanning my sister, at the time—I was there to protect her; she wished me to be there, and also the doctor—the prisoner used abusive language to me, and said "Get out of the room"—he struck my sister over the head with the fan, and she screamed—he pushed her back in the bed, and he got me down between the bedstead and the chest of drawers, on the floor, and he knelt on me with his knee, and nearly choked me with his</p>

Police!" and sat herself on the window-ledge, and reached out, calling "Police!" and "Murder!"—she came in directly, and caught up the poker, and said she would split his skull—I saw her flourish it over the top of his head, and I grasped it with my hands—she then went back to the window directly, and still continued crying "Murder!" and "Police!"—by that time the police knocked at the door—I did not see my son lay hold of her, and try to push her out of the window—I never saw him touch her once—I did not see her partly out of the window, held by my son, nor did I see Mr. Harrison and the nurse go to her assistance, and pull her in—I did not interfere no further than I grasped the poker when it was flourished over my son's head—I don't know whether I laid hold of Mr. Harrison's hair or not; I rather think I did, to hold him back—yes, I did, because he had got my son by the throat—I did not see my son kneeling on Miss Harrison, on the floor; there was no one on the floor at all—I did not see the poker in my son's hand at all—someone grasped it at the same time I did; whether that was the old gentleman, or my son, I don't know—I first saw it in Miss Harrison's hand—she took it from the fire-place, and flourished it over his head—she let go of it directly she found someone had got hold of it—I did not see my son's hand on her breast or throat; I never saw him near enough to touch her, except when she came at him, and flourished the poker over him.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Tuffnell Arms public-house, Tuffnell Park Road—I have two cricket gardens, divided by a road, one called the old ground, and the other the new—I had two houses in the old ground, one of iron and one of wood, connected by a small room—there is no means of getting from one house to the other without going out of doors—on 26th September I was removing the iron house to the new ground, and some canvas, paper, and felt were stripped off and placed outside the iron house, which was between the felt and paper and the wooden house—that rubbish was set on fire by my orders before 6 o'clock that afternoon—the wind was then north-east, blowing direct from the iron house—I left at 5.45, and then it was all embers—I was sent for to the wooden house about 8 o'clock the same evening, and found it full of smoke—it had been put on fire, but had been put out—the back part was burnt, and the canvas inside the house was partly burnt, but none of the material of which the house was built was on fire—next morning I noticed a hole in the weather board at the back of the house large enough for a man to put his hand in—the can<lb/>vas was scorched or burnt near the hole about two feet from the ground—the charring was at the bottom of the hole—the canvas was against the wall—whether it was set on fire from inside or out I cannot tell—the prisoner Tye used to bowl at the cricket-ground for gentlemen—he was there in the summer, but not by my permission—I would not have him on the enclosed ground, and my manager ordered him off—Mr. Brighton lived in the wooden house with his family, and slept there.</p>

               <p>between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening, there was a fire of rubbish burning—I was near it, with my brother—it was dark, as the fire was very nearly out—it was burnt down, so that there was no flame, but there were some embers—the two prisoners, who I knew before, came up and warmed their hands, and two small boys followed them—they remained there about ten minutes, and then they all four went round to the back of the iron house for ten minutes—that made twenty minutes—I followed them round and saw all four against the wooden house, and smoke and <hi rend="italic">flare</hi>, was coming out of a hole in the wooden house—Tye was as close as he could get to the hole—I ran and told my mother, who was in the kitchen of the wooden house, and got some water and put it out—I saw the prisoner's faces, and knew them before.</p>

I was present when the conversation took place, at Judges' Chambers, between Boys, and Wright, and Tanner—I went there, not with the intention of seeing Mr. Tanner—a summons had been made out at Bow Street, and I went to serve Mr. Tanner, and he did not know it—I found Boys, and Wright, and Francis Day, the brother of the plaintiff, there—Mr. Wright went up to Mr. Tanner, and said "Some of the witnesses whom you subpoenaed in the case of 'Day and Wife against the South-eastern Railway Company,' say they have not been paid"—I did not hear Mr. Tanner say anything in answer to that; but Mr. Boys went up at the same time, and said "Will you pay me my expenses in the case of Day</p>

               <p>and Wife, which they say you have received?"—Mr. Tanner turned away, and I understood him to say "I won't pay you."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not hear him say "You must go to Mr. Day"—I did not hear him use Mr. Day's name—he said "I won't pay you," and turned away—I served him with the summons directly afterwards—that was a summons to attend at Bow Street for the perjury—I did not attend the taxation of costs, but I went to meet Mr. Stevens, and I was just in time to add up the bill—Mr. Stevens is the managing clerk in our office—a summons was taken out afterwards, to review the taxation—the costs were taxed on 24th July, and I suppose the summons was taken out about three days afterwards—that would be the 27th—I did not see the defendant when that summons to review was taken out—it was served by one of the clerks in the office, and he instructed Counsel to attend—I think there was only one summons to review, and that was with reference to the doctors' fees—I don't think there was any other—I don't think Mr. Day was in communi<lb/>cation with our office before the summons was taken out—I don't think I had spoken to Mr. Day—at the time of the summons to review the taxation, I don't think we had received any information that the witnesses, or some of them, had not been paid—I believe there were two summonses, now I come to think of it—there was a summons to review the master's taxation, I think, and the other to review the expenses of the witnesses who attended at Kingston, but they were settled at the same time—I don't think there was a summons taken out after that, and abandoned—I don't know the date of the second summons—I say they were both heard at the same time by Mr. Baron Cleasby—I paid the defendant the money on 4th August, the date of the receipt—I think I had seen Mr. Day at that time—I had not received information at that time that the witnesses had not been paid; if I had, I would not have paid the money—I don't know whether I had seen Day myself; I don't think I had any conversation with him—I did not have any conversation with any of the medical gentlemen—I attended to this matter under Mr. Stevens.—at the time the money was paid, on 4th August, I had not been informed by Day that the witnesses had not been paid—I had no reason to believe they had not; I believed they had been paid by Mr. Tanner, directly or indirectly, the medical gen<lb/>tlemen as well as the others—the action brought against the Company was resisted strongly throughout—they knew that we meant to fight the case—I think the claim was 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the husband, and 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the wife; 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—we resisted on the ground that there was no cause for the action, and they were not injured certainly to the extent they claimed—to a certain extent it was a fraudulent claim, an exaggerated claim, and it was fought in that spirit throughout—the evidence was given on Saturday, 24th June; the taxation was 24th July—when the bill of costs was taxed, it was 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and it was impossible for us to pay the amount; and by 11 o'clock the next morning the Sheriffs were on London Bridge Station—the Judge ordered him to return us the expenses, about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he put the Sheriff in on 25th July—we received a notice from Mr. Day, on the 25th or 26th, to pay him the money, and not Mr. Tanner—there was a verdict for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Day, through his attorney, took out a summons to show cause why the amount had not been paid into Court—we attended that summons, and Mr. Baron Cleasby ordered that the damages should be paid into Court, subject to any rival claims—I believe Mr. Day had changed his attorney—I</p>

               <p>believe the money is lying there now, but I hare not been to search—I only paid Mr. Tanner 236<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think the total amount for the costs of the medical witnesses is between 108<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the bill of costs would be between party and party—I don't know that gentlemen of the emi<lb/>nence of Dr. Hancock do not attend trials without their expenses are guaranteed—the total amount here between seven and eight doctors, is 28 guineas; but there would be other large fees—I should be very much surprised if the costs out of the pocket of the solicitor amounted to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I should think it would be more like a quarter of that sum—I should think 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would cover it.</p>

With regard to the costs out of pocket, supposing he got 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. damages, he would charge the plaintiff a certain sum for the costs, except those he could recover upon this affidavit, and when I paid him that 236<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I believed he had paid all that sum—the reviewing of the taxation was with reference to the medical fees, not the other fees, and I paid the defendant the 236<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the belief that that sum had been paid by him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, and landlord of the Oxford Arms, Warwick Lane—on the 23rd September prisoner came to my place, sat down, took out two bottles, and placed them on the table—he stayed about half-an-hour, and then said "I want to run round to the office, would you oblige me by putting these on one side"—I said "Yes, certainly," and did so—he did not come back, but was taken into custody, and the bottles remained in my possession.</p>

I live at 14, Wall Street, Blackfrian Road, about four minutes' walk from prisoner's house—on September 23rd I happened to be in the Oxford Arms, a lad brought in a box without a lid—the lad went out, and prisoner's wife went to the box, took the paper off the top, and took out a lot of papers—she must have emptied the box—all she took out were papers—on the 30th September I was there also—Mr. Joyce came in—a conversation between Joyce and Mrs. Clairmont took place—I did not see any box.</p>

The box contained my overalls and jackets—the taps and other things belong to me, and were used in my former business; the quicksilver was given me by Mrs. Judkins at the Crystal Palace, and was what remained. I had to superintend some work, and declined to do it because of my unsettled state. The tools were given to me to complete the work; the lead I sold to Dale is what remained of my late business.</p>

I am a physician, and reside at Bridge House, Kingston-on-Thames—in consequence of seeing a newspaper advertisement I went to Dean Street, Soho, and saw the prisoner Wicks—I told him I called in reference to the advertisement—he made excuses, and said the owner of the horse had gone to Richmond—I asked if he had a horse there that would suit me—he said he had one four years old, and knew its history, mention<lb/>ing the name of a railway contractor as its late owner, that it was very quiet, and would stand at the door of a house without requiring any<lb/>one</p>

Millington—Giles spoke to Fuller there—I next saw Fuller in Queen Victoria Street, where he was joined by Hudd—they then drove to Silver Street, Blackfriars Road, and there delivered some paper—they drove to Surrey Row, under the railway arch—Hudd got out of the van—something was given him from the tail-board, which Hudd took through a court, into Friar Street—Fuller then drove on to Gravel Lane—I followed Hudd into Friar Street, where are the premises of Mrs. Cole—the words "Jane Cole" are over the door, and "Marine Store Dealer," and best price given for different articles, named on the board—I went to Gravel Lane, and saw Fuller's van standing outside the Hope public-house—I had lost sight of Hudd, close to Cole's door, and went after Fuller, who was joined by Hudd at the Hope—they separated on coming out—I saw Fuller again on the 29th, about 9 o'clock, at Milling<lb/>ton's, in Budge Row—he left there with his van full—he waited in Victoria Street a few minutes—Hudd spoke to him, and walked on—they joined again in New Street, near Blackfriars Bridge, and walked over the bridge together—the van stopped under the railway arch—Hudd did the same as before, looked up and down, and then went back to the van—Fuller gave Hudd a sack out of the van on to his back—there was a bluish stripe on the sack, which was held upwards—the bottom of the sack had been mended—I saw Hudd carry the sack into Friar Street, to Mrs. Cole's shop, and place it on the scales, which were about a yard inside the door—Mrs. Cole and a boy were in the shop at the time—I was not half a dozen yards away when Hudd was brushing himself down—the boy put the weights on, and Mrs. Cole appeared checking the weights—he was in the shop six or seven minutes, dressed as he is now, except his hat—I then followed Hudd to Southwark Street, and made a communication to Smith, the officer engaged in this matter, and returned to Friar Street, and watched Mrs. Cole's premises till 3.30—I was there when she was appre<lb/>hended.</p>

Police!

I have not been able to show my face anywhere, fearing arrest; I therefore throw myself entirely on your mercy, should you still wish to carry out your determination, as the imprisonment will be preferable to the torture I am undergoing; but I think your heart is not so hard as that, although mine has been the reverse; but it was the drink that caused it, being the ruin of a good many. However, it will be a lesson to me. I remain, in waiting, yours obediently, T.

Ross's warehouse in Houndsditch—I saw Fletcher there, and had a conversation with him—some time afterwards Moore came in—Fletcher said "I sold you one dozen of rules and a two dozen of rules, they are in packets"—Moore said "You did not"—Fletcher reminded him of the time, and he said "I did buy them"—I went over to Moore's house, and he gave up the goods—I had been trying to find goods be<lb/>longing to the prosecutor.</p>

I am a customer of Mr. Ross's, and have known the prisoner for two or three years as his shopman; the goods which I delivered up on the 20th I gave to Mr. Ross because I believed a good many of them were his property, and I let him take them all. I can't say which of those goods I bought of the prisoner; I can't say that I bought any of them from him; I did not say to Mr. Ross, or to the officer, that I had bought the goods of the prisoner, or that that was the reason I gave them up.

I am a shoemaker, of Playhouse Yard—about 12.15 on the morning of the 26th, I was at the Leopard, in Seward Street, Goswell Road, with a brother of Powell's (<hi rend="italic">see next case</hi>)—Powell threw some tobacco pipes at his brother, and I asked him the meaning of it—he said "I will do for you"—I said "Not while I am here; while he is with me I will protect him"—he said "I will do for you—I said "Not me, for I will not quarrel with you"—he struck at me, and the landlord said "I will have no fighting here; you had better go outside"—I went outside, to avoid a quarrel, and the two Powells and the prisoner came out, and fell on top of me—Powell made a blow at me, and the prisoner pulled out a knife, opened it with his teeth, and said "I will <hi rend="italic">chiv</hi> you"—while I was sparring with him I felt a prick in my back, and said "I am stabbed"—the prisoner was the closest person to me, and he had a knife—he was stopped—they used him roughly—the other three got away—I went to the station—my trowsers and shirt were stabbed through, and I was bleeding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not try to return the blow inside the house, but when he hit me outside, I hit him back—there was no ill-feeling between me and Powell, but there was between the two brothers Powell—I said to one of them, "Your brother wants to be friends with you"—he said "No, I will do for him"—this is not the first time I have mentioned that—I will swear I did not provoke him to fight—I am not fond of fighting—I have fought in the prize-ring; but it is eight years since I struck a blow at anybody—I cannot swear that the blow was not given by Elizabeth Powell.</p>

As soon as I was remanded he went to my wife and sister, and told them I was charged with burglary, and that a lot of bad money fell out of the bundle. She said "You must have known that it was a made-up thing, if you leave your windows open. It has pressed upon my wife, and taken her reason away. The Rev. Dr. Cox said that he would appear for me, and he has been here all the week. It is all made up by the policeman, because a robbery had been committed on his beat, and he thought he would put it on me. My word is as good as his; he deserves to be in my place. I have a blind mother, and a wife and child. My master is Mr. Chamberlain, a carpenter. If I can raise a little money when I go out, I will try and show you that I am speaking the truth.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a telegraph engineer, and proprietor of the Telegraph Works, at North Woolwich, and also owner of the steam-ship <hi rend="italic">La Plata</hi>—she has been used several times for laving, marine cables—the prisoner Henman was in my service as chief-mate of the <hi rend="italic">La Plata</hi>, for a few months—on Saturday, 19th August, I went on board the <hi rend="italic">La Plata</hi>—Henman was on board, but Hilliard was not—Hilliard had spoken to me about some rope, and offered to purchase it for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per ton—I said I would go on board the first opportunity, and examine it, and see if it was fit to be condemned—I went on board, and Henman showed me the rope, lying on the forecastle—I told him to bring it ashore, and weigh it on the turn-table, in the proper manner, and let Hilliard take it away with him—a day or two afterwards Henman paid me 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was not exactly the price at 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per ton—I was told the rope weighed 15 cwt. 3 qrs.—Hilliard was frequently employed in putting coal on board the ships, not by me, but by the coal merchants—I never gave anyone authority to take any rope from the ship, except that which I saw on the forecastle, and which was brought to the works, and weighed—I received an anonymous letter, after the ship had sailed, in consequence of which I caused inquiries to be made.</p>

Hilliard never bought anything of me before—I employed him once to discharge a ship; about twelve months ago, I should think—I had had the same captain on the <hi rend="italic">La Plata</hi> for the two previous voyages—the day before Hilliard spoke to me the captain said that the old rope on board might be got rid of, and he mentioned that Hilliard would buy it—I told him to see me after I had seen the rope—I told the captain that I would sell it to Hilliard—according to the ordinary course of things the ship's boats would not be lowered to take the rope ashore—I don't know what boat brought the 15 cwt 3 qrs. ashore—the ship sailed on the 25th—she was taking in cable all that time, and she sailed immediately she was ready—I don't recollect seeing Hilliard on board when I saw the old rope—I don't recollect a clearing of old rope taking place before—I got the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Henman, on the Tuesday, I think, within a day or two after I had seen the rope.</p>

I am a constable employed on Mr. Henley's works, at North Woolwich—from instructions I received I saw Hilliard on 2nd Sep<lb/>tember, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening—I asked him if he knew anything about the rope that had been taken from the <hi rend="italic">La Plata</hi>—he said he had bought some rope from the <hi rend="italic">La Plata</hi>, but Mr. Henley knew all about it—I said "I don't mean that which went ashore at the works to be weighed, but that which was taken away in two boats, and taken to the Victoria Docks Pier Head—he said he had bought some of the chief mate, and gave him about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, he did not recollect to a few shillings—I saw Hilliard again on 8th September; he then said he recollected what he had given the mate for the rope which was taken away in the two boats, and taken to the Victoria Docks Pier Head; he said it was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I met him again on 12th September, riding in his cart—I got into his cart and accom<lb/>panied him back to his house—Inspector White eventually took him into custody—I afterwards went on board the <hi rend="italic">La Plata</hi>, and saw Henman—I said "What do you know about this?"—he said "I know nothing at all about it"—I said "It is no use your saying that, I have seen the carters and the boatmen, and I have seen Hilliard, who said he gave you 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it"—Henman then said "As so much is known of it I may as well tell the truth; I did sell it to him, and received the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I should not have done so if Hilliard had not persuaded me to do so."</p>
