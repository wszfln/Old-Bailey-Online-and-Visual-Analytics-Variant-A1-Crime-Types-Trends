He came out again, in a little Time, and told me and another, he could shew me such a Sight, as I never saw with my Eyes. He pull'd out a Bag, and put twelve 3 l. 12 s. Pieces, and one Guinea into my Hand; from another Bag he took out several other Outlandish Pieces of Gold, but did not tell the Number of them; putting his Hand in his Pocket, he shew'd me Parcel a of Guineas, I can't say how many there might be; and then, opening a Paper, he produc'd a Diamond-ring, and said, he believ'd that was of more Value than all the rest; he likewise pull'd out a Purse of Gold, as he said it was, but he did not open it - and as for Silver I did not see any. He told me that his Master, who (he said) liv'd at Nottingham, had sent him about the Country with Orders to receive this Money for Goods, but I thought it more likely that he had committed some Robbery, or Murder, and so I fetch'd Assistance and apprehended him on suspicion, upon which he at first said he'd make me pay for stopping him on his Journey - But afterwards he own'd that he had robb'd his Master East.</p>

             told my Father, and me, that he suspected the Prisoner, and wanted a Constable. I said any Man might take a Thief. My Father, Humphry Buckle, seiz'd the Prisoner, and said he should go with us before the Justice. The Prisoner refused, and pulling out a Pocket-Book, said, Here's my Orders from my Master in the Country. I did not see the Writing, for he made a Hand of it; but I saw 48 Guineas, 12 Portugal Pieces of 3 l. 12 s. each, and some Doubloons, and double Doubloons, I think they call 'em. The Morning ( after he had been before the Justice ) as I lay by him on the Bed at the White-Bear, he confess'd to me, that he had robb'd his Master East of that Gold, and that he took it out of the Scratoir.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he say he had taken any thing else?</p>
               <p>Buckle. Yes, I remember a Piece of White Dimity and some other Things.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he tell you where Mr. East lived?</p>
               <p>Buckle. Yes, it was somewhere in London near the Monument; but I forgot the Name of the Street. And he wrote this Letter to his Master, who thereupon came down that Monday Night.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see him write the Letter?</p>
               <p>Buckle. Yes, I sat close by him when he writ it.</p>
               <p>Court. Then it may be read in Evidence.</p>

The Distiller not liking the Company I was in, advised me to leave my Watch with him, for fear I should lose it, but I told him I was able enough to take care of it myself; so I went out with the Prisoners, and in a Minute my Watch was gone, and they run away. The Distiller follow'd, and took Jones, but Clark got of. Jones told us Clark had got the Watch, and directed us to her Lodging, where we found her next Day, but she would not own she had my Watch, and so I lost it.</p>

I again desir'd him to let me take Care of his Watch. No, says he, I warrant ye I can take care of that myself; they must be cunning indeed, if they can get it from me. You shall see how safe it is; but putting his Hand to his Fob to shew me. Hah! says he, it's gone already!

He said he'd go and see what could be done in the new Street, I think 'tis Queen-street, which is hard by where he lives. At the farthest End we saw a Light in the Kitchen Window; and looking over the Pallisades, says the Prisoner, there's a Chance of a Silver Cup, if we cou'd get at it. We soon contrived a Way. They two hoisted me over the Pallisades, into the Airey, and I listed up the Sash. I suppose the Maid had lately been washing, for some Sheets and other Things lay on a Table by the Window. I took out the Cup, three Pair of Sheets, a Shift, and a Handkerchief, and had taken more, but that we were afraid the Maid would come down and surprize us. I handed the Cup up first, and the Prisoner not being tall enough to reach it as he stood, he rais'd himself up, and leaning over the Pallisades, took it in his Mouth; then I gave them the Linnen, which they haul'd through betwixt the Bars Dun helpt me up. The Prisoner gave him the Cup, and covering the Linnen with his Great-coat, carried it into the Vinegar-field, where he left it, and went Home, and returned with a Bag which he had forgot to bring out with him at first. He put the Linnen in the Bag, and so we went to Mr. Cotterel's, a

Dun told Mrs. Cotterel, he wanted some Money, and so had taken his Wife's Cup, and was going to sell it. Why, says Cotterel, as you look like well dress'd Persons, and have drank here before, I'll lend you a Guinea upon it. Dun told her that would not do, for he must sell it for two Guineas. Then, says she, I'll let you have 38 s. and if you redeem it in a Month, it is yours; if not, it is mine: So we struck a Bargain, she paid us the Money, and Dun, I, and the Prisoner, went to the Prisoner's Lodging, where we made a Dividend, each Man taking a Pair of Sheets, and 12 s. 8 d. in Money. - I discovered the Robbery in about a Fortnight afterwards.

               <p>Prisoner. The Pallisades are not so high that I needed to raise myself up, for I could look over them. I had no need to go a thieving, for I could maintain myself very well by my Work. I am a Cane-Chair-Carver by Trade, and my Father (in-law) is a Cane-Chair-Maker in Moor-fields. Indeed I marry'd against his Consent, but before and after he trusted me with Money to pay the rest of his Men.</p>

About 1 in the Morning, a little Man (like Simmonds) came and snatch'd my Pocket-book out of my Coat-pocket, I was then awake, for I had just had my Nap out. Aha! says I, What's that for? And catching up my Stick, I follow'd him. He turn'd back, and cut me into the Skull with some Weapon, I thought it was a Pistol by the Brightness, but Fidzar, their Accomplice, says it was a Cafe-Knife.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173401160007"/> With that I lifted up my Stick to take him a Knock, when Fidzar appear'd, and Smoaking Jack, I suppose it was he, came behind me, seiz'd my Arm, and took my Stick away, and fell a beating and mauling me. The other, who was like Simmonds, kept pushing me in the Head with the Knife, and said, You Dog, do you resent it? He wounded me so that my Skull might be seen in five Places, and I was almost blinded with the Blood that run down my Face I found my self over power'd, and begg'd for my Life : You Dog, says he with a Knife, speak another Word, and I'll shoot you thro' the Heart, and with that he stabb'd the Knife against my Breast, but the Stroke falling upon the Button of my Coat, I received no hurt by it. They took my Hat and Wig, a C knife, a Fork, a Razor, a half Shirt, and 20 d. in Money, and then they wanted my Coat, which I was very for I had no Waist swore they would have it, or be the the Death of me, and so they went to beating and kicking me again and believe would have kill'd me, but that Fidzar, who was the least of the three begg'd for my Life, and took the Knife from Simmonds, and threw it over into the Horse-road : It was a Moon-light Night, for the Moon was at the Full; but I was robb'd in the Shade of the Hay-rick, and therefore I could not see their Faces so plain as certainly to know 'em again. They took my Coat, and left me for dead, and went off; but Steel came back and gave me a Blow on the old Wound, and ask'd me if I knew any of them, and then he beat me on the Eyes and Mouth, to hinder me from speaking or seeing, and so he went away again - Besides what I mentioned before, they took out of my Pocket a particular Thing that I kept secret, for no Body but myself knew that I had any such thing about me, and this Thing Fidzar describ'd to me so exactly, that I was satisfy'd he knew something of the Robbery - It was a turn'd Stick for a Snuff-Mill.</p>

            . I met with Simmonds at Buck's Brandy-shop, against St. Giles's-Church, on the 14th of July, in the Morning, I was in and out there all Day. Towards the Evening, Steel came in, and we drank together; says Simmonds to me, Will you go out with me and this Man to Night? Ay, says I Who is he? Why don't you know him? says Simmonds, it's smoaky Jack - That's a Nick-name that Steel goes by; so we turn'd out together about 11 at Night. They let me to Hide- Park, and so into the Field behind Buckingham-Wall : Now, says Simmond, let's cross to that Hay-cock ; we agreed, and he led the Way, and coming to the Hay-cock, the Prosecutor was lying under it, Damn says Simmonds, Who's here? And prese took a Pocket-book out of the Prosecutor's Pocket; the Prosecutor got up to follow him, but was stopp'd by Smoaky Jack, who took off his Hat and Wig, and beat him se- verely; when his Wig was off I saw he was bald headed, tho' he was but a middle Man. Simonds push'd a Knife at him would have kill'd him, but I begg'd his, and got the Knife away; I saw it was bent, and I toss'd it over the Rail into the P; but Smoaky Jack still kept beating, and kicking, and abusing him, and at last pull'd off his Coat. They shew'd me the Pocket-book, and a Sham-Shirt, and a little turn'd Stick that we knew not what to make of. The Hat and Wig were in my my Hands for I had them from Smoaky, when he took 'em from the Prosecutor;  was any Mo- ney they sunk it, for I had no part of it. When we had got the Prosecutor's Coat we left him, but getting under the Rail I saw one of the Company turn back - I believe it was Simmonds - and I and the other coming to a high Bank, we waited for him, because two of us could not get over without the Assistance of a third, and so we help'd each other up, and went over Hedge and Ditch, 'till we came to a Ditch too wide for us, and then we return'd by the same Hay- cock, and came to Buck's at St. Giles's by 3 a Clock on Sunday Morning. I wash'd the Blood out of the Coat, and then Simmonds put it on, and Smoakey and he went away together. They to me at Buck's, about 9 the same Morning. They two toss'd up for their share in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173401160008"/> Coat, Simmonds won Smoakey's part and he was to pay me for my part; he had the sham Shirt too, and I had the Hat and Wig; the Wig I sold for 6 d. but the Hat (which we valu'd at 10 d ) I kept for my own wear. Simmonds did not go out with us that Night, but with Sutton and Stick-in-the-Mud* and a heap of them, that frequented Buck's House. Next Morning when I came to Buck's, expecting Simmonds would meet me there, and pay me for my part of the Coat, I heard that he, and Sutton, and others were taken up for robbing a Gentleman in Mary-bone-Fields.</p>

Both the Prisoners endeavour'd to sit by me several times; I desir'd him, as he was Master of the House, to keep them off, for I did not like their Familiarity. Then both the Prisoners, at times, endeavour'd to get at my Pocket; I told him it had an ill look, and let him know my Name, and where I liv'd, that he might not think I would bear with ill Usage, for fear of being expos'd. As I was near the Door, I went to go out, but found the Door was fast: I had reason to think I was in bad Hands, and feeling for my Gold-watch, I miss'd it. I told him I was afraid he was a great Villain, and if he did not restore the Watch, I would raise the Neighbourhood, which might be of ill Consequence to them all. Says he, I'll try what I can do for you; but if I get it, what will you give? I ask'd him, What he requir'd? He said, he would not meddle with it under 5 Guineas. I reply'd it was very unreasonable in him, to insist upon any thing for helping me to my Watch when he knew how it was lost; but however, I shew'd him 2 Guineas. Well, says he, I'll consult about it; and so he and the two Prisoners went aside into a Box, and order'd me not to come near. In about 10 Minutes he call'd me in, bid me lay down the two Guineas, and look in the Window: I desir'd to see the Watch first, upon which he drew the Curtain, and I saw it. I clapp'd the two Guineas on the Table, sprung to the Window, and got the Watch, intending to take up my Money again, but he took it up before me; I re- proach'd him with his Usage, and insisted on his returning the two Guineas; upon which he and the two Women laid Hands on me, and drag'd me to the farther End of the Room; I thought my self in imminent Danger, and dragg'd them towards the Door, and they dragg'd me back again. Says Distance, He'll be too hard for us, let us throw him into the Cellar. This added to my Surprize, and I told them, I hop'd they had no design upon my Life, and again threaten'd to alarm the Neighbourhood. And indeed, at last I found a Necessity to cry out, Murder! and Thieves! when by God's Mercy, the Watchman being upon his Rounds, came to my Assistance, and they were all carry'd to the Compter, but Stanley made his Escape from them.</p>

            . The Prisoner and I lodg'd at Mrs. Whitehead's* in Bit-Alley in Turnbull-street - Her Husband is a Watch-maker - We went thence about Midnight, and walked up and down to look for a Chance, 'till we came to the Prosecutor's House. There the Prisoner took a sort of a Chissell and split the Flap of the Cellar-window in two, and raising up one of the pieces, I took out a Barrel of Anchovies that stood upon the Stairs; I felt more, but they stood so close together, that we could not get another, without pulling up the remaining part of the plank, which at last, with a good deal of Trouble, I made a shift to manage, and then he took out another Barrel. We could then have got into the Cellar, but some of the Barrels rolling down the Stairs, made a Noise, and so we went off. He took one, and I another, and carry'd them home, where we let them lie 'till Day-light, and then went with them to Mrs. Whitehead's in Charter-house-Lane, for at that time she did not live at home, but kept out of the Way upon Account of receiving some-Plate that was stolen. We shewed her the Anchovies; she said they were poor Stuff, and ask'd how much we must have. I told her to take no less than 7s. 6d. The Woman of the House said, there had been a Noise about her having, stolen Goods in her House, and therefore it was not safe to leave the Anchovies - I forget her Name, but I think they call her Jenny - So they were wrap'd up in an Apron, and sent to Mrs. Taylor, who keeps a Pawnbroker's and Chandler's Shop, against the Blue-Boar, in Barbican. Then the Prisoner and I took a Walk towards the Prosecutor's, and heard the People talking about the Robbery. Coming back, we met Jenny in Smithfield: She gave us 4s. 6d. and said it was all that Whitehead could get - I surrender'd my self, January 2, to Mr. Claxton, who with two more went with me to Mr. Cross, the Constable, and he carry'd me to Justice Ribe.</p>

By Fidzar's Direction I took the Prisoner at a Brandy-shop in Rosemary-Lane, and as I came with him in the Coach, he begg'd me to speak in his Favour, or he knew he was a dead Man, for he said Fidzar was a Rogue, and had been an Evidence two or three times before, and he was sure he would take his Life away.</p>

            . Some Days before we to the Anchovies, the Prisoner and I went from Whitehead's late at Night, and walk'd about 'till we came to the Pewter-platter, and then it was 3 a Clock. The Prisoner put in his Chissel between the Plank and the Frame, and thrust one of the Bolts back, and pull'd the Plank up. He took out his Tinder-box, and struck a Light in the Street, and putting the Box in his Pocket again, went down the Cellar and lighted a Candle below, for he carried Candles and Matches in his Pocket as well as a Tinder -box. I shut down the Window and staid to watch. In a little Time he knock'd, and I open'd it again. Lay hold, says he, here's two charming Great-coats, one was Cloth, and had a Velvet Cape, and one was a blue Rug. I carried them over the Way, and left 'em on a Bulk. Then he handed up a pair of Cloth Breeches, two pair of Shoes, and a pair of Pumps ; a pair of worsted Splatter-casnes, a blue Apron, and a natural Wig; I laid these with the Great-coat till he came and then we went down an Alley, and each of us pat on one of the Great-coats, under which we took the rest of the Things, and went to Whitehead's. She was not up, but bid us bring the Great-coats to Taylor's in Barbican, for the other Things we shar'd betwixt us. We went thither, and she came to us. I told her the Coats were worth 18 s. but we must not have less than 16. The Prisoner and I went over to the Ale-house, and in a little Time she brought us 14s. and said if that was too little, we might have the Coats again in a Fortnight. We took the Money and shared it equally, and so we went to a Brandy-shop in Rag-fair, where we used to be harboured. From thence we went to a Lodging house hard by, where we lay all Night, his Wife lay with him, and I lay in another Bed in the same Room 'Tis a Sort of an Ale-house, the the Sun and Wheathead. We can there before, but not constantly for we were never rightly settl'd.</p>

I had the Prisoners before his Majesty the Justice of Peace, where they confess'd, and their Consession was taken in Writing, tho' they refus'd to sign it; but after they were sent to Newgate, Tilson said if we'd let them go with us, he'd shew us where the Goods were pawn'd; so we took them both handcuff'd and they went directly to the Pawn-broker's, where the Goods were found, and they both confess'd there, that they took 'em out of the Shop. And Tilson told us before the Justice, that the Sugar was under his Bed.</p>

            . A little after 12, the Watch call'd and said the Street Door was open. I call'd up Mr. Gardner's Servant, and we went down together and search'd the House, but found no body hid, nor did I miss any thing: And so thinking the Door had been left open, carelesly I made it fast, and went to Bed again, without observing that the Key was taken out of the pin of the Windows. About 4 I was call'd up again, and then I found that the Window-matter was open, and the Shop had been robb'd a. I got a Warrant to search some Lodging Houses of ill Repute in the Neighbourhood. At one of those Houses we found these three Lumps of Sugar, under a Bed, and two Lads in Bed in the same Room; we charged them. They said the Prisoner lay in that Bed last Night, and that they went out about 11, but did not know what Time they came in again: However we took these two to the Constable's, and while we there the two Prisoners passed by the Window, and one of those we had taken happened to see 'em, and said there goes Tilson and Worrel! We went out and took 'em, they both cry'd, and said we should have the Goods again. At first Tilson said they had hid them in a Brick-field, but soon after confess'd he had given them to his Sister, who had pawn'd 'em. I ask'd him how they got in. He said he went down the Cellar Window (which had no Shutter) and so came up into the Shop, and open'd the Street Door and let in Worrel, but hearing the Watch, he took out the Key of the Pin of the Window, and they went off. They returned between 3 and 4, and drawing out the Pin, they put back one of the Shutters, and he went in and handed the Goods out to Worrel, who took them in his Apron. - Worrel confess'd the same.</p>

Catherine, says I, why d'you sit sleeping there ? Why don't you go to Bed? But immediately recollecting myself, Lord bless me! says I, she went to Bed when I did! So I got up and run to the Window and found the Sash open. I saw something move before me, as far off as my Hand is, but what it was I cannot tell, for I could not see Head nor Face, and so I call'd out Thieves, and I afterwards found a Ladder left standing against the Window. I lost a Silver-tankard, three silver Spoons, a Velvet manteel, a Cambrick-hood, and a pair of silk Shoes and Clogs.</p>

            . The Prisoner and I frequented Mrs.Church's Brandy-Shop, at Salt-Peter-Bank, in Rag-Fair, we were often there from Morning to Night. On the Sunday before New-Years Day, we went from thence about 10 at Night to break open the Prosecutor's House, which we had attempted once before, but were hinder'd by the Watch. When we came to the Place, I wrenched open the Lock of the Cellar-door with a Chissel; but it making a Noise, we look'd up and saw a Light in the Window, and being afraid the People were alarm'd, we went off a little, and stood upon the Watch; but the Candle being soon put out, we concluded they were gone to Bed, and had not heard us. So struck a Light in my Tinder-box, and the Prisoner went down with it, and lighted a Candle below, for he had a Candle and Matches in his Pocket. I waited above to look out; the Watch coming by past 11, I bid him lie close, and stepp'd aside; but they taking no notice, I return'd to my post. The Prisoner brought up one Firkin, which I set by, and then he fetch'd another, and each of us taking one, we carry'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173401160017"/> them to Whitechapel-Mount, and cover'd them with Dung. We staid there till 4 a Clock, and then went to Church's Shop, for we knew she would be up by that time. When it was light, I propos'd we should fetch them; but the Prisoner being very sleepy would not go himself, but gave another Man (we call him French Peter) Six-pence to bring one of them. Peter and I went together and brought them to Church's. Where they stood all Day, for we could not find a Chap. Next Morning I met

             (who buys old Clothes in the Fair) and another Woman. They tasted one of the Firkins, we ask'd them Two pence Half-penny a Pound, they bid us 2 d. and we agreed to it. The Firkins weigh'd about half a Hundred and eight Pounds a-piece, but one of them not proving so good as the other, the Women would give us but 16 s. for the Whole. We knew not where to mend our Market, and so we consented to take their Money: Anderson carry'd one away, and I carry'd the other, to a House hard by, to which I afterwards directed the Prosecutor; but it was gone before he came. She said she would come to Church's and pay us. I went to eat a ha'p'orth of boil'd Potatoes in the Fair, and going back to Church's I met Anderson, who told me she had paid the Money to the Prisoner. I went to him, and he gave me 8 s. for my half - No, it was but 7 s, 9 d. for we had two Pots of Cherry-beer, which he paid for out of the Whole.</p>

We came to this Brandy-shop (the Prosecutor's) in Brick-Lane, I flung back two flat Bolts with an Iron, and wrenched the Plank up. I struck a Light in my Tinder-box, and gave it the Prisoner, who went down and lighted a Candle below; some Butchers came along with a Hurricane of Marrow-bones and Cleavers. I bid him lie snug, 'till they were all gone by, which he did, and then brought up a Cask, and a Box of Tobacco. He went down a second Time, and brought another Cask. We carry'd them into a Field behind the House, and empty'd them into our Bags, and so went to Church's, leaving the empty Casks and Box behind us.

He answer'd, God damn you, I saw your Watches in the Morning - When he had got the Purse, he look'd both Ways and went off.

There was a Guinea, a Crown, a half Crown, a Queen Elizabeth's Six-pence, and some other Silver - Here's the Coat and Whip.</p>

            , Constable. I follow'd the Prisoner to Brompton, and took him into Custody; he pray'd me to keep him from the Mob, and lend him a Bible. I told him I had none about me, but he should have one, and other good Books at my House. I carry'd him before Justice Vincent, who made his Mittimus to Newgate. I thought it was then too late, and unsafe to carry him thither that Evening, and so I kept him all Night in my own House, and next Morning carry'd him in a Coach to Newgate. By the Way he own'd to me that he had robb'd Mrs. Cox - There was a Report that one Downs a Baker who had done it, but that was a Mistake.</p>

            . The Prisoner and I used to drink at Maddox's Ale-house. We went from thence the Beginning January, two Years ago, between 7 and 8 at Night, and walk'd about till 9, when we came to the Prosecutor's House. The Window-shutters were put to, but not fastned. I pull'd 'em open, hoisted up the Sash, went in, took 5 Tea-spoons, a pair of Tea-tongs, and two silk Birds-eye Indian Handkerchiefs, and handed them out to the Prisoner, who stood at the Window to watch. He has been concerned with me at other Times in robbing the Prosecutor. We went back to Maddox's. The Prisoner sold the Tea-spoons and Tongs for 8 s. and the Handkerchiefs for 4 s. and gave me 6 s. for my Share.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said before my Lord Mayor that I enter'd the House.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Pray let his Information be read?</p>
               <p>Then the Clerk of the Arraigns read Oaks's Information taken before the Right Hon. the Lord Mayor, Jan. 8, 1733-4. Oak therein gives an Account of van Numbers of Robberies committed by himself and several others, for 4 or 5 Years past, and among tho rest, those which he charged the Prisoner with.</p>

            . About one a Clock a Saturday Morning, the Prisoner came into a Publick-house where I was, for a Pint of Beer, and ask'd if they could change a Guinea; she was answer'd, No. She lighted a Candle, and went out, some Body there said, she had a Watch, and a Snuff-box; upon which I follow'd her 4 or 5 Doors, and she went into another. I stood at the Door to listen, and heard a Woman's Voice, saying, Well, Grace, What have you got to Night? She answer'd, That as will fetch my Clothes out of pawn, and now I'll follow this Trade no more, but get into a Place and live honest. I suppose some Body there had got a Buckle from her, for I heard her say, Now I can bang you for taking that Buckle. She was ask'd how she could be so barbarous to serve the Man so? And she reply'd, I did it out of Spight, for when I had pick'd him up, and carry'd him to my Lodging, he could do nothing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The first House where the Prosecutor lay with me, was the Coach and Horses in Bond-street. I am an Oyster-woman by Trade, and that Night as he lost his Things, I was sitting by Temple-Bar with my Goods, and he came out of the Devil-Tavern, and call'd, Here, you Oyster-woman! and I turning about, O, says he, is it you my Dear? How do you do ? Will you go and take a Night's Lodging with me? I said, No, and with that he threw my Oysters about the Street. You Villain you, says I, han't you done enough in getting me with Child, but you must throw my Goods away? Then he said, truly, that he'd make me any Satisfaction, and so he gave me a Crown for my Oysters, and follow'd me to my Cellar, where he would go to Bed, and there was another Woman with me, and I went out and left them together - When I was at the Red-Lion against Drury-Lane, Will. Adams, the Thief -catcher, told me, if I'd give him two Guineas he discharge me, and because I would not, he sent for Allen the Constable - When the last Witness follow'd me from the Coach and Horses Alehouse, where I went to change a Guinea, he went to put his Hands up my Coats, and ask'd me to go along with him; and when I was at the Brandy-shop, Davis bid me go backwards and warm myself, and he brought me half a Pint of Liquor, and begg'd the Seal of me, and said it was Brass; but when he found I would not part with it for nothing, he gave me a Shilling for it - If I would have spent the Money among these People, I should soon have been let loose again.</p>
