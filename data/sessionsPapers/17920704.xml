               <p>I was servant to Mr. Howarth; I know Keeling and Abbott; I saw them at the Goat, in Stafford street, on the 22d of March; they proposed to me to brake my master's house open; we met the night before the robbery, and it was agreed in Dover street that the house should be broke open by the two prisoners and Caverner; when we met I was drunk; we agreed I was to leave the bolts open; Keeling said there was no occasion to leave only one, as he had materials once to break all the bolts in the kingdom; Keeling went home with me, and took some shrub to give the maid to make her sleep; about two o'clock I heard a noise of breaking the plate chest; I was terrified, and I went to them and told them not to make such a noise or they would surely be taken; this was about three in the morning; then they went down stairs and swore at each other, and said they expected to find many quid, those are the men; I saw Abbott and Keeling at that time; when they were going a soup ladle dropped by Keeling.</p>

               <p>Upon that day did the prisoner at the bar come to their banking house? - On that day, as I believe, between three and four, somewhere near four, the prisoner came into the banking shop and presented the draft I have now in my hand as the draft of

             for payment; on my receiving the draft, I asked him in what manner he chose to receive it, and he answered four 20 l. notes, and the remainder in cash; the draft is for 96 l. upon his answering me, I looked again at the draft, and was persuaded in my own mind it was not the hand-writing of Mr. Hardinge; I again repeated the same question, and received the same answer; I then referred to Mr. Morgan, who concurred in my opinion; I heard the questions which Mr. Morgan put; he can better tell you; the draft has been in my possession ever since; the prisoner was secured and taken to Bow Street.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with Mr. Hardinge's hand-writing? - I should suppose six or seven years.</p>
               <p>He has, during that time, drawn on your house? - He has very frequently.</p>
               <p>Did he keep cash at your house? - He did (looking at the draft over and over again); I firmly believe, to the best of my judgment, that it is not his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt of it? - I have great doubt that he wrote it.</p>
               <p>(The draft produced and read.)</p>
               <p>Court. As far as a man can swear to the hand-writing of another, do you believe it is not his hand-writing? - I believe it is not the hand-writing of Mr. Hardinge, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If you had conceived it to be his hand-writing should you have paid on his draft? - Most certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding, prisoner's counsel. The mode of your judgment, whether Mr. Hardinge's, or not Mr. Hardinge's, is derived from the drafts that you have seen presented at your house? - Not in that situation.</p>
               <p>Your judgment at present is made in this way, that this writing is not like other writing of drafts that you have paid? - Just so.</p>
               <p>And the only way in which you make up your mind is, because you have seen drafts of Mr. Hardinge's presented for payment, and which had not been honoured, and this hand writing is not like that; read,</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, pay the bearer 96 l. yours G.</p>
               <p>"Hardinge."</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Besides this being very dissimilar to the character of Mr. Hardinge's hand-writing, was it in the mode of his drawing? - No, he at present draws, and did at that time, on a check, and signs his name different to that.</p>
               <p>Had that taken place in consequence of some peculiar circumstance; I do not ask what? - It had.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. You are a clerk to Messrs. Hoare? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect on the 11th of April the prisoner being at Mr. Hoare's? - Yes, I think I do; his person appears to me to be the same; I am rather blind; it is the same person that was taken to Bow street.</p>
               <p>Do you remember a draft being shewn to you by Mr. Willoughby? - Yes, perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Is that the same draft? - I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding - Have you any mark upon it? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Willoughby. I have marked.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Hardinge's handwriting? - Yes, sir, but not very particularly, though I am in the habit of knowing his hand-writing; not in the same degree as Mr. Willoughby.</p>
               <p>From the knowledge you have of his hand-writing, do you believe that is it? - I believe it is not.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179207040009"/>at the bar, or was there any between Mr. Willoughby and the prisoner in your hearing at that time? - Yes there was.</p>
               <p>State to the Court what passed. - I was accidentally sitting near Mr. Willoughby, and I do not immediately recollect seeing the prisoner come into the shop. Upon my seeing the draft, I had little or no doubt of it; therefore, I walked round the prisoner, and posted myself between him and the door. I then interrogated him where he got it. He told me he had received it from Mr. Hardinge. I do not recollect whether he said that morning or the preceding evening, but I told him he could not have received it that morning, because I was persuaded Mr. Hardinge was on the circuit to Wales. I am not sure, but I think he said he returned to town the preceding evening. I think I asked him for what purpose he might have the bill of Mr. Hardinge, and he told me that it was for some horses that Mr. Hardinge had purchased of a friend of his at Llandovery in Wales. I immediately left him in custody, and he went to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Had you no other conversation with him but what you have related? - Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>You did not persuade him at all to tell you any thing that passed with respect to the draft? - No.</p>

             at the bottom of the draft; - I will not swear that it is his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Which do you believe? - I think it is not, and I will give you my reason why, because he does not always write one hand, nor confine himself to one hand-writing; but the reason I think it is not his writing is, because he was in South Wales at the time, and not only that, but because it was not on a check upon which he at that time drew.</p>
               <p>I cannot take upon myself to say it is his writing he writes so different in drawing his drafts, and in letters which I have frequently seen, in short every day and every hour; for that reason, I could not say; we were in South Wales till Saturday: I cannot tell the day of the month, but I think it was the 14th. This was upon the day of the week Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. The only reason then for your thinking that this is not Mr. Hardinge's writing is, because he was in Wales at the time the note was presented? - One reason, Sir.</p>
               <p>That note you know may have been written a long time before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The other reason is, because this note does not appear to be on a check? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Otherwise you say Mr. Hardinge writes so many hands that it is difficult to say which is which? - It is. I cannot say that he writes in so different a hand, that I do not know that I can take upon myself to say that is not his hand.</p>
               <p>He writes as different hands as there are letters in the alphabet almost? - Yes, Sir.</p>

               <p>Did you see this confession signed by him?</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Permit me to ask who was in company with him at that time; were any of the gentlemen from Mr. Hoare's shop there? - No.</p>
               <p>I should think not. Had you yourself had any conversation with him before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had a good deal of conversation before he went in to the Justice? - No, not before he went in to the Justice, but when he had been in to the Justice, not before he went in: for this was drawn up before I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179207040010"/>saw him at all, and before Mr. Kitchener, and a young man of the name of Rant that is under-clerk in the office. Lightowler was taken over the way to the Green Man; then I talked a deal to him. Some time after he was sent back to the office, and it turned out that he had signed this confession then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The only question that is fit to be asked you before this is read, is this, had you, or any body else to your knowledge, made him any promise, or used any threats? - I cannot know what passed at the first; I do not know of any such thing.</p>

               <p>Did you see that signed by the prisoner? - Yes, I saw it signed by the prisoner at the magistrate's. It was read over by Mr. Lavender, one of the clerks, to the prisoner. Read.</p>

               <p>Court. You know your counsel has not an opportunity of saying any thing for you? - Clearly, my Lord. I wish to suggest there is a grand mistake in Mr. Macmanus's evidence: I do not know that the confession was ever read over to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding to Macmanus. You hear what Mr. Lightowler says.</p>
               <p>Macmanus. Yes, Sir, and I am very sorry to hear him say so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Lavender was the most likely person to know whether it was or was not. I have very little thoughts of its doing me a service: this I will tell you very candidly, that I read it over myself, but it never was read over to me.</p>
               <p>Macmanus. I am sure Mr. Lavender read it and gave it into his hand afterwards.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he read it to him in an open way, so that he heard the whole of what passed? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. How came Lavender not to be here? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Are you prepared then to say upon your oath, that it was read over? - I have no doubt about it, not the least; I wish Lavender was sent for.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no desire of the kind, I do not think it would serve me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. There is no harm in your suggestion of the question at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I hope not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. If you mean to say any thing to the Court or Jury, you must do it yourself. - I have nobody here. Apprehending from the message I received from the worthy solicitor against me, that my trial would not come on, I did not prepare myself with any witnesses at all.</p>

A gentleman was there at dinner and the prisoner; I had some victuals in the same room where the watch was. About two minutes after the prisoner went out, I missed the watch; I pursued the lad and got sight of him; he ran when he saw me, and he took down a passage; I saw his hand move, and I took him; he denied having the watch, and then said there is something there, and the watch lay behind a shutter.</p>

               <p>One day I was in great distress, and a gentleman came up and gave me 3 d. and I went into the shop: the gentleman was ringing the bell for coals. I was in great distress, out of place, and it was necessity made me take it; it is the first error I ever was guilty of, and I hope you will have a little mercy. I have no friend in the world but my mother; she lives at No. 52, in Skinner's-street; she knows I am in goal.</p>

I thought it was my master, but he is an old gentleman of 74 years of age, and I thought the foot was too quick for him: I came up and met the prisoner; he asked for a woman that was not in the house, and I seized him directly; then he dropped the silver soup ladle, and took out 6 silver table spoons and the gravy spoon, and went down on his knees, and said that it was his first offence; he asked me if I had all the spoons, I counted them over, and there were two more wanting; and he opened his breeches and took out two out of his breeches.</p>

            . I went first to Mr. Watts's, at Walworth-stairs, one of my masters; I went to Mr. Holland's, in Gray's Inn, and I was going up Holborn to buy a Builder's Price-book, and I met with the prisoner in Middle-row, Holborn; he was talking about London, and he said he had been subpoenaed on a trial from Lincolnshire, and was almost tired of London. Walking up Holborn in conversation with this man, he stooped and picked up a purse, and he had me over to a publick-house; I do not know the house, nor who kept it; just after a gentleman came in and opened the purse, and there was a receipt, bought of Mr. Smith, a diamond cross, value 230 guineas; the diamond cross was in the box.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you never in London before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to be such a fool then? what passed next? - The gentleman said the receipt was good for nothing, unless we had the prize; then he pulled out this cross, and the gentleman said if I was with him, I had a right to have half of it, and he should have expected the same, and he agreed to give me 100 l. for the half part of it, and he went out pretending to get the money, and he could not get the money, and he asked me if I could get the money; this gentleman gave me a card to one Mr. Blundell, the bottom of Holborn Hill; he said his name was Blundell, and we were to meet at this Mr. Blundell's between six and seven o'clock, and he was to return me my money back again, and 100 l.</p>
               <p>Court. Why you said nothing about your money yet? - He asked me if I could get the money, and I told him I could; I laid down on the table a hundred and five guineas; then he went out with the money, and we parted, and I went to this Mr. Blundell's, and not finding him there, I went to the Ram, in Smithfield, where he said he quartered.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body of the name of Blundell? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was that the man that you saw at the house? - No.</p>
               <p>Neither of them? - No, and at the Ram they told me there had been a trial on from Lincolnshire, but the people had been gone home a fortnight: then I went up to the Castle in Holborn, and in a very little time the prisoner came in; he asked me if I had seen the other; I told him I had been to the house, but there was no such man to be found; he said he would go and look after him; I followed him into Old-street; he said he must go into Old-street; there he went and found the other, and they wanted me to go and have something to drink; I told him I would not leave them; the other man slipped by us, I caught this prisoner; I cried murder, and there happened to be some officers in the house, and the prisoner was apprehended. Some of the money was produced, but I do not know how much; 98 guineas are in the hands of the Bow-street officer, Mr. Carpmeal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. This was your master's money, Mr. Foreman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179207040013"/>You had no difficulty, however, in parting with it for a good bargain which you know did not belong to you? - No.</p>
               <p>What had your master intrusted you with this money for? - To pay the men at Southend.</p>
               <p>You did not see this purse dropt? - No.</p>
               <p>It was not he that proposed to you that you was to have part of it, it was the gentleman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That gentleman seemed to have taken the most active part in it.</p>

               <p>I live in Holborn; I keep the Castle inn: I recollect about two in the day, that this gentleman and another came in and called for six pennyworth of brandy and water, and then another; the prosecutor and the young man that was along with him went away; the prisoner was not there at that time: the business had happened, as I understood it, at another house. Mr. Foreman, and another young man, came to my house; they went away; about six o'clock in the evening, or thereabouts, Mr. Foreman came into the coffee-room and had a glass at the bar, and asked me if I knew the men that were with him; I said I did not; says he, they have ruined me; says I what have they done to you; says he, I gave them 105 guineas.</p>

               <p>Then you never saw the prisoners at your house? - No, not at that time, but in the course of this discourse, this gentleman, the prisoner, came in and said he was to meet a person there at six o'clock; I said there are some gentlemen in the coffee-room; he walked in: says Mr. Foreman, I really think that is one of the men I gave the money to to-day. I told him to lay hold of him. I never saw the prisoner till six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court to Foreman. Where was it they got the 105 guineas from you? - At this man's house between one and two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Was that the young man that drank to you? - Yes, that was the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Where was Owen then? - He was there, but he went out after he got the money.</p>
               <p>Brady. I never saw Owen till that time.</p>
               <p>Was you in the house when Foreman first came in? - Yes, I was when Foreman and the other young man came in; I never saw this man at all till six in the evening, when this young man came in to ask me if I knew the parties.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If he had been there you must have seen him? - Yes, though he might have been there, I saw nobody in company but this young man and another.</p>
               <p>Court to Foreman. How long was the prisoner in the house? - I cannot say how long, he was out once or twice. When the prisoner came out, Foreman said to him, you did not meet me according to your promise, and the prisoner said come along with me.</p>

               <p>On Thursday last, me and Carpmeal and another officer had occasion to go to Mr. Clayton's in Old-street, where, I believe we remained about three hours. At about seven, or a little after, I was in the back-yard seeing them play at skittles, and I heard a great noise at the door of somebody calling out murder! - do not beat me! - do not beat me! - I said to Carpmeal, what is all this noise about, somebody said, it is a man and woman a fighting; however, I went to the door, and, to my surprise, the prisoner and the prosecutor were apparently to me a fighting. Owen had got hold of him by the hair of the head, and the prosecutor was endeavouring to get out of the entry into the street; I immediately said, what is all this about, and the prosecutor, Foreman, was crying, and saying, oh! for God's sake pity me, they have robbed me; - robbed you, says I, of what; why says he, they have dropped a purse; oh! says I, that is very well, and we took them both to Bow-street; I then took this cross from the prosecutor; I made him put his mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Do you know the value of it? - I should suppose from what I have heard, it is worth<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179207040014"/>about half-a-guinea, or something thereabout.</p>
               <p>(The cross produced.)</p>
               <p>We then took him into the parlour, and I believe he sent for some of the money: however, 98 of the guineas have been recovered out of the 105; Carpmeal has them.</p>

The prisoner came in, and called for a pint of beer; I asked him to sit down in the bar; he came in, and had another pint, and I asked him to have some tea; and after that he had another pint. During the time he was there, I had recourse frequently to the bag in which the bank-notes and cash were, to give change, which was kept in a drawer. After some time the prisoner went out, and said he would come in again and pay for his beer; he did not return. I saw him about six weeks afterwards; I asked him what he had been doing with himself all that time; he said he hoped I would forgive him. I saw him first at Union Hall, and afterwards at Bow-street.

The prisoner asked me where I was going; I said I was going home, what was that to him; so he made no more to do but pushed me down, and pulled me up again, and took away my watch.</p>

               <p>"May be you may find the watch." There was a good many looking besides me, and I looked and I found it laying between two tubs in Parker's Lane; I called out for our landlord, and gave it to him, for there were a whole parcel of blackguards about me; I thought they would take it from me, and our landlord carried it up to the watch-house, and gave it to that gentleman there.</p>

I said I would;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179207040020"/>but if he had another horse, I would rather make a chop with him; I asked him 35 guineas; he said the money was too much; he gave me 19 guineas and a poney; the 19 guineas was shared among four of us; we went into the country to commit a robbery. I have been in this line of thieving 18 months; I believe I have stolen 12 or 13 horses; I never said I did not mean to hurt the prisoner Mead; I never said so to Dixon or Bruce; I never was in custody in my life before.</p>

               <p>I am a coal-dealer. I know Holbrook and the prisoners; Holbrook called upon me since the prisoners had their hearing; I asked him what would become of Mead; he said he had nothing to say against him, for he had never done any thing with him; as for Jones, he was sure to be a dead man, and that what he had said before the magistrate was for the sake of his own liberty. I was subpoenaed last Tuesday night.</p>

               <p>I am a rope-maker. I was in company with Dixon when Holbrook said that he could not hurt Mead, not a hair of his head; and what he said himself was only to save himself; this conversation was in the tap-room.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. The prisoners wish to know how often you have been in custody within these two years? - I do not know that I was in custody.</p>
               <p>About four years ago you was not in custody for being concerned with a desperate gang of water-pirates? - Whether I was in custody; I was not in custody; I was taken, for they said they sold me things.</p>
               <p>Was you ever in custody about some Prussian blue? - Why that is the same affair.</p>
               <p>Was you ever committed from Litchfield-street for robbery, for which you at present stand indicted? - Was I committed for robbery, I never was committed for no robbery.</p>
               <p>You never was in Litchfield-street, perhaps? - Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear you was not? - That I was not committed; why there was something that somebody said.</p>
               <p>Is there, at this time, an indictment against you for it? - Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>How long is it since you was admitted a witness in Worship-street, about some callico; how long ago is that? - Mr. Garrow, if you will give me leave one thing, was I not to come here at all.</p>
               <p>Answer the question, how long is it since you was admitted a witness for the crown in Hog-lane or in Worship-street, for it bears both names, I believe about some callico? - I believe that is about eighteen months ago.</p>
               <p>How long is it? - Why how long do you think.</p>
               <p>How long do I think! - You never was charged for any thing of the archbishop's plate? - No, Sir, any thing more?</p>
               <p>Yes, a great deal more, master Moses? how long is it since you was taken for purchasing a chest of tea that had been stolen? - I know nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that; because though this is passing off pretty easily, there is a shorthand-writer taking down your answers? - I never purchased any.</p>
               <p>That is an answer to my question; have you never been charged with it? - I might have been charged with it, but I never bought any.</p>
               <p>Is Mrs. Moses at this time indicted? - I will tell you, gentlemen of the jury, if a man has been guilty once of a fault, he is always guilty; I can bring you sufficient housekeepers in our parish; I will take particular care if a man has been guilty once of a thing that he will never be guilty of again; I shall be very particular for the future.</p>
               <p>How long is it since your wife was apprehended and taken to Shadwell-office, and kept in Elby's house for a robbery? - I will tell you how that is: we keep a shop; a woman came to our house, and begged and prayed (her husband was pressed) that we would buy an article, and it had the misfortune to be stolen; we are very particular now, and have been for this long time past.</p>
               <p>Now I just read you the conclusion of what these poor men had been put in: they say they hope your Lordship will inspect your manner; for that since New South Wales has been established, you, Mr. Moses, have been the cause of sending more<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179207040024"/>young men to that place, than all the officers of justice put together, which can be proved by

               <p>Did they fight fairly? - It was no fight, only pulling and hawling, and striking as they could, both of them as much as the other; the deceased went home to his own lodging; they did not live together; I saw him the next day; they were to have fought two or three weeks before, and the prisoner would not come.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I was sent for on the 31st of May to Miss Lowndes's; I found the man in the shop, and the journeyman; he charged the man; I received one half-crown from Porter; and somebody told me he had something in his mouth, which I found was half a crown; then Porter gave me another; it was a good half-crown that came out of the man's mouth.</p>
               <p>Mr. CLARK sworn.</p>
               <p>I attend here, in order to prove the difference of good money and bad money; here are three bad half-crowns, and one good one; whoever made one half-crown made the other; they are all three from the same pair of dies.</p>
