               <p>but he had no home—I do rot know what she said—he took her to her mother's, and then they went to lodge at Mrs. Pike's—the prisoner came to me on March 3rd—she sit down in a chair, burst out crying, and said she had nowhere to go, as her mother had turned her out; what should she do.—I said I did not know until my husband came home—she had her baby with her—her husband came in afterwards, and they sat down for a few minutes, and then went over to Mrs. Pike's again—about 7.30 they came in again; my husband had returned by then—they had three children with them—I made them up a bed in the back room and lit a fire—they had some food with me—I made no charge—the prisoner and her husband seemed to be on friendly terms—they and the children went to bed—I heard them talking loudly in the night—I could not hear what was said—on March—4th they went out in the morning, taking the baby with them and leaving the other children with me—they returned about 8 p.m., and slept in the back room—I heard them mumbling—on March 5th they had more food—Mr. Coleman came down early—I was in bed when he went out—the prisoner had breakfast with me—she cried, and said her husband had been on to her during the night—she said she was tired of it; that she did not know what she would do, and felt as if she could make away with herself—I said, "I should not do that; think of your children"—she said, "Wherever I go, I will take my baby with me: he can look after the rest"—her husband came home and said his mother was making up a bed, and the children would be all right—the prisoner then went up stairs; her husband followed her—she came down about 11 a.m. with the baby in one hand and a bag in the other—they were dressed to go out—I asked her where she was going—she said, "to the pledge"—the baby was dressed in a petticoat, white flannelette cape, navy blue socks, and no boots—the prisoner said, "I shall not be long"—on March 22nd I went to the Tottenham mortuary where I saw the body of the baby—I also identified the clothing as that which the child had been wearing—when the prisoner left my house she was very much put about and worried—the child was delicate, and could not walk.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner had been very ill ever since she had her last baby—she complained of pains in her head—on March 5th I heard her say that if the pains in her head went on she would not be able to live—her mind appeared to be weak when she said that—I was rather frightened of her. and thought she might go out of her mind—I did not like to have her in the house, because she was strange in her manner—on March 4th she tramped the whole way from Potter's Bar with her baby—the pains in her head that night were very bad.</p>

All at once Jenkins said, 'Here's one,' and ran across the road. I saw him snatch the hand bag from her and run away. I heard a lady shout, 'Stop thief!' Hunt remained with me until Jenkins snatched the bag. Hunt then ran across the road and ran away with Jenkins. I stopped still. I did not run away. I saw a lad running after Jenkins and Hunt. I lost sight of them. I then went home to the Abbey Chambers. I next saw Jenkins and Hunt together at the Earl Derby. Jenkins said, 'I only had a shilling.' He also showed me the bag (it was a light coloured one) and I think three bills. Jenkins gave me sixpence to go and buy some bread, butter, tea and sugar. I left Jenkins and Hunt shortly afterwards. I have never been in their company when they have done this kind of thing before, and had I known they were going to do this I would not have gone with them. I have heard Jenkins talk of having stolen things from ladies before. I heard him say he stole one from a lady in Kensal Road with about Ms. in it. I have never been in trouble before, and I make this statement after being cautioned."</p>

I am manager for Annie Silverman, who trades as the Eagle Chemical Company, at 18, Commercial Street, Mile End—the prisoner was employed by us as a traveller to sell goods for cash on delivery only—he was not authorised to receive money, and he has never paid us money that he has said he has received—on March 5th we got an order through him from Messrs. Coules, of Bermondsey, for ten gross of bleaching soda in half gross boxes, to be delivered on March 8<hi rend="italic">th</hi> or 9th—we paid the prisoner the commission he was entitled to—I went to see the firm on the 11th. and in consequence of what happened I said to the prisoner on March Kith or 14th. "What made you send in a bogus order 1", and he replied, "Mr. Coules gave me that personally," and he told me that he would go down and see that the goods were accepted—I went again to Messrs. Coules on the 20th or 22nd and in consequence of what happened I immediately communicated with the police, and gave them certain information.</p>

                  </hi>. I am head assistant of Mr. Bernard Alfred Quaritch, of 15, Piccadilly—the firm has had dealings with Alexander Denham &amp; Co.—the first ledger account was in 1900, but we had small dealings before that—after the death of Mr. Alexander Denham in 1902 we dealt with the prisoner—their purchases in 1900 amounted to £99 18s. 9d.; in 1901, to £70 19s., and up to December, 1902, £1,183 10s.—we had a second Folio Shakespeare for sale from June to December, 1902, with a Smeth wick imprint—on December 18th, 1902, the prisoner called at 15, Piccadilly—he said, "I have been asked by a customer for a copy of the First and Second Folio Edition of Shakespeare"—he said the customer was an American, and was staying either at the Carlton or Claridge's Hotel, I forget which—he said, "I want you to lend me this Second Folio Shakespeare"—I said I would consult Mr. Quaritch—I went to Mr.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190404180031"/>
               <p>Quaritch and gave him full details of what the prisoner had told me—in consequence of what Mr. Quaritch said I returned and said to the prisoner, "Mr. Quaritch will allow you to take the book to show your customer, and we must have his decision within twenty-four hours"—if the customer liked the volume the payment, £720, was to be made that day month—if he did not buy, it was to be returned to us—the prisoner agreed to that and went away with the Shakespeare—a clerk made out this invoice: "210-112—Shakespeare Second Folio, old calf, 1632, £720, if sold to be paid for on 18th January, 1903"—this was near mid-day—I did not see the prisoner next day, but I was informed that Mr. Waring Denham had called—the Second Folio Shakespeare has never been returned nor paid for—we issued a writ after three days—in consequence of a statement made, I considered the volume was sold, and we treated it as having been sold by the prisoner to his customer, and looked to him for payment—a bank<lb/>ruptcy petition was filed before judgment was obtained—Mr. Quaritch is credited in that bankruptcy with £960 odd—there were a few items in addition to the £720—Mr. Quaritch had bought the volume at an auction at Sotheran's—this is the book (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bookseller, of 118, Shaftesbury Avenue—on December 18th, late in the afternoon, or in the evening, prisoner brought among other things this Second Folio Shakespeare, and asked me if I wished to buy it—I said I had no particular desire; I was not specially interested—I knew him as a bookseller—he said it had a special imprint, and that a copy had realised over £600, he did not say by auction, but that was understood—I said he would probably want more money than I would be willing to give him for it. or something to that effect—he said he had an appointment the following day to buy some valuable illuminated books, and that he was a little short of cash—to the best of my recollection, they were miniature books—I looked at them, but paid chief attention to the Shakespeare—I found it was a good, sound copy, and said I would not mind giving him £400 for the three books—we agreed at £400—I wrote him a cheque for £400—he asked for an open cheque, as he was leaving town early in the morning, and I gave him an open cheque—it was paid—this is the receipt, in his writing, dated December 18th—it was made out in my office—I think he took it out of his pocket already written out—this is my cheque, dated December 19th, because it was after banking hours, or else I mode a mistake—I think he intimated that he wished to repurchase all three books—I do not think he went so far as to say he had the right but I think he suggested 10 percent—the next day I saw him about 3.30 p.m.—he said he had not succeeded in placing the volume—it had been delivered to him by someone in my employment—he had called in the morning and left this note, enclosing this cheque for £403 10s. 6d.: "My appointment has been postponed till Monday, as I may not need the money then and have an extra chance of selling the Shakespeare this morning; I enclose cheque; as the time is so short, practically one day, I presume the £5 10s. 6d. profit I have added will be satisfactory to you; I will, however, run in later in the day and see what you think"—he asked me if I had deposited the cheque—I said I had—it was not paid, but returned—on December 31st he repurchased the book for £440, or 10 per cent advance on the price I had paid—my profit was £45 10s. 6d.—two books were returned and two manuscripts.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was present on December 19th, when the prisoner came into the shop—a conversation took place about Poets' Autographs—I let him have them for sale, after I had shown them to him, as he said he had a customer—it was late in the day, and he could not have called again—I recollect on December 18th his opening a parcel and showing us some things—I did not notice a volume under his arm—I recollect the parcel being opened on the table. and his showing my father a Folio Shakespeare and other volumes—I am positive the prisoner did not ask to see the Poets' Autographs on December 18th—he was alone—he had seen the Poets' Autographs on several occasions, and had admired them, but they were not mentioned on December 18th—he had not seen them the week previously—it may have been two months previously when he saw them, or probably not much longer than a week previously, but certainly not a week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It is not true to say that, "That evening" (December 18th) "on my way home I called at Mr. Sabin's. My brother Waring was with me. I had the Shakespeare with me; I was taking it home to</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was first asked to give evidence after going through the account with Mr. Sabin, when I explained the £5 10s. 6d. and the £405 10s. 6d. cheque to him—it was after the evidence was finished at the police court—I presume the letter referring to the £405 10s. 6d. cheque was written in my presence—the point in my discussion with Mr. Sabin was that the £405 10s. (id. cheque was not paid, and the prisoner paid £5 10s. 6d. the following day—the cheque must have been entered in the bank's deposit book—it must have been enclosed in the letter of Decem<lb/>ber 19th and sealed up—that letter was left in the morning—I did not at any time hand the prisoner the Shakespeare—when he called on Decem<lb/>ber 20th the cheque had been sent to the bank, and I told him so—he did not hand me Sabin's cheque for £400, but only the £5 note and £1 in gold, and asked for 9s. 6d. change—he said he had been obliged to alter the arrangements, and if he paid the advance agreed upon the account would revert to its original position—he inferred that the £405 10s. 6d. cheque would not be met—he suggested bringing the book back—the £5 10s. 6d. was not paid because he had the £400 for a day—that was the advance on the book—the cheque for £405 10s. 6d. was not met—I did not see the book handed back, but he had the book, or else we should not have had the cheque, and there is the prisoner's letter and his visit the next day. paying the advance on the book, and suggesting that he should bring it back—Mr. Sabin's two sons are in the business—one is Mr. Stanley Sabin—he was there on December 19th and 20th, to the best of my recol<lb/>lection—he would attend every day in the week—Sabin, his two sons and myself were the whole staff—Sabin was there on December 20th, but was not present when the prisoner came in; I was alone—Sabin may have been in doors—he returned between ten and eleven on December 20th—he may have been there before the prisoner came in.</p>

I am a messenger in the London Bankruptcy Court—I produce the file in Frederick Denham's bankruptcy—it is the debtor's own petition and was filed on January 24th, 1903—the adjudication and receiving order are the same day—I find a statement of affairs filed on February 26th, 1903—it shows total liabilities £13,751 0s. 10d., assets £1,071 3s. 4d., and a deficiency of £12,679 17s. 6d.—among the unsecured creditors I find Frank Sabin for £1,735 and Bernard Quaritch for £994 10s.—among the partly secured creditors I find Biggs-Roche, Sawyer &amp; Co.; £560 under the heading of "Books deposited" in September and October, 1902; also Miss Marsh for £258 on the security of mortgage and lease of 123, Haymarket; Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am an examiner in bankruptcy—I took the prisoner's preliminary examination—Mr. H. W. Marillier, an accoun<lb/>tant, on February 2nd, 1903, was assigned to assist him in preparing his statement of affairs—in submitting that statement it was pointed out to him that a balance sheet of October 31st. 1902, contained some errors—the original balance sheet was handed to a Mr. Buckley, and I obtained my copy from Messrs. Linklater, Mr. Buckley's solicitors—I have gone through it with Marillier—in the balance sheet the book debts from customers are put at £3,844 3s. 4d.—that included £2,473 12s. 4d. which should not have been there—the balance sheet showed a surplus of £7,613, and included £2,000 for goodwill—when corrected the surplus was brought down to £337 15s. 1d., which still included £2,000 for goodwill, which was based to some extent upon profits which had not been made; I found that upon a copy of a letter written to Marillier—the £2,473 which was included in the book debts was said to be a debt due from the prisoner's brother, Mr. E. A. Denham, in New York—that debt did not exist—when I asked the prisoner to explain it he said that the entry comprised various amounts which his brother. Mr. Waring Denham, ought not to have charged to his brother in New York, and that he had made the error—Mr. Waring Denham was then in New York, or was arriving there—I examined the book and found an entry of November 5th, 1902, so that the error must have been after that date—the entry relates to transactions some of which had taken place before May, 1902—I have never discovered any justification for that entry of £2,473—the prisoner refers to the Second Folio Shakespeare in his public examination; the preliminary examination contains no specific mention of it—I was present at the public examination—(<hi rend="italic">The important passages in the examinations were then read, from which it appeared that the prisoner stated that he had a client in America, a Mr. Halsey, to whom he hoped to sell the Shakespeare at a good price, and that he had reasonable expectations of inducing a Mr. Buckley to invest</hi> £10,000 <hi rend="italic">in the business, and that he sold books with the option of repurchase, so as to keep control of the stock till the business could be put on a sound financial footing.</hi>)—I find from sheet K of the Statement of affairs, that the prisoner's loss upon option sales from October 31st, 1902, to the bankruptcy in January, 1903, was £7,600, and that the people from whom the books were bought are amongst the unsecured creditors—I have worked out the percentage of the prisoner's loss on these sales—the loss on the Second Folio Shakes<lb/>peare, sold to Sabin on December 18th for £400, and repurchased for £440, works out at £280 per cent per annum—in addition he paid the £5 10s. 6d. already stated, which brings it up to £380 per annum—the loan from Leighton on January 3rd, with the right of repurchase of the volume within six days for £400, shows a rate of interest of £869 per cent. per annum—I have also taken out the prisoner's purchases for 1901 and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190404180037"/>
               <p>1902—in 1902 his purchases amounted to £31,218, as against £9,565 in 1901, or three times the amount.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am not familiar with the book trade—I only know of two large profits being made in this case—one of them was the Scott manuscripts in November, 1902, at a profit of £5,000—they were bought for £1,500—there was also a large profit made after August; that is to say, the prisoner told me so—I know his writing—substantially, the book entries are made by his brother—the prisoner said he left the book-keeping to his brother, who was dependent upon certain notes made by himself—I do not remember that he said he was familiar with the items of the transactions—a balance sheet was made out in December, 1902, pur<lb/>porting to show the state of business to October 31st, 1902, drawn up by a chartered accountant—I do not say the accountant was dishonest—this letter of explanation accompanied the balance sheet, dated 12th December, 1902—both were based upon information supplied by the prisoner—I took down his statements with regard to the Shakes<lb/>peare first of all he initialled it, then he handed me a type-written document which was substantially the same—I did not raise that question in the preliminary examination, nor make any specific notes about it, and there is no reference to it in the preliminary examination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Apart from the prisoner's loss on option sales of £7600 during November and December, 1902, he made a profit on his ordinary trade of £100 only—there is no entry in his books of the option sales beyond "Cash received, Sabin," or whatever name it was—there was no entry of the terms nor of the books sold—in his preliminary examina<lb/>tion, in reply to the question who was responsible for the business in 1902, he says "For about six months prior to his death, my father had in consequence of ill-health, been unable to take an active part in the management of the business, which I alone managed, and rarely con<lb/>sulted him on business matters in consequence of the state of his health"—the father died in October, so that would take us back to April.</p>

Denham—the entries are in my writing, except the notes in red ink—I believe Edwin's memorandum was typewritten—it cannot be found—the entry is wrong—the total had been already entered—I knew the purpose of the balance sheet was to show a gentleman who desired to become a partner—there are errors in the balance sheet and liabilities not mentioned—directly after the bankruptcy I went away to America—I have only just come back, and have had no opportunity of answering questions in the bank<lb/>ruptcy about the entries—(<hi rend="italic">Read from Mr. Quaritch's evidence:</hi> "Waring Denham told me on December 19th that the book had been sold to their customer.")—I do not remember the exact words—that is not what I said, because I knew the book had not been sold—it was purchased, I believe, for a client, a Mr. Halsey—I saw Mr. Halsey twice in America when I went there—he never told me the Second Folio Shakespeare had been obtained for him—I do not remember any intimation from him to that effect, nor any such intimation to him—(<hi rend="italic">Read further from Mr. Quaritch's evidence:</hi> "The next day the defendant's brother" (<hi rend="italic">The witness</hi>) came into our shop, I said to him, 'Is it sold?'—he said.

I am a chartered accountant at 21 Lombard Street—I received instructions on November 8th, 1002, through the introduction of the managing clerk of Biggs Roche, Sawyer &amp; Co., solicitors, from the prisoner personally, and received his brother's ex<lb/>planation of the books—I was to make out a trading account for six months with a balance sheet to October 31st, 1902, to show Mr. Buckley—I have headed it "Summary of Sales, etc.," because I had not sufficient materials for a trading account—I saw the books from time to time; they were very incomplete—Waring Denham kept them so far as they had been kept, but he was not a professional book-keeper by any means—I explained to the prisoner the incomplete state of the books, and he gave me what explanation he could, and Waring helped—I had assistance the whole time—I went through the stock book and struck off each item where a book had been sold, and made additions where books had come into stock without being entered in the stock book—I understood that some of the stock was on consignment; I took it into account and showed the liability—we collected the receipts and checked them with the cash book, and made notes where they showed accounts had been paid, but there was great difficulty, as the counterfoils had not been filled up, only the figures being recorded—we made the nearest approximation we could get of the facts for the balance sheet—we afterwards found omissions, and I attached a report to show Mr. Buckley with the balance sheet—I was afterwards called in to assist the bankrupt in preparing his statement of affairs—his reason for asking me was because I had been employed in the matter—I had had no previous connection with him—he was a stranger—in making out his statement of affairs I found that several large liabilities had been omitted, and that certain assets had been overstated—£2,473 was said to be due from E. A. Denham—that was the amount entered in the books in October—it was stated to be a summary of decided transactions in American business up to that date—there were omissions—£1,300 was said to be outstanding in the ledger as borrowed from Sotheby's; as a matter of fact, there was £2,600 in addition—in my list is "Sotheby &amp; Hodge, £1,700"—that is taken from Sotheby, and Buckley £1,300; appeared as actually owing, and that was included in the balance sheet—I ascertained from the prisoner's proof that £2,600 had been advanced, and not repaid at the date of the balance sheet—£1,300 appeared in the loan capital as paid off by reason of Mr. Buckley having taken over the loan—the balance sheet was made out from such information as I had.</p>

I live with my mother at 60, Tyers Street, Vauxhall—I have seen the prisoners go into the shop next door—I have never seen anyone else go in—they used to go about on their bicycles—I have never been into 58, Tyers Street myself—there is a yard at the back of No. 58, which is separated from ours by a wooden Tence—there was a wooden shed in the yard—once my mother sent me into the back yard because the smoke was so bad, and when I went out I saw a forge with a little pot on it, with a lid like this one (<hi rend="italic">A crucible was produced.</hi>)—I climbed to the top of the w.c. door, and I could look into the shed where the pot was—there was a fire underneath it, and a lot of smoke coming from it—this happened about twice a week.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Nathan Brothers, jewellers, of Birmingham and Hatton Garden—towards the end of Sep<lb/>tember last year Brooker came to me at my London office with an intro<lb/>duction from one of my customers, saying he had some gold for sale—having come with an introduction, I considered I was entitled to negotiate with him—he left a piece of gold with us, which I noticed was in rather a good state, to be assayed—I asked him why he did not take it to a refiner, and he said he did not know of any—we sent it to Birmingham—it appeared to me to have been melted and left to cool in the original crucible; as far as I remember, it was in the shape of one—I should say it was rather a smaller crucible than this one (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>); it was more the size of a teacup—he intimated to me that he knew it was very good gold, and that it had been reduced and got down pretty well, and the weight of it also guided me. in concluding that it was of very good quality—I believe 22 carat is the quality of a sovereign; 24 carat would be pure gold—it is more likely to have come from this other crucible (<hi rend="italic">Pro<lb/>duced)—</hi> I cannot remember if he mentioned at the first interview How the gold had been accumulated—two or three weeks after, he came to see me again, and I, wanting to be satisfied as to <hi rend="italic">bonafides</hi>, said, "I presume you do not mind telling me something of the manner in which this gold has been got?"—he told me that he advertised for old gold, and he showed me an advertisement, telling me that his partner got the gold down, who he gave me to understand was a skilled metallurgist—this is the slip he showed me: "Gold, silver, and platinum, damaged or otherwise, platers' waste, jewellers' sweepings, false teeth, &amp;c, bought, and the best prices given; parcels by post; cash the same day.—<hi rend="smallCaps">BROOKER</hi>, 58, Tyers Street, Vauxhall"—I cannot remember whether it was at the third or fourth interview that I saw Appleton—Brooker introduced him to me—I had parted with two or three cheques before I saw Appleton—the first piece of gold was 26 ounces 19 dwts 14 grains, for which I gave Brooker a cheque for £100 under date October 3rd, which comes to about £4 per ounce—I made it payable to myself, as I thought he would</p>

               <p>require the money at once, and at his request I crossed the cheque (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—shortly after I received a letter signed "Appleton and Brooker," enclosing me gold for assaying and valuing—it was written on note paper with the lithographed heading, "F. Brooker, General Dealer and Com<lb/>mission Agent"—that gold was sent to Birmingham, and on October 10th I sent a cheque for £20 15s. 6d. (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), for which I produce a receipt signed "Appleton and Brooker"—it was about this time that I met Appleton—on November 30th I received 13 ozs. 10 dwts. 12 grs of gold, for which I sent a cheque for £52 8s., which is at the rate of £3 17s. 6d. per ounce—I wrote, explaining that I could not give so highly per ounce as hitherto, as the gold was not so pure, and he replied, saying that as his partner had been away the gold had not been properly refined, and that in future they would send the gold as pure as possible—I pro<lb/>duce the letter and receipt dated December 1st, 1903, signed "Appleton and Brooker"—Brooker wrote, telling me that owing to the absence of his partner, he could not send the gold so pure as formerly, and that he would be satisfied with any value that I put upon it—this was a perfectly businesslike arrangement—on January 7th 13 ozs. were sent, for which I sent a cheque for £49 13s. 3d.; on February 6th, 16ozs. 19 dwts., for which I sent a cheque for £64 8s. 2d.; on March 1st, 22 ozs. 14 dwts. 10 grs., for which I sent a cheque for £85 4s., which was the last transaction we had with them—I put myself into communication with the police and rendered them every assistance in my power.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROOTH</hi>. The references that Brooker came with I thought satisfactory, and I did not make any further inquiries—we rarely enter into transactions of this sort—as a rule, if gold is run down by a manufacturer, he would run it down into a bar or ingot—my suspicions were not aroused, because the introduction was quite sufficient for me, and there was nothing about the gold except that it was very good—I considered it had been run down by a person who knew a good deal about it—I have seen gold in crucible shape many hundreds of times—I suggested that he should show the old jewellery to me before he melted it down, as he might get a better price for it by not doing so—the gold in false teeth is undoubtedly very good; I believe they work in what they call dentists' metal sometimes—I know something about galvanic bat<lb/>teries from having used them as a boy—you can only gild with virgin gold; you cannot gild with a sovereign—if gold had been extracted from sovereigns you would not necessarily expect to find the same character of gold every time in the assay; in collecting the gold from the plate on which it has been deposited, some of the particles of the plate may adhere the gold, and so cause different purities; the Assay Office often find old from the same ingot to vary—copper and silver are used as alloys; depends for what the gold is required—one sample of gold sent to us the prisoners, I should say, contained copper, because it was very and crumbly—undoubtedly, if by means of a battery gold from a sovereign were deposited on a copper plate and then taken from the copper plate and melted down in a crucible in getting that gold from The copper plate you would get some copper with it—if the gold came from</p>

               <p>jewellery and other articles, you would find either silver copper, or brass—I did not make the assay personally, but you can tell the amount of alloy by the weights and the amounts given per ounce; 79s. 4d. per ounce would be for gold of about 20 carat—there was very little alloy in this gold; whatever it was may have been silver—you need not use a battery at all; you could put jewellery of different purity of gold into a crucible and melt it down, and you would get different purities of gold, and according to what you had put in; of course, the carat would be rather low if it were not refined—we buy all qualities—I have been a working jeweller myself—I took a cursory glance at the Westminster Police Court at the plant and batteries found on the premises; I did not see any quicksilver; I saw some tools—in some processes of gilding you would use quick<lb/>silver, but not in electro gilding; you would keep it away from the gold solution—batteries are necessary; crucibles are also necessary if you melt gold down.</p>

               <p>another one he cashed two postal orders for £2; and at another he bought three postal orders for £1 each—I stated who I was to the post office clerks, but I did not succeed in obtaining anything—on March 7th I saw Brooker leave the premises at 10.30 a.m.—he rode away on a bicycle, and I followed him to several post offices in the vicinity of Victoria—each day he went to a different district—I saw him as he came out doing up postal orders; I followed him back to Tyers Street—on March 10th, at 11.30 a.m., I saw Brooker leave, and I followed him to a post office at Kennington Cross, and to another one at Dante Road—Sergeant Beard was with me that time, and at the Dante Road Post Office I went back to Tyers Street, and Beard followed Brooker—when I got back I saw Appleton leave at 2 p.m., and I followed him to a post office in Kennington Road, to another at the foot of Westminster Bridge and to another at Waterloo Road; he purchased postal orders at each office—I showed my authority to each clerk, but the gold with which the postal orders had been bought had already been put in the till, and it was impossible to secure it—on March 11th, at 11.30 a.m., I saw both prisoners leave on bicycles in opposite directions; Appleton rode up Tyers Street into Jonathan Street—I followed with Inspector Knell, and they were arrested.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Appleton.</hi> On January 30th, after you left the Auckland Street Post Office, you went under the railway arch and turned down the South Lambeth Road—sometimes I was twenty yards behind you, some times 100 yards; it depended on the state of the traffic—I should be surprised to know that you were not on a bicycle that day—before you went into the post offices you looked about, but otherwise you did not act in any way suspiciously—you entered nine or ten post offices altogether whilst I had you under observation, none of which you entered again—I did not hear what you asked for at the Kennington Road Post Office; I was at the door just as you were asking—I saw you fill up a money order and ask for something at the Westminster Bridge Post Office and get the money, but I do not know what amount—that post office is a long one with a counter at which you can buy stationery and other articles, the post office being at the end; it would have been easy for me to have spoken to the person at the stationery counter, and they could have gone to the post office counter, but I did not think it a favourable opportunity—I thought you were suspicious, and that if a man had left the counter to go to the post office directly I came in, it would have excited your suspicion—on coming out, you went to York Road opposite, but did not go into the post office—the reason I did not follow you after you left Waterloo Road Post Office was because I wanted to make inquiries there—during the two months I never had any complaint from a post office clerk that you had passed any light sovereigns or bad coin.</p>

Bassett"—one of the money orders made payable to you is issued at the Edgware Road Post Office, and payable at Hatton Garden, and the other issued at Kennington Road and payable at Lambeth Walk—you were walking on March 10th, and I was from fifteen yards to thirty yards behind you—Ward generally went first after you and I behind—postal orders, all dated March 10th, at Drury Lane, Kennington Street, High Holborn, Southamp<lb/>ton Row, New Street, Waterloo Road and East Strand, were found upon you—two £5 notes and a money order for £7 obtained at East Strand were found upon you also—they could have weighed the coins that I handed over at Westminster Bridge Post Office if they had wanted to—I let you go when you came out of the post office, as I thought that if you saw me many times you would get suspicious—you did not appear to be suspicious—among the tools found at Cranmer Road was this one, which in connection with a battery could be used for sweating coins—there were also a number of these plates which could be used as discs for the inner part of the counterfeit coin; there are some slips here with im<lb/>pressions on them as if they were about to be cut out for discs—the <hi rend="italic">cramp</hi> found would be used for holding the coins while being milled—the silver leaf is used for covering coins, and the bottle of double cyanide of silver is used in either sweating or manufacturing coins—I found a tub which I inferred contained sal ammoniac by the label on it—one side of the shed at Tyers Street is 12 feet high, and the fence about 6 feet 6 inches; I measured it—the frosted shop window is 5 feet 8 inches—I am 5 feet 9 1/2 inches in my boots; I could only see over it if I stood on my toes—I believe it is correct that you sold a dairy business for £900—I know that you were charged for assault in 1895. and got six weeks for it—I also know that there have been letters found at Tyers Street giving advice to ladies, and some herbs were there, which I am informed are for a very bad purpose—I cannot say that you have ever given medicine with a criminal intent—I heard that you were a quack doctor in Holborn, and that you had posed as an M.D. from the United States—I found some drugs at Tyers Street, and bills were found at Cranmer Road, showing that you had purchased from Messrs. Parkes and Davies a quantity of drugs, including some liquid ergot and sulphate of carbon—I cannot find the ergot now—I remember</p>

A letter from Messrs. Parkes and Davies, addressed to R. Appleton, Esq.," stated that they could not find his name in any books of reference as a medical doctor, and they therefore could not supply the drug asked for; there was also a later letter from them in which he was addressed as Dr. Appleton.</hi>)</p>

Johnson and Matthey have searched for the assay notes of the gold that you say you sent them for six months back, both in your name and Brooker's, but they have not been able to find them—I know you have lived eight or nine years at Cranmer Road—other than this allegation, I know of nothing against you.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant assayer at the Royal Mint—I received from Inspector Knell three sovereigns marked with an "H," two of them dated 1903 and one 1875—I examined them and found gold had been extracted from the reverse side in each case, in consequence of which there was a deficiency in one 1903 coin of 7 94 grs., representing 1s. 4d. in currency; the second 1903 coin was deficient of 7 24 grs., repre<lb/>senting 1s. 2 1/2 d.; and in the 1875 coin there was a deficiency of 6 27 grs., representing 1s. 0 1/2 d.—on March 14th I went to 58, Tyers Street, and in the back room on the ground floor a large bath with an electric battery and a gas jet underneath, was pointed out to me—a smaller bath was inside which contained an amber coloured liquid; the large bath contained water—I took a sample of the amber coloured liquid, and on analysis it yielded 66 grs. of gold per gallon—there was another bath in the back yard con<lb/>taining a liquid, which I analysed and found to contain 11 grs. to the gallon, and the sediment at the bottom contained (5 per cent, of gold—I examined 43 ozs. of gold dust and platings found in a tumbler and on analysis it was seen to contain 90 per cent approximately of gold, the whole being worth, roughly, £16—I cannot say whether the whole of the alloy was copper, but copper was present—if you sweated a sovereign and deposited what you got from it on to a copper plate and scraped the copper plate, on analysing the scrapings one would expect to find very much the same as was found in that tumbler; there was more copper than you would find in a sovereign—I saw this crucible at Kennington Lane Police Station (Pro<lb/>duced), and I found a ring of reddish coloured slag near the bottom, which I examined and found to contain gold in small beads—I also examined the scrapings from the bottom and the side leading to the lip of the pot, and found them to contain pellets of gold—I saw the copper rods and strips found in Tyers Street connected with the baths, and on examination found the strips to be coated with gold—(Mr. Rooth <hi rend="italic">objected to the witness being asked whether, in his opinion, the appliances found upon the premises were used for the purposes of extracting gold, which objection the</hi> Court <hi rend="italic">upheld</hi>)—I myself have tested the appliance by putting a sovereign in one of the rubber receptacles on this strip of wood and placing it opposite a copper strip fitted, more or less, as this one (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), for the purpose of seeing whether I could extract gold through the agency of a battery similar to the one found—the sovereign depreciated in value by 6 24 grs., representing</p>

Another evidence of sweating besides weight is that one side is not so sharp as the other; it is rounded over; this would not happen if a coin had been in circulation a long time—I have seen a spade guinea, but I do not know that I particularly noticed that on one side the impression is better than on the other—to the best of my recollection, nothing was said when I was given the sovereigns to test by the police—the gold seems to have been removed more from the centre than from the edge—I see that one side of this florin (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is more rubbed than the other, but I am not prepared to compare gold coins with silver coins—I only examined the implicatory tools: it is quite possible that the rest were ordinary engineering tools—no sovereigns that had been</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Appleton, in his defence, said that Brooker had arranged with him that he should have the front shop at Tyers Street for</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a week, to carry on his business as a motor cycle repairer, and that he should take over the tenancy; that a man named Welsh who now could not be found, in answer to Brooker's advertisement in the paper with reference to buying old gold, had brought quantities of gold, which it was arranged should be assayed and. sold, Welsh paying them a commission of</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per ounce; that about January, Welsh took over the back room, the yard, and cellar at</hi> 58, <hi rend="italic">Tyers Street, paying</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a week, saying that he required them for the purpose of plating common jewellery, and a battery and other instruments, including a gas stove, were moved in for that purpose; that he (Appleton) did not deny that the appliances produced in Court looked as if they could be used for sweating sovereigns, but that neither he nor Brooker expected anything of the kind was going on, 'and that he had no means of knowing, as he was away for days at a time; that he also let Welsh the shed in Cranmer Road, which he had built, and had formerly used in his dairy business; that a woman next door had seen Welsh twice, hit he could not get her to come and give evidence on his behalf, as her husband objected to her doing so; that he had no knowledge of the base coins found in the cellar; that they must have been made by Welsh; that he had been a doctor for three years, and that the medical books found at Tyers Street related to the cure and cause of cancer; that he claimed that he had discovered the cure of this disease, having cured himself; that the evidence as to documents found at Tyers Street relating to the sweating of gold, and stated to have been in his writing, had been served upon him so late that he had not had time to produce evidence that they were not in his handwriting; that post office clerks would be the first people to find out if base or light coin had been paid, as every office had a pair of scales on the counter, and not a single complaint had been made; and he suggested that the reason of no step being taken at the Westminster Bridge Road Post Office, where he had bought postal orders, was that the detectives had examined the coins passed and found them to be good, so no evidence could be found against him.; that he and Brooker had been engaged in a profitable system of betting, by which they evaded the police, and that this accounted for his having such mixed sums in his pocket; that the reason of his having such a large sum in his pocket when arrested was that owing to a judgment summons for a solicitor's bill of costs for endeavouring to produce a divorce from his wife, he had thought it safer to draw his money from the bank and carry it about with him, the most convenient way being in the form of postal orders; that to produce</hi> £100 <hi rend="italic">worth of gold it would require</hi> 2,000 <hi rend="italic">sovereigns to be sweated, and that no evidence had been given of what had become of the</hi> £2,000; <hi rend="italic">that he had bought some steam laundry machinery and put it into Tyers Street, and had sold it again; and that of the punches found, one was a leather punch and the two others were ordinary tinmen's punches.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor and formerly practised at East<lb/>bourne for eighteen years and at Bexhill for two or three years—I first made the prisoner's acquaintance on May 9th, 1901, when he called at my office at Bexhill, and said he was in very low water, waiting for some pupils to come to him, and could I lend him £5, which I did—I understood the pupils were boys—he said he. was living in Wilton Road, Bexhill—after that I several times lent him sums of £3—about the beginning of June he told me that he was expecting a very large sum of money to be left him on the death of a Mr. Baring—the day that he mentioned that he got some money from me—he also said that the pupils who had been coming to him had got measles—he told me that Mr. Baring was a man of immense property, getting on for £4,000,000; that his wife was to receive a very large sum and so was he; that he was Mr. Baring's grand-nephew; and that Mr. Baring's Christian name was George—I asked him if Mr. Baring was anything to do with Baring Bros., and he said no, he was not a member of that firm at all, but that his Mr. Baring was half brother to Lord Revelstoke—he said that owing to his Mr. Baring having drawn £800,000 from the firm of Baring Bros it had practically brought about the smash in that firm—he said his Mr. Baring was then ninety-two years old; that he was suffering from cancer in the throat—he said he way coming into Mr. Baring's money under his will; that one of the trustees was a Mr. Pollock and that his wife, Mrs. Short, was the executrix—the prisoner stated that Mr. Baring's health was so bad, and he was so imbecile, that he could not alter his will—he said he had seen Mr. Baring, but had never spoken to him—I do not remember if he said how often he had seen him—he said that three firms of solicitors had been down to St. Leonard's in July, 1001, and had made Mr. Baring's will there and then, that they were paid their cheques and went back to London, and that the firm of Freshfields took the will back with them and lodged it</p>

               <p>in the Bank of England—he told me all this subsequent to his beginning to borrow money—it would be the end of July or beginning of August, 1901—the will had only just been made, according to him—he did not explain why three different firms of solicitors should make the will—he first spoke to me about raising money for him in September or October, 1901—he then told me that Mr. Baring had large properties everywhere; that he had half an oil mine in Russia; that he had properties all over London, and a large amount of ground rents in Lewes. Vienna, and other places—he did not say where the property in London was—when he spoke about raising money I said he would have to make a statutory declaration as to the facts, as nobody would lend him money on his bare word, and he said he would certainly do it—I think at that time he had had about £400 from me—in consequence of his asking me to raise money for him I introduced him to Mr. John Reeves, of Bank Buildings, Hastings—he lends money, but he does not call himself a money lender—he is not a registered money lender—he lent the prisoner £300—I prepared a draft declaration according to the prisoner's statements—I read it to him, and he read it himself—I asked him if it was right, and he said yes—I told him that making a false declaration was a dangerous thing—he approved of it, and it was engrossed—it was made before a commissioner for oaths, Mr. Draper—Mr. Reeves paid £100 to the prisoner on September 21st, and the £200, I think, on January 10th—the prisoner gave Mr. Reeves a promissory note—Mr. Reeves was paid off, but I do not remember seeing the declaration again—I do not know what became of it—after that I lent the prisoner several sums of money myself—in 1902 the prisoner asked me to get him a large loan—I mentioned the matter to a Mr. John<lb/>stone, who said he thought he knew somebody who could do it, and he introduced me to Mr. Jeffery, who is Mr. Bainbridge's secretary—Mr. Johnstone negotiated the matter with Mr. Jeffery, who I saw twice—I do not know what Mr. Bainbridge is, except a very wealthy man—I cannot say if he lends money—I saw Mr. Jeffery as solicitor for the prisoner—I told him all that the prisoner had told me—before the account at Lloyd's was opened, I think it was in May, 1902, I was present when the prisoner made statements to Mr. Jeffery—the account was opened on May 14th—the interview was quite at the end of April or beginning of May—the prisoner told Mr. Jeffery the same story that he had told me that Mr. Baring was possessed of all this money, that he, the prisoner, was going to have £40,000 under the will, and his wife was going to have some money also, and that he was going to have the interest for life of £250,000—that statement had not then been embodied in the form of a declaration, but the declaration was drawn immediately after that inter<lb/>view—this is the declaration: (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>) "I. Eric Gordon MacCrae Short, of Winchelsea, in the County of Sussex, late Captain in His Majesty's Army, do solemnly and sincerely declare as follows: (1) That I am connected with James Baring, who is now residing at Warrior Square, St. Leonards<lb/>on-Sea, in the said County of Sussex, and who was formerly a merchant in Australia. (2) The said James Baring is now ninety-two years of age, and is suffering at the present time from cancer in the throat, which</p>

               <p>cancer is in a very advanced stage. (3) The said cancer appears to have touched or to be pressing on the base of the brain, as at times the said James Baring is quite imbecile. (4) It is within my knowledge that the said James Baring is quite incapable of making any alteration in his will. (5) I am informed by the trustee of the will of the said James Baring that he, the said James Baring, is possessed of property to the value of four millions or thereabouts. (6) I am also informed by the said trustee that the said James Baring has bequeathed to me the sum of £20,000 in cash and the income for life of £250,000, and I make this solemn declaration, continously believing the same to be true, and by virtue of the Statutory Declaration Act of 1835. Declared at 1, South Square, in the County of London, this 13th day of May, 1902.—Eric Gordon MacCrae Short. Before me, W. T. Boydell, a Commissioner for Oaths"—I do not think I was present at the interview with Mr. Bain<lb/>bridge at Whitehall Court—a joint account was opened at Lloyd's Bank, Law Courts branch, between Mr. Bainbridge and the prisoner on May 14th—on May 17th there was a cheque drawn to me for £370, to pay off Reeves' loan and interest, which was done—I had to pay off several loans—there was a cheque to me for £375, which I think was for a man named Taylor; at any rate, it was for the prisoner's debts; and there was £300 to St. John—all the money passed through my hands—it was sent to me by cheques drawn on Lloyd's Bank, and signed by Jeffery, myself, and the prisoner, in that order.</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly a solicitor practising a Hastings and St. Leonards—I have given up practising now, and am connected with a commercial company—I first heard of the prisoner in the latter end of 1901—my first dealing with him was in connection with a loan from Mr. Reeves—two or three months afterwards the prisoner told me that Mr. Baring was a very rich man—I think he said that his Christian names were James Drummond—he said that Mrs. Short was Mr. Baring's niece, that he was then ninety-two years old and very ill indeed, suffering from cancer at the base of the back of the neck—the prisoner told me that he was interested in the will and I asked the prisoner's solicitor about the will—I introduced a Mr. St. John accidentally to the prisoner—after that he wanted some more money, and wanted to know if I knew anybody who would be likely to advance him some—I said I thought I could arrange it subject to his proving the truth of his story—he told me that Mr. Baring had drawn, I think, a million pounds from the bank of Baring Bros., and that that was what had broken the bank—Mr. Kelsey spoke to me with regard to the prisoner's wish to raise loans, and after they had borrowed some small sums I said it was absurd to go on like that; they had better get a sum of money large enough to last out the life of Mr. Baring—I introduced Mr. Bainbridge's name—I was to get £500 com<lb/>mission—I eventually received £2.10, and introduced the prisoner to Mr. Jeffery—before this at Hastings the prisoner said he wanted some more money, and could I arrange it for him—I said that unless he could prove his statements it was impossible for anybody to lend him any money, and could I see Mr. Baring—he said no—I said could I see Mrs. Short—he said yes—I said, "Where is she?"—he said, "At Winchelsea:" so we went by the next train to see her—I did not see her, as the prisoner said she would not see me—he did not give any reason, but he said she was a curious</p>

I am secretary to Mr. Emerson Bainbridge, of Whitehall Court, who by profession is a mining engineer—in March, 1902, Mr. Johnstone called upon me in reference to an advance of money to be made to the prisoner—he made some statements to me, and I afterwards discussed the matter with Mr. Kelsey as the prisoner's solicitor—all the statements that I thought material were embodied in a draft declaration, and afterwards this declaration was drawn up—I saw the prisoner at Whitehall Court some weeks before, May 13th—Johnstone was present, and I went through each paragraph of the declaration—I asked the prisoner if the statements in it were correct, and he said they were—I then had some conversation with Mr. Bainbridge, and there was afterwards an interview, at which the prisoner, Mr. Bainbridge and myself were present; the statements in the declaration were gone through again, and the prisoner repeated to Mr. Bainbridge the statements in the declara<lb/>tion—Mr. Bainbridge upon that agreed to give his personal guarantee to the extent of £5,000—all this has nothing to do with mining engineering—Mr. Bainbridge is not a money lender—he does not practise now as a mining engineer—he is a colliery proprietor—he makes investments on the Stock Exchange—the commission here was 10 per cent per annum—Mr. Bain<lb/>bridge was a Member of Parliament, but not at this time—he was Member for the Gainsborough Division of Lincolnshire, I think, up to 1902—Mr. Johnstone did not know Mr. Bainbridge—I believed the statements in the declaration to be true—at the time the declaration was signed we had received this document; it is dated May 12th—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi>) "To Emerson Bainbridge, Esq.: You having guaranteed for me an overdraft on Lloyd's Bank to the extent of £5000, out of which I am to provide for the deposit for the purchase of the Blacklands Estate near Crowhurst, I hereby under<lb/>take to hand to you half of the net profits derived from the estate and the development of the same, you at the same time assisting me, doing what you can to promote the well being and advancement of the said estate.—Eric Short"—we also had this document before the account was opened (<hi rend="italic">Ex.

Dear Sir,—In consideration of you having arranged by your personal guarantee the opening of an account at Lloyd's Bank to the extent of £5,000 in your name and mine on the statements contained in my declaration dated May 13th, 1902, I hereby agree and undertake to repay the amount standing at the debit of the account on the day on which I receive my interest under the will of James Baring. But in the event of my receiving nothing by the will, I still agree to be responsible for the repayment of the account.

               <p>the money was most certainly advanced on the strength of the declaration—the account was opened with the bank on May 14th, and this is the pass book—I was one of the persons who had to sign cheques drawn upon it—I signed cheques down to, I think, June 24th, when the account was closed—these three cheques, all dated May 14th, one in favour of Reginald Kelsey for £375, one in favour of John Reeves for £375, and one in favour of Louis Frederick St. John for £200, are signed by me, and at that time I still believed the statements were true, and I should not have signed them if I had thought they were untrue.</p>

"All right, you go down and see what happens," or anything like it; I do not remember if I saw you on November 9th I saw you so frequently—I understood that Mr. Bainbridge was to have half profits in Crowhurst—I did not arrange with Mr. Kelsey that you and Mr. Bainbridge should borrow £5,000 from Lloyd's Bank; the arrangement with the bank was. that an account should be guaranteed to be drawn on to the extent of £5000—I do not know if Mr. Bainbridge attached any value to the purchase of Crowhurst, but it must have been a very deferred interest, because the estate was not paid for—the money was not borrowed to pay for it—the account was opened partly to enable you to pay a deposit, which is a very different thing to purchasing an estate; you cannot pur<lb/>chase an estate on a deposit—I received a draft declaration about the end of March or beginning of April—I had it before I saw you, which was some time in March—I saw you with Johnstone alone and also with him and Kelsey—I went through the declaration with you, I cannot remember the date—I saw you four or five times before the money was lent—I think May 13th was the first time you saw Mr. Bainbridge—I think Kelsey remained down stairs, because I said it would be quite sufficient if you and Johnstone explained the case to Mr. Bainbridge—I had only seen Kelsey once before.</p>

I saw Mr. Baring last Monday week at Eastbourne Station before he left for London and the north—he has not been known as Mr. Baring for the last sixty years, but as Robinson—he was staying in Eastbourne for a few days, but I do not know his address—he was Staying near Warrior Square in 1901, 1902, and 1903, with the exception of the times that he went up to London—he told me that when the case was over and you had proved that you had not done wrong, all creditors would be paid—he has told me that several times during the last twelve months, and he told it me again on Monday—he also said that, according to rumour, he had many connections with the Baring family, but that was for them to prove—he is no connection of Lord Revelstoke's—Mr. Baring is my trustee and godfather, William James Baring Robinson—</p>

               <p>he is not exactly my trustee, but he is my godfather, and I have always had great expectations from him—I met you about twelve years ago—Mr. Baring, when told of my engagement, greatly objected—of course, we were greatly in want of money, and Mr. Leonard kindly helped you—no money was borrowed on Mr. Baring's name but we told him we should repay the money—Mr. Baring had then intended to settle money on me—you went to Armenia and several places, and greatly offended Mr. Baring by your folly in allowing the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> to send you there and not giving you anything on your return, as there was some mistake—for severe years Mr. Baring had nothing to do with me, but Mr. Pollock asked him to kindly overlook your mistakes and to assist me—of course, he explained to Mr. Baring about the Crowhurst Estate—I know nothing about it myself—Mr. Baring said he thought you were proving more of a business man, and promised that in twelve months' time he would give me and my sister a certain amount of money, and would also allow you a private income, and I think he would have done so, but through the creditors he refused to have anything more to do with me until matters were arranged to his satisfaction—sometimes Mr. Baring says he is ninety years old and sometimes ninety-three—he varies in age very much, but he is a very old gentleman—he said he could not understand why people wanted to know how much he was worth, but that his wealth could pay your debts, and that he was worth a good deal more than was represented—he was very ill, and the doctors said they thought he had cancer—it may be cancer, for all I know—he still suffers from some complaint—he could walk the other day when I saw him, but he could not take a four mile walk—Mr. Arthur Pollock is the trustee of the will made in Hastings—I wish to say that you know nothing of Mr. Baring except what I told you—Mr. Baring refused to meet you—he has said many times that he would apologise to you if he has made a mistake and injured you by his opinions or actions—I wish to state who I am—I am supposed to be a criminal at Norwich, and it has done me great harm—I am a Miss Stewart Moncrieff—I married the prisoner on August 31st, 1895—my father was a civil engineer, and for many years was employed by the Russian Government, and my mother was a Miss Olga Soltykoff, of St. Petersburg.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was christened at St. Petersburg—I knew Mr. Baring as Mr. Baring—he made his fortune in Australia—he left there sixteen years ago, but he has been back there several times since—I think he was present at my christening—he is my godfather—he was known to the Moncrieffs, my father, mother, sisters, and myself, as Mr. Waring, but to the outside world as Robinson—I think he was called James Baring Robinson, but I am not sure—his name is William James, but he is known as James Robinson—his letters were addressed "Mr. James Robinson"—I have not at present with me any letters from him or a single scrap of paper signed or written by him—he is infirm through illness—he sometimes has carriages and horses, but not always—he was very quiet—he has old family servants who travel about with him—I do not know if they know him as James Robinson—he last went to</p>

               <p>Australia five or six years ago, when he was eighty-five—he wishes to go there to die—I cannot call any of his servants to prove his existence—he can prove it himself if he likes—he says he had nothing to do with this business transaction, and in no way did he put his name to it, and he does not wish to come forward—he lived on the left side of Warrior Square, going up—I do not know if it would be the west side coming from the "front"; it is on the left—I must decline to give the number—I might as well demand Mr. Baring's attendance as give his address—he requested me not to do so, and said that the prisoner must fight his own battles—I am aware that the case for the prosecution is that I am giving perjured evidence—if I am under the imputation I must remain so—Mr. Baring does not live at Warrior Square now—I cannot tell you his address as I was requested not to do so—I have myself to consider as well as the prisoner—I have known Mr. Pollock since I was a child—at present he is in Kimberley—he went there four or five months ago—before that he stayed with Mr. Baring—he had no other address when he was in Hastings—he has his London address—I must refuse to give it, because he does not wish me to—he asked me not to do so at the beginning of the case—I do not know why he asked me not to give it—the prisoner never borrowed money under Mr. Baring's name—I am entitled to money under the wills of two Soltykoffs—one is named Michael George Alex Soltykoft, he is my cousin, and the other plain Michael Soltykoff—he died about ten years ago—he made a will, to which my mother was entitled, and the money was left in Mr. Baring's hands for the benefit of myself and my sister—he is the executor—Michael George Alex died about a month ago in St. Petersburg—Mr. Baring told me that Michael died in Victoria, Australia—my husband told Mr. Leonard that we thought he died in Victoria—I do not know that my husband informed Mr. Leonard that Michael had <hi rend="italic">chunks</hi> of Sydney and Melbourne, and was the ground landlord of nearly the whole of those places—he did own property there—I do not know that at my husband's request, Mr. Leonard sent out to some solicitors there and got a reply that the whole story was a myth—I have seen Michael's will in Mr. Baring's hands—I do not know where it is now; Mr. Baring knows—I left Russia when I was five or six years old, but I have been there many times since—I do not speak very much Russian—my grandfather always spoke English—when I spoke to the Russians I spoke Russian—I have not got here a scrap of writing to prove that I am in any way connected with the Soltykoff family, but I could get it from Mr. Baring—he has been suffering for many years from cancer, and has had one or two operations—it is supposed to be in his throat—I was with him when he was making his will, and went through many documents with him when he made it many years ago—he altered it in 1900, and in 1901 Mr. Pollock made various suggestions to him, and he again altered it—it has always been in my favour—I first saw it in my favour many years ago—he has got many relations, but has not known them for many years—sixty years ago he returned to this country and said he did not wish to know any of them—he has never been married, and has no brothers, to my knowledge—he has one</p>

               <p>sister—I call her Miss Baring; her name is Miss Baring Robinson—she is alive—I do not know her age; she is very old—at present she is in the South of France—when she was home she stayed with a cousin of ours, a Mrs. Marshall, at Eastbourne—I cannot say where Mrs. Marshall lives, because Mr. and Miss Baring do not wish me to do so—Mr. Baring does not claim relationship with the family of bankers; he has only distant relations, I do not know how distant—he is a very funny old man—if I ask him anything he might say, "Oh, nothing," and another time he would tell me something—I did not say that if the Baring bankers wished to claim relationship with him they would have to prove it—he said he did not know them when he left this country, nor did he know them now—I do not know why he is so anxious to conceal the fact that he is a Baring; since I have known him he has been anxious to conceal it—he never used the name of Baring in his business affairs—he never went by the name of James Drummond Baring, to my knowledge—I do not know why people should think that hat is his name—this document (<hi rend="italic">Addressed to Leonard, dated February</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">th</hi> 1896, <hi rend="italic">stating that the prisoner did not then know where Baring was, but that his name was James Drummond Baring, that would be found in the Northbrook Peerage, and that he was half brother to Northbrook, Revelstoke, and Cromer.</hi>) looks like the prisoner's scrawl, but I am not quite sure—I never told him that-Mr. Baring's name was Drummond—Mr. Baring's mother was a Miss Drummond, so I suppose the prisoner made his mistake like that—he asked me if Mr. Baring was half brother to North<lb/>brook, Revelstoke, and Cromer, and I said I did not think so—I suppose Mr. Leonard would find out that he was not—I asked Mr. Baring about ten years ago if he was related to the late Lord Revelstoke, and he only smiled—I borrowed money from Mr. Leonard on my expectations, but the prisoner did not—the letter dated April 8th, 1896, asks for the loan of £9 9s. for rent—Michael Soltykoff was not dead in 1894—he died after we knew Mr. Leonard—before Michael Soltykoff died I was borrowing money then for the prisoner—I suppose that there are many persons I could call to say that they had seen Mr. Baring, but I shall call no one, and there is no person whose address I shall give who can say they have seen him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> With Mr. Baring's permission, I can produce papers to show that there is such a person—Mr. Baring called Michael Soltykoff Samuel as a nickname—Michael died just after our marriage, and Mr. Pollock said he thought that he died in Melbourne or Sydney, but that he would make inquiries and let us know—you never knew until a few days ago that Mr. Baring was known as Robinson—when I wrote to you he did not wish you to know what name his investments were in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence on oath, said that he always thought Baring's, name was James Drummond, but that he had never told Kelsey so, nor had he said that Baring had withdrawn any money from the banking firm; that the</hi> £5,000 <hi rend="italic">from Bainbridge was advanced on the understanding that they should go into partnership to develop the Crowhurst Estate, which was the security for the advance, and not his expectations; that he made the declara<lb/>tion</hi>

I am the wife of Joseph Lambden, and reside at Walthamstow—on April 4th between 7 and 7.30 p.m., I was with my husband and William Clements in Black Horse Lane, Walthamstow, going in the direction of Higham Hill—I was walking a little in front, when the prisoner, whilst passing me, made an offensive noise in my face, and I said to him, "You will want that presently, <hi rend="italic">old chap</hi>"—he then hit me on my nose with his fist and knocked me down—Clements looked to see what the matter was, and I saw the prisoner strike him a heavy blow on the right side of his head, and he fell to the ground, striking his head.</p>

I was with my wife and Clements in Black Horse Lane on the evening of April 4th—my wife was twenty yards from us when I saw the prisoner strike her—I turned round and said to him, "What did you do that for?" whereupon he struck Clements with his fist on the left side of his head—I had been with Clements the whole afternoon; he was sober at the time—I helped to take him home; I did not see any sign of blood, but he was unconscious.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Clements had had something to drink—I know I said before the Magistrate that he was <hi rend="italic">medium</hi>—I was going forward to catch the prisoner, but Clements did not have a chance to get anywhere near him—he was going towards him, but he did not have his hands out—I did not have a scuffle with the prisoner—Godbold must have meant by saying at the police court that we had a scuffle, that I was going towards the prisoner to catch him, but we did not come hand to hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 10, Hilton Street, Plumstead—in December was in Davies' employ at the Paragon Iron and Brass Works—I remember Hexton coming there on December 9th, when Davies was out—I had a short conversation with him, and he left—I told Davies when he came in about it,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190404180076"/>
               <p>and he asked whether Sexton had seen Mrs. Davies—I cannot say whether he saw Sexton that day or not—on December 11th, when I got to the works, about 8 a.m., I saw a cannon placed on end in the brass furnace in the melting shop, surrounded by coke for heating it—it was the breakfast half hour when I arrived, and after breakfast Davies came in and, with Edward Saggerston, a moulder, took it from the furnace and beat it with a sledge hammer into small pieces, which were afterwards put into a smelting pot and melted down—another cannon was served in the same way—the molten lead was then poured into moulds the shape of a bottle—Davies was about more or less the whole day—on December 12th I got to work at 7 a.m., and saw Davies there—the ingots of metal were taken from the shop, Davies brushed the saidoff them, and they were weighed and sent away in a van—I saw that a man named George, a carman at the California public house, was driving the van—about 11 a.m. that day Sexton came and was with Davis for some time—I am not certain whether I saw Jones on the 11th or 12th—on December 18th I got to work about 7 a.m., and in the yard I saw a van which was almost immediately driven away—Davies was in the yard at the time—about 5 p.m. Jones and Sexton came into the foundry and took off their coats, as if they were going to work—shortly afterwards, while passing the smith's shop I saw Sexton looking down into the smelting furnace—I went in, and Davies told me that I could go home, as there would be no more business that day, as one of the furnaces had failed—I did on occasions assist at casting myself—I went out into the road, and wanting to see what they were doing, I went to an empty house at the back of the shop and looked through the window, when I saw Jones, Sexton and Davies take a cannon from under a heap of ashes or something, in the yard and drop it into the cupola—I then went home—the next day I arrived at work at the usual time, when I saw a van in the yard and ingots of metal being put into it—Davies and Jones were there, and I believe Sexton was there too—the van was then driven away, I believe, by Sexton, but I cannot be sure—after the van drove away I went straight into the shop, where I saw a piece of metal, which looked to me like a part of a cannon, on the floor—Davies told me that the bands which draw the blower for forcing the fire into the cupola had gone wrong in the night, and sent me to North Woolwich for some more laces to repair the bands with—when I returned the piece of metal I had seen had gone—I saw Sexton again that day about 11 a.m.—on December 21st, when going to work, I bought a <hi rend="italic">Morning Leader</hi>, and saw a report of the guns being missed, which on reaching the works I at once showed to Davies, saying, "It looks all right"—he said, "What is it?" and read the report—it is a common thing for working men to say, "It looks all right" when they mean it looks all wrong—he asked me to say nothing about it, and that I knew nothing about it—I told him that the police would come, and that I should go home; he told me he knew nothing about it, and that they could not touch him—I told him that if he could not carry on business in a fair and square manner he should give it up and go back to work—he had been employed as foreman and manager at Messrs. Kirk and Randall's, contractors at Woolwich, and had only recently gone into</p>

D."—I showed it to Davies, and he said, "Yes, that is my card"—I then said, "Sexton has made a statement which I will read to you"—after I had done so he said, "I only know two of them," referring to the other prisoners; "I have had genuine dealings in metal with Sexton. He told me the guns were all right, and signed a paper saying that he bought them at a sale"—I said. "Have you the paper?" and he said, "No; one of my workmen tore it up"—I then said, "Have you any<lb/>thing in writing from Sexton or the other men respecting the guns?" and he said. "So"—he then said, "Sexton showed me a newspaper report of the case, and I wired him to clear the guns"—I said, "Some of them had been melted down by that time," and he said, "They were not all run down; my man took some pieces and got rid of them"—I said that it was not then too late for him to have given information to the police—he was taken to Blackheath Road Police Station, and the next morning was charged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Sexton's statement read:</hi> "I am a prisoner charged concerned, with Alfred Atkins and others in stealing six ancient cannon from the Rotunda Grounds, Woolwich Common, and I desire to make a statement respecting the case. On December 10th, 1903. Alfred Atkins and another man named Ben Jones and I were all out of work. Jones and I had been in search of work that morning, and took shelter in the Rotunda from rain. When we came out we walked round the Rotunda Grounds and looked at the cannon that were lying about. We noticed that some of them were small, and I lifted one up to try the weight. Jones said. There's a Christmas dinner for someone if they had heart enough to come after them.' Jones and I met Atkins the same day, talked about the cannon,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190404180079"/>
               <p>and we all agreed to go that night and get a couple of them. Some weeks previous to this I met a man named James Davies, formerly a foreman in the metal department of Messrs. Kirk and Randall, builders and con<lb/>tractors, Warren Lane Works, Woolwich, where I also had worked. He told me that he had taken the Paragon Iron and Brass Foundry. Manor Way, North Woolwich, and asked me if I knew anyone who could get any kind of metal, as he could do with it. and that he had bought several tons of zinc and tin of the dockers. In consequence of this, Jones and I went about 5 p.m., December 10th, to the Paragon Works. Jones remained outside, and I went in and saw Davies. I said to him in course of conversation, 'I know where there are some small cannon,' and he at once replied, 'Fetch any d——mortal thing over. I can do with it as much as you like. How many are there in the job?' I said, 'Three,' and he saw Jones standing outside, and asked me if he was one of them. I replied, 'Yes.' He said, 'Do you think he will keep his mouth shut?" I said, 'Yes.' He then said, 'Fetch them over in the morning, as near seven o'clock as you can, and I will be ready to open the gates for you to drive in.' I asked him for a drink, and he gave me sixpence, and Jones and I went away. At 7.30 p.m. the same evening (December 10th), Jones, Atkins, and I met at the Burrage Arms public house, Plumstead Road, by appointment, and went to the Rotunda Grounds. We took two small cannon and carried them to the boundary wall in Hill Street, and placed them against a tree near the gateway and came away. Atkins left us to go home, and Jones and I went to George Minor, greengrocer, Station Road, Plumstead, and hired his pony and van for six o'clock next morning. I told him we wanted it for a moving job, and as he knew me, it was arranged that I should harness the pony and drive myself. At 6 a.m. (December 11th) Jones and I met at Minor's stable, harnessed the pony, and drove to Plumstead Station (railway), where we met Atkins by appointment, and all drove together to Hill Street, arriving there about 6.30 a.m. Jones got over the wall and forced open the gate with his screwdriver. I went in, and he and I carried the two cannon out and placed them in the van. We threw a sack over them. Atkins remained outside and kept watch. We then all drove away together, and crossed the Thames by the 7.20 a.m. ferry. I went on top with the van, Atkins and Jones went below with other passengers. On arriving at North Hill, I drove on to the Paragon Works, and Jones and Atkins followed on on foot as arranged. On arrival at the Paragon Works, Davies was waiting for me, and opened the large wooden gates and I drove, in. Jones and Atkins remained outside. Davies and I weighed the two cannon, which weighed together 2 3/4 cwt. He agreed to pay me 30s. per cwt., but said he was short of money, and only gave me 30s., and promised to pay me 35s. the next day, Saturday. About noon that day Jones and I went to the Paragon Works. Jones stopped outside and I went in and saw Davies. He told me that he had run the cannon down into bottle shape ingots, and had sent them away with a van to Arthur Castle, metal dealer, Commercial Road East with some other old stuff, and that I should have to wait till his man came back with the money. Whilst</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190404180080"/>
               <p>waiting Davies took me into his blacksmith's shop and foundry, and he showed me a cupola in which he said he had melted the cannon. He said that he first laid them on the fire in the blacksmith's shop, heated them, and broke them up; but if I could get another half dozen he would put them in his large 'cubils,' and they would be run down in a half hour. The carman returned with a cheque from Arthur Castle, which Davies sent his man to cash at the California Arms public house, Manor Way. He returned with the money and I went into the office with Davies, and he paid me 35s., making in all £3 5s. for the two cannon, Jones and I then went away and met Atkins in Beresford Street, Woolwich, by appoint<lb/>ment, and we shared the money. On Wednesday, December 16th, Jones and I went to the Paragon Works about 3 p.m. We both went in and saw Davies. I asked him if he could do with some more cannon and he said, 'Fetch six if you can, and be here at the same time (meaning 7 a.m.) with them, and I'll be ready for you.' I asked him for some money, and he gave me 5s. I gave Jones half of it. Jones and I had seen Atkins at 11 a.m. that evening at Beresford Square, Woolwich, and arranged to meet at 7 p.m. at the Burrage Arms, which appointment we kept. We all three went to the Rotunda Grounds. Atkins remained at the gate and kept watch; Jones and I got over and picked out four of the smallest cannon we could find and laid them on the wall dividing the grounds from the road leading into the Rotunda, and left them ready for removal next morning. This was about 8.45 p.m. We then went away, and Jones and I saw George Minor the same night and again hired the van. I told Minor that we had got a piano to shift, and he said I could have it, but would have to see to it myself. The next morning, December 17th, Jones and I met at Minor's stable, took a pony this time, a trap, not van, and Atkins met us at the stable yard. We all three drove to the Rotunda Approach. Atkins held the horse to prevent it making a noise, and Jones and I got over the gate and rolled the four cannon off the wall, down the bank, broke the wire fence, and placed them on the trap. One long one protruded over the front, and we covered it with a sack. I then got up and drove the pony, and Jones and Atkins followed on foot, and I believe we caught the 7.20 ferry. I went on top with the pony and trap, and on arrival at North side I drove straight to Davies's Paragon Works. I got down, knocked at the side gate, and he opened it. He then opened the big gates, and I led the pony in, and we unloaded the four cannon placed them in the yard, and we covered them over with ashes. He said he would get the big cubils ready and wire me to come over and lend him a hand to run them down. I then joined Jones and Atkins, who had waited outside and we returned across the ferry to Woolwich. It was arranged that I should go to my home, 107, Station Road. Plumstead, and await wire from Davies, and that on its receipt I was to join them at Jones' house. Earl Street, Plumstead. I received a telegram about 10.45 a.m. (December 17th) from Davies as follows:' Refuse to remain on premises any longer: clear at once.' Jones and I went at once to the Paragon Works and asked Davies the meaning of the telegram. He said,' The man that was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190404180081"/>
               <p>going to have them of me refused to take them, and if you' (Jones was present) 'will come and lend me a hand I will run them down this evening.' It was arranged that we should be there at 7 p.m. same day. We got there at 8 o'clock, and Davies's two workmen ran some cast iron out of the cubils, and Jones and I placed three of the guns, with Davies's assistance, into it. Davies then started a gas engine which drove a fan to get the necessary blast, and about fifteen minutes later we put in the fourth cannon. Some of the molten metal was drawn into a ladle, and we (Jones and I) came away. At 7 <hi rend="italic">a.m.</hi> (December 17th) Jones and I went to the Paragon Iron Works, saw Davis, and found that he had a cart waiting, with ingots of metal in. He said it was the metal that came from the guns, and it weighed 4 1/2 cwt., and that he thought there would be about 3 cwt. To come later. I said, 'How is that?' He said, 'The fan broke down, and it did not all melt.' He then asked me to take the ingots to Castle's, Commercial Road, which I did, and sold in the name of Stevens, and received a cheque for £9 9s., I had had previous dealings with Castle's, who believed me to be a genuine metal dealer, and they did not suspect anything wrong. I cashed the cheque at their bank in Commercial Road: Jones was with me. and we returned with the money to Davies. I handed him the £9 9s., and he gave me £5 5s., which was at the rate of 30s. per cwt., the price he had agreed to pay us. Jones and I left, and we met Atkins at the Railway Hotel, North Woolwich. I gave him 17s., Jones £2 2s., and had £2 2s. myself after paying for the pony and trap. I never took anything else to the Paragon Works, but called there shortly after Christmas and asked him about the other metal, which he said was to come, and he told me he had buried it, but that I do not believe. On January 29th or 30th, 1904, I received the postcard bearing postmark January 29th produced, but I did not reply to it, neither did I go to see him, as I was in work until March 17th, when I called and saw him at his house, and he gave me half a sovereign. He did not ask me to bring him more metal, and I did not suggest that I would, but in the course of con<lb/>versation he said that he had seen a notice about the guns on the police station notice board and in the papers and said that he hoped that my mates and I would keep our mouths shut. I have not seen or heard from Davies since. I make this statement, which is perfectly true, of my own free will and accord, and without fear or any promise of favour. When I took the first two cannon to Davies he asked me where they came from, and I told him they were Government guns. When I took the four he asked me where the guns were coming from, and I said from the Rotunda, Woolwich Common. Signed, John Sexton. Witnesses, Arthur Hailstone and Alfred Crutchett."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 11. Disraeli Road, Putney, with my father, who is a veterinary surgeon and job master—the prisoner was in my father's employ from October, 1903, to March 11th this year—she occupied a bedroom on the top floor by herself—about 2 p.m. on March 11th she complained to me that she had pains in her head and inside, and I told her she had better go and lie down for a while, which she did—between 3.30 and 4 p.m. I went up to her room and found her undressed in bed—she did not seem any better, so I gave her some brandy and water, and came down stairs again—at 4.30 p.m. I went up again and she told me that she felt better—I saw signs of blood about the room—I did not see or hear anything of a child—about seven o'clock my father came home, and Dr. Keenan, who was sent for, arrived about 8.30—outside the door of the prisoner's room there is a box with some rugs in it, which was often in use, and kept unlocked—it was not hers.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.P. I am a pathologist, And on March 14th, at the Wands worth Mortuary, I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of a newly born male child, which had been dead about three days—it was fully developed, And about 19 1/2 in. in length—the umbilical cord had been torn Across About 1 1/2 in. from its insertion into the abdomen—I found two independent pieces of tape tied round the neck, about an inch to three quarters of an inch from one Another; they ran Across the middle of the thyroid cartilage; one was tied round twice, And they were fastened by two knots, one Above the other; the lower tape was tied round once; both tapes were wound round very tightly, And were buried practically in the skin; I cut them off, And the skin under the tape was compressed and pale, And where the edges of the tape ran, there were several minute hemorrhages under the skin, and the skin between the two tapes was swollen Ana contained more serum; the skin above the upper tape was livid, and below the lower tape it was pale; the eye<lb/>lids and eyeballs were bloodshot, and the lips were livid; the tongue was turned up against the palate, and had several hemorrhages at its root; there were hemorrhages both in the structure surrounding the larynx And inside the larynx—there were further hemorrhages in front of the larynx, under the skin of the scalp, And in the substance of the gullet—they ceased At the level of the lower ligature—the cause of death was strangulation, which is evidenced by the colour of the eyelids And lips, the position and the hemorrhages of the tongue, and by the ligatures being so tight that you could not pass your finger round them—I applied the hydrostatic test to the lungs, cutting them up in small pieces, placing them in water, and I found them all perfectly inflated—I examined the bronchial tube, And found no foreign substance in it—I am of opinion that the child had a separate existence, my reasons for so saying, being that the birth of the child appeared to have been rapid, and that the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190404180085"/>
               <p>lungs were perfectly inflated, which could not have taken place if the child had not had a separate existence: it must have breathed deeply and fully.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> A child does not breathe so fully when only half born as it does when the birth is complete; the amount of air in the lungs varies—I know that it was a rapid birth from the umbilical cord being torn, that being caused, in my opinion, by the child being shot out—the hydrostatic test is, in my opinion, absolutely conclusive in circum<lb/>stances of this kind; each lobe is separately tested to see if it floats; then each is cut into pieces, and these pieces are tested, and so you get a complete test of the lungs: you might get a quantity of air in the lungs even if the child had not had a separate existence, but had had a long birth, but then mucus and blood would be found in the larynx and mouth; and there was none to be found in this case—in an abnormally long birth the child would be asphyxiated, and it has to be brought to by artificial means; if there had been no respiration the lungs would sink; in this particular case the inflation of the lungs, to my mind, proved conclusively that the child had had a separate existence, and breathed fully and deeply.</p>

"They can go if they like"—they did not come, because the boy would not go without his sister, and she would not go without the prisoner and he said he would not come—I went to the flat next day and knocked at the door—there was no answer and I could not get in—I then wont to Sutton &amp; Baddersley, to whom the Hat belongs—I remember the prisoner's son, to whom I had sent the telegram, coming to the Grove on Monday evening—I gave him the revolver and cartridges directly I saw him—I did not give him the letter until the next morning, as I forgot it—I remember the prisoner coming back with his children on the Tuesday—they all appeared to be very ill—about a fortnight before this I bought some chloroform for the prisoner; he said he wanted it for neuralgia, and that his head was bad—I found this bottle (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), with the scent label on it as it is now, on the mantel<lb/>shelf in the back room at the Hat—it is not the bottle that I bought the chloroform in—I did not say anything to the prisoner about the chloroform, but I saw him put those labels on the scent bottle one evening at 30 Camberwell Grove—(<hi rend="italic">The label had "Parma Violets" on it.</hi>)—I did not then know that there was chloroform in it—I did not know there was chloroform in it till I found it at the flat a few days after March 20th,</p>

I am divisional surgeon at 29, Camberwell-road—I have examined this bottle with the label on it—it contains three drachms of chloroform impregnated with an appreciable quantity of attar of roses—that would not in any way affect the chloroform—I have heard Henry Hallam's evidence—deafness and dizziness are con<lb/>sistent with recovery from chloroform—if the children took chloroform I do not think it was taken by the mouth, because it is so strong an irritant that they would be bound to have tasted it; even when diluted with water it causes burning, and by itself it causes distinct pain and inability to swallow—if it was administered they must have inhaled it—it could have been given when they were asleep by being put on a handkerchief—if a sufficient quantity had been sprinkled on their pillow it might have some effect—it would very likely produce sickness but I should not expect the symptoms to have lasted two or three days; I should expect them to last one day—evidently something had been given to them—if they went to sleep on Sunday night and did not wake up till Tuesday morning I should expect that there was more than one administration, because if any<lb/>thing like complete anaesthesia had been brought about by one administra<lb/>tion they would probably have died—it would be absolutely unnatural for the children to go to sleep on Sunday night and not wake up till Tuesday morning, unless they were given something—I think chloroform was administered to them during Monday—if they had only had a dose on the Sunday night it would not have kept them asleep so long, unless it killed them—if a sufficient amount of chloroform was given to them to keep them under its effects for the whole of the time I take it that it might endanger their lives.</p>

Who is charging me, and what is the evidence?"—I replied, "It has come to my knowledge that you caused chloroform to be pur<lb/>chased, and that you took your children to an empty flat, where they were partly insensible for two nights and a day, and that their symptoms were afterwards those of a person recovering from chloroform or a similar drug, and a bottle of chloroform was afterwards found at the flat"—he said, "Since you know so much, I will tell you. My wife is at the bottom of this. I have had a lot of trouble with her. I still deny having done anything to the children"—he was charged, and he said in reply, "I am innocent"—on searching him I found these three poison labels with "Chloroform" written upon them—a bottle containing some chloroform was handed to me by Mrs. Hallam in Blakesley's presence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">A letter was read from H. M. Gome, M.D., to the prisoner, stating that the prisoner had consulted him during January, February, and March; that he found him to be suffering from a general break down in health, which the doctor attributed to worry; and that he always found him sober and gentle<lb/>manly.</hi>

HALLAM</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi>) Before I enlisted I was a clerk—I enlisted because I fancied the Army—it had nothing to do with the differences between my father and mother—my mother has behaved in a proper manner to us—she drank very moderately—I have seen her the worse for drink a few times—I knew none of her friends—she was always affectionate to us—she has lately been nursing an old gentleman—I do not know if she went home every day.</p>

The prisoner has been at Brixton Prison since March 28th—I have had him under observation since April 4th—he has been very quiet and well conducted, and in conversation on ordinary topics he has talked rationally and coherently—he has talked very bitterly about his family affairs, and brought many charges—I cannot say it is exactly a delusion—he is very jealous, and accused his wife of great immorality—I asked him if he had any direct proof, and he said he had on several occasions charged her with immoral conduct—he mentioned Cochrane, and said that his wife used the nursing as a mere blind to be more away—that is the only thing one can have any suspicion of being a delusion, and if it is jealousy it is not a delusion.</p>
