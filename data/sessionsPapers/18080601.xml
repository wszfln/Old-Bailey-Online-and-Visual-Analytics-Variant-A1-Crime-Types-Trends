               <p>Q. What time was it your house was robbed. - A. On Tuesday the 1st of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your house been broken into before the 1st of March. - A. Yes; on the the Wednesday evening before that a square of glass was broke or cut through; I lost on the Wednesday, two caps, two silk handkerchiefs, a stock stiffner, and about thirty five yards of British lace. On the Tuesday morning following that, about a quarter before eight o'clock in the morning, from the information the servant girl gave me, I perceived the same pane of glass broken, which had been repaired.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the same pane taken out, or broken. - A. It was not all taken out; it was broken, and about half out; I missed a plad handkerchief which laid against the glass.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the colour of the handkerchief. - A. A green and dark blue; I had seen it the evening before lying near the pane of glass that was broken.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get up in the morning. - A. A quarter before eight: my servant girl got up before me, she saw nothing of it; I saw nothing of it; the neighbours gave me to understand that I was robbed and that they knew the parties.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. It was a quarter before eight o'clock when you discovered the window had been broken. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>LEITH DUNBAR. Q. You live at Ratcliffe Highway, do you. - A. Yes; I am a cooper.

               <p>Q. How far were they from you when you first saw them. - A. It was about three doors off where I first saw them; they turned up another street; they came back in about a minute or two; they looked very hard at me again.</p>

I shut the door and went into the lock up house and looked through the iron grating at the end of the lock up house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that lock up house on the same side of the way as Mrs. Milton's - A. There is only a pavement of about a yard and a half wide between it and the houses adjoining Mrs. Milton's; after I stood there some time, I saw the two prisoners there again; I saw them trying to force the windows in with their thumbs, both of them; the prisoner went about four doors off; there were two or three people coming by; a milkman came by with his pails; the prisoner went down with him towards Shadwell, about twenty doors off; they got out of my sight; while I was gone Nathan Levi turned round and missed him; in about a minute and a half after he missed him he saw him coming towards him.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him too. - A. Yes. They both came to the window again, they both tried the pane of glass with their thumbs again as they did before; I saw the prisoner take and put his hand into his pocket; I could not observe any thing that he had in his hand, they both stood close together. I heard the window in about half a minute crack; they both walked away directly.</p>
               <p>Q.You did not see either of them put their hands to their pockets after you heard the crack did you. - A. No. When they walked away I went out of the watch-house and crossed over the way to the public house; I told a gentleman that these two men, that were over the way had broke a window; they came back to the window while I was at the public house, and forced a piece of the window in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did both of them or one. - A. Both of them together; I saw

               <p>Q. Do you know who had given the alarm to them. - A. Yes; Mr. Ayres went out of the public house where I was and told them; in about five minutes after that I went to Mrs. Milton's shop. I perceived the window was broken, and one or two handkerchiefs were rumpled; Mrs. Milton came into the shop, I asked her if she had lost any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any of Mrs. Milton's family in the shop during the time this was done. - A. No; after it was done the servant girl came out.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know this, do you, whether the window was broke before they came up to it. - A. No, I could not; it was a bow window, and this was one of the farther side.</p>

About a quarter before eight o'clock in the morning, as we were going past Mrs. Milton's shop window, we looked in, we saw nobody there, we walked away and came back again; then the prisoner at the bar took out a knife from his waistcoat pocket and cut a pane of glass, and I shoved a piece of the pane of glass in; we both walked away and went up a turning; we both came back together, we stood with our faces to the window so as nobody should see us; then I pulled the handkerchief out of the window and gave it to the prisoner; we walked away with it, and went down Wentworth-street, Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a handkerchief was it. - A. A plaid silk handkerchief; it looked like puple and green.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by saying it looked like purple and green. - A. It was a dark blue with a kind of a red and green.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you should know the handkerchief again if you saw it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Combs. The handkerchief has never been found.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed. - A. Not till one o'clock; I fastened the door myself, it was fastened in every respect; I was the last person that was up in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state did you find it in the morning. - A. The maid was up first in the morning, she saw a reflection of light through the shop door; in consequence of that she came up to my room door and informed me that the shop had been broken open; it was about five o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light then. - A. Quite light. I immediately came down and saw that the door was left upon the latch and that it had been cut by boring a number of small holes with a common gimblet in one of the pannels of the door; after they got the piece out they could put their hand in and unscrew the iron bar; after that they took down the half shutter and took out one of the squares of glass in the shop door; the squares are very large; it appeared that they got in at one of the squares; after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010005"/>which the shutters had been put up again, and a piece of paper of the colour of the door, was pasted upon the hole of the door, and the gimblet that they had bored the holes with, they tied the lock back with it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you miss. - A. I missed twenty pieces of Irish linen, value sixty pounds, about five hundred yards of printed cotton, value fifty pounds, and two wrappers full of my best muslins, figured and plain, about the value of thirty pounds; they were taken from three shelves, which were empty in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing more. - A. On Thursday morning the 7th of April, I received a letter by the post; I went to Worship-street and shewed the letter to the magistrate; I had a warrant to search the prisoner's house, No. 45, Seward street, Brick-lane, St. Luke's; I went there in company with three officers on that same Thursday; we went first into the parlour even with the shop; in a chest of drawers, which was in the parlour, we found a piece of muslin. This is the piece of muslin; we found nothing else belonging to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that yours. - A. From the texture of it, the breadth, the quantity, and the situation in which it was placed, and missing it the next morning, I believe it to be mine; it had a fag end on it then, it has not now; the private mark and the fag end has been cut off. I cannot swear to it; I have not any doubt that it is mine; it is worth about ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. I understand you to say, that when you discovered your house to be broken open, it was at five o'clock in the morning. - A. Yes; it was day light.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a great deal of force used with respect to this house of yours - there must be a good many more persons than one. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The gimblet being used, the pannel taken out, and the paper stuck upon the hole; I take it for granted you think there were more persons than one. - A. Yes; it must have taken a considerable time.</p>
               <p>Q. The way they got in was through a pane of glass, do you think it likely that a woman was doing this. - A. I do not pretend to say it is.</p>
               <p>Q. What size was the pane of glass. - A. I never took the dimensions exactly, it was large; I suppose about fourteen inches in width, and eighteen or twenty in length, too the best of my recollection; the whole square of glass was taken out, any moderate size person could get in.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you enquired whether this woman is a married woman or no. - A. We asked for her husband when we went to the house; we went to the house for the purpose of seeing her husband, and searching the house; I did not see the husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear that upon a conviction of a burglary there was a forty pounds reward. - A. I have heard of it for trials in the city; I did not know there was for the county, it was not for that.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street office. In consequence of this warrant; I went to the house of Mrs. Eversall on the 7th of April; I saw Mrs. Eversall, I asked her if her husband was at home; Bishop, Kennedy, and Mr. Rutter were in company with me: she answered that her husband was not at home; there was some other woman in the house besides her; I told her that I had a warrant to search the house. I read the warrant, and then asked her if she had any goods in the house answering that description; she answered no; we then proceeded to search a back room behind the shop. In a draw of a chest of drawers, we found this piece of muslin; she said, she had bought it, but she did not know from whom; we searched different parts of the house, we found nothing more that belonged to this robbery; in searching up stairs, behind a chest of drawers we found a small piece of paper covered with dust; I took it out, I asked Mrs. Eversall what that paper contained; she said garden seed; I opened it before her, and found it contained bank notes to the amount of two hundred pounds and upwards; she then said it belonged to her husband, she knew her husband had a private plant; but she did not know where it was, nor to what amount these notes were I brought away; I knew there had been notes of that kind advertised; I could not find the owner of them. I produce them. I went a day or two after to the prosecutor's house, and saw the way the entry was made; there were holes bored in a square form with a small gimblet, and then it was cut by a knife; after the piece was taken out the hole was about as big as your arm; it was to undo the fastening.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not it appear to be the work of some man instead of a woman. - A. Yes; they do it that way, because if they are taken, they suppose a gimblet would not be considered as an instrument of house breaking.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how the woman came to be indicted. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You speak very sensible - it seems that you think a woman could not do this. - A. I do not believe it was done by a woman. Bishop found some pick-lock-keys.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you think she was the receiver more than the thief. - A. I have no doubt of that.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you the butler. - A. Yes; I heard him walk out again.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your master's plate kept. - A. In the pantry; the pantry door goes out immediately from the kitchen; it was open, the plate was in the pantry, it laid on the table; when I heard this man walk out, I was in the back kitchen; I went into the front kitchen, then I saw the prisoner at the top of the area steps: I went into the pantry to see what I had missed; I missed eight silver table spoons; I went directly after him, and caught him; I brought him back into the kitchen; he denied he ever had been in the kitchen at all; I could see the print of spoons through his coat, at his breast; I asked him to unbutton his coat; he did not give me any answer, but walked directly into the pantry; he asked me where the plate was; he id not take it away, he did not know where it was; I took hold of his coat and pulled him back from the pantry<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010006"/>door; then he directly pulled the spoons out, and laid them down on the table and said here is your spoons, be friends, and let me go and say no more about it; I told him I could not let him go; an officer was sent for, I gave him up to the officer; these are the spoons; I have had them in my possession ever since; there is my master's crest upon them; they laid on the table in the pantry; they are my master's property.</p>

               <p>Q. And the pantry door was open. - A. Yes; the area kitchen door was shut; I heard the door shut after the man came in the kitchen, and I heard it shut when he went out; I had seen the door about two or three minutes before; the door shuts of itself.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to say that when you went into the back kitchen you shut the door. - A. Yes, I had, but whether it latched I cannot say; there was nobody down stairs but me and the cook, she was in the back kitchen with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in the back kitchen before you heard the door shut, and heard a person walk across the kitchen into the pantry. - A. About half a minute</p>
               <p>Q. You and the cook were in the back kitchen - what other persons of the family were in the house. - A. Mrs. Twining was at the top of the house, and the house maid was in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of these spoons. - A. They are worth five pounds at the least.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to Bloomsbury square, to the colonel of the regiment, that I belonged to; and when I came from there, I came to this gentleman to get my pension; I have been a soldier in Germany; when I came up to the house, this man came up to me; he says I beg your pardon, was not you in our house; I said I did not know; he said he wanted me to go with him; I told him I would, I asked him who wanted me; I followed him, he said the gentleman of the house has lost some silver spoons; I said, I was sorry for it; when I went in there was an iron door, I could not open it; he opened it, and when I came down in the kitchen he opened a drawer; out he runs again, and ran up stairs; he looked very hard upon me, I thought it very comical, I thought of no harm; when he came down stairs, he said open your coat; I did, there was three and sixpence which the colonel's lady gave me, and he found an old German letter on me; I said my good man here are your spoons, they were laying under the table; the woman took the spooms, she gave them to him: he ran up stairs, he came down, he said send for a constable; the constable came I was taken in custody; I never was before any judge or jury before.</p>
               <p>Q. to Britten. I heard you say positively that when you brought him back and took him into the pantry, you saw the print of the spoons on his coat. - A. Yes, and he took the spoons from under his coat and laid them down.</p>

             in possession of the house from nine till twelve o'clock; about the hour of twelve I returned again and my wife; at that time we knew nothing of what had happened; on the Tuesday morning following, I wanted to give change for a forty pound note; I went to my iron chest to get my money, and when I had introduced my key. I found it would not go round; I then pulled it and found it was open; and when I took the book out I found all the money was disconcerted; it was differently folded to what I generally put in the cash book.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it cash or bank notes. - A. It was bank notes in that book; on looking over the money I found a twenty pound bank note missing; likewise when I looked to the cash in my purse, I discovered two guineas in gold missing; upon examining the drawer of the iron chest I found it had been forced open; I sent for an officer; he searched the prisoner; some money was found on him in my presence, two one pound notes, a guinea and two seven shilling pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know these notes. - A. I do not. He was then taken to the office and examined, and Mr. Conant gave me a warrant to search the aunt's house; we had a suspicion that the twenty pound note might be deposited there. The officer, myself, and another witness went to the aunt's house in Chandos-street, Grosvenor-square; in a pair of drawers we found a pair of corderoy smallclothes, five new shirts, two calico and three linen; the two callico shirts were taken away from my house that morning, on the 26th, a little before eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know. - A. By the information of his aunt; I had not missed them, nor had we any suspicion; likewise there were four pair of thread stockings found in his aunt's apartments. On the 28th he was brought up the second time to be examined; he there acknowledged that my twenty pound note he had secreted in a roll of blue cloth; I promised that if he would tell me where the money was, I would save his life.</p>
               <p>Q. Then we must not hear any thing more about what he said.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that did he direct you to go to any place where you might find the property. - A. He did; he told me that if I would let him go to my warehouse up stairs, in my house where he had deposited the money in such a roll of cloth, I might find the money that I had missed. On the officer and myself going to the warehouse at the top of the house, I found the twenty pound note, in the roll of cloth where the prisoner informed me, along with it were two guineas, with an additional sum of three guineas more; five one pound notes and a five pound note; that overplus quantity of money he said was his own; I charged him with having taken a twenty pound note and two guineas; he had been previously robbing me; he told me then the five one pound notes, and the five pound note, and the three guineas were his own; before Mr. Conant he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010007"/>acknowledged that the whole was my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take them at one time or how. - A. He did not say; about a fortnight before I missed my money in the iron chest; I left the keys in the hurry of my business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss all this money at one time. - A. No, I only missed the twenty pound note and two guineas at one time; I charged him with it; he acknowledged taking it, and he acknowledged the remaining part of the money was my money, which no doubt it was.</p>
               <p>JOHN WARREN. I am an officer. On the 26th of April I went to Mr. Allardice's shop, he gave me charge of the prisoner for robbing him of a twenty pound note and two guineas; I took him into custody, he was committed for re-examination; on the Thusday following he asked me whether he could speak to his master; he asked his master if he would spare his life and he would tell him where all his property was; then we went to his warehouse, up in the garret, where the prisoner slept; in a bale of cloth we found the money, bank notes and cash; he told us where it was. I had a search warrant against his uncle's house in Chandos-street, there I found five shirts. Here is a twenty pound note, a five pound note, and five one pound notes, and five gnineas, I found in a bale of cloth in his master's warehouse; he said it was his master's property, that he broke the drawer of the iron-chest open with a fork; there was a mark of the fork on it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He told his aunt that I let him have these shirts that were found at his uncle's as part of his wages; the notes I can say nothing to; I have no private mark upon them; all the things I found at his aunt's I can swear to; they have my private mark; these shirts are my shirts.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they worth. - A. Ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This is my first offence; I leave myself to the mercy of the court; I beg for mercy.</p>

               <p>Q. You at last found that she was at Rochester. - A. Yes; I followed her to Rochester. I started at two o'clock in the morning, Tuesday the tenth of May, I found her at the Duke's Head at Rochester, where she had slept; she was not then up; it was about eight o'clock in the morning when I found her; I requested the servant maid to knock at the door to say that she wanted the candlestick to clean; she got up to open the door to give the maid the candlestick; I stepped in and kept her in her shift, as she was; she asked what brought me there; I told her she had brought me there, I wanted her and a few of the bank notes; she requested me to let her dress herself; I told her she should not dress herself till I had searched the room.</p>
               <p>Q. You put her in the hands of your brother officer. - A. Yes. She said it was of no use to search the room, to go to the bed; if I would look under the pillow, I should find all I wanted; we did look under the pillow; I found bank notes to the amount of two hundred and fifteen pounds; I found one for thirty pound, one forty pound, five twenty pounds each, two five pound each, one ten pound, and twenty five one pound each; I found in gold, three guineas and a half, thirteen seven shilling pieces, a dollar, four half-crowns, and twenty shillings in sixpences and shillings together, and fourteen pence in copper, making in the whole two hundred and twenty five pound ten shillings and eight pence; I told her that was not all that I wanted, for she had taken two hundred and forty five pound; she said that it was all that she had got left, she had been buying some new things that were under the bed, and the rest she had spent; she said that she should not have taken it from the man, only he had behaved so very mean to her; he had only given her a shilling, she thought she had a right to help herself to more.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Have you seen any of the notes. - A. No, none; but the officer has got them; I know the thirty and the forty; there are no marks on any of them.</p>

            . I found the petticoat and silk pelisse. When the prisoner was charged with stealing, she was asked where they were; she immediately said they were up stairs in the room where she slept; the prisoner shewed me into the garret; between the sacking and the bed she produced these articles tied up in this handkerchief - a silk pelisse and a cotton petticoat. In her pocket I found a silver fruit knife.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor. I suppose these things are worth seven shillings - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The very first beginning of it was my master came down in the morning, he left my mistress in the bed; he wanted to behave very improper with me. When I told my mistress of it, he said he would fix me, because I would not hold my tongue. I put the things under the bed, not with intention of taking them away; the things would have been found.</p>

On Friday evening the 30th of May, I was coming from Kingsland Road, about a quarter past nine o'clock, it was dark; the prisoner passed by me with a bundle under his arm, gathered up loose, not tied up as they are now.

               <p>Q. Near town or further from town - A. Further from town I asked him how he came in Kingsland Road, as he was going to the manglers with it; he told me he had been of an errand for his wife with the bundle; I told him it was an unlikely story, I should go to the mangler's and know the truth.</p>

             to watch, he sat up several nights; the banks were robbed after he came away; I desired him to call me on Friday morning the 29th of April, which he did at half after three o'clock I desired him to go over the banks and I followed him immediately; at the time I came up to him I discovered him with a woman, I saw a quantity of potatoes laying by her, I asked her what business she had there, she said it was the first time of her coming. I took her to the constable and gave her in charge, and kept the potatoes ever since under lock and key; these potatoes had been taken from the bank; the bank contained about seven ton.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the quantity taken away - A. About fifty pound weight.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where she lived - A. In Meeting House lane, within about half a mile from the place.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know whether she had any children - A. No, only what she informed the magistrate that she had two children.</p>
               <p>JOHN WHITE. Q. Are you servant to Mr. Whitbread and Morrison - A. Yes, I was employed to watch the potatoe bank. On the 29th of April, about half past three, I saw the prisoner, she went to the potatoe bank, she turned the straw of oneside and pulled about a bushel of potatoes into her apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts were the potatoes - A. In the field, in the parish of Edmonton. I apprehended her with the potatoes in her apron; there is a foot path in the field, it is a bye road. She threw the potatoes down, and begged of me to let her go. I told her it was more than my life was worth to let her go.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did it through distress for my children.</p>

In the morning I found the gate and the door of the house open; I looked at the ground were this fell, there was an impression on the ground. I heard of a man being in custody for stealing of lead; that very morning I sent to Mr. Seabrook to come forward to see if any thing was lost; accordingly it appeared that this lead belonging to the top of the window was gone; I went with the officer and saw the lead fitted; every thing seemed to correspond exactly.

After I had been there some time there was a knock at the door; I desired Mrs. Jones to open the door; the prisoner at the bar came in; Mrs. Jones said the prisoner at the bar was the man that she had the warrant against; I told him him I wanted him; he asked me what it was for; I told him did not he know that Mrs. Jones had been robbed; he answered what of that, I know nothing of it; he set his fist and put himself in a position as if in a Posture of defence; I told him it was of no use; I took hold of him and tied his hands with a handkerchief; I found nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010010"/>on the premises that led to the robbery that I was in search of; I searched the prisoner when I had secured him; in his waistcoat pocket I found a canvas purse; in it there were four good shillings and four sixpences; there were some halfpence and some keys; I took him to where the robbery was committed, and I desired Mrs. Jones to fetch the little boy down; I took him from there to No. 15, Robin Hood-court, Shoe-lane, where I learned that he lodged; I went up two pair of stairs, the prisoner went up with me; I sat him down in the window; I looked at a large chest that was there; I asked him if it was his chest; he said, yes; I told him I meaned to open it; he told me there was a key in his pocket; I took it out and the key did open it; I could not open it immediately; he told me to weigh heavy down upon it, and it did then open it; the first thing I took up was a drab coloured great coat; in the side pocket I found a crape hat band; in shaking the coat out I perceived a paper drop; I took the paper up; there were nine sixpences in it, and I thought they were of the same sort that I saw in his purse; I asked him if they were his; he said they were his; I took up a waistcoat; I opened it and shook it, another small paper dropped out; I took it up; in it I found some sixpences with a kind of stamp on them; they answered to what I had seen before, but they were brassy, not coloured.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sixpences. - A. Eight, and a seven shilling piece with them. There was a velveteen pair of breeches laid folded up in the said chest; when I took the breeches up I found by the side of it another paper, that contains some kind of cuttings that came off these sixpences; I found next a kind of a christmas-box. I asked him what he did with them things; he said it only contained children's play things, it contained different metal watch keys; the next thing that I found was some aqua fortis with the bottle three parts full, but the jolting of the coach has spilled some out of it; it is half full now; in taking the remaining clothes out, I found stamps and punches; these stamps, all but that stamp, was found in a chest; I found that stamp by the side of a box of charcoal; if you compare them with the marks on the sixpences, these stamps correspond to them; I found some metal rolled up in a paper, some brass, and a pair of small scales; I found some sand pa per, some that had been used and some that had not been used; I found in a box some cream of tartar with some shot at the bottom; I found two crucibles, one that had been used, with some metal at the bottom, and the other apparently had not been used; I found an oyster shell with some grease in it; and a small pocket book with some India ink in it; this is all I found that time in the chest. After I searched the other part of the apartment, I found this box on the shelf; I found this cutting punch; when I found these things the prisoner's wife seemed to be very resolute; I searched her in the prisoner's presence; I found nothing upon her but a snuff box and a few halfpence; I did not take her in custody, but she followed me to the compter; going along a little girl stood close to her; when we came to the compter I desired Mr. Leadbetter to bring her in; I went with Leadbetter again to the house in Robin Hood-court; then I brought away two hammers, a kind of a block, two flat irons and this pair of gloves; they looked as if they had been stained with a aqua fortis; I had seen the things the day before, but I did not bring them away, not being upon such a thing before; I compared the cutting punch with the marks on the block, they tallied the same as it does upon the iron; Leadbetter told me that this was a material thing, I should have brought them away; and when I compared the flat iron to the punch I perfectly saw it was marked with it; I went with Mr. Powell on the day following, on the Wednesday; I shewed him the things that I left behind me; Mr. Powell desired me to take away a large mallet and a bench or table; the mallet appeared as if they had been working on that metal, and I found a tag stained and burnt with aqua fortis.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any thing with respect to the window, - A. Yes; there was a window curtain tacked down that completely hid the window it being a kind of a gauzy nature it let the light through.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you took the prisoner did you observe any thing with respect to the person of the prisoner. - A. When I took the prisoner he seemed to be very resolute; I told him it was of no use; Mrs. Jones's husband said he would knock his head off if he offered to resist; as he held his hand up I saw his thumb stained, I thought it was bruised; I did not know it was aqua fortis at the time; I asked the prisoner when I took the things out of the chest if they were his; he said they were: and when I took the different things out of the chest he said they were trinkets for the children.</p>

            . - Mr. Knapp. You assist the solicitor of the mint. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. You are acquainted with the different process by which coining is completed. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you explain to us what is the use of the different articles that have been found. - A. The crucible is for melting the metal; after melting the metal, previous to casting it into the ingot mould, this sort of thing, that is an ingot mould.</p>
               <p>Court. That is one thing produced. - A. Yes; after being cast in the ingot mould, the ingot mould would be sent to the flatting mills, of which there are many in this town, and it would be flatted into plates which might be flatted into any thickess it might be wanted for; for instance, for either a shilling or a sixpence. You have some sissel which has been produced on the examination; I matched the sissel with the cutting punch as well as I could, and it appeared to correspond with respect to the circle, it corresponds with the cutting punch, and I compared the cutting punch with the iron; it corresponded with the marks on the iron.</p>
               <p>Q. Explain to the jury how this is done - A. This plate is fixed upon that block, and held between the legs; the man sitting and the plate put on this iron; then with the mallet it might be cut out, and if the punch passes through the plate it would leave the marks of the punch on it, there are many marks on the iron;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010011"/>it appears to have been very much used; by holding the block in that position between the legs it would prevent any particular noise from being heard, any more than the chopping of wood; which I desired the officer to use, by placing it between his legs, and not letting it touch the floor, it appeared like chopping of wood, it effectually answers the purpose; I compared the sissel with the finished money, it appeared exactly of the same metal. After the blanks are cut out by the punch, the edges are smoothed by the file, which was produced by the officer; this file has metal in the teeth of the same sort as the finished money and the blanks; here is sand paper, which is used for smoothing the surface preparatory for the colouring; here is a pair of pliers for holding the piece while these two operations are performing, by smoothing the edge with the file and smoothing the surface, and it might be done on such a thing as that bench, which is produced by constant use; the edge would be wore away in the manner this is; these blanks after being finished in the way I have described, would be heated over a fire made with charcoal, which here is charcoal produced.</p>
               <p>Court. For what purpose is that - A. To soften the metal preparatory to the colour, it takes the colour the better; the blanks are then put into a pickle of aqua fortis; and the aqua fortis alone upon a blank of this description, would raise the colour of silver, as the blank contains a certain portion of silver incorporated with the base metal; I satisfied myself in that particular. I took one of the finished sixpences, I entirely divested it of the silver on the surface, and I coloured it again with the assistance of aqua fortis; that likewise fits this punch, apparently cut out of a plate; the blanks after remaining a certain time in the pickle of aqua fortis are taken out and put into cold water, they then appear quite black; the next thing to be used then is cream of tartar, which is here produced; which being rubbed on the surface it takes off the black, and then the silver colour appears; the appearance of the silver being very bright, in order to make it appear as if they had been in circulation, then the grease and blacking in the oyster shell is used to take off the brightness, and to make it appear as if they had been in circulatation. With respect the small letters, that is not at all necessary, it is only to make a greater deception, as many people are in the habit of marking of money.</p>

               <p>Q. Are some of these marked with the small letters that was found - A. Yes; I compared them with some of the little punches, I found them to correspond upon examination; I accompanied Shrubsole upon the third search, as he mentioned some things, which I thought were material to be produced, as this bench, which appears to have been worked by some person, with this coin that has been produced.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to Shrubsole. Produce the coin that you took out of the prisoner's pocket - A. That is the coin that I first took out of the prisoner's pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Powell. The bench appears to have been used with aqua fortis, which has been used in colouring of metal.</p>
               <p>Q. Now looking at that money, Mr. Powell, tell me whether these three sixpences are finished for circulation, are they such as a coiner would make compleately for circulation - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at these others, here are seven others - A. They are finished for circulation; they have the blacking upon them, which I mentioned to be the last process; they appear to be recently done; they have never been in circulation.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these of the same sort of the three that were produced before - A. Yes; save only the appearance of the blacking, they are exactly the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the others - A.These are blanks in a preparatory state for colouring; they are sixpences which are quite prepared for the colouring; here are two which are not in quite so forward a state; six are perfectly finished for colouring, and the two which are not in quite so forward a state, having only the edges filed, but not the surface scoured.</p>
               <p>Court. What are all this coin - A. They are all sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the purpose of coining be compleatly carried on by the articles found - A. Yes: the whole is compleat.</p>
               <p>Q. Those that are finished, and those in a less finished state - do they all appear to be done from the same materials - A.They do.</p>
               <p>Q. Those that have the appearance of grease upon them, do they appear to have been recently done - A.They appear to have been very recently coloured.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How long have you been acquainted with this process that you have been describing - A. About fifteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly acquainted with it - A. Perfectly so; I have seen a great many hundred cases.</p>
               <p>Court. Are they such as would pass current for good sixpences - A. Certainly.</p>

               <p>Q. You know Messrs. Longman's and Dickinson's. - Yes, it is of the other side of Ludgate church; he was coming from their warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came to Passley, what did he say to Passley. - A. He asked him to take them two reams of paper for him to Goldsmith street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that place. - A. Near the King's printing office near Gough square. Passley asked him if he did not know the way; he said if you do not, if you will go with me and pay me I will shew you. Then they parted from the street and went into Mr. Temple's wine vaults the corner of Fleet street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Randall before. - A. I have seen him come out of Longman's and Dickinson's, I knew he was their porter. They did not remain long in the wine vaults; Randall came out first and Passley almost immediately followed without any reams of paper, he went in again and took out one; he took it down to Mr. Goddard's, wax and tallow chandler; he went into two or three shops first; when he came out of Mr. Goddard's he left the paper behind him. I then followed him up to Harp alley; and then I came up to my stand, I saw him come up to the wine vaults and take out the other ream of paper; he went to Mr. Goddards with it; I saw Mr. Goddard receive the paper and give him some money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him join Randall afterwards. - A. No, I did not; then I told the officer what I had seen, and that I would go with him and shew him from where the property was stolen; I went to Mr. Longman's and gave the information, and afterwards I went to Mr. Goddard's shop door, but I did not go in.</p>
               <p>Randall. - Q. Did you see me give the paper to Passley. - A. No, you went into the liquor shop the corner of Fleet market, you had the paper then.</p>
               <p>Passley Q. Did you see me receive the paper from Randall A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the paper to have been stolen then. - A. by his saying take the paper to Goldsmith street, I suspected it.</p>
               <p>Passley. If I had known the paper to have been stolen, I should have concealed it.</p>
               <p>MR. GODDARD. - Mr. Gurney. On Saturday the 30th of April, did the prisoner Passley bring any paper to your house. - A. Yes, two reams of paper. I had seen the prisoner twice before that. He came to me that morning, he asked me if I wanted any paper; I asked him the price, he said twelve shillings, six shillings a ream; I asked him how he came by it, he said he had it by the waggon from the country, it was returned for goods sent; he appeared like a waggoner; I had no suspicion of him.</p>
               <p>Q. He brought you two reams and you paid him twelve shillings. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Shortly after Mr. Ford, Mr. Longman's clerk, came and you gave him the paper. - A. I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Last Saturday you had been to Isleworth - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to the King's Arms public house in that parish - A. Yes, I was in company with the man that I worked with; after I had been there some time I saw the prisoner; I went away at the same time with him. Nothing happened till we came to the Rails End, then he went his way and I went my way; in less than a quarter of an hour I heard a voice crying halloo! I answered; when I came a little further, he said come here; when I came up to him he was sitting down and his hat was over his eyes; I asked him what he wanted I lifted the hat over his eyes to see who he was; it fell down by his side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put it down by his side or did it fall down. - A. I put it down by the side of him; he got up with vengeance to strike me; I was afraid, and started, and just below the boat house he knocked me down; that is fifty yards from the place; there he used me very ill and knocked me down; and robbed me of my watch; I got up and followed him to get my watch; he knocked me down again; I got up again, ran after him thinking to get my watch; down he knocked me again; he started and came to the Campsot, then he knocked me down again.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times did he knock you down. - A. I cannot say. it was a great many times.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this. - A. Last Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Are those marks on your face from the blows that he gave you. - A. Yes; he knocked me down. I laid hold of the pallisades or else he would have thrown me into the Thames.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this after he had taken your watch. - A. Yes. I followed him and when he came to the meadows he knocked me down; I begged for mercy, I said do not kill me. I halloaed out murder for assistance; he fixed me down, he clapped his hands on the back of my neck and pushed me down, and he put his knee into my loins: it was enough to squeeze me all to pieces. Just after that a gentlemen coming from Richmond to Iseworth came to my assistance; the prisoner made off; we attempted to pursue him but he got away from us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Walford. What time was it you went to the public house. - A. Just before eight o'clock; I stopped till after eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you drink in the course of that time. - A. I cannot tell you exactly. There were three of us in company.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not half a dozen pots of beer. - A. No; it might be four.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid for all the beer. - A. We paid between us.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you obliged to pay for a pot against your inclination. - A. No, I was not against my inclination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the landlord compel you to pay for a pot of beer when the reckoning was settled.</p>
               <p>Court. Why do not you answer the question. - A. A pot of beer was brought and I paid for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. It comes to that at last that you was obliged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010014"/>to pay for it. - A. I did pay for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You followed the prisoner to Rails End. - A. That was my way home.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to Rails End, did you not say he had used you very ill in making you pay for a pot of beer. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not you take his hat and tear it about and strike him - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear that. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you never heard of any such a thing as a reward for a person convicted of a highway robbery - A. I have heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much do you expect to get, answer the question - How much do you expect to get if you convict the prisoner. - A. Forty pound.</p>
               <p>Q. When he kneeled upon you why did not you resist, you are as strong a man as him. - A. He is a great deal stronger than I.</p>
               <p>SEDDON BAMFORD. - Mr. Adolphus. At twelve o'clock at night were you coming from Richmond to Isleworth. - A. As near as I can recollect I was in a meadow going from the bridge towards the Rails End Ferry; about the middle of the meadow, as near as I can recollect, I heard some desperate blows and cry of murder.</p>
               <p>Court. What time of night was it. - A.It might be twelve o'clock. I ran towards the place, in my way there stood a tree; I retired behind that tree for a few seconds to see whether there was a number of them or not; I could see nobody standing up, I saw something down in the meadow, it appeared dark and looked about this high (witness describing); then I saw a man get up and stand straight up, whether it was my voice that occasioned his getting up I cannot say; then he stooped and ran stooping away; I ran and halloed murder; as I ran I saw the prosecutor getting up and he ran the same way that the man run: I lost sight of the person that was running away; I could not possibly swear to the person of the prisoner. I ran towards a farm yard in search of the person of the prisoner; I could not find him; I returned back to see if I could find him any where in the meadow; the prosecutor came up to me.</p>

               <p>Mr. Adolphus. What state did he appear to be in. - A. He was in a very bad state, he could hardly walk; I ordered him to take hold of my arm and support himself; I advised him to go back with me to Isleworth. When we came to a light in the town I saw a great deal of blood about him and his eye knocked up.</p>
               <p>Court. The man that you had seen run away you do not know whether it was the prisoner or not. - A. I do not.</p>

Another constable present, he put the clothes down and saw the prisoner's feet; I called a soldier, who assisted us; we secured the prisoner; I told the other men to hold him while I looked to see if I could find any bloody clothes or the watch; I found nothing in that room; I searched the garret, between the bed and the sacking, I found this shirt.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Please you, my lord, there were me and my two comrades that were working together; we went into the King's Arms at Isleworth, to pay for beer that we had in the week; after we had been drinking there about an hour, in came the prosecutor and forced himself into our company; we had three pots of beer during the time he was in our company; as we were all going out of doors, my partner said here is four of us to drink three pots of beer, I think this man has a right to be a pot as he has been drinking part of ours; he said he would not, he had no money the landlord came up and said to him you owe me some money for tea and beer you had in the morning; the prosecutor said he would not pay him; I said he has been drinking our beer, we want him to be a pot and he will not; the landlord locked the door and kept us all in till such time the man had paid for what he had in the morning; then my prosecutor said is the pot of beer to come in; I said, yes; he said send it in, I will pay for it; the pot of beer was brought in and all four of us drank it up; then the door was opened and all of us went out; I wished one of my neighbour's good night, he went away home; my wife, and myself, and the other mate that was at work with me, we went down the street together. In the middle of the street I wished him good night. The prosecutor still kept following us, saying that we were a parcel of good for nothing rascals to impose upon him to make him pay for a pot of beer; I said my friend the pot of beer is settled for, drop it; there is no further to say about it; I said my friend the best place for you is on board a man of war; he came up and gave me a thump on my head and knocked me down in the road, I got up, pulled off my jacket and he and I fell a boxing; we were all in liquor. With the blood that came from my nose and from his head, that is the reason of my shirt being in the condition it is in; the prosecutor said he had enough; I picked up my jacket, my wife and I came home; coming along the road he followed us very sharp, and at the corner of a public house I bid him good night; I said good night my friend, he made no answer; I said to my wife go in doors, I must do my occasions; I set down by the corner of the wall, to do my business; in the mean time I heard somebody on the other side of the bridge halloo out halloa; I answered him; the prosecutor came back and says halloo; he came up to me and lifted up my hat; he put it down;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010015"/>he took the hat afterwards and ran away with it; I says to him as he was going over the bridge, my friend you have got my hat; he said he had not; as soon as I had buttoned up my small clothes, I pursued him; he dropped the hat, I picked it up and returned home.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Had you been drinking any liquor with the prisoner - A. Yes; I drank some of his and he drank some of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been that day. - A. I had been up to Mr. Munn's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive your wages - A. Yes, I received eleven shillings and tenpence; I put it in my pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he take any of your money away - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your watch - A. No.</p>

On the 13th of February the two prisoners came into our shop, and enquired for an article which we had not got, according to the pattern that she had in her hands. I told her we could make the article if they would wait for them; they said it was for a gentleman, they would go and enquire, and perhaps return; the woman said she would buy a pair of half stockings, some people call them socks; I shewed her some and she bought a pair and paid for them; she gave me half a crown, I had to return her sixpence; we have two tills, I had to run from one counter to the other; I fetched sixpence and gave to her; prior to that I had sold twelve pair of stockings to a gentleman; I was putting them up intending to send them home, when the prisoners came into the house. I rolled them round with the paper they were then in, with intent to serve the prisoners; I pushed them near to the end of the counter, there were more goods on the counter; these silk stockings laid next to the prisoner; when I had given them the change, and they had gone out of the shop, I missed the dozen of silk stockings from the counter, that I had rolled round with the paper; I ran out of the house to look after the prisoners, I did not see any more of them till the 14th of April; I caused them to be apprehended in Covent Garden.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Walford. You never saw the prisoner in the house before - A. No. They were in the shop about ten minutes, talking about the hose and looking them out.</p>
               <p>Q. Two months had elapsed before you saw them - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A number of people come in the shop - what made you recognize them - A.He had a light great coat on, and a hand basket in his hand; he had that coat on when he was taken, and the hand basket.</p>
               <p>Court. That hand basket was convenient to put any thing in - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These twelve pair of silk stockings were sold - A. Yes, to Mr. Scott, but they were not delivered; we were obliged to buy another dozen to deliver to him.</p>
               <p>MR. ROWLAND. I am a friend of Mr. Hummel's.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in his shop to assist on the 13th of February - A. I was out when the prisoners came in the shop; I found them in the shop when I returned, as I walked through the shop I saw the man take a parcel off the counter; I am positive to the man; he put it into the hand basket he had in his hand; the woman had a parcel in her hand, which she put in her muff when they went away; the first witness said, I will see if the hose are all right; after the prisoners were gone he missed twelve pair of silk stockings.</p>

About a quarter of an hour before that I locked it myself; I left in the room a quantity of things, among which was some tablecloths in a basket; finding the door partly open, I went up to the door, I said who is there, I pushed the door open, I perceived the prisoner just behind the door, apparently putting things into a sack, down by the side of him, which was the tablecloths out of the basket he was putting in the sack.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your street door open - A. Yes; it is a French eating house; when I pushed the door open, I said what do you want here; he made answer, and said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010016"/>he is a coming; I said who is coming; he took me by the shoulders with one hand and apparently wishing to put me in the room that he might get out.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with the sack - A. He dropped it down by the side of him, the sack did not belong to my mistress. I did not go in the room, I kept on the landing place where I was. I collared him with both my hands tight; I said you are a rogue and a thief; instantly he gave me two hard blows on my head, he gave me another blow on my head and another in my face, all with his fist, he gave me a black eye when he gave me the last blow in my face; I let go of him because it hurt me very much; I called out for assistance as loud as I could; when I let go of him he ran down stairs as fast as he could run, and I after him; he got half way out of the passage, my master came out of the kitchen and caught him, and with the assistance of the gentleman in the parlour he was secured; after the officer came I went up with them and looked at the sack; there were seven tablecloths put in the sack. The officer took the sack and the tablecloths.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure the tablecloths were in the basket when you locked the door - A Yes, ten tablecloths; the next day my mistress picked up three pick lock keys on the stairs.</p>

            . I was sent for, I went into the parlour where the prisoner was setting; I handcuffed him, and then I took him up stairs with me; I examined the bag, the mouth of it was open; this is the bag, there were seven tablecloths in it. I took the bag and the tablecloths, I have had them in my custody ever since. Here is a key that was found on the stairs, it opened the door.</p>

               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went up the street to enquire for a brother in law of mine; the street door was open, I went up one pair of stairs; I knocked at the door, I saw the door of a jarr, nobody answered. I went in and came out again; this young woman asked me what I wanted, I told her I had made a mistake. I was wrong in the house. I might shove by her, the young woman seemed to be falling of one side; I was going down stairs when I found I was in the wrong house.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you, a married man and perfectly sober, to go to her apartment - A. I cannot give any account for it. After I was in her apartment some time I found her hand in my pocket; I found that she had taken a one pound bank note, and two seven shilling pieces; when she took her hand out I told her that she had robbed me of my money.</p>
               <p>Q. That I suppose was no more than you expected - A. Yes, people do not expect to be robbed. I told her that she had robbed me of a one pound note and two seven shilling pieces, I saw her stoop down and put something into her stocking; I asked her to take her stocking off to see whether she had the quantity of money there that I had lost; she pulled the stocking down and one seven shilling piece fell out she put her foot upon it; I got it away; I asked her for the remainder, she immediately took up a poker and knocked me down. I got up and took the poker away from her; then she took a knife out of her pocket. she swore she would stick me if I offered to say another word. I got the knife away from her after some time, then she called three or four men's names and put the candle out, and by the assistance of these men I suppose she was got out through a trap door into the street; it was sometime before I could find my way out; the room was down stairs; they shut the door below. I was obliged to go up stairs and go out that way; when I got out in the street I saw the prisoner standing with some men; I saw the patrol, I gave her in charge.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any man in her room did you - A. No. She was taken to the watchhouse, nothing was found upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you loose after all - A. One pound note and two seven shilling pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. I perceive according to your own account, you were strong enough to resist her upon different occasions that you have mentioned, I want to know how you came to let her take the money away - A. I could not prevent it.</p>
               <p>Q. You were strong enough to take the knife away, then why could not you take the money from her; you have indicted her for her life, by taking violently and forcibly from you. I want to know why you did not prevent her from taking it. - A. I could not.</p>

            . I am a patrol. In going my round I heard a great noise in Parker street, Drury lane; when I came there, there were from fifty to a hundred people; I saw the prisoner in the crowd; the prosecutor came out of the house he had been confined in, he gave charge of the prisoner for assaulting and robbing of him, his face was scratched and tore as if with nails and all over blood; the blow of the poker was under his hat. I took the woman to the watchhouse, she was searched, I found nothing on her but to the amount of sixpence. The prosecutor had a seven shilling piece that he said he took from the woman after she robbed him, and he had the open knife that he took from the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober - A. He was sober; he told the constable where he lived, and that he had a wife and family.</p>

Please you my lord about eleven<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010017"/>o'clock at night I went for a kettle of water at Queen-street pump, this man asked me to go to a public house; he said I should have something to drink; I said, no; he followed me home, he asked me to go for something to drink; he said he had four children and a wife, he gave me a shilling, I went for a quartern of gin, and I went down stairs; he said, I am robbed; he opened his breeches and there fell out a seven shilling piece; I said I have a right to half of that; he took me by the neck and said he would kill me; he half choaked me; he was half intoxicated. I am innocent of the charge.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor. When you saw this woman first, had she her kettle or any thing with water in her hand - A. No, nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How many children have you. - A. Four; I never told her; I have five now; I had four then.</p>

               <p>ROBERT COLTON. Q. Do you live with Mr. Wheatley. - A. Yes. On the 14th of May, about half past five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner take seven pair of shoes, which were hanged at the door of my master's shop for sale; I was in the shop behind the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner see you. - A. No. He unhooked the shoes, I ran after him; I never lost sight of him; as soon as I called out stop thief he dropped the shoes from behind his coat at the corner of Berner's street; I did not stop to pick up the shoes; I kept running after the prisoner till I saw my master coming up Charles-street. The prisoner ran till he dropped the shoes, and then he walked till he got into Wardour-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master was coming up Wardour-street, was not he. - A. Yes; my master saw me close behind the prisoner. He caught hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You are perfectly sure you saw him drop the shoes. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Who picked them up. - A. I cannot say. These are the shoes; they were hanging up by the string; the prisoner threatened me that if I did not leave him, he would fall upon me and kill me. There were two of them; the prisoner took the shoes, the other was looking at some things; I followed the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wheatley. In consequence of information I received when I went home I pursued the track I was informed they went; I turned down Holland-street, and met the prisoner coming out of Wardour-street into Holland-street and the boy close behind him. I took him by the collar and he was taken to the watchhouse. The shoes were brought back to my shop; I believe my wife picked them up.</p>

On the 7th of April, about half past one o'clock in the afternoon, John Kenton, alias Brooks, he is well known by different names, I saw him break my window with a knife, at the same time I saw him draw the three toy watches out of the hole that he had made; the hole was not large enough for him to put his hand in; I went out and took him, I took him to Worship-street office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the watches upon him. - A. No, I did not; there were two more in company with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you saw this. - A. I am sure I saw this.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the watches there soon before this. - A. I had put them there a few hours before that; I have never seen them since.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen him lurking about before this happened had you. - A. No; when I took him he said he had not been near the window; he attempted to get away from me, but I held him so close I prevented him.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the value of your toy watches. - A. Seven shillings each.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, many years; she is a chair woman. On the 19th of April, between six and seven o'clock, the prisoner came to me and her sister along with her, she told me she had a good find; she said if I would let her sit down she would shew me; she pulled out a black leather purse and desired me to look at what was in the inside; she said she had changed a one pound note; I looked in the purse. I found three one pound notes, a two pound, and a forty pound bank note; she said she found it in Oxford street; I told her it was a good find, it was of consequence, as it was such a sum of money there was do doubt it would be advertised; they agreed to leave it my hands; they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010019"/>did leave it in my hands I told them after they left it in my hands that if there was an advertisement for it, I would wish them to give it up; I said I dare say there would be a ten pound reward for it, and that would do her more good than if she had kept the whole; I told her I would look after the newspapers, and when it was so I would go with her and see that she had the bounty; the next morning as soon as I came to my business her sister came up to me at six o'clock, I had not been with her two minutes before I saw the prisoner and another person with her, that I did not approve of; they both came to me, and the prisoner asked me for her property; I told her that as she made a demand of it I should give it her; I was very sorry she had altered her disposition, I would have no more to do with it; I fetched the money from my home; they came to me at my stall, there I left them. On my return I met Saunders and his wife; Saunders asked me to let him look at the notes; I had a better opinion of him than them drunken brutes; I delivered to Saunders the leather purse, containing the three one pound notes, one two, and a forty pound note; this was Wednesday morning I delivered it up; on the Thursday it was advertised; I led such an abuseful life by the woman after I delivered it up, that I could not do my business; then I went and found the young man that belonged to it; from thence I went to Marlborough street and related the matter to a magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Walford. You told us you knew the prisoner - I believe you know the prisoner can neither read nor write - A. I believe she is a stranger to both.</p>

            . Q. You are brother in law to the prisoner, are you not - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember meeting Sedgely - A. I met him on Wednesday morning close to his stall; he gave me the purse, which he said he received from my sister in law; I never took the purse out of his hand, nor opened it, till I saw my sister in law; she asked me for it, and I gave it her.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Walford. Can you read and write - A. Yes, both.</p>

               <p>Q. Then when this purse came into your hands how came you not to open it - you did not suppose there was any value in it, did you - A. I did not; he did not tell me the value.</p>
               <p>Court to Sedgely. Did you tell Saunders what value was in the purse - A. I did, I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was advertised the next day, which was Thursday - did you give any information to the prisoner that it was advertised - A. I did; her brother in law was with me at the time that I saw the advertisement; it was in the mouths of every body almost; I told Nixon the same day; I told her the same day, upon her saying that she had not got the money, that if she did not content herself about it, I would go and settle the business at once; when I found she was not satisfied, I went and let the prosecutor know.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if it had not been for that you would not have discovered it - A. Yes, I would, because it was advertised in a pitiful manner, that it was lost front a poor man, if he did not get it, it would be his total ruin.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. You tell me your money was safe at between four or five o'clock on Tuesday afternoon - you went from Glocester place where you lodge to Green street, Glovesnor square; in going to Green street did you go near Oxford road - A. Yes, I went across Oxford street.</p>
               <p>Q.You do not recollect meeting any crowd of people - A. No, nor any person coming near me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find you had lost it at Green street, or when you returned to Glocester place - A. I found I had lost it just after I came out of Green street.</p>
               <p>JAMES KENNEDY. I went from Marlborough street to apprehend the prisoner, on the 22nd of April, about ten o'clock in the morning; the prisoner was rather worse for liquor; I searched her pockets, I found nothing but a few halfpence, I asked her what she had done with the young man's forty odd pounds; she said she had spent it; I asked her which way she could spend so much money in so few days; she said she paid ten pounds to an undertaker for burying her husband; I asked her where the undertaker lived; she could not tell.</p>
               <p>Q. You found none of the money on her - A. No; the purse was never recovered.</p>

I believe that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010020"/>was all, to the best of my knowledge; the next morning a young woman came and asked me to take a walk with her; I left a two pound note and a prize ticket in the prisoner's drawer, in his room where he slept; that was about ten o'clock in the morning; I went out with this young woman, and when I came home again I went to the drawer to look for my two pound note, it was gone; the prisoner was then setting in an arm chair; I said Mr. Tomling have you got my two pound note; he gave me a great many abusive names, and got up and knocked me down, and then his wife got up and knocked me down, tore my cap, and my handkerchief; then I went to Worship street, there was no magistrate sitting; I came home to the prisoners place, the door was padlocked: I went to the White Horse facing the prisoner's house; the prisoner was sitting there with a pint of beer and a pipe; I said Mr. Tomling have you got my two pound note; he told he had not, d - d me several times; Mr. Bridges the headborough came, he told him if he had got the young woman's note to give it her; he said he had got no two pound note nor the worth of a two pound note; the officer took him to the watchhouse, searched him; in his left hand breeches pocket he found the two pound note.</p>

On the 14th of May, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was sent for to the White Horse in Wheeler street; when I came there the prosecutrix gave me charge of the prisoner; in his presence she told me she had lost a two pound note; he said no such a thing; I told him if he had got the note, he had better give it to the prosecutrix; he said he had got no notes; I took him to the watchhouse; after having him there a little while, I searched him; in his left hand pocket I found this two pound note; he was very tipsey when I took him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I know this is the note that I took at Somerset house by the marks here; there is a wrinkle in the paper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When she went to the navy office to receive the money, my wife went along with her; she received nine pounds odd, she gave her the notes to bring home; when they got home and had a mouthful of victuals, then she wanted to know what she was in my debt; fourteen weeks I supported her, besides money that I had laid out for her at different times, that made the whole six pounds thirteen shillings and seven pence halfpenny; she said she could spare me no more than five pounds; I told her I did not desire no more at. that time, because she would want some money to buy a few clothes to make herself decent to get herself into service; she has informed your lordship that she paid me a five pound note; she had no five pound note amongst them; she was paid in three two pound notes, and three ones, she paid me two two pound notes, and a one pound note I went over the way to pay a score at the public house, I paid the landlord a two pound note and a one pound note; and the other two pound note was to take some things out of pawn, that I had pledged to support her before she went away; she had been drinking gin; then she went to her landlady where she lodged to pay her; she paid that woman a two pound note, she I believe paid it in a mistake for a one pound note, and after she recollected herself, she went and got it changed; she kept drinking that night, went to Well street playhouse, came home with a soldier; she went out and got more gin; the next morning she came again at six o'clock, then she was so drunk that she began to cascade over the bed. A young woman of the same fraternity as herself called upon her, they set off together, and went drinking at the public house; she came to me about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was over the way at the public house having a pint of beer; she said Mr. Tomling I want my note; I said what note, I never saw the note; she said I will have it, if you have not got it Mrs. Tomling has; I said I cannot tell what she knows, I thought the woman was joking; the officer was dubious of taking the charge, he thought it was all fun that was going forward.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you a labouring man - A. No, I cannot labour, I have lost the use of my left arm; I let out lodgings. On the 26th of May, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the house. I heard some small noise, and I went to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your wife in the house at the time - A. Yes; about thirty yards from the door, I saw a man putting his shoes on.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, did you see him. - A. Yes; I saw him putting his shoes on, he was sitting; after he had put his shoes on, he had got a basket, he put a green apron over it and tucked it all round to cover it; he pulled up his small clothes, and took this basket and walked away; I returned into the house, and shut the door. I turned my head and missed the carpet out of the little hall; I called to my wife to ask her about the carpet; she told me she knew nothing of it; I pursued the prisoner and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner before - A. I had seen him before; I hit the prisoner on the side of his head, and then I took hold of his collar and brought him back to my house with the property with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he carry the basket or you - A. He carried it himself; I took him to the beadle and delivered him and the basket and all.</p>
               <p>Q. You examined the basket did not you - A. Yes; the basket contained a carpet, shirt, stocking, one pair mine and two pair my wife's, and a tin ink stand; I knew them to be my property; there were some rags also.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me you heard a small noise - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you - A. I was in an adjoining room to where he took the things.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose the passage into the adjoining room is by the hall - A. Yes; the street door leads into the hall.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010021"/>Q. How long before you heard the noise had you been in the hall - A. A few minutes before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the carpet then in the hall - A. Yes, in a chair rolled up; the other things were in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q.I suppose you go from the hall into the kitchen - A.Yes. the kitchen door is always open.</p>
               <p>Q. What room was your wife in - A. She was up stairs in the garret, in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was in the hall was the street door open or shut - A. Shut, I am pretty certain of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Being the street door, you generally keep it shut A. Always, except any person is in the hall or is coming in.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you pretty sure that no person had come in the hall sometime before you heard a noise - A. I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. How does your street door fasten - A. With a spring lock.</p>
               <p>Q. How does it open on the outside - A. With a key; when we come in we shut it too, it locks, and when we want to come in we open it with a key.</p>
               <p>Q. A stranger then who had not the key must open it by force or with a false key - A. Yes; there is no latch at all; he must come in by a false key or by force.</p>

Yes, and a basket, I have had it in my care ever since; this basket was searched before he went to the watchhouse; Mr. Waring recognized his property; I searched him at the watchhouse, I found a number of pick lock keys in the prisoner's pocket; there is a turnscrew, phosphorus bottle, matches and every thing for house breaking; I found all these things in his pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. You found your place broken open. - A. Yes; the window was broken; he had got in by lifting up the sash; he broke the window all to pieces in getting out; it is a large sash; I found my door safe, the key was in my pocket. In the drawers there were a pair of sheets, five gowns, three petticoats, a shift, a pair of stockings, and a silk handkerchief, they were all taken out.</p>

               <p>Q.How do you know that. - A. Because he got out of the window. I left the door locked and found it locked; I observed the window; before I went out I bolted one of the bolts of the window shutter before I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. You keep no servant. - A. None at all. Going out at that time of the day, I did not imagine any thing of the kind. I am a poor old woman.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he break the glass. - A. Yes; then he broke out the wood of the bottom sash and throwed himself out; the moment he got out I collared him and stopped him, and

               <p>ELIZABETH PEACHCY. I am shopwoman to Mr. James on Holborn hill. On Friday the 13th of May, between the hours of three and five in the afternoon, the two prisoners came into the shop, the youngest of them asked for ribbon; the lace box was on the counter, she took up some lace and asked me the price of it; I told them it was too dear for them. I took up some other lace and told them the price; they asked me if I had none cheaper; I told one of them no; one of them walked out of the shop and the other followed; I did not shew them any ribbons.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there nobody else in the shop - A. There were three or four customers on the other side of the shop, Mr. James and a shopman.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived there - A. Three months.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had looked pretty sharp you might have seen what passed - A. I was paying attention to my business.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing done by them to take off your attention - A. I looked at them.</p>
               <p>Q. They did not send you to the other end of the shop to get lace - A. No.</p>

            , Newport street. On the 13th of May I was coming by Mr. James's door, I saw one of the prisoners drop part of the lace; she picked it up and walked on a few steps, and the other prisoner came up by the side of her; she gave the lace to her, and walked across the way; she went as far as Swan yard, and the other followed her; I went into Mr. Jame's shop, and told the shopman of it; the shopman and I followed them, I pointed to him the person that had got the lace, her name is Martin; she run across the street to Fleet market; we brought her back to Mr. James's shop; a constable going by brought Lyons; I could see the lace in Martin's bosom, she took it out in Mr. James's shop.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified)</p>
               <p>Martin's Defence. I went into that gentleman's shop to buy a quarter of an ounce of thread; a tall young woman served me, not that lady; at the corner of Fleet market I picked up the lace, close by the grocer's shop, and a young man tapped me on the shoulder, he said I had picked up something that did not belong to me; I said if it belonged to him he might have it; the street keeper came up to me and took me; I never saw this young woman before; she came up when somebody catched hold of her.</p>
               <p>Lyon's Defence. My mother goes out with a barrow; I asked her if she would buy me a ribbon; yes - she said, when she came home if she had money enough; she had not money enough, I went and pledged something for a shilling; I was coming by Mr. James's shop, I asked the price of ribbon, they told me; coming out of the shop I saw a mob at the corner of Fleet market, I went over and somebody laid hold of me, and said I was the person that was in the shop too; this young woman, I never saw her before to my knowledge; I know no more about it than any of you do.</p>
               <p>Lyon called no witness to character.</p>
               <p>Martin called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>The case was stated by Mr. Fielding.</p>
               <p>MATTHEW BEECHER. - Mr. Knapp. You are a glazier - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner - A. A serjeant in the guards, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you employed to do any work in the duke of York's chapel, Jeffry's buildings - A. Yes, at Tothill street, Westminster, in the year 1806.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make out any bill for that - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that bill, and tell me whether that is your hand writing - A. Yes. that is my bill.</p>
               <p>A. What are the charges that are contained in that bill - A. Three sash squares; nine shillings and nine pence; twelve ditto, fifteen shillings; twenty two squares of lead, five shillings and sixpence; that is all. The sum total is 1 l. 10 s. 3 d.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any recollection without looking at your book, whether that is the sum that you delivered in originally - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where consists the alteration to what it was originally - A. When I wrote the bill out it was one pound and three pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any alteration in the number of sashes - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Does there appear upon looking at it any alteration - A. Yes, the 2 is made 12.</p>
               <p>Q. It was 2 ditto, and now it appears 12 - A. Yes; it was 2 sashes, and now it appears to be 12 sashes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the other alteration - A. A 1 before the 5.</p>
               <p>Q. So that there are three alterations - A. Yes; it is now 1 l. 10 s. 3 d. whereas it was before 1 l. 0 s. 3 d.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir. take this book in your hand, and tell me whose book that is - A.Mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the insertion there your hand writing - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you make the minute of what appears there - A. That is my wife's writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not write it -</p>
               <p>COURT. You said first of all that is your hand writing in the book - A. It is my book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The question is whether the insertion of the bill in that book is your hand writing - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. The bill in the book, or the bill out of the book - A. Both.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. When did you make the entry of that bill in your book - A. I wrote it from my state, as I generally take off my work.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the entry in the book correspond with the account you have given in court - what is the entry in the book - A. One pound and three pence; - three sash squares, 9 s. 9 d.; twenty two squares in lead, 5 s. 6 d.; two sash squares, 5 s.</p>
               <p>Q. From looking at your book, and looking at that bill you have in your hand, are you certain that the alteration took place after you had been paid the money - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. How much have you been paid - A. I have not been paid.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not receive the money, but your wife did - A. Yes. I do not know that she gave it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when the receipt was given - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. This was in the beginning of the year 1806 - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you have not any distinct memory of it without looking at the book - A. I remember the amount of the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your memory is better this sessions than last sessions - A. I remember that.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you have a perfect memory of all your bills - A. I have a very shallow memory except any thing that happened soon.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a very shallow memory, but you remember this distinctly - this is an exception - then from January 1806, down to the beginning of the present year, you call soon - A. I do not call it soon.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was the enquiry made - A. About fifteen months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. You think you remember this - that you did not receive the money - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. It is received the 2nd of January 1806 - that is your wife's writing - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.It should be 1807 - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not by at that payment - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not recollect at all the transaction of receiving the money of your wife - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Mr. Beecher, can you venture to swear that these figures which have been inserted are not yours - A. No, they are not mine.</p>
               <p>COURT. You are sure the different 1's are not your hand writing - A. They are not.</p>
               <p>Q. You speak to three 1's, there is a 1 before the 2,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010025"/>making it 12; and 1 before the 5, making it 15; and the 1 before the 0, making it 10 - these three are not your writing - A. They are not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you receive any money of the prisoner, Mr. Moore - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the sum that you received - A. One pound and three pence was the amount of the bill. I did not take the halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. You received one pound, not taking the halfpence - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember how the bill stood with respect to the 12 ditto - A. To the best of my recollection it was 2.</p>
               <p>Court. The 12 was 2 - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Richardson. The charge for that which is now 15, how was that at that time - A. I think it was 5.</p>
               <p>Q. In the sum total, which is now one pound ten shillings and three pence, I think you before said was one pound and threepence - A. Yes it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the book, that bill is your husband's hand writing - A. Yes; it is one pound and threepence.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a receipt at the bottom of that, whose hand writing is that - A. That is mine; I wrote that soon after I received the one pound; I cannot say whether it was the same day, but I am inclined to think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver the receipt when you wrote it to the bill to the prisoner - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Now, Mrs. Beecher you say you think that the figure 1 was not before the 2, and the 1 before the 5, you think that was not there, but you will not venture to swear it - A. I think it was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Because you find your bill is not that, is not that one of your reasons - A.If it had not been enquired about early, I should not have recollected any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. My question is this - whether part of the opinion you form upon the subject does not arise upon comparing it with the book, and seeing what it ought to be - A. I cannot say to the contrary, had I not the book to look at, but it might be so.</p>
               <p>Q. You now think that these figures were not there at the time you signed it - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not suppose that we put any sort of blame upon you, your belief is partly founded upon looking at the book, not knowing what it ought to be - A. I should not have recollected what is in the book without looking at the book.</p>
               <p>Q. I am not asking you with respect to the book; you do not remember, I dare say, whether or no you read the bill over line by line - A. I think I looked at the bill at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. The question is, whether you have any recollection of reading it over article by article at the time - A. No, I do not know.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect at about what time it was produced to you by the prisoner - A. I cannot take upon me to say to a day or two, whether it was in the latter end of December or the beginning of January I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that accompt was produced to you by the prisoner, was the voucher produced to you. - A. The voucher accompanied the bill and was brought at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the voucher's being produced, and correspondence appearing between the bill and the voucher, you signed it. - A. I speak upon the bill, not upon the voucher; I speak upon the general accompt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You was not at home when the vouchers were entered. - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner at the bar. - A. For ten years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever known a man in his situation of life, who ever bore a better character. - A. To the best of my knowledge no man in the regiment ever bore a better character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. At the time of the examination of the voucher that these tick marks were put on, did that take place after it had been left at your house. - A. Yes; it might have been left there two or three days; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010026"/>prisoner was there.</p>
               <p>Q. When you delivered that accompt to the prisoner, for what purpose was it you delivered it to the prisoner. - A. In order to be sent to the chaplain general, Mr. Gamble.</p>
               <p>REVEREND JOHN GAMBLE. - Mr. Fielding. You are chaplain general to the war office - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The chapel in Tothill street, Westminste, is under the direction of his royal highness the duke of York - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The expences thereof are defrayed by the war office - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive at any time this particular packet from Moore - A. Yes; I received the half yearly accompt from Moore; they were left upon my desk in the war office.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Harman inspects the bills under you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You deliver it into the war office - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was stopped in the war office - A. Yes. (The bill and receipt read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I declare before God and this court, that I never altered any bill.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

On Monday the 2nd of April, about six o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner at the bar, in company with another woman, came into the shop and asked me to shew them some caps; while the other woman was looking at some caps, I observed the prisoner pulling the things on the counter; the other woman paid for the cap, and they both went out.</p>
               <p>Q. What was on the counter - A. There were shawls and other things on the counter; before they had been out two minutes they returned again, and the other woman desired me to shew them some ginghams for frocks; the prisoner took her apron up as soon as she got to the counter and just looked at it, she threw it over some things on the counter; I observed her putting her hand under her apron and pulling some things off the counter; I shewed the gingham to the other person; she bought half a quarter of a yard; she gave me six pence, it came to three pence; when I went to the till for the halfpence, I told Mr. Janeway that I thought the prisoner had been taking some thing off the counter. I laid hold of her immediately; I told her that I thought she had something belonging to us; she asked me what I meaned, and shook herself, and the two shawls dropped from under her clothes; while I got over the counter she ran out; I followed her and took her about an hundred yard off, brought her back and gave charge of her to the constable.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you and Glosse - A. Glosse asked me once or twice to go out; I was drinking; I did not like to go out; I did not go out. I do not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010027"/>recollect any thing more. Before I left the house I was very much in liquor indeed.</p>

I remember there was a fight at the outside of the door between the deceased and the Malays, as far as I can recollect the fighting was with sticks; the deceased was a Lascar and the prisoners are Malays.</p>

            . - Mr. Gleed. Where do you live - A. I live next door to the Blue Gate, I am a rope maker. On the evening of the 25th of April I was sitting by my own fire side about ten o'clock; I heard the noise of sticks on the ground; I went to the door; I saw some men of colour ill using some other man on the ground, opposite of the Blue Gate door; when they had ill used him as long as they thought fit, they went away about twenty or thirty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say they, how many do you mean - A. Six or seven; they were beating him with sticks as he lay upon the ground; I could just observe it as I stood at my own door.</p>
               <p>Q.How many of them had sticks - A. I did not take notice, it was very dark indeed; when they walked away about twenty or thirty yards they returned again; there was a word or two passed between them, they all stopped, and two or three made their way to the Blue Gate door; they got the man up to the door;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010028"/>I kept at my door; I saw the sticks going at the man when they placed him at the door; they ill used him till they brought him to the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by ill using him - A. Giving him violent blows with sticks; the deceased fell a second time; they all went away then. I went to the Blue Gate door, and saw the deceased lay on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any persons standing near the deceased at that time - A. There were two or three round about him, I believe they were Lascars, they were persons like the deceased; I saw them take him away; I did not follow them no further than my own door. When I came up to the Blue Gate door I saw a violent blow on his forehead, it was bleeding very much; he laid on the steps, I did not hear him say a word.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. You say it was a very dark night - you was not there at the beginning - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not tell how the blows first came, because you were attracted by the noise - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Could you discern whether any of the Lascars were in liquor at all - A. No; I could not discover.</p>

I did not take notice; then I heard a man groan; I went up to him, the man was laying with his back towards the Blue Gate door; I saw his face all over blood; then I saw three or four men of his own colour take him down towards Shadwell High-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these four or five men that you describe going down Shadwell High street, men of his own colour - A. Yes, but different men.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon after they got there did he see the deceased, Imambacchus - A. Almost directly; the girl was with him; he did not see no one else.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he know the prisoners at the bar - A. He knows all three, he saw them that night, almost directly after the deceased and the girl came out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Imambacchus any stick in his hand at the time he came out of the house - A. He did not see any thing in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Ask him whether the three prisoners had any sticks - A. Yes, they had sticks.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Imambacchus any conversation with the three prisoners before any blows were given - A. He did not hear a word pass; he saw Savau strike Imambacchus, and next he saw Glosse strike him; when Savau struck him, Imambacchus fell. Glosse and Sacchar struck him when he was down, and blood came from his mouth and his head; he went away to inform the people of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. During the whole time he was observing these blows, did he observe Imambacchus strike or attempt to strike - A. No. There were more men, but only three struck him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you called on this unfortunate occasion to see the body of the deceased - A I was; on Monday the 25th of April; I saw him in one of the rooms where the men are boarded by the East India company; he was laying in a state of stupor; there were three wounds upon his head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did these wounds appear to be inflicted by a sharp instrument - A. They did not appear to be done by a sharp instrument; the edge, of the wounds were ragged; there were three wounds quite to the scalp.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you attend him - A. I only saw him in the night; I was called about half past eleven o'clock; he was in the same state when I left him as when I first saw him. I did not see him after till he was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had seen him and left him, did you entertain any hopes of him - A. It was my opinion he would die by his laying in that state of stupor; I opened the head; I entertain no doubt that the wounds were the occasion of his death.</p>

            . Q. You are likewise a watchman - A. Yes, in Marybone. On the 12th of May last, about half past ten o'clock, on the south side of Manchester square, Flannagan told me to come and assist him; he had hold of the prisoner; he told me to help the woman along; the woman was in a very weak state, and blood all over one arm; with that we went to the watchhouse and charge was given of the man; and we were going to lock him in the hole; Mrs. Howell, the watchhouse keeper's wife said the blood was coming through her clothes; the prisoner replied I know I have done it, I have put it so far into her; shewing by his finger up to the second joint.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any knife - A. I saw the knife given by

             PODMORE. I am the house surgeon of Middlesex hospital: Sarah Wood was brought on Thursday the 12th of May, about eleven o'clock at night; on examining of her, I found a wound in the lower part of the belly; it was two thirds of an inch long, and about the same depth; it was the lower part of the belly below the navel.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose the plaits of the petticoats that she wore, prevented the wound from being deeper - A. I suppose so.</p>
               <p>Q. If it had penetrated deeper, I need hardly ask you whether it would not be dangerous in that part of the body - A. It would. There was a wound in the palm of her hand near the wrist, about an inch and a half long and about half an inch in depth.</p>
               <p>Q. Was a wound in that part of the body dangerous - A. It might have been; had it been a little more of one side it would have been near a large artery.</p>
               <p>Q. That had the appearance of a cut - A. Both of them were incised wounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of the petticoats being cut - A. No.</p>
               <p>Howell. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. to Podmore. Would a stab occasion such a wound as that - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the edge of the knife took an oblique direction rather than a direct one - A. Yes; I was just going to say that.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you attend her - A. She was brought in on the Thursday night and I discharged her on the Tuesday; believing her fit to be an out patient. She presently recovered of her wounds; they did not appear to be dangerous.</p>
               <p>Q. You discharged her believing the wounds not to be dangerous - A. Yes; she was an out patient.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you last see the wound - A. I cannot say that I have seen the wound since she has been in the habit of coming there; the dresser has dressed it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She promised to go down with me on board an Indiaman; that very evening she went into the Cross Keys, Marybone lane, and got drinking with six people. I did not cut her.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you cry out - A. No. I was afraid; I was in a nasty dirty place in <placeName id="t18080601-33-crimeloc183">Dyot street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Why did not you come out when she used you ill - A. There was a parcel of fellows at the door would not let me come out; she said I should not go out of the room without giving her some money; I took my purse out of my pocket and gave her a shilling; when I got my purse out I missed my purse.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she take from you - A. A half guinea, and two seven shilling pieces; she took all that was in my purse; it was found in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you in the room - A.Not a quarter of an hour.</p>

I went into another, she was there; he said there she is; I took her to her room, I found the key in her pocket; I unlocked the door, and found the purse under the window with half a guinea, two seven shilling pieces, and a penny in copper.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM WATSON. I am an apprentice to Mr. Sirdefield. I was engaged at the time these women came in cutting a man off a handkerchief; directly I was disengaged I came to the women; I shewed them a quantity of prints but none of them seemed to take their fancy; they asked me to go to the window to see if there was not something pretty to take their fancy, which I did several times; the prints that I brought from the window did not seem to please them, and they being rather difficult I thought I would not shew them any more; I turned the same goods over again, thinking that might persuade them to take some of the goods I had shewn them before; there was one pattern in particular which I had shewn them, and which I was looking for, which they seemed to like better than any of the rest; I looked for it and could not find it; I observed

I went into the shop, there were several people waiting to be served; this gentleman laid hold of me as I moved from the counter; there was a piece of sheeting, half on the counter and half off; I never saw it with my eyes, nor yet the other prisoner; the shop was amazing full.</p>
               <p>Wood's Defence. I was not in company with the prisoner; I never saw her before; seeing the shop full of people I went in to look at some flannels; the gentleman asked me to step up stairs with him; he says you have got something about you; I said no, if you please to bring any one into the room and search me; then he picked up a bit of cotton. I could not get to the counter to take any thing for the crowd of people.</p>

               <p>Q. What time in the day - A. Before five in the afternoon; the prisoner was trying on a shoe; I saw the shoe was too small for his foot; the instant I opened the door, my sister in law seeing me, left him and went into the back parlour; I took the shoe from off his foot; I took another pair which was too large for him; the prisoner arose up and placed the chair he was sitting in in the middle of the shop; I moved the chair and desired him to sit down, and gave him another pair of shoes to try on, which fitted him; a soldier came in soon after and stood inside of the door; the prisoner asked me the price of the shoes; I told him; he offered me money for them; I told him I could not take it; I looked at him and saw him very much agitated; I looked down his great coat, I saw something bulge out. I seized his pocket and felt that they were shoes; I desired the soldier to hold his pocket and not let him take any thing out. I got an officer; he searched him; he took a pair of shoes out of that pocket; I saw they were mine; the officer put his hand into his other pocket and drew out another pair of shoes; I saw they were mine; the officer searched his pockets and could not find any money whatever.</p>

               <p>Q. You lost a great many articles, part of which you found upon the prisoner in a basket - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A basket, a chissel, a punch, and a sawsett; these were all your property; they were afterwards found upon the prisoner - A. Yes. I lost a great many more.</p>
               <p>Q. You suspected the prisoner - A. I did, because of his being there on the 12th; he came to speak to a young man that he knew, and by that means we had suspicion of him; we made enquiries after him; we found that he went by the name of Bond; it passed on for a fortnight afterwards; we fell in with this man as we were going to work near the City road: we asked him where he lived; he told us near Smithfield. Two or three mornings afterwards he was taken; he was coming down the City road; we sent a man after him. He was taken in Little Britain, in Mr. Briant's shop; when I went into the shop, I asked this man if he wanted any hands there; he said no; I saw my basket under the bench where the prisoner was at work and my tools were in the basket; I took it up and said it was my property; he said it was not; I took charge of him till an officer came.</p>
               <p>SIMON FORD. On the 13th of April I lost my tools from a building, River Terrace; I was present when they were taken from Mr. Briant's shop; I was in company with Powell; my tools were in the basket that Powell claimed.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you open her hand - A. No, I could not; I kept my hold; she threw my hat over my head, still I would not let go my hold; she slapped me on both sides of my head, then I called the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she get away with any thing of your property - A. No; I did not let go my hold; after that I went to the watchhouse to have her safe moored, there I delivered her up to

I was; I produce the note; Johnson came in the watchhouse in a strange kind of a state, with his handkerchief tore off his neck, and with a thick rough coat on; he had hold of the girl, he brought her in; he says I have boarded her at last; he delivered her into my custody; I thought he was joking, the woman said nothing was the matter; he said she had got a note of his; she said I will be damned if I have; Johnson said it was wrapped in a piece of brown paper, and he knew the note by the smell of it. I desired her to open her hand; she refused it; I rubbed her hand and got it open; I took this note out of a small bit of paper, the same paper it is in now.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you overtake him - A. Yes, and took him to the watchhouse; I had another watchman with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Another watchman came up in the way, he was running - A. Yes, and he was stopped between us both.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call out - A. Yes, I called out stop thief, and another watchman coming up a contrary way, the prisoner stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you took the prisoner did you see him do any thing - A. No, he made no resistance.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose your companion seized him as well as yourself - A. Yes, he took hold of his arm, and I took him to St. James' watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him - A. Yes, in the watchhouse; I found nothing upon him he; had the stick with him; we took it from him when we took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the watch did not you - A. Yes; I went out to look for the prosecutor, I brought him into the watchhouse; he swore to the man and the stick; I went and searched the track in which I had followed him, as the man said he had been robbed of a watch; I thought he might have throwed it away; in Oxendon-street I found the watch upon the pavement.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that it was in the track that you and the prisoner ran. - A. Yes, I am sure of that; I noticed the track, I made several blows at him to try to knock him down.</p>
               <p>Q. You carried the watch to the watchhouse did you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew it to the prosecutor - A. I did; the prosecutor swore it was his watch; he said his own name was in the watch; this is the watch, I have had in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive whether the prosecutor was in liquor - A. He had been drinking for certain, but he was more in a passion with the man, than he was affected by drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to you to be a man that was so drunk that he did not know what he was about - A. Far from that; he was capable of any business whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. You should have thought that he was capable of any thing - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Andrews. You searched the prisoner at the watchhouse - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found nothing upon him - A. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. Look at that watch and seal - A. That is my watch it has my name upon it; I am confident of it being my watch; I had it in my pocket before I felt the blow, and I felt it go.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going along the Haymarket towards St. James' street; the prosecutor ran away from me, the watchman attempted to stop me, and I was taken to the watchhouse; the prosecutor came in the watchhouse soon after I was taken in, he said I had robbed him of his watch; I denied the charge; a watchman came in soon after and said he had found the watch.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 16th of April last, had you occasion to leave your house for a short time - A. Yes, for a few minutes, between the hours of twelve and one o'clock; when I left my house, I locked my shop door, and left the key in the door; I left my wife in the house up stairs, my workmen were in the back shop in the yard; it is detached from the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you locked your shop door, where did you go to - A. I went to the end of the street; and I returned in a few minutes, and when I entered the passage; I saw the prisoner at the shop door which was locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever known the prisoner before - A. Yes; he is a sadler and harness maker by trade; he had often been in my shop; I saw him pulling my door to as if to lock it; he had hold of the key; I asked him what he wanted, his answer was, that he wished to know if I had heard of a situation for him; I answered that I knew of nothing for him; I then asked him how he could take the liberty of opening the shop door, saying that I knew he had been in; which he denied; I then asked him if he would walk in the shop; he went in with me; at the same time one of my men came in; when I went into the shop, I looked at that part of the shop where I had frequently missed goods before; I observed some things had been taken away; on turning to the prisoner, I saw his countenance very much change; I then looked into his outside pocket and observed a brown paper parcel in it; I then asked him how he could have the impudence to ask me for a situation when he came to rob me; he turned the goods out of his pocket; my servant assisted him in so doing.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find upon him - A. I found four paper parcels of nails, such as sadlers use; the four papers contain four thousand; we sell them at one shilling and ninepence a thousand; one paper containing twelve plated trace buckles, and one paper containing eight plated territs; I knew the things when I saw them, I looked at the place where we kept them; I missed them.</p>

They are valued at twenty two shillings; it was laying on the counter, I did not see her take it, large as it was; she moved very slowly when she went out of the shop and talking to us of the price of our goods; I rather suspected that she had it between her legs.</p>

               <p>Q. How many dustmen went down - A. Two.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who these dustmen were - A. The two prisoners at the bar; when they went down first, the younger man, Smith, took the shovel and filled the basket; they took a candle with them down in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you had the means of seeing them distinctly - A. Exactly. The younger one Smith filled the basket, and Russell took it up stairs; when Russell came for the second basket, Russell said is there any thing in this, speaking of the second basket; Smith said no, it shall be in the next; then Russel took the candle and looked at the back part of the cellar, and went to where there was some wood; he looked to see if there was any body there, he went then to the coal cellar, and went to where they clean the knives; he returned to the basket and took this bundle and put it edgeways into the, basket and covered it over with dust; he took it from the left hand side of the cellar warehouse, he took it from a place where there were five in a parcel, and took the others and covered the vacancy so that it should not be discovered.</p>
               <p>Court. How many did he take away in the third basket - A. This one; then Russel took this one and the basket on his shoulder, Russell said to Smith there is one there, and I will put another in the next; then Smith went to the other side of the warehouse, and took this bundle, and put into the other dust basket and covered it with dust over it; I then threw down my concealment where I was in the cellar, and ran up stairs immediately, bolting Smith in the cellar; I took Russell in custody with the basket and this bundle on his shoulder before he got to the cart; I took him to the Compter directly; then I came back to the cellar and took the other prisoner, and took him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When you came back to that cellar and found Smith, where had he put that parcel which you saw him put in the basket - A. On the coals.</p>
               <p>Q. He had taken it out and put it on the coals - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the other parcel had been removed from the dust basket and put on the coals - A. It had.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Potter On the 14th of April, between the hours of two and three o'clock, the prisoner came in the shop to look at some prints; I shewed her some that laid on the counter; she did not approve of them; I went to the shelf to take down some others, and the instant I took them down and turned my eyes towards the counter I saw her shuffling something under her petticoats, which led me to suspect her; I desired the porter to inform my master; my master came down stairs, he asked me who was the prisoner; she had bought two yards of print of me, and Mr. Potter took the money.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. Potter in the hearing of the prisoner what you had observed - A. I did, Mr. Potter took the money for the print; then he said to her I believe you have got something which is not your own, he took hold of her; she resisted and was very abusive; she said no man should touch her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he attempt to search her - A. Yes; he told her to be quiet, he would send for a constable and have her searched in a room up stairs; while they were taking her up stairs, before she was half out of the shop, I observed a-piece of calico, in the middle of the shop, in a tumbled state; it had the appearance as if a person had attempted to fold it in a small parcel to carry it away; I am sure it was one of the article for sale in my master's shop, it had my master's mark on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. I understand this I your shop mark on it; do not goods sold at your shop go out with the shop mark on them - A. Yes; sometimes at the finish of a piece.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that this piece might not have been sold before with the shop mark on it - A. I will not venture to swear that there was not precisely the same mark on a piece of calico sold before.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you sold an entire piece of calico to this woman - A. I had not; she bought two yards of print at a shilling a yard.</p>

               <p>Q. Before you went up stairs had you looked on the spot where she was standing, to see if any thing was on the ground - A. I did not; I watched her for fear she should drop any thing. When I got her into the room; I searched her; I saw no property on her; Mr. Potter said he was very certain that he saw some property about her when he attempted to search her; the prisoner said she was quite innocent; Mr. Potter went out of the door; he brought in a piece of calico; he charged her with taking it; he ordered me to take her in custody; she set herself down in the arm chair and turned her arms into the holes of the arm chair to prevent me from taking her; I was under the necessity of sending for Dodson.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you both together secured her - A. Yes; she then said she hoped we would overlook it; it was the first time, and she never was in a prison in her life.</p>

            . I was sent for by Mr. Potter; I found her up in the dining room; Mr. Potter charged her with robbing him of a piece of calico: I took the piece of calico along with the prisoner; she suffered me to search her; she was very quiet with me and said nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Potter. What passed after your foreman gave you the information - A. Mr. Mitchell pointed out the prisoner to me; I then asked her what she bought, she told me two yards of print at a shilling a yard; I folded the print up and took the money for it of the prisoner and gave her the piece of print; I told her that she had some property about her that we suspected was not her own; she was then standing close by the counter; she denied the charge; I pulled her gown and apron of one side, I saw something white, which I supposed to be calico; I then moved her about three yards from the counter; there I kept her and sent for an officer; when the officer came I gave her in charge.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she behave herself before the officer came - A. I did not mean to say how she behaved herself, but if you wish it I must. She behaved very riotously indeed; I had some very respectable customers in the shop; she said I was going to ravish her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you direct your eye to the spot of ground where she stood - A. I watched her very narrowly, and I am very much astonished I did not perceive the goods drop. After the constable came I picked them up myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the goods picked up at the precise spot in which you held her - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing a person had been looking at goods on the counter could these goods that you found by any accident have fell on that spot - A. It is impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she been removed up stairs before you picked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010041"/>up the goods - A. I gave her in charge of the constable and was following her up stairs; Mr. Mitchell informed me that the piece of goods lay on the floor; I went back and found the goods upon the very spot where she stood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge her with having taken them - A. I did, and she denied it; I persisted in my charge and desired the officer to do his duty; at that time there was but one.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the second to be sent for - A. The woman was very riotous, that was the occasion of my sending for the second officer; before the second constable came, she said she was extremely sorry, hoped I would forgive her and this was the first offence ever she had committed. The calico had my shop mark upon it; it cost me about ten pence a yard; there is eighteen yards of it.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I went into Mr. Potter's shop; I asked the gentleman to let me look at some pieces of cotton for an apron; I choosed a piece; he cut me two yards of it; Mr. Potter came into the shop and asked me if I had not got some stolen property; I told him I did not know what he meaned; he said he was very certain I had a piece of Irish or a piece of print; I never laid my hand upon any thing in the shop.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner on the 11th of April last - A. I did, between twelve and one o'clock. At the time Sarah Kettel came to my masters' shop I was cutting off a man a handkerchief;

             asked me whether the price was sixteen pence or no; I told her I had said the price was fourteen pence, but I would cut her off one for a shilling; she then told me to cut her one off; I did, and left it on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other person in the shop at that time - A. There was; there were both the Mr. Sirdefields; the young man and the boy; they were all engaged.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cut her one off - A. I did; she did not pay me; I then turned to the man, put his handkerchief into paper, took his money, and went to the window to see whether it was good; I then came back to the counter with intent to put her handkerchief up into paper. On my coming back to the counter I missed one of the two pieces of handkerchiefs which I had shewn to the man before and which the prisoner was looking at; I then went on the side of the counter that the woman was of, thinking it might have fell down; she was standing close by the counter; I could not see it there; I looked at the woman and I saw the corner of it under her gown; she was covering it up with her arm as fast as she could.</p>
               <p>Q. How many handkerchiefs did that piece contain - A Five. I took hold of the handkerchiefs and asked her where she got them from; she told me she bought them in Cheapside; I directly then sent the boy for the constable; when he came I gave her in charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you delivered her up to the constable did you see that the handkerchiefs were your master's property - A I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I not lay a seven shilling piece on the counter for you to take for the shawl - A. No; I am quite certain that you never offered me any money.</p>
               <p>Q. to Watson. She did not attempt to bargain for or cheapen this piece that she had taken - A. No; nor did she tender any money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand that the whole she attempted to buy was this single handkerchief - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JAMES WOODMAN. I am a beadle. I was sent for to take charge of this woman; I took her in custody. I have had the piece of handkerchiefs ever since.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into this shop to buy a cheap shawl; he shewed me several; he said he would warrant this to be a strong shawl; and then I seeing these shawls lay by me I turned myself round to look at them; he said I have cut your shawl off; I said I have put seven shillings down on the counter; I had my gown tucked up under my arm; I looked round to look at these shawls; he then said I came in as a shoplifter; I said I did not understand it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

Yes; I was alone and saw it; I followed her out of the shop, brought her back to the door, and took it out of her hand, and I sent for a constable; I am confident it is my master's cotton, it has the shop mark on it; it hung on a horse in the shop.</p>

I was taking the prisoner with another, they were tied together, down to the House of Correction; somebody coming along run against me, whether by accident or design I cannot say, then she made her escape; she has been since in New Prison for stealing a kettle, and was confined two months.</p>

               <p>Q. What part of the shop was it lost from - A. It was standing up, inside of the shop, tied up with a string near the door.</p>

               <p>Q. Before you was informed that it was taken, how long before that had you seen it safe yourself - A. I had seen it safe ten minutes before it was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to learn that it was taken - A. Because the next witness brought it into the house; I knew it was my master's property by the marks.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner near your house that day - A. I had not; I served a man that came into the shop with two yards of tape at three halfpence a yard, that I believe to be connected with him.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What is the value of the baize - A. Five pounds is the lowest; it cost me six pounds nine shillings and sixpence.</p>

On the 26th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010043"/>of April, about twenty minutes after six in the evening, I saw the prisoner he had nothing with him; I saw him enter the shop of Mr. Croten in Drury lane; I saw him stoop near the door where the baize was, I saw several pieces by the door, what they were I do not pretend to say; he was stooping by the green baize, I watched him, I saw him cut the string, and take up two pieces of green baize; he crossed over the way from Mr. Croten's shop with the two pieces and he went into Clare court; I looked at him very hard and followed him. I called out stop thief several times. I was joined by several other people in the cry, upon my crying out stop thief; he ran when the report became general of stop thief; some one made a thrust at the prisoner as if to take him; immediately the baize fell from him on the ground; I picked up the green baize; the other people pursued him.</p>

               <p>Q. You was not present when he was secured - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that he was the man that took the green baize - A. I looked upon him very hard, because I thought I should be called upon. I am quite positive he is the man; I brought up the baize and took it to the shop; he was not brought back while I was there; I saw him on Thursday the 28th following, in the evening, at Bow street; this was on the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then recollect his person - A.Perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q. You staid no longer than to deliver the baize - A. No; I delivered it to the young lad in Mr. Croten's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he dressed then as he is now - A. No, he had a great coat on then.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure the green baize was within side of the shop - A. I am perfectly sure it was inside of the shop.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner on this 26th of April - A. Yes; I first saw him in Clare court, nearly opposite of the shop where the goods was taken from; I was taking to a friend in Clare court when I heard the cry of stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing with him when you heard the cry of stop thief - A. He had this bundle of green baize upon his shoulder: the prisoner was running; I fronted him as he was coming towards me, I attempted to stop him, he chucked the property at me; I followed him from Clare court into Wych street, he turned down Blackmoor street and into Drury lane, and at Astley's I saw he was getting the start of me, I called out stop thief; I never lost sight of him, he was stopped in my presence; I went up to him in a second after he was stopped; I am quite positive that he is the man that threw down the baize; when the man stopped him I saw him put his hand into his pocket and drew out his knife.</p>
               <p>Q.Had he time to open it - A. No, he had not time to open it; I seized his hand to prevent mischief; I secured him and brought him back to Clare court; they told me the shop where the property was taken from; then I took him to Bow street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see the knife in my hand - A. I did; I laid hold of your thumb and wrenched it back; the knife fell and a boy picked it up.</p>

               <p>Court to Deer. Did you see him open the door - A. He pushed the door open; the door went on a pulley I believe.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you meet with this assault - A. On the morning of the first of May, between one and two o'clock, I met with Frances Spencer in Ratcliffe highway, I was in liquor, I could not find my way home; I I asked her to shew me the way home, instead of shewing me the way home she took me to her apartment in <placeName id="t18080601-56-crimeloc318">Seven Star alley, St. George's in the East</placeName>

                        targets="t18080601-56-off315 t18080601-56-crimeloc318"/>; I told her that was not the house I wanted her to shew me; she said I might stay there all night, she would not shew me any further I sent her for a drop of liquor; she brought the money back, she said it was bad; she did not return me the seven shilling piece; I sent a half guinea next, she brought some gin; she said she could get nothing to eat it was too late.</p>
               <p>Q. How much liquor did she bring - A. I cannot recollect whether it was a pint or half a pint; I was a little in liquor between ten and eleven o'clock; one began to beat me with the poker and the other with the fender.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you slept there I suppose - A. I was sitting on the foot of the bed, with half of my clothes on and half off.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you laid down and took a nap - A. I do not recollect at all; I was sitting on the foot of the bed all the time to the best of my knowledge. I could not lay down nor could I walk.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you to stay there from between ten and eleven o'clock, till one in the morning - . I was not able to stand on my legs or else I would not have staid there so long; they beat me so I was hardly able to walk, they would have murdered me if I had not got assistance; the constable came up; when she saw the constable come she said she was sorry she had not murdered me at first. They took all the money I had from me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did they take the money from you - A. Before they began to beat me.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them took the money from you - A. I do not know; the constable found the money, they took two guineas, half a guinea, and three seven shilling pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the constable come - A. I cried out for assistance; some of the people in the street went for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. When you come there did you find the prisoner Smith - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go to bed with the prisoner Smith - A. No, not to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. On your examination you said I met the prisoner Smith in the street, I went with her to her room, I remained there till about five o'clock in the morning. I went to bed with Spencer, when I awoke I discovered the prisoner Smith. I found I had lost four one pound notes; I then challenged the prisoner with the robbery; which is the truth what you then said or now - A. I speak the truth; I told the justice the same.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Smith come into the room - A.Ann Smith was in the room when I came home.</p>

            . I am a constable belonging to the public office, Shadwell. On the first of May a young man came to me, he said there would be murder done in Seven Star alley, at the lower house on the left hand side; he shewed me the room. I found Spencer's arms bloody from her finger up to her elbow; I found the man in the room bleeding at different parts of his head; he said he was struck with a fender by Spencer, and a little woman had struck him with a poker; Smith was not there, she came in a few minutes; I said to Spencer why did you rob this man and want to murder him; she said I am very sorry and made use of very bad expressions that I had not murdered him; she said she would not be searched there but she would in the other room; the rooms were all over blood; I found this protection box.

             had the protection box; in the protection box was two one pound notes, a half guinea, three seven shilling pieces, and a red pocket handkerchief that the man, had; I found the certificate of the discharge of the man it laid on the floor, and likewise some gentleman's address where he took some prize money. I found on Spencer a few halfpence which the magistrate ordered me to give her; she said it was his money, but he gave it to her.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find the other two one pound notes - A. I did not; Smith had been to a Jew's in the alley there; he keeps a bad house.</p>

               <p>Spencer's Defence. I met the man between eleven and twelve o'clock on Saturday night, he had another young lass with him; he asked me to have something to drink, I said no, let him go with his own woman; he said he would not go with her; he gave me a seven shilling piece to get something to drink, he had only seven shillings in silver in the morning, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010045"/>asked me to give him something to drink; I said no I would not; he said I should get up; he struck me with the fire shovel. I too up the fender to bar the blow off; the other young woman was not in the room at all; when she saw him beating me she came and wiped my hands with her apron; the tin-box is not his; I have had it ever since the beginning of last summer.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. I know nothing of the affair, nor about the money; there was a terrible piece of work, I ran up stairs and wiped her nose. Mr. Brown took me. I know nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Brown.) Was Smith's hands bloody - A. Yes, they were both obliged to wash themselves before I took them out of the house; the water was as bloody as though it came from a beast.</p>

            . Q. You are shopman to Mr. Hoskins. - A. Yes. On the 29th of April, between six and seven o'clock, the two prisoners came into the shop together, they said they wanted a gown. Gagan had a brown great coat on and the other had a cloak on. The first thing that I shewed them was twenty four yards of buff printed cambric, they both made answer that they did not like a buff colour. I left it on the counter and proceeded to shew them many more; I found a great difficulty in finding one to please them, but at last after giving a great deal of trouble they fixed upon one pattern; they did not want to take the gown with them but to pay three shillings on account, and laid the gown by till the rest should be duly paid.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it to come to - A. Seven yards at one shilling, and ten pence a yard; the next morning I missed this twenty four yards of buff printed cambric; we were shutting up the shop when they came in, and we had no person in after them nor the next morning; there were some customers in at the same time, people that we knew very well; they left before they went; one of them lived with us, and the other is a responsible tradesman.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you miss it the next morning - A. Between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the things again - A. They have owned to it, but we have never found it; about that day three weeks, the prisoner Gagan came in, she wanted a piece of cotton for a frock; I knew her again. I took the identical pattern which they had laid by; I asked her if she and another person had not laid that by, leaving three shillings on account; she said that Burgess did, she added that she had not spoke to her for a fortnight. I saw that she was affected; I told her that evening they were there I missed this twenty four yards of printed cambric; I told her I had given a description of both the persons that they might be apprehended in case I might be out of the way; that I was very glad I had the opportunity of apprehending her myself; I should send for an officer and have her taken in custody; the officer was sent for, and before he came she confessed to me that she did not steal this but the other prisoner Burgess stole it; that she did not know that she stole it till she crossed the street, and that she shewed it to her, and when she saw if she advised Burgess to take it back again. Burgess told her to mind her own business; when the officer came she gave information where Burgess was to be found, but it was not a true one.</p>
               <p>Q. You never found the piece have you - A. We found fourteen yards more which they stole the same evening, it is in the court now. The prisoner Burgess before the magistrate convicted the other of stealing one gown on her back, and one in pawn which we have brought forward.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was the other person in the shop - A. The boy which we have not brought here.</p>
               <p>Burgess. The print that he had at the pawnbrokers, which is seven yards, I bought on Ludgate hill; I told him that I had a ticket that I had lost, and when he saw that seven yards, he said it was his property.</p>
               <p>RBOERT BROWN. On the 20th of May, I was sent for to Mr. Hoskins to take a woman into custody; I found Gagan in the shop, he said that was the woman I was to take in custody; I asked her where she lived, she said in Bell court, Bell alley, Golden lane; Mr. Greathead said there was another woman concerned in the robbery; she told me if I would go to the corner of Long alley, at a pawnbrokers, I should find a person of the name of Burgess; we could find no such person there, she misled us; I received information from a woman in Bell court, that Burgess was at the George, in Compton street, Clerkenwell, there I found her; we then proceeded to a pawnbrokers on Snow hill. I searched her at the public house, and found some duplicates; we could find no property of Mr. Hoskins, we took them before the magistrate. Gagan acknowledged that she was there, that Burgess had taken the piece of print; she went across the way, she immediately asked her what she had got there, and desired her to take it back; Burgess told her to mind her own business; we had a hard matter to keep Burgess quite till Gagan was done; the magistrate asked Burgess what she had to say, she said that good for nothing hussey has told against me; that night she stole fourteen yards of print out of the shop; that gown on her back is part of it; and the other part is in pawn for seven shillings at the pawnbrokers Wellclose square. I will go and shew you where it is; accordingly I went there with Burgess, and there we found seven yards of print pledged for seven shillings; we could trace nothing of the twenty four yards. Burgess said she believed the other must have lost it.</p>
               <p>Q. When Gagan accused Burgess with stealing the twenty four yards, did she deny it - A. She said that Gagan stole it.</p>
               <p>Q. When Burgess said that Gagan stole the fourteen yards, what did Gagan say to that - A. She did not deny it.</p>
               <p>Burgess. I told him I had one ticket which I had lost. I shewed him where it was in pledge, seven yards for seven shillings.</p>

I bought the gown on Ludgate hill, I gave eighteen pence a yard for it; he asked me whether I had not a gown put by, he said did I not take a piece of cotton; he said if I would only own to taking of the cotton he would take four shillings a week for it; I told him I could do no such thing, I never had it.</p>
               <p>Greathead. I know the pattern very well; there were exactly fourteen yards of it; I am sure it was our own cotton, they had divided it exactly; we went immediately and saw the cotton was gone; they had tore the fag end off.</p>
               <p>Burgess's Defence. I bought that cotton and gave eighteen pence a yard for it on Ludgate hill; this young woman bought a gown about a fortnight before, she gave me a pattern when I bought mine; I pledged it on purpose to pay off another; and when I saw another that I liked better, I paid three shillings off it. He told me he kept them in general six months; I told him I should fetch it between this and Whitsuntide.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Greathead.) What is the worth of the cotton - A. About two shillings and two pence a yard.</p>

Yes; I was eating my dinner at Hungerford, I heard the cry of stop thief; I ran out of the door, I heard Mr. Simpson say that it was the second time that he was robbed; I turned round the Globe door, I saw the prisoner running along by the bottle warehouse very fast; I ran after him, he run up Hungerford, and up Church lane; he went up Church court singing out, stop thief, there he goes; he was crying out just at the head of me, stop thief, there he goes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body running before you - A. No, not a soul; I was the next person after him; he ran up Duke's court; he stopped to tie up the handkerchief on his leg, and there I catched him by Mr. Payne's the bookseller; he went behind the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him - A. No; he was very remarkable by having this handkerchief round his leg; I did not lose sight of him at all.</p>

            . Q. What are you - A. I do not follow any business particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you lose this pocket book - A. On the 17th of May; I went to the Swan in Rosemary lane for a cart to take a load of goods to my house; I was directed to Mr. Bolton's in Whitechapel; I met the prisoner Wheeler near the end of Essex street, Whitechapel; we went up Essex street together.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you and her - A. She said would I give her something to drink; I went into her apartment in <placeName id="t18080601-62-crimeloc353">Essex street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18080601-62-crimeloc353" type="placeName" value="Essex street"/>

               <p>Q. I do not understand you - you felt a hustling that is with a number of persons, here was only one - what time of the day was this - A. Soon after one o'clock; coming by Aldgate I took out my pocket book to look for a direction, I returned it into my pocket again; I do not know whether I felt it after that or no.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went up in the room, you staid some time there I suppose - A. A very short time; when I missed my pocket book I asked her for it; she said she had not got it, and called out murder, when the prisoner White and a number of other persons rushed into the room; I thought myself in danger, I let the prisoner Wheeler go; White said if you give me a shilling I will tell you were she is gone, and I will endeavour to procure the book for you; I gave her a shilling, and then a second, and then a third, and a fourth, and then I found it was a trick.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. You live at Barking in Essex - How many does your family consist of -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010049"/>A. No one but myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You were quite sober - A. I think I was, I had drank a pint of ale.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober, or as they call sober in Barking - A. I was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go to her apartment to look for a cart - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The last time you saw your pocket book was at Aldgate - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from Aldgate to Essex street - A. About a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. You passed a great many of his Majesty's subjects from Aldgate to Essex street - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say whether any of them took it - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it never found - A. No.</p>

I would have nothing to say to her, I was going to bed; she slung herself about me, and picked my pocket; I felt her hand in my pocket, I laid hold of her by the arm and told her she had robbed me; I put my other hand in my pocket, I found a dollar, a half crown, and two shillings gone; I then told her if she did not immediately give it me I would take her to the watchhouse; she denied having it, and wanted me to go home with her; I told her as I did before, I would have nothing to do with her; I called the watch three times, no watch coming; three young men passed me; I desired them to send me the first watchman they saw; immediately I saw a watchman turn the corner, they called to him and he came to my assistance; I told the watchman the girl had robbed me; I heard the money drop into her pocket as I took hold of her arm; in taking her to the watchhouse she made several attempts to put her her hand in her pocket; I was obliged to pull her hand out; going through Covent garden I found her hand in her pocket and out fell a shilling or two; I desired the watchman to pick it up, she was taken to the watch-house; there was found upon her a half crown piece, two shillings, and a dollar.</p>

            . I am a beadle; a little before twelve o'clock the prosecutor came in the watch-house with the prisoner and two watchman, relating that he had lost a dollar, half a crown, and two shillings; she pulled off her pocket, I found half a crown, and two shillings upon her; he seemed to know one of the shillings; I took her into the yard, she stooped as if to pull up the heel of her shoe, which caused a suspicion in me that she had hid something in the gutter; I saw this dollar standing in the gutter on the ground.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I got that dollar out of the change of a half guinea that day; and I had four shillings in silver; he wanted to come home with me; I never saw a halfpenny of his money.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Do you know one of the shillings - A. There is a star on the opposite side of the reading; the other shilling has a stamp upon it; I know both the shillings. She offered some money to the watchman; he would not take it.</p>

            , and the prisoner standing together, they stood a little while in conversation; the prisoner then left him and went up the street; my porter came over the way and rung the bell; one of the servants let him in my gates that lead down to the wharf; I keep my oils at the back of my premises; I watched my porter; he opened the gates that lead into the street and went to a stable, which I have nearly opposite, of the other side of the way; while he was there a few minutes, the prisoner came with a basket in his hand and went down the gateway, leading to where my oils are deposited; immediately after Croft, the porter, brought the horse down the gateway; about five minutes after that I observed White go out of the gateway with a basket on his shoulder, and apparently something heavy in it; I immediately went out and followed him up St. Peter's Hill into Old Fish street; I asked him what he had got upon his shoulder; he said nothing of mine; I said I supposed he had got some of my property there; he immediately threw the bottle down with all the force he had upon the curb stones and broke it all to pieces; I tasted and smelt it; the bottle contained rape oil; it was of a similar quality to the oil that I had in the warehouse; it was a five gallon stone bottle. It appeared as if it had been full by the quantity spilled on the ground; it cost me four shillings and three pence a gallon. I secured him; some friends coming up at the time, I sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the porter - A. I took him up to Guildhall; Mr. Alderman Combe thought the evidence could not be brought home to him; they were obliged to let him go; I have never seen him since. I asked him how he got the oil; he did not make any answer particular; he did not like to be kept in the street; he desired to be taken into a public house.</p>
               <p>Jury. When the basket was taken into your warehouse was it empty or had it any thing in it. - A. It appeared to be light; he was swinging it in his hand as he was carrying it.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the weight of five gallons of oil - A. About thirty seven pound; with the bottle forty three pound.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I have seen him; I do not know how he gets his living; I saw him on the morning he was taken, standing at the end of Mr. Vicars' warehouse; I went down their gateway to borrow a truck for my master; I left the prisoner there; he was alone and had nothing with him; I did not see him do any thing.</p>
               <p>- VICARS. I am Mr. Vicars' son; I saw the prisoner talking to our porter in Thames street, a few minutes before seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing with him when he was talking to your porter - A. No; the gates were then shut; about half after seven o'clock I saw the prisoner come down the gateway with a basket in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be light or heavy - A. He was swinging it about in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any business or employment down your gateway - A. None; there was no business carrying on there but our oil warehouse; in about five minutes he returned again; he had something covered with straw in a basket, which he carried on his shoulder, it appeared to be heavy; I and my father followed; when I laid hold of him we asked him where he got it; he said he did not bring it from our premises; my father said he was sure he did; before he said that, he chucked it upon the curb stones and broke it; it appeared to be a five gallon bottle; we sent for a constable; he stooped down and washed his apron in the channel, which was all over oil; I never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. The porter is not here - A. No; we turned him away directly; I tasted the rape oil; it appeared to be of the same quality as the rape oil-in my father's warehouse.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH COWARD. I am a constable; I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner. Mr. Vicars charged him with stealing a bottle of rape oil.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any oil in the street at the time you came up - A. Yes, a large quantity on the curb and part of it in the channel. The prisoner said to me, are you to take me; I said, yes; I was very sorry to see him in that situation; I had known him before; I asked him what could induce him to steal it; he said he was employed by a man at the warehouse to carry this bottle of oil to a pitching block at the corner of Fenchurch street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say who that man was - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner - A. He was a porter to Messrs. Howell and Atlee, Thames street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am quite innocent; I was hired by a man to carry it to a pitching block in Fenchurch street; he said he had got another house to go to; he would be there as soon as I was.</p>

I was with Mr. Sadler on the 13th of April, about nine o'clock in the evening, when he lost his handkerchief; I observed the prisoner following of him few paces, which induced me to look round, I saw him in the act of drawing the handkerchief out of the right hand pocket of Mr. Sadler; I made a motion with my elbow to him that there was a man picking his pocket; I never took my eye from the man till he 
               <persName id="t18080601-65-person558">drew</persName>
             the handkerchief out; then he wound the handkerchief round his left hand with his right hand and put it into his bosom; Mr. Sadler turned round immediately and took him by the collar; the prisoner protested innocence; he took the handkerchief from his bosom; he held his hand behind him and dropped it on the street.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner sell you any gold filings at any time - A. On the 19th of April the prisoner brought a piece of solid gold to the accompting house; it weighed ten penny weights and twelve grains.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the piece now - A. No; it was made use of among other gold; it has been melted when it came there in a small crucible; he left it and called the next day, which is the usual way. I paid him the next day; it came to a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this - A. He came about two in the middle of the day, and he called the next day about three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Do you know what quantity of filings you ought to have in that box - A. I do not; there were more than ten penny weights missing.</p>

            . Q. Do you know this man Taylor - A.Yes he worked for my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of your master missing any filings - A. Yes. On the 19th of April, when my master and the two lads were gone down to breakfast, the prisoner went to the cupboard where the gold filings was; he took out a little stone bottle out of it; he asked me if I would go and fetch him a little water to drink.</p>
               <p>A. Did you go down - A. No, I took the bottle with me and stood behind the door; I looked through the crack of the door; I saw the prisoner leave his workboard and come to the cupboard; he took the box down where the filings was kept and put it on the lower shelf; my mistress called me down for a letter; I went up directly into the workshop and the box was removed into its proper place in the cupboard.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you tell your master or mistress what you had seen - A. On the Wednesday morning, I told my master.</p>
               <p>Q. What time on Tuesday did you see your master again - A. About half after nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner left the shop then - A. No, he left the shop about one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Masters.) What time of day was it when the prisoner brought the gold to you A - . About two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You live in Sutton street, Mr. Lovell in Aldersgate street; what time would it require to melt filings into a solid mass - A. That would depend upon what fire he had, if he had a fire to light it would take an hour; and if he had a fire ready lighted it would not take half the time; and it would cool in a very short time.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. - (to Mr. Lovell.) I apprehend you could not swear to that piece of gold that was sold to Mr. Masters. - A. I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. And the filings you could not swear to - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The box that Mr. Lovell alludes to, is metal filings. The tin box he puts what they call gold filings; the method of Mr. Lovell's work is all common; indeed the last metal that Mr. Lovell had was twelve shillings an ounce; and that gold that man had was forty two shillings an ounce; Mr. Lovell's metal I could not reduce it into a solid piece.</p>

On the 11th of April I was walking down the Strand; when I got facing of my own window I saw the prisoner take some drops and put in his pocket, he was taking them from a lustre; I then went into my shop, it was about eight o'clock; he left work in a moment then. I was so much alarmed I said nothing to him that night about it; he went out. On the next morning about six o'clock he returned to his work again, I called him into the counting house, I told him I had seen him rob me the night before; I asked him where he lodged, he told me three or four places, but he never told me where he did lodge. I sent for an officer; Miller came and took him to Bow street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards find any of these things - A. I went with Miller and saw some of these things in Burleigh court, Burleigh street; we saw his wife there in the lodgings; we found the goods mentioned in the indictment; the pans I know to be mine, I believe them all to be mine; they have no particular marks, they are like our patterns; the glass drops he took away the night before were more valuable than those we found.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never discovered those drops he took away that night - A. No.</p>
               <p>- MILLER. I am an officer of Bow street. I took charge of this man on the 12th of April; when we came to the office he told me where he lodged. I went with Mr. Price to his lodgings in Burleigh court; Mr. Price said he had robbed him; the prisoner said he had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew him the things that were found there - A. I produced them in his presence before the magistrate; he told the magistrate that he brought them in his bundle from Dublin.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Is there any thing that you can particularize as yours - A. These pans are the same patterns as were in our shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you venture to say that other shops cannot have pans of that make - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury - these articles are all my property; these spangles, that Mr. Price calls drops, I brought from Dublin with me; the other articles, the pans, I got them made<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010053"/>and had cut by my brother, I made them for a lady that employed me to make a pair of candlesticks; my brother cut them in this old fashioned way; the lady would not have them. The brass chain I made myself; I purchased the spangles, with a great many more articles. It is impossible for Mr. Price, or any body else, to swear to the things found on me; throughout Dublin and London there are similar articles, they are of the commonest sort; Mr. Price knows nothing of the trade. If I had had a mind to defraud Mr. Price of any articles these are not the things that I should take, when there were things of the newest patterns that would be worth something. There is no one in the trade that would give any thing for them; they are worth nothing.</p>

               <p>Q. You and him took a bit of ground together - A. No, not taken the ground; I took the ground and he built the houses; we had some words and I discharged him.</p>
               <p>Q. And after you discharged him, you spoke well of him and he of you; he and you were not good friends at the time these deals were lost - A. No, not very good friends nor no enemies; when I met him in the street, he did not look at me in a civil manner, or else I should have been ready to meet him.</p>
               <p>Q. After you missed the deals you got Armstrong the officer, and you met the prisoner; he went with you to Mr. Knight's - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you know these ten deals to be yours - A. I swear to four in particular, and the others I have a perfect knowledge of.</p>
               <p>Q. And you say you know one of them by the mark of a shore and by the nail holes - A. Yes; we had been taking down two houses; they had been standing some time; we have been using them from time to time; that brings me to a perfect knowledge of that board.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you know the faces of all of them - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the mark of the three shores; does your shores leave a different print from others - A. No; that is not likely; when we use a deal we look to the quality; it is the quality of the deal as well as the marks I know it by.</p>
               <p>Q. That makes you, a cautions man; swear to the deal - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your deals are very remarkable, they have some nail holes; your nail holes are different from all others - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are of the same opinion now as when you found them in the timber yard - A. Exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have always said you have maintained that opinion. Have you never said that you was satisfied that he was innocent - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. And that you would rather have given fifty pounds than to make the charge - A.Never; and here I am upon my oath, I never said anything of that kind in my life.</p>
               <p>Court. When you went to Knight's was he in custody of Armstrong - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>MR. SHERRY. Q. You are a carpenters; you work for Mr. Jeffrey - A. Yes; I was employed to finish some houses in Grey Eagle street, I saw the deals there on Saturday evening six o'clock. On Monday morning I missed them eleven deals; I found ten on the same morning at Mr. Knight's deal yard in Old Nicolls street. I knew them as soon as I saw them before; I got into the yard; I knew them; there were eight of them standing up inside by the gate and two of them laying down by the saw pit.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say whether any or all of them are Mr. Jeffrey's deals - A. I can, some.</p>
               <p>Court. What length are they - A. Some twelve foot, some eleven, and some ten. This is Mr. Jeffreys deal<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010054"/>it has three nail holes; the other deal has a knot.</p>
               <p>Jury I may have ten deals in my yard like these.</p>
               <p>Sherry. There is four deals that I know; this deal has a chop at the end.</p>
               <p>Jury. That is a chop when they were timber, before they were deals.</p>
               <p>Sherry. This is the fourth deal; I know that deal, it has a large swell; I took particular notice of it, it is a very irregular deal.</p>

About seven months ago the plumber came to lay on a pipe for the water; there were twenty three deals in Grey Eagle street; Mr. Jeffrey desired me to remove them to the adjoining house, and one of these deals he took notice of; instead of one of the edges being square is is round; it is a very rough shaggy deal, one of the ends is round, and a knot in the middle with a hole in it; I made some marks on it with the paving hammer, chopping some wood for the plumber to make a fire.</p>

On the 18th of April I received, between seven and eight o'clock, ten deals of Mr. Tolley; I was ordered to saw them with three cuts in each. On the 29th of March be brought some of the same description as he brought on the 18th.</p>

               <p>Mr. Bolland. Have you at any time had any conversation with the prosecutor about this charge - A He made a remark the day he went to Hicks' hall when we went to find the bill; I asked him whether the business was done, he said he believed it was.

               <p>Q. On Thursday the 26th of last month were you in company with the prosecutor at a public house in George yard, Whitechapel - A. I was; I remember his saying to a person he knew, I am sorry for Tolley, I believe he is innocent, I am sorry for what I have done. I did not know the man nor Mr. Jeffreys at that time.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did he begin that conversation to the stranger saying any thing to him - A. There was talk before and after; he tossed up with me for a pint of beer and I tossed up with him; it was a bad house; there was more conversation, but I could not hear; there were a parcel of bad girls in the house, they made a noise.</p>
               <p>COURT. I should be glad to take the exact words that Mr. Jeffreys said - A. My best recollection is this, that Mr. Jeffreys did say these words - I am sorry for Tolley, I believe him innocent, and I am sorry for what I have done.</p>
               <p>Q. That is all that you heard - A. That is all that I can recollect; there was more said than that.</p>

On Monday the 16th of last month a person came into the shop for a pair of jean shoes; I tried them on, she said they would do; the customer wanted some pocket handkerchiefs, I went round my counter to get the scissars to cut the handkerchief off; I saw the prisoner at the bar come in, she asked me the price of a gown that was hanging on the shop door, I told her about five shillings; I did not watch her, I did not suspect her. When I had cut off the pocket handkerchief she took it in her hand, and said how good it was for the money; she went out; I did not know that she had any of my property; a neighbour opposite gave me some information. I saw the prisoner run over the way, and I almost flew after her; I never lost sight of her only as she turned the corner of a court; I stopped<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010055"/>her at the first door of the court; I took a white gown, a white cloak, and a nankeen spencer, out of her hand.</p>

On the 16th of May last I was standing at my own door, I saw the prisoner in Mrs. Smith's shop; as Mrs. Smith was busy, I saw her take something down; she then went to the counter, and the article that Mrs. Smith was shewing to the other woman the prisoner laid hold of with her left hand, while she tried to conceal the property with her right; in a short time afterwards I saw the prisoner come out of the shop with the sleeve of something hanging down before her; I directly ran over to Mrs. Smith and told her of it, and she pursued her and took her at the back door of our house, with the property in her hand.</p>

Early on the 15th of May, between one and two o'clock, I was in bed, I heard a violent knocking at the door; I got up, the prisoner was brought to my door. After I took the prisoner to the watchhouse, I went and got a bag of broad cloth from the last witness; I have had it ever since; it was wet in the bag.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Wheatley.) Was the bag of broad cloth that you gave to the constable; the same that you took from the prisoner - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Paxton.) Have you measured it - A. Yes, there is seventeen yards and a half.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you walk about the premises in the way the prisoner was described to come - A. I did; I found two more pieces of broad cloth rolled up laying over the wall in the field, where Wheatley had seen the prisoner near this little house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you compare these pieces with the piece you have in your hand - A. Yes, they appear to sit altogether; in length they made thirty four yards.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Wheatley says very false, he says he saw me coming out of the ground and pitching it behind the gate; he never did; I was coming home, I went behind the gate to make water; I was not five minutes behind the gate, when this young fellow and two more came in with him and asked me what this bag was: I dont know says I, I have no call to it; he says I will have call to it; he took me to his father's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010056"/>house. I went up into my own room and went to sleep; he went down to Mr. Furman and Mr. Green; they called me up; they took me out of bed up to the constable.</p>

On the 24th of May, about one o'clock at noon, my back was toward the door; I saw my apprentice run by me out of the door; on looking out I saw him hold the prisoner with one hand, and take a hat from him with the other; I ran out and brought the prisoner into the shop, I sent for a constable and gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>JAMES SPENCER. I am an apprentice to Mr. Pedder. On the day the prisoner stole the hat I was at work; I saw him pass the window with a hat in his hand, I saw the ticket on the crown, I thought it was one of ours; I ran after him, I catched him about three doors from the public house; I took the hat away from him; he said he picked it up, or found it, I do not know which. Mr. Pedder came and brought the man into the shop.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met with an acquaintance; we had been drinking a little, I got myself too far in liquor, more than I ought to have done; I passed by the prosecutor's door about twelve o'clock in the forenoon, I saw this hat, I thought I would purchase it; I saw the apprentice at work, the apprentice saw me; I took this hat, I put my foot on the door, I saw another acquaintance going by. I called to him, he did not see me; I being in liquor I went a yard with the hat in my hand, when I found somebody came behind me and give me a kick; I had a knock on the pole of my neck, I had a second and a third kick; I was knocked against a woman; I could have got away, but I stopped; I did not like to knock the woman down.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The prisoner was very forward in liquor I believe.</p>

About the beginning of last November I sent the prisoner to Mr. Hatchard, bookseller, Piccadily, to require the payment of one pound sixteen shillings; he brought me back word that they could not pay it, that there was a mistake in the ledger, in the entry of the name, it being credited to one Mr. Swan, the printer, instead of myself; I immediately sent him back to inform them that Mr. Swan was the printer, but not the seller; he brought back word that when they saw Mr. Swan and ascertained that it was right, they would settle with me; from that time till the 8th of May I have sent the prisoner more than a dozen times. On the 12th of May I went myself; I found that the bid had been settled on the 12th of December last, and that the prisoner had received the money.</p>

A man of the name of Ray came and asked me whether I had not lost a box from behind my cart; I looked, and said yes; he said if you will go with me I will shew you where you may catch the man; we both run together on the road after the man; then he went into a field, and there he dropped the box; I saw him get over in the field with the box on his shoulder; he dropped the box before Ray laid hold of him. I laid hold of him by the collar, I brought him into the road; some gentlemen coming along the foot path, I asked them to assist me; they took care of the man while I went and got the box; then I charged a constable with him.</p>

The box was white, and I had him directly.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Pike. I was making my mistresses bed on the Wednesday, I heard somebody come in at the street door; I asked who was there; Mrs. Welch answered me; the girl came into the two pair, where I was; she asked for the name of Mrs. Cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she come into the room where you was - A. No; she came into the passage; I met her in the passage; I told her no Mrs. Cotton lived there; I went into the room and finished making the beds. In about five minutes afterwards I went down stairs; I missed the belcher handkerchief off the stairs; I called to Mrs. Welch and asked her whether she had taken it; she said no; I went into the first floor; I missed the cloth out of the window, and I missed a gown.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards saw the gown - A. Yes; on Saturday, in my mistress's stall.</p>
               <p>- I was headborough of the parish of Christ's Church at the time this transaction took place. On the 7th of May, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was sent for by Mr. Pike to take the prisoners into custody; I conducted them to the watchhouse; when I got them to the watchhouse I took the gown and handkerchief off the elder prisoner; I asked her where she got them from; she said that the daughter told her a bargain was to be bought in Wentworth-street, of a woman of the the name of Mrs. Wells; I went from one end of Wentworth street to the other, no such person could be found; I took also two boxes from the prisoner, containing thirty duplicates, nine leading to this property. At the prisoners lodgings I found another gown and shawl; the elder prisoner told me this gown and shawl belonged to the servant of the prosecutor, I should find it there; she told me she had bought them of Mrs. Wells for ten shillings. The mother said she had been drawn in by the child recommending her to the bargain.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>

            . I belong to the East India company's warehouse. On Thursday the 26th of May the prisoner came into the passage of the house where I live, which is next door to the prosecutrix. I thought I heard something in the passage; I opened the door to see; she was standing there; I asked her what she wanted; she asked for a Mrs. Mills; I told her no such person lived there, nor never had; she said she supposed she came to the wrong house; she went away. In about five minutes afterwards I was standing near the window, I saw her go by with a bundle before her; I thought directly that she had been doing of something what has proved she had been doing of; I directly went to the street door to take particular notice of her dress and her person as high as I could, in case any thing should happen; in about half an hour the alarm was given that this person had lost her things; I told her what I had seen, and advised her to go to the pawnbrokers to stop them.</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH BELLENDINE. Q. Are you daughter to the other witness - A. Yes. I went up stairs, and a girl that lives in the next kitchen came up to me, and says your mother has been robbed again. I found it was true. Cummings said have you been robbed; he told me the description of a person he had seen; he advised me to go to the different pawnbrokers; I went to Mr. Lee, the pawnbroker; I described the things; he said he had just taken such things in, and when I saw them I knew them to be my mother's things; Mr. Lee detained her when she came to pledge the apron and shawl; he came to my mother and shewed her them.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. I am a pawnbroker; I live at No. 48, Broad street, Bloomsbury. On the 26th of May, about five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner pledged a bundle of things with me for five shillings in the name of

On the 12th of May, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came into my shop and looked at some pieces of marked leather; I was in the shop attending some other customers; he stopped about a quarter of an hour in the shop, and he brought a small piece of leather to the counter for me to take the money for; I think it came to three pence; he paid it and was going away; one of my young men came forward and said he had got some leather that he had not paid for.

               <p>Q. Did you find any leather about him - A.

            . I am shopman to Mr. Duncan. When the prisoner was in the shop I observed him secreting leather under his apron from the hole where the leather was kept; in doing which he dropped one piece of leather; he left it on the ground; he took up a piece of leather he had previously laid on the counter, and gave three pence for it; when he went out I called after the man, I said you have got some leather you have not paid for; he said he had not. I brought him into the shop, I searched him, I found the four pieces of leather in a canvas bag under his apron; the prisoner begged Mr. Duncan's pardon, he said it was the first time he had ever done such an offence, if he would let him go he would never come in the shop any more.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 25th of May did you see the prisoners in your shop - A. Yes, I recollect when I came down stairs they were there; it was a little after seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What order did you receive from the prisoners - A.Mrs. Taylor was receiving an order for mourning rings, with mottoes round them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with them. - A. Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time they were in the shop, did you observe any thing particular in their conduct - A. I did not; they were only shewn one tray of rings by Mrs. Taylor; they were laying on the counter when I came into the shop; in that tray were the rings and the pins in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them there - A. I do not know that I saw them there that day; I saw them before frequent; they were some of the most valuable rings, therefore we look after them first.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your taking the order the prisoners went away - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of some information did you follow after them - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. They gave you an order to make rings - A. They gave an order; I requested a deposit, as it is always customary with strangers; they ordered two at three guineas each, and one at a guinea and a half, I believe.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Did they say what time they should want them - A. They said they should want them on the Saturday following; this was on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after they left your shop had you reason to suspect them - A. When I missed the property, about five or six minutes after they went; I missed the the rings and the pins; the boy had been previously sent after them, he said they came in a chaise. I went up Cornhill, in Mr. Fearn's shop, nearly opposite the Royal exchange.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mr. Fearn - A. A jeweller. Upon goin there I found the two prisoners at the bar, giving a similar order; they were both of them conversing to Mr. Weddal about mourning rings; I shut the door to, I put my foot against it; I told Mr. Weddal I wished to speak to them when he had done with them; the tall one immediately turned round and said he would wish to speak to a lady who was at a coffee house hard by, and if the lady would wait the time he would give them the order.</p>
               <p>COURT. He would give Mr. Fearn the order - A. Yes. I said that I wished to speak a few words with him before he went; he swore at me and struck me a violent blow on my forehead.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all you said to him - A. Yes; I kept my right foot against the door, I seized him by the coat,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010060"/>which tore all down the left side; I told him I should hold him right or wrong as he struck at me; he struck at me several times; I took hold of his collar and secured him; I requested Mr. Weddal to secure the other, which he did; we took them into Mr. Fearn's parlour, and some rings were shewn me by Mr. Weddal.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the rings produced to you by Mr. Weddal your property - A. I identified two out of the thirteen, which are the subject of the present charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your pin - A. No, the pin was not found at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Where Mr. Weddal picked up these rings you do not know - A. No.</p>

               <p>COURT. Look at them and see whether you are sure they are the persons. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. When the prisoners came in you and Mrs. Taylor were only in the shop - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect a tray of rings being shewn them by your mistress - A. I do; when the tray of rings was shewn them, the short one took his handkerchief and wiped his mouth; afterwards he took his glove to wipe his mouth; then soon afterwards he said he had hurt his eye with the finger of his glove; my mistress thinking that he had hurt his eye very much sent me to get a glass of spring water to wash his eye with; I came back with the spring water, and he dipped the corner of his handkerchief in it; I saw him looking over the rings with his hand; I could see underneath that he was hooking them up on his little finger.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the little man that did this was it - A. Yes; then he took his handkerchief and wiped his eye again, and stamped his foot, and said what pain he was in.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the handkerchief could cover the ring if it was on his finger - A. Yes; then the tall one said you had better go into the chaise if your eye is so bad.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was the chaise at the door - A. No, I saw no chaise; the tall one had a riding whip in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. He had a jockey whip. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all you saw done by either of them - A. No; my master came down into the shop directly I heard the tall one say you had better go into the chaise; I went round the counter unbeknown to them and let down the lock and bolted it; then as my master was standing in the shop, I touched him on the hand, and asked him to come into the parlour, and then I told him what I had seen softly by ourselves; my master went round the other side of the counter, and took the order of them; the tall one gave a brass ring for the size of his finger, and a piece of hair to put into the mourning ring. I stood at the door till my master wished them good evening. I then opened the door and let them out; my mistress sent me after them to see what sort of a chaise they had come in; I went to look and they went down Lime street; I came back and told my mistress which way they went, and when I came back my master was gone after them.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you quite sure these are the men - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>EDWARD WEDDLE. Q. You live with Mr. Fearn, who is a jeweller - A. Yes; I am his shopman.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 25th of May last, do you remember the two prisoners coming into Mr. Fearn's shop - A. I do well, it was somewhere between seven and eight o'clock; their object was to buy pearl and mourning rings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to buy or to order - A.They wanted to buy at first when they came in, and before they went away they wanted to order.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect Mr. Taylor coming in - A. I do, he came in towards the latter part of their being there.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard the account that Mr. Taylor gave - do you recollect what passed - A. I do; when Mr. Taylor came in he spoke to me over the counter; he said I believe you know me, sir; I told him yes; upon that I saw him shut the door rather in a hurry, and set his foot against it; he appeared rather agitated.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoners see him - A. Yes, I believe they did; after that I drew my rings back, and the two particular rings, that I had been shewing them, I did not see at the moment at the place; I looked again at the place and I saw them; after that I saw one of them strike Mr. Taylor; Mr. Taylor said he wished to speak to them after they had done with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it struck Mr. Taylor - A. The tallest one,

            , I think with the whip in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say nothing more than that he desired to speak with them when they had done with you - A. Nothing else; upon that a scuffle ensued, and I saw him strike Mr. Taylor several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was nothing that past in your presence that would create a quarrel - A. Nothing but civility upon the part of Mr. Taylor; upon that the door opened, I do not know upon what reason, and they both went out in the street, Mr. Taylor and Charles Brown; I was sure all was not right, I secured the short one; the tall one was brought back, and pushed with his back against the counter, and after we had taken them from the counter and put them in the parlour, I found thirteen rings upon the counter in a purse, lying close by them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any of the things the property of yourself and master - A. They were not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body by at the time to put these rings on the counter besides the prisoners - A. I saw nobody at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any person have left these rings on the counter before they came in without your seeing them - A. I am quite sure they could not; I went round that very counter a few minutes before; these are the two rings which Mr. Taylor has claimed.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept them ever since that Wednesday evening - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at these two rings - A. These two are my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that these two rings were kept in the tray that you shewed to the prisoner - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen them in the tray - A. I cannot exactly say. I generally saw them there every day when I am serving in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say that you saw them on the day that you shewed them to the prisoner - A. No, I cannot, they were kept in the tray in a very regular manner; I arranged the rings before I left the shop; I said I missed two rings of the quality of these rings; one of them is marked the other is not; it is marked with a private mark, what we give and what we sell for; it is marked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010061"/>inside on the gold; it is never erased, it goes out to the purchasers with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say these two rings are your property - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the value of them - A. Ten pounds; they are worth more, and cost me more than twelve pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. What parish is your house in -

            . I am a housekeeper; I live in Camden town; I have some houses in St. Giles's; I was in town this Saturday night; coming past this house I heard watch and murder cry; I saw one of the lodgers at the door of the house; and I saw the prosecutor within; the woman had hold of him by the coat; I asked the man what was the matter; he said he had been robbed; I pushed the door open with my knee; then they wanted to give the man an old gilt watch; I told the man not to take any but his own; there is none else in the house but common women. Mr. Dancer is the owner of the house, he is the clerk of Bedford chapel; he is a fine man to say amen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have washed his clothes for these six months; he came to my house on Saturday evening; I told him I had a duplicate of a watch to sell; he said when he took his money at Somerset house he would pay me for his washing; he was to give me three pounds for the watch; instead of that he only gave me one pound five shillings.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was to give her five shillings and no more; she never washed for me; she robbed me of a shirt the first night.</p>
               <p>Q. She robbed you of a shirt the first night, and you go to her the second night. Did you know this to be a place for common women of the town - A. Afterwards I did; she told me it was her brother's watch that died.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time you were in his company had you any notes, or drafts in your possession - A. Yes; I had a hundred pound bank note, a check for twenty four pound, a two pound bank note, four one pound notes. I had them in a sample bag in the inside coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time that you were in company with the prisoner, did you take them out - A I did, in the back room in the White Swan; I asked Mackdonald to look at this check; I said I am not used to these checks, as I am of gold and bank notes; when I shewed him the check he could see that I had bank notes in my pocket; at the same time he gave his opinion, and another man sitting by said he knew Mr. Milton very well, the check was a very good one; I put the check into my bag, and put the bag into my pocket again; the prisoner and the other man had an opportunity of seeing me put them in my pocket; there were a good many people sitting there, but none that took any notice that I could see; they were playing at cards; this was about half after two o'clock in the afternoon; I had been to market to pay this money, but I was too late; I left the house in about a quarter of an hour; I met the prisoner again in Leadenhall street, about three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and he join in company together - A. No; I had something else to do; at eleven o'clock at night I saw him on the Surrey side of London bridge; he was walking the same road it appeared to me.</p>

               <p>COURT. Had they all slouched hats - A. Yes. There was a lamp that gave me a light.</p>

             was the man, most undoubtedly; his face was well known; after trying to catch him in vain, I went home. It might be then within ten minutes of twelve.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. How soon did you make this charge against the prisoner - A. I did not make the charge against him till the 7th of May, because he owed me six pound ten shillings and sixpence. I had a better opinion of him when I lent him the money that that he would become a thief and rob me on the highway; he promised to bring this money forward; I was persuaded to get the money first and take him up afterwards.</p>
               <p>COURT. When did he pay you this money - A. Two days before that; after that I went to Bow street; the prisoner was taken before the magistrate and there bailed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. How long after the robbery was committed was it before you went to Bow street - A. From the 1st of February, till the 7th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. That is near four months; had you been making any complaints against the prisoner or any body - A. Yes; I had been to Mr. Bligh about the business; but I did not tell him of the prisoner; I was afraid he would fly; I wished Mr. Bligh to go and see whether he could find the other men that were with Mackdonald; I supposed them to be two soldiers; he went up to the horse guards to see if he could see any loose people about; I told him that all three had soldier's clothes on, and great coats on, such as they call weather coats.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you describe to him that the three persons that robbed you had soldier's clothes on with slouched hats - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you describe at that time that the prisoner was one of three - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave him instructions to take up three persons - A. It does not signify to bother me; the prisoner at the bar is the man that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not you tell Mr. Bligh to take up three persons - A. Two.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that - A. Yes; I told him there were three men that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner present at the time you gave instructions to Bligh - A. Yes; he was very busy on the subject.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner hear the charge to Bligh that you gave against the three persons that he was to take up - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that he was not there - A. He came up soon afterwards.</p>
               <p>COURT. You told me the prisoner was present - A. He was there; he came soon afterwards; I was in Mr. Bligh's house; this prisoner came there.</p>
               <p>Q. How many public houses might you have been in this day - A. What day.</p>
               <p>Q. What day, indeed! I do not believe a word of it - A. I do not care whether you do or not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many public houses had you been in - A. Not above five.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you drank in each of the public houses - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you been drinking of - gin - A. No, porter; gin is not my liquor.</p>
               <p>Q.When you came to London bridge was you drunk or sober - A I was sober enough to know what I was about; I had my senses about me as much as I have now.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been drinking this morning - A. I have had two half pints of porter, and a glass of gin and bitters.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought gin was not your liquor - how came you to take it this morning - A. I had a pain in my breast.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober when you attended at Bow street - A. I was as sober as I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. You attended the night afterwards - was not you turned out of the office because you was beastly drunk, was not you told by the magistrate to go out, and did not he order the officer to turn you out - A. Yes, I was told so; I was not drunk</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever recovered any of your property A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. So this man, supposing your story is true, had all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010063"/>the four months to squander oway your money, and you never charged him of robbing you till the 7th of May, for the purpose of getting your six pounds - A. It is so.</p>
               <p>Then I leave you with the jury.</p>
               <p>COURT. How was the prisoner dressed - A. He was dressed in boots, blue coat and waistcoat, and a round hat; he was dressed like a gentleman; he had the same dress when I met him on the Surry side of London bridge.</p>

On the 28th of April, a little after nine in the evening, the prisoner came to our house, he brought two pieces of music on false pretence, he said they were ordered out of Holborn; he sent the boy down stairs; in the mean time he came through the folding doors of the hall and took from a peg an umbrella; I was in the drawing room, and just as he was going out of the door I came down stairs and detected him with the umbrella in his hand; he asked me what I wanted with him, I told him if he waited a minute I would let him know; I expected the butler up stairs in a moment to give him an answer; he asked me what I meaned by speaking to him in that manner, and walked away down the hall, and said because I suppose the umbrella was standing there, and I took it to walk about with it; he then walked backwards and forwards in the hall, and in a hurry; he put down the umbrella; the umbrella took my attention; I stepped towards it. In the mean time he got the door in his hand and got out; I pursued him and cried stop thief. In about the middle of the street he rejoined me in the cry of stop thief; he was stopped by Cunningham; we took him to the watchhouse and gave him in charge of the constable of the night; he refused to give him name, he said his name was Up! This is the umbrella.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did you observe me in the inner hall - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see me take down the umbrella - A. I did; the folding doors generally stand open; he came in as if he knew the way.</p>
               <p>- BROWN. On the 28th of April the prisoner came in, he said here is some music for you; I told him our people were not at home, they were gone to the play; he asked me if any of the servants were at home, I said yes; he said it take it down to the butler, it comes to twelve shillings, perhaps he will pay for it; I did; the butler was reading it; we heard a cry of stop thief; the butler ran after him and he was taken to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>- CUNNINGHAM. Q. You stopped the man in the street - A. Yes; I was going by, and seeing the man chasing the prisoner, and cry out stop thief, I laid hold of him; we took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I was delivered by the justice in Marlborough street to prison, I was informed by the clerk, as well as the governor of Tothill fields prison, that I should be committed for petit larceny, and I should be tried at Westminster sessions; I thought by the time the Westminster sessions came on I should be able to procure counsel. Thank God I have a clear conscience, which is as well as a counsellor. I must beg leave to observe that if I had meaned to take the umbrella, I should not have waited; when the footman came down and accused me of taking the umbrella, I was at least four yards from the door, and the door shut; if there was any thing wrong, it was in my deceitful friend who said he was butler at No. 34, Sackville street. When I was accused of theft, I thought I would leave the house to prevent any blame upon the butler; unfortunately I misunderstood him, or he gave me the wrong address; I declare to Almighty God, that it was my most distant idea to rob Mr. Calcraft. I shall leave my case in your hands and bow with submission.</p>
               <p>Peacock. He went next door to a neighbours, to a gentleman of the name of Taylor, but the butler did not believe his story.</p>

               <p>Q. Then I suppose his stables were in his yard - A. Yes. I was informed on the 14th of May, before four o'clock in the afternoon; I was at my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Somebody informed you something which made you come back to your masters - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you returned to your masters - A. Yes, I made my way to this yard as fast as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoners about when you came into the yard - A. They had loaded the dung which they had come to fetch away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Mr. Severn and King kept their oats in that yard - A. They kept it in the lost over the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any oats in sacks at that time - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the stable door open when they loaded the dung - A. I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the dung loaded on their cart; did you find any oats or any sacks of your masters in the cart - A. There were three sacks in the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they laying open in the cart - A. No, covered up with dung.</p>
               <p>Q. Any oats in the sack - A. Yes, there were about seven or eight bushel of oats in three sacks; I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say in consequence of your finding the sacks in that situation - A. Our foreman came along with us, he accused them of taking the oats.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell them where he suspected they had taken them. - A. No, he charged them with taking the oats; they said what they had got did not belong to the place; they did not take it from there.</p>
               <p>Q. They said it did not belong to your master - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say who they did belong to - A. No, not then. Mr. Bishop sent for the officer then, Mr. Griffiths.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the officer come directly - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When Griffiths came did the foreman charge him with the thest then - A. Yes, they said it did not belong to our yard; they persisted in it that it did not belong to our yard. Mr. Griffiths secured them; he searched for the oats first, and found the oats upon them; at this time the oats had not been found.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time you did not know where the oats and the sacks were - A. No, we only suspected they had got them; Mr. Griffiths took one of the sacks from the side of the cart, under a small quantity of dung that was over it; the others were near the bottom of the cart; the cart was tilted up to find them.</p>

               <p>Q. Then they were discovered by shooting the dung - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where this cart came from - A. Yes, from Eastham.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the day did they arrive in your yard - A. I cannot tell; it was about four o'clock in the day when I was sent for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Arabin. You know that Tollson is a servant that drives up hay to town, and the other prisoner a labourer - A. I have heard so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not they repeatedly say that the oats did not belong to you; I do not know whether you are countryman enough to know that turnpikes allow them to take any weight of manure; if there is a board or a sack then they are weighed; and if they have only a board above their weight then they are compelled to pay the penalty. You missed no oats, and they constantly denied them being your oats - A. I know nothing of the oats.</p>

            . I came to the yard; I sold them the dung, and I went from the yard into Whitechapel; and I came back into the yard again at four o'clock; they bought the dung before they loaded it, at eleven o'clock in the day; I went from the yard at three o'clock, and returned at four; and they had loaded it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the care of the corn and the sacks - A. I had, it was not kept in sacks; it was loose in a bin.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the corn bin shortly before you left the yard that day - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity was there in the corn bin that day - A. There may be as near as I can guess five or six quarters loose in the bin.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you when you returned perceive that any quantity had been taken from that bin - A. I could, there was an apparent deficiency in the bulk.</p>
               <p>Q. As near as you could guess what quantity might be missing - A. I saw there was some quantity gone, and it appeared to be lessened about six or seven bushel.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any sacks in the bin - A. Yes, some was lying on the bin.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found there was a deficiency in the bulk of the corn, did you see there was a deficiency in the sacks - A. Yes, there was; there should have been twenty sacks before these men came.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sacks were there when you perceived<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010066"/>this bulk of corn was diminished - A. There were nine teen sacks left that was missing; the sack that was missing is marked with a stripe; it is my masters sack there is two blue stripes on it.</p>

            . I went and informed my master that there was a sack short; our foreman, Mr. Bishop, stopped them and sent for an officer; we charged them with having stolen the sack and the oats I said as soon as the sack was taken out it was my master's sack.</p>
               <p>Q. They were charged with it and denied it - A. Yes; they said what corn they had it belonged to them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Arabin. Did you mark your master's sacks - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. These stripes are not your master's marks, they are the maker's marks - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. He only proves that this is a sack the same as his master's was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. I will ask you whether you do not know that these men who come to town with heavy loads, who are fond of their teams, they bring more corn than they are allowed, and that if the turnpike man see anything in the cart he will make them pay toll.</p>
               <p>COURT. Though farmers' men may take some more corn than is allowed them by their masters, six or seven bushels is an enormous sum, they could not want six or seven bushels, the horses stomachs could not hold it.</p>

I was; I searched the cart after I went in the yard; the men were charged with stealing the corn by Mr. Bishop, the foreman; I asked the men whether they had any corn in the cart, they said they did not know whether there was any there or not; if there was any they brought it with them; I desired the cart might be searched; I got somebody to go upon the top of the cart; I asked the two men if they had any more, to save us unloading of it; they said they did not know that there was any more, if there was they brought it with them; I desired the cart load of dung to be shot out, and then they found the other two sacks, they tumbled out.

The man asked me in Whitechapel to take the corn down to the Plough; he told me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010067"/>he would give me half a gallon of beer. Just after we had loaded the dung I asked this man to give it me up, to cover it under the dung, because of the weighbridge, because my master might be angry about it. While we were loading the dung I laid it behind some sugar hogsheads, because there were some pigs there.</p>

There were no watchman or constable there; I took him to the watchhouse.</p>

On Friday the 27th of last month, I was going through Shoreditch to go to Worship street; I saw a waggon at Mr. Holmes's warehouse unloading of bags; I saw the prisoner, who was the driver of the waggon rolling up the tilt to cover the goods; when he had rolled it up, he put it on the forepart of the waggon, and went immediately to the mouth of one of the bags and endeavoured with his hands to close it; I went up to the warehouse to see Rouse, Mr. William's man; I asked him if Mr. Williams was in the way; he said no. If you have got any message I will deliver it to my master; I said no, come with me to the door, he did so; I asked him if the prisoner was employed by his master; he said no, he was a person employed occasionally to draw goods from the wharf; I then desired the prisoner that was upon the top of the waggon, to chuck down the tilt; he seemed confused and asked me what I said; I said chuck down that tilt directly, which he did. I then desired Rouse, Mr. Holmes's man, to unroll the tilt, as it was rolled up; in unrolling it he found this quantity of horse hair rolled up in it. I desired Rouse to take care of the horse hair; I gave him that handkerchief to tie it up in; he did so, and when the waggon was unloaded I took him down to the office; on going down to the office he took this knife out of his pocket, and said he found it in London wall; it was open as it is now. I told him I was very sorry he had a knife, for if he had not he could not have cut the mouth of the bag; he said he did not cut it open, it was partly sticking out and he pulled it out, and he could not think what possessed him to do it; he did not know what to do with it when he had got it.</p>

               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>

            . On the 25th of April I was looking out of my one pair of stairs window; I saw the prisoner unpinning the two shirts, folding them up, and putting them into her pocket; I called out to her that the property did not belong to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was she when she was unpinning these shirts - A. In an open yard that goes down an alley far from the street; I told her again that the property did not belong to her; she still kept on. I ran down stairs as fast as I could and went to the causeway where she was; she was running up Stepney causeway; I called out stop thief; she was taken from behind some buildings; she was brought back to where she stole the shirts.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you suspect her - A. Because she pulled up her petticoats, and put them into her pocket. I was confident that she was not the person that belonged to them.</p>

               <p>Mr. Walford. This man had given you the sum of twenty guineas in order for you to teach him his trade - A. He certainly had.</p>
               <p>Q. You wished to get rid of him - A. No, I did not. I told him he would be of great use to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you promised to give him three guineas - A. I had, it was by his own proposal; I had not paid it him, I was to pay it him on the following day, but as we found my property on him, and he was going out of the house with them, he was taken in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not in the habit of selling shoes for you - A. Not a pair.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that he never sold for you a pair of shoes, nor recommended to you a customer - A. He was at the business before he came to me; after he had been with me a few weeks he said his aunt wanted a pair of shoes; I let him have a pair at the wholesale price; he always paid me for the shoes as he had them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he had bought shoes of you at the wholesale price - A. He had so, by single pairs.</p>
               <p>COURT. This man was an articled servant to you - A. He was articled to me for eighteen months, he was with me about six months; he gave me twenty guineas; I was to board, wash, and lodge him, and learn him his business.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he want you to give him - A. Three pounds or three guineas, and find him in work, and then he was to board himself.</p>
               <p>Q. He did sell some shoes for you, did not he - A. I cannot say he did; I sold them to him first; what he did afterwards I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not he take shoes and sell them - A. No; he had always a measure for the shoes that I sold him, I did not sell to him at haphazard more than once; they were two pair of shoes of a size.</p>
               <p>Q. You did trust him with two pair of shoes - A. I did, without having the money for them; he brought them back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the articles here - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you now upon your oath did you or did you not, either before he was in custody or after he was in custody, at any time say to the prisoner that you would give up the prosecution if he would give up the articles - A. I did when he repented he had done the crime. He said Mr. Stevens, I am sorry for what I have done, this is the first time I robbed you; I told him if he would give up the articles and go about his business, he might do for himself, or else he would come to be hanged; he said the articles were at an attorney in High street, St. Giles's; then I said Thomas you must go through the regular business of the law.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not to give up the shoes but the articles - A. The articles; nothing was said about the shoes then; he delivered me the shoes before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>SUSANNAH STEVENS. I am the wife of the last witness. On the 10th of April, between ten and eleven o'clock, as the prisoner was coming out of the back room door, he had this two pair of shoes, and the pair of shoes he had bought in the course of the week, under his arm; I looked very hard at him and he at me; we had missed shoes repeatedly, I said Thomas what have you got in that bundle; he made no reply but went back, stood at a box, and endeavoured to shove the two pair of shoes into the drawer at the bottom of the box; I said Thomas, is this your property; he said he had them in his possession ever since last Sunday; I told him another night he should not sleep in the place for he had been continually wronging us; I told him I did not wish to hurt him the least in the world only that he should not sleep in the house any more; I sent for the beadle; he wished to take him into custody; I would not let him till my husband came home.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. The prisoner used to board with you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any quarrel with the prisoner - A. Yes; he was impertinent to me and he had more power over my husband's property than I had; we had a great many words.</p>
               <p>Q. You know he had given your husband twenty pound - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you know that if your husband got rid of him at six months a great part of that would be profit - Ao. No; I do not think so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when your husband offered to drop the prosecution if he would give up the agreement - A. When the officer took him in my custody; my husband said if you are of the mind to go about your business and destroy your agreement, I will do nothing against you; he said he was sorry for what he had done, he had lodged them in an attorney's hands; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010071"/>first said that he had destroyed them.</p>

            . On Sunday the 10th of April, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody. Mrs. Stephens said he had stole two pair of shoes, her husband was out, she did not know what to do. I recommended her to keep the prisoner locked up and send for her husband; I locked him up; Mr. Stephens came home in about three quarters of an hour; I was sent for again; Mr. Stevens desired me to bring the prisoner forward; he informed me that he did not wish to hurt the prisoner, if he would destroy his indentures before me; his reply was, he had already done that; Mr. Stephens imagining that was false, said I must take him in custody; the prisoner then said he had lodged it in the hands of an attorney in High street. On the Monday morning I took him to Marlborough street office; the indentures were delivered to the prisoner at the office, and I believe delivered up to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford I take it for granted you have told us every thing that passed in your hearing; no such conversation passed in your presence, as that he was sorry he had robbed his master, that was the first time - A. There was nothing passed than what I have related.</p>
               <p>Q. And if he gave up the articles he offered to give up the prosecution - A. He did so.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have paid that sum of money to the prosecutor; and his wife frequently taking up unlawful weapons to throw at me, I told my prosecutor that I would go from him. On the Monday following I asked him for three guineas, I told him I would pay him in the course of the summer; and he has never set down to work with me the whole time I have been there, above one fortnight. I could make a thread when I went to him - but what could I learn from him. The shoes I bought of the prosecutor on the Monday before; I gave him eight shillings and sixpence for them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. How much was there left in the till - A. Thirteen shillings and sixpence in penny pieces and half pence; about eight o'clock I went to the till and counted the money; there was a deficiency of about four shillings and sixpence in copper coin; I asked him what money he had in his pockets, he said he had three pence halfpenny; I desired him to produce it; he did so; I examined and found it was not mine; I asked him if he had no more about him, he said no; I asked him if he was sure he had no more about him, he said no, he had not. On asking him a third time, he said he had more, but it did not belong to him, it was given to him by his mother; he pulled out about sixpenny worth; I saw by the marks they were mine; I desired him to put them in his pocket again; he was searched; there was four shillings and three halfpence found upon him, all marked money; I told him they were mine, he denied it and said it was his mother's; I told him it had my mark upon it, he seemed confused; I told him to take them in his hand, he would see a small cross upon them; then he said he took them from the till.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day was this carpeting missed - A. Between the hours of four and five, it was safe about a minute before it was missed. The carpeting was placed outside of the door; part on the pavement and part on a chair; I was sitting at work about six yards from where the carpeting lay; I could see a part of it as I sat, and when I turned my eye that way, I missed it. I went to the door the carpet was gone; I saw the prisoner at the bar with it: he was walking towards Holborn, I pursued him; he turned into Maryland buildings. I was very near him; stop thief was called; he turned his head and looked at me and dropped the carpeting; I knew it to be my carpeting; he was brought back to my shop and taken in custody.</p>
               <p>MR. SENIOR. I am a baker in Kentish town; I was coming from Kentish town on the stage; I saw the prisoner walking along with the carpetting; a few paces beyond Mrs. Fothergill's door. I saw Mrs. Fothergill come out and look round; I kept my eye upon the prisoner; he went into Maryland buildings, and when he came out at the other end then I jumped off the coach and ran after him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him - A. No further than while I was turning the corner; I am quite sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you catch him - A. I run him down Tash street, through Baldwin's gardens into Black horse yard; there he went into a stable and shut the door after him; when I took hold of the man I found I knew him; I said to him I know you; he said do not hurt me Mr. Thurgood, my name is not Thurgood though he called me so; going down Liquorpond street, I delivered him into the officer's custody.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>

            . On Tuesday the 17th of May, I was at a house opposite of the London hospital; I went up stairs to sweep some dirt away; I left my saw on the stair case. I heard some person come in; I looked out of the window; I saw the prisoner going out of the house tucking something up under his great coat; he turned up the first alley on the right hand; I never lost sight of him but while he turned the corner; I came up to him, I saw he had the saw under his great coat; he said he was very sorry for it, he hoped I would forgive him; Mr. Combes took the great coat from him.</p>
               <p>MR. COMBES I am an officer of Lambeth street, I took the saw from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner - A. No, I find he has been a very respectable man.</p>

This is the shawl, there is a blot on it. My mistress came down in the kitchen; he was desired to step up stairs; he doubled up the shawl, took it with him; they went into the parlour together.</p>
