The prisoner took the cloak, and the apron, and the handkerchief, and the money, I gave them to him for the ring; and he was to return them the next morning at seven o'clock, he was to come for the ring and give me three guineas, and return my things. The other man wished me a good night; and I thought by the manner of his behaving, he did not mean to come again. I went home, and looked at the ring by the fire, there was no candle, and I thought there never was such a stone as that set in gold. I went to a silversmith that lived near, and he told me, I had lost my cloak; he advised me to take the rascal, but he did not tell me what the ring was worth. I went to another silver-smith, and he told me the same: as I was going home, I saw the prisoner facing Scotland-yard, in Buckingham-court; I said to some children, that were there, there were the men, and the men hearing me, and seeing me, ran away; I called, Stop thief! and they were taken by a gentleman; and I desired the men to give me the things again, and the prisoner gave them me; he did not give me back my money, I did not recollect it then: the prisoner was committed.

There being a crest on them, I desired to know where he lived, he said in Poland-street No. 12, I told him I should go with him and see that they were his, he desired to have either the plate or the money, then he said he lived in St. Ann's court; I then immediately sent for a coach to take him to the magistrate, as soon as the coach came he said the plate belonged to his wife who was in the country, and lived in a gentleman's family; I said I should take them to a magistrate's, he said there was a man at the door could give me an account whose they were; the prisoner

I missed a great many things; and when these things were produced, they appeared to be my property. The first time I saw them again, was at justice Wilmot's, (except a pair of boots, which by the permission of Mr. Alderman Townsend, I took away; having nothing left but slippers this man having first made a mark in them, that he might<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160006"/> know them;) I saw the boots at the Red-Lion, at Tottenham, about the middle of the day; this was the morning after that I heard they were at Tottenham, at the Red-Lion. I found the man belonging to the Red-Lion, he told me he could not deliver any thing without Mr. Alderman Townsend's authority. I went to the Alderman, and informed him of my situation, that I had nothing to wear but a pair of slippers; he went with me, and I got the boot.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure the boots so delivered to you, were your boots? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Court. Had they been in the house the night before? - I had worn them the day before, I did not pull them off till eleven o'clock the night before; I delivered them to my servant.</p>

               <p>Is there any other person that speaks as to the time of the house being broke open? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>You are perfectly satisfied as to the identity of the boots? - Perfectly.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whether the house was fastened as to the outer fastenings? - I cannot tell as to the outer fastenings, being only a lodger; but a part of the window was forced open, and the tracks of feet from thence.</p>
               <p>LANE HARRIS sworn.</p>
               <p>Where did you get these boots that you delivered to Mr. Finch, by order of Alderman Townsend? - They were in this bag with the other things.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am one of the Toll-men. A cart came up, about a quarter past three, as near as I can guess, on the Sunday mor ning, the 29th of September, at the Green-lanes turnpike, going up to Hornsey; it came there, and two people in the cart appeared at first; they asked me to take my toll, they gave me all bad half-pence, and I disputed them; then one of the guards that was along with me, wanted to examine the cart; (we have two guards every night, for the safety of the roads, ordered by the commissioners) they said they had nothing but a bag of linen, and they hoisted it out themselves, that was this bag; he took it into the house, the guard's name is Bond: then he desired me to take hold of it, and see it; I put in my hand, and the first thing I saw was a child's frock, and I said it would not do; and I went to the horse's head, and stopped the cart. There were four in the cart, I stopped them all: one drove it, and the other set by the side of him, and the other two were laying buried under some hay, so that I did not see them at first. The men behaved extremely civil, and wanted to come down; they all agreed to get down to see these things examined; and as soon as they were got down on the near side of the cart, they all ran away, just like as one may say, shot out of a gun. The guard run after them on the off side of the cart, and shot at them, but there were only three swan shot in his pistol; and they all got off.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you an opportunity to observe their persons, so as to know them again? - Not me.</p>
               <p>Court. They all got clear off then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Has that bag been in your possession ever since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Does it contain the same things that it did then? - Yes, to my knowledge; there is Mr. Finch's name within the boots, and a mark I can swear to, which I put myself.</p>
               <p>The other things are the same that were in the bag? - To the best of my knowledge, I sealed it; I have no reason to think that any thing has been changed.</p>
               <p>(The things deposed to by Mr. Finch; and the boots deposed to by Harris, who marked them.)</p>
               <p>Court. What may the value of these things be? - I valued them at 10 l.</p>
               <p>Court. Put a moderate and reasonable value on the things, there seems to be no reason why you should under value them? - The other things I am no judge of.</p>
               <p>What other things are there? - Three muslin robes, I value them at one guinea and a half, they are worth more than that;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160007"/> here is another dimity robe, that is worth half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Court. Are any of the things marked Mr. Finch? - They are all stained with and wine, they were carried down into the country on purpose to be bleached, and I believe I saw them every day; I have not the smallest doubt of their being mine; there are three cotton gowns, I valued them at half a crown a piece; here are four frocks, value half a crown a piece, here are two skirts, value two shillings, an old pair of shoes which I know perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel to Mr. Finch. I suppose you do not know them by any thing but the general appearance? - No.</p>
               <p>To Harris. You say it was a little after three that the cart passed the turnpike? - To the best of my knowledge I had just been up to look at the person's watch that was in the house.</p>
               <p>It could not be more than a quarter past three? - I think not.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it? - It was moon-light, but the moon was clouded, it rather rained.</p>
               <p>Is not this turnpike eastward of Hornsey? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>How far do you take it to be from Barnet, take it the nearest way you can, suppose a horseman to go it? - About six or seven miles.</p>
               <p>JOHN BOND sworn.</p>
               <p>You were the guard at this turnpike in the latter end of September? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you remember this cart coming up to the gate; and stopping it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of observing any of the men, so as to know them again? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect whether the persons that robbed you had any weapons? - They had a case-knife, a common table knife, I did not see any other; I think the prisoner at the bar is the man that had the case-knife, but I am not positive.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's counsel. It was so dark you could not take any notice of his figure and face? - No Sir.</p>

               <p>I was standing at Mr. Haythorn's, the corner of Goodge-street, the sign of the Talbot, I heard a hallooing out, Stop thief! I pursued him over into these gardens; I went out of the tap-room door as he crossed the road, he run up the gardens; there was no person besides this man, the prisoner at the bar, he was going to run into another gateway, and he overshot his turning, there was no thoroughfare where he run up; there was nobody else before me, that place was Coye's Gardens; I pursued him up to the top of the gardens, he turned about and said he would shoot me, and then I withdrew a little back; I followed him again, and he turned about again and said he would shoot me; I saw his hands drop, and I laid hold of his arms and pinioned him, and secured him, that was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Was he ever out of your sight? - Never.</p>
               <p>Where was he when you first saw him? - Crossing the road, running right across from the Talbot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. Was any thing found on him that night? - No, but he went the next day and shewed where he had thrown the watch of the gentleman's, and we found it, I saw him at the office in the morning and I came away after I saw him, when he went in custody with two officers to shew where the watch was meant to be thrown, they found it, he carried them to No. 2 in Coye's Gardens; the watch was found in the house in a gentleman's pocket.</p>
               <p>What was that gentleman? - A dancing master I think.</p>
               <p>What was his name? - I do not know indeed, the runner took it out.</p>
               <p>Do you know how it came into that gentleman's pocket? - No, I do not indeed.</p>
               <p>Did that gentleman go back to the justices? - Yes Sir, he went and delivered it to the justice.</p>
               <p>Who was the justice? - I cannot say indeed.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman, I was within fifteen yards of No. 71, Charlotte-street, I came as soon as I could, these two men were coming within a yard of me, they came from the gentleman; they did not pass me, I did not let them; they crossed Charlotte-street into Pitt-street, and one of them blamed the other because he did not cut the gentleman's throat; if he had cut the gentleman's throat he said he could not have called watch; I cannot say what answer the other made, but he grumbled; and as we pursued them up Pitt-street, we heard something drop out of their hands, we thought it was a pistol or a watch; he turned to the right to John-street, and when he came to Goodge-street he turned to the right again into Coye's Gardens; there he was taken.</p>
               <p>Court. The two men that you saw, how far had you them in your eye? - One of them when he came to John-street, the prisoner at the bar turned to the right, and the other to the left; we followed the man that turned to the right, we thought he was coming into the body of the watchmen and the other was going into the fields, and we thought we should loose them; I kept my eye on him, but I lost sight of him for three minutes till he came into Coye's Gardens, I am quite sure, I kept him in my eye till he got into Coye's Gardens.</p>
               <p>Did you see Hinton that night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the man that Hinton was running after, the same man that you was running after? - Yes Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you take notice of the men as they came up to you? - Yes Sir, I took very particular notice. I knew very well the appearance of the prisoner; the prisoner is the very man that the gentleman called watch to; we brought him down to the middle of Pitt-street; we delivered him up to the other watchmen; and in the very place that the other witness remarked that we heard something fall, we found a large table-knife.</p>
               <p>You did not see any thing fall? - No Sir, only heard it, I cannot tell which of the men it was.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the finding the watch? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. When you first heard the cry of Stop thief, the gentleman was at some distance from you? - About fifteen yards.</p>
               <p>At that time the men were running away? - They were running to me, they came within two yards of me, and kept running on.</p>
               <p>What time had you to make any observations on the persons of these men, who were running towards you, and passed as fast as they could? - They did not know, you see, that a watchman was before them.</p>
               <p>No, but you told my Lord just now, that you had an opportunity of taking notice of their persons? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Was it light that night? - Yes, moonlight.</p>
               <p>Did you hear what the gentleman said just now, that it was so dark, he could not observe their faces? - He was frightened.</p>
               <p>You did not offer to strike them with your stick? - No, my stick is not a yard long.</p>
               <p>You did not see them for a moment? - I lost sight of them for three minutes when they came into Coye's Gardens.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that you never lost sight of them before they came into Coye's Gardens? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>I thought you was so lame, you could not run fast, just now? - I was not lame; I am not lame, I followed them as fast as I could.</p>
               <p>Did you see any pistols? - I saw none.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any evidence of this watch being found; here has been a talk of the finding this watch at a house to which the prisoner carried it; I expect some account of this: who is the committing justice?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My Lord, I had my watch from Mr. Fletcher, at the Rotation Office, in Litchfield-street; he is not here.</p>
               <p>Court. How came he by it? - I do not know.</p>

               <p>On the 3d of this month I was coming home, I saw the prisoner at the bar and another man, at Mr. Mackintosh's pockets, searching them, I was within three yards of them; I was in Charlotte-street, on the right-hand side coming out of Tottenham-street, about a dozen yards from the corner: I staid about a minute, thinking what they was a-doing; I believe they did not observe me, I was in black. I took particular notice of the prisoner, he was next to me; they turned from me after they had rifled his pockets, and crossed Charlotte-street into Pitt-street: I did not stop to ask Mr. Mackintosh any questions, but I believe he said, I am robbed. A little way down Pitt-street they made a little stop, and I thought they were going to turn on me, but they flung away a knife; I pursued one to the end of Pitt-street, one turned one way, and the other, the other: the prisoner turned to the right, and I was close to him. I called out, Stop thief! and when he got to John-street, as far as Goodge-street, he turned round to the left, and crossed Goodge-street: at Haythorn's corner, this man came up to my assistance, he was before that man; he ran up Coye's Gardens, which is no thoroughfare; there we took him and brought him back, at the end of Coye's Gardens. This man and I, and I believe, a person that lives at the end of the Gardens, came out, we met this watchman and some others; I told them to take him to the watch-house, and I said we will go to Pitt-street; and at the very spot where I saw him fling something away, we found a knife, which I believe is in court, a case knife, what a person dines with; it was the prisoner that flung down the knife, I never had my eyes off him, not a second, till Hinton got before me. The prisoner shewed them where the watch was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. You was nearer this man, than the watchman? - Yes, I was close to the prisoner; I did not see Berreghan till after the prisoner was taken.</p>
               <p>How far was the watchman from the man? - I never saw the watchman.</p>
               <p>How far was it off where you took the prisoner? - I suppose about one hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see Berreghan there at all? - Not till I got into Tottenham-court Road, out of Coye's Gardens, which faces Goodge-street.</p>

               <p>I went one night to spend the evening, and I staid above my hour, it was past eleven o'clock, on Saturday evening, three weeks last Saturday. I spent my evening at Cloth-Fair, I staid till about twelve o'clock, or near it; I could not get home, I could not get in, I lodge in St. Martin's le Grand; I went to a house to spend the night, where I was to stay with this woman; I met with her in the street: I went to a public house in <placeName id="t17821016-6-crimeloc32">White-cross-street</placeName>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160014"/>Were you drunk or sober? - I cannot say that I was quite sober; and after I had sat down to sleep, I do not know how long I was asleep, but I was awaked, and alarmed, and a gentleman shewed me some things which belonged to me, he asked me if that was my property; and he said I was robbed of it. I demanded it, but he said he could not give it to me unless I did appear before a justice, which I was obliged to do, to get my things again. I cannot say any thing against the woman, she did not behave indecent to me; nor can I say that she took them from me: the man was a Peace Officer.</p>
               <p>- WYER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a headborough belonging to St. Luke's; on the 22d of September I came into the White Swan in White-cross-street, and going into the parlour, a person said come into the tap-room here is a woman robbing a man, the man was asleep, the woman's hand was round him taking his handkerchief which was wrapped round his hand, he had a lame hand; I saw her take the handkerchief and a clasp knife: I found the opera glass in her bosom, and a half crown piece.</p>
               <p>Court. Were not there a number of other people in the tap-room? - I dare say there were thirty, he was in a corner and she sat by him close, there was another woman but she went off. (The handkerchief and opera glass produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.) The half crown piece I cannot swear to.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you miss any money? - Yes, I cannot be sure to say how much; I know I had a half crown piece in my pocket, and some money.</p>
               <p>Was that half crown gone out of your pocket? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you give this woman any of those things that were found on her? - I gave her victuals and drink, but nothing else.</p>
               <p>To Wyer. What did she say for herself? - She behaved as most of these lewd women do, rather impertinent with her tongue, but she was in liquor then, but she did not behave so the next day before the magistrate.</p>

               <p>Court. She did all this openly, and made no secret of it? - None at all my Lord.</p>
               <p>What did she say? - She said nothing.</p>

               <p>The prisoner lodged with me, he paid my wife some rent, and pulled out some money more than she thought he could come by honestly; she said that boy has been robbing some body; I hope it is not our money. I went up stairs and looked in my box, which was hid in my bed-chamber, at the head of my bed; there were half-guineas and guineas, to the amount of twenty-two guineas.</p>
               <p>Court. When had you counted the money in it before? - About eight days before, I missed it on the 22d of September, about one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Was the box locked? - No.</p>
               <p>Where was it hid? - it was up behind the bed in a corner.</p>
               <p>Who knew where that box was hid? - Nobody but my wife. The prisoner did not come home all night, the next morning I apprehended him at his master's shop; he owned he had robbed me, and that he had given a man a guinea, and eleven half-crowns; he said he took it, but not quite so much, he would not say the exact sum; I did not ask him where he took it from; he said he took it from me, he owned to about six guineas and an half.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you say to him to induce him to tell you this? - I charged him with it, and he said he did take it, and he hoped I would forgive him. I told him I must have him before a magistrate; I made him no promise at all: I apprehend he went in the day time, as my wife is hard of hearing, and searched the room. He did not tell me how he took it.</p>

               <p>The things in the knapsack were found in my house; two men came on Saturday the 17th of some month, I cannot charge my memory; one of the men seemed to be like a soldier, I know the man that was tried before, the prisoner is the other man, he is greatly altered, but that is the man; I came in while they were selling something to my man, my man bid him 5 s. for them, I offered them 5 s. 9 d. one said I will be damned if you shall have them, then they returned and sold them for 5 s. 9 d. they consist of old iron, and brass and locks, and several things.</p>
               <p>Court. Tell particularly what they are. - Here are the things mentioned in the indictment, the brass locks and iron locks, here is a part of the engine.</p>
               <p>Court to Horwood. What may these things be worth? - They may be worth 30 s. they are all mine.</p>
               <p>Court to Franklin. These men appeared like soldiers? - One of them had coloured cloaths on.</p>
               <p>They were both strangers to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to buy a variety of articles of these strangers worth 30 s. for 5 s. 9 d.? - To me, to sell again, they are not worth the money: I deal in all sorts of metal.</p>
               <p>Court. And with all sorts of people.</p>
               <p>Jury. I would give him 5 s. for one of the locks.</p>
               <p>Court. If you had stood at that bar, indicted for receiving these goods, on this evidence, that jury I have no doubt would have convicted you; I advise you to be more careful for the future: receivers make thieves.</p>

I missed a great number which I had seen the day before there under lock and key; several quantities of silks, of Manchester velvets, and some gold and silver stuffs for waistcoats;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160018"/> I do not recollect the livery cloth; the black striped velveret I saw the day before; the quantities are wrote down; my clerk has the care of the warehouse; the silk and embroidered straps I do not recollect; the brown sattinet I recollect, but not the quantity, I recollect seeing the buff the day before, the silk chain tabby I saw the day before, the black velveteen was an article that was in wrappers just sent from Manchester, the silk cord I saw the day before, the figured silk and cotton I do not recollect, the silk and silver stuffs I know very particularly, they were rolled up on boards, but I do not know the quantity; some corded silk I recollect the day before; the whole is found again, it will be produced in court; they had been trying at particular parts for the bolts by a little chissel, my door had a very strong double look, it was not bolted, because one of my principal men used to let himself in, that led up to the shop.</p>

               <p>In what state was it when you saw it? - It appeared to have been broke open by a picklock-key found in the apartment of the prisoner; that was the front door, the other three doors were all burst open; one was a glass door, they had broke the glass, and burst the door, I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and deposed to by the prosecutor as follows.)</p>
               <p>The first article, livery red cloth, I do not know; the striped velveret I know exceeding well, there is no mark on it, we keep them under lock and key, and cut them off as we want them; the silk and silver embroidered straps, they are for officers, I know them very well to be my property; the silver figured lace, silk and gold striped lace, both these I know perfectly well; then there is some brown sattinet that I know; buff velveret, that I know very well; sixty-five yards and a half of black velveteen, I do not know them so well; eight yards of silk cord I know perfectly well, I saw it the day before; the figured silk and cotton I know very well; the corded tabbies I know.</p>
               <p>Court. What value in general might all these things be? - They are valued, my lord, in the bill of indictment at about 110 l. my clerk put a value upon them.</p>

               <p>Court. Was nobody out after that? - No person could come out that way after, I had the key in my possession all night; and I always used to go in of a morning at six.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Racquett out of town, or the family? - He lay in town that evening.</p>
               <p>At his house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you let him in? - This is a back way that leads to the shop, there are other doors that lead to the house in King-street.</p>
               <p>Did you fasten them? - No my Lord.</p>
               <p>Who fastens them? - The servants.</p>
               <p>Are any of them here? - None of them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My Lord, this is a distinct house that joins the other by a wall at the bottom of a little garden, it is a distinct place where the business of the shop is carried on, and where the warehouse is, it is a small distance from the house that I live in.</p>
               <p>Court. But it belongs to the house, a part of the house and is a part of the dwelling house? - It is rather a dwelling house of itself.</p>
               <p>Who lays in it? - Nobody sleeps in it.</p>
               <p>Is it detached entirely from your house? - Yes my Lord, at a small distance, by a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160019"/> little garden that leads from one to the other.</p>
               <p>But is it intirely detached? - Intirely.</p>
               <p>Does it join to the wall of your house? - Yes, there is a wall on each side, I have a door from one house to the other, there is a door that leads into it both before and behind.</p>
               <p>Is there a communication between your house and this dwelling house? - Yes, I go into a door and go along my own garden.</p>
               <p>Then there is a door goes into the back part of this house? - It is all on the same premises.</p>
               <p>You have a communication from your house going through your garden to this place? - Yes my Lord I have.</p>
               <p>And you look upon it as the back part of your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But where were these other doors that were broke open? - They were up one pair of stairs, two were up one pair of stairs, and the other is a large work-shop; one opens into a cutting room for a foreman, the other into this warehouse where these goods were.</p>
               <p>Then the door that he locks double, does not that lead to the warehouse? - Yes it does.</p>
               <p>Court to Wright. What time did you get up in the morning? - At six o'clock, I lay out of the house in the same street, I found the door which I double locked the night before open; one of the men came to the door a few minutes before me, he thought I had opened it, he pushed it and it opened immediately.</p>
               <p>When you observed it, could any body have got through that door unless it was opened by a key or picklock? - No my Lord, and in the lock I found a bit of a pick-lock key as I apprehend, (a bit of a pick-lock key shewn to the jury) and here is a key that was found, from which it was apprehended the bit was broke, (the key handed up.)</p>
               <p>Did you try that key with the lock Mr. Wright? - I never had it in my possession; a person in court found it where the goods were, he brought the key and the piece has been tried to it; I know nothing more of the robbery than locking the door over night, and finding it unlocked the next morning.</p>
               <p>VALLENCE TRUNE sworn.</p>
               <p>I work for Mr. Racquett, I was the first that went to the door leading to the shop a few minutes after six, the door goes with a pully, I pushed it as usual, it let me in freely, I took no notice, I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you the first in the shop? - Yes Sir, I took no notice of any thing, I went up stairs, and set down to my work, till Mr. Wright came up and asked me if I did not perceive the door broke open, and the shop robbed; I said I did not, and immediately run down stairs, and examined the lock, and found the marks of some instrument, with which they had been attempting to break the door open in two places.</p>
               <p>Court to Wright. You say no other person was in the house? - I let in two or three with me; there were marks of violence on the door case on the outward door, where the first lock was picked: I did not see the bit found in the lock, I know nothing of the finding of the goods, I went into the warehouse, and saw it had been robbed.</p>

               <p>Court.

               <p>I am a watchman in Drury-lane, ; I was going down Drury-lane half past two, I saw three men walk down Drury-lane opposite to me on the other side, I saw these three men go into this house; Mr. Jones and the watchman called me, I went over; we heard a noise up stairs, I rapped with my staff, the door gave way, it was not locked or barred inside; there is a window that you might see into the burying-ground. I run out and rung my rattle, and went to the burying ground gate, I did not see the men get over; I came back again, and went up stairs into the dining-room, there was a little fire in the dining-room, and some knives and forks, and plates, and a glass of beer, about half full. I followed a foot up stairs into the front garret, there I found a young woman in this garret, set down on the side of the bed, I gave her in charge. Then I came to the two pair of stairs back room, and there was a bed; the door was fast, I burst it open, and there was fifteen pieces of silk, and two pieces of velvet; I carried them to St. Martin's watch-house. The time I was up stairs, the prisoner at the bar was not taken, I do not know where he was taken: I did not see any of the men escape.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman; about half past two, as I was crying the hour in Drury-lane, three men passed me, two of them seemed to be very merry talking to the third, who was a little behind, I did not take any great particular notice of them, I said you are very merry gentlemen, I wish you would give me some cloaths, you have more than I have, you seem to have cloth enough; the prisoner at the bar had a great load on his left arm, part of it hanging over his left arm, which caused his head to turn full in my face; they made me no answer.</p>

               <p>Did you take such particular notice of the prisoner as to know him again? - Yes, my Lord, he could but just pass me: I took particular notice of him, as he was obliged to turn his face quite close to me; he was near to the house, and the other men walked near to the street; I had no thoughts of any thievery. I thought presently there must be something wrong, and I turned round and followed them to the burying-ground.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that the prisoner is that man? - The prisoner is the man that went by with the bundle, but where he went I do not know, because I went one way and they the other, then I turned back, and thought I was wrong that I did not stop them; I went as far as the burying-ground, I thought nothing further of it. I stopt about a minute, somebody called me, it was Mr. Jones, who told me three men were gone along with bales of cloth, and they ought to be apprehended; I said they had just passed me; the other watchman he hits at the door, and we went in; I went into the house with Macmanus. In the first pair of stairs, the sash was thrown open, and somebody had made their escape; somebody was on the stairs, but in the dark we could not see who they were; the stairs is in the middle of the passage; they went up stairs, I cannot say how many there were. We came back again, and rung a rattle for assistance; I found nobody as far as I went. When we went up the stairs the second time, we found a woman in the top garret, finding the back door fast, I said here is a door fast, somebody made answer, but who it was, I cannot say, You must not break it open without a constable. Upon the leads of the privy there were two bags found. (Produced.) Then I came into the burying-ground, I did not stay the breaking open of that door, one watchman had lost the light out of his lanthorn; he picked up two bags on the leads of the privy belonging to the house, they are here, I can swear to the bags; the man that picked them up is not here, he went over a party-wall, and another man with him, who stooped down off the privy, and said, here is one, which was the prisoner Davis, he was in the privy; and as soon as he was apprehended he jump'd over a wall nearly seven foot high, or between six and seven foot; he put his hands at top, and reached up, and went over it; there they seized him, Richardson seized him; I staid to secure him.</p>

               <p>Court. Then he jumped over to you? - Yes, I am sure it was the prisoner at the bar, it was the yard of the house adjoining, not the yard belonging to the house.</p>

               <p>I am constable of the night of Covent-Garden parish, I heard there had been some Woollen Draper's, or Taylor's, broke open, and that a man and woman were carried to St. Martin's round-house, from a butcher's shop, the man's name is Lock that keeps the house; I immediately went in and found the landlord there, and I told him that as the two parties were taken from his house, and taken to the watch-house, I must search his house; I searched every room: in the dining-room where the greatest part of this property was found, which I did not perceive at first, there was some black cloth, a coat, a waistcoat, and three pair of silk breeches laid over it; I concluded somebody had undressed them and laid these cloaths down. I asked Mr. Lock, the landlord, who lodged there? and he said, Miss Pritchard; there I found this suit of new mourning, three pair of silk breeches, five of these pieces of silk.</p>
               <p>Mr. Racquet. My Lord, these cloaths were made for a particular nobleman; and when we came before Sir Sampson Wright, he very candidly gave them up to me, and I sent them home, they are my property.</p>
               <p>Court to Bambridge. What did you find? - There was five pieces of silk of different colours, three rolls of fustian, a large piece of livery cloth, and five other pieces of silk, and the buff velvet, and the corded velvet, the yellow epaulet, a piece of embroidered lace, a narrow piece of embroidered silk and gold; I asked the butcher if he claimed, or knew any thing of these; he said he had nothing to do with the apartments, he let them to Miss Pritchard.</p>

             stands indicted for the wilful murder of Mr. Herd. It is impossible for me to say anything to impress your minds with a greater abhorrence of the crime imputed to the prisoner, than what I am convinced you now feel; it is not my province either to aggravate the offence, or to say any thing to prejudice you against the prisoner. From the evidence that is to be laid before you, you are to judge of his guilt, I shall only therefore endeavour to narrate the circumstances of the case under the direction of the court, that your decision may be just; and I doubt not but you will by your verdict, do credit to yourselves, and justice to your country. Gentlemen, it is my duty to inform you, that the most material evidence against the prisoner is an accomplice; and though for the sake of publick justice it is necessary, that the evidence of an accomplice should on many occasions be taken, yet the character of an accomplice is held in law so infamous in itself, that without such evidence is corroborated by other circumstances, the testimony of such a man is insufficient to conviction. Gentlemen, it is necessary from the peculiarity of this case, that I should trespass a little on your time, more than I would wish, in opening it for your consideration; and I must inform you of one very singular circumstance, which is, that two persons, who from the evidence of this accomplice will appear to have been concerned as accessaries to this murder, were on the clearest conviction of their guilt last sessions, for robbing, and most cruelly treating the Rev. Mr. Bromley, made immediate examples of publick justice. Gentlemen, the case that I have to lay before you, or rather the outlines of that case are these.

             the servant twice attempted to fire, but his pistol flashed in the pan; there were several attempts to fire on the other side, only one pistol went off, at that time no mischief whatever was done, the gentlemen immediately attempted to make their escape; two of the robbers pursued Mr. Best and Mr. Herd, and two of them attacked the servant, one of them pushed the servant into the ditch, after they had severely cut him with their cutlasses; at the time that he fell into the ditch he heard the report of a pistol: Milbourne the accomplice staid with the servant, and the others ran to the place where the report of the pistol issued: sometime passed, and then the servant after being robbed got up, and as well as his wounds and bruises would permit him, crawled in the direction that Mr. Herd and Mr. Best had gone before, hoping he was the only sufferer; but to his great astonishment, after advancing a few paces, he found a dead body laying across the path, and as well as the light would permit him, he immediately recognized the features of Mr. Herd, who was quite dead, with the upper part of his head blown off! Gentlemen, it will appear to you from the evidence of Milbourne, that the prisoner was the man who actually fired that pistol; besides which, I am instructed to inform you, that the prisoner at the bar without any hopes of reward, or fear of punishment, has made a voluntary confession of the fact. Gentlemen, if the proofs which will be brought on the part of this prosecution shall have sufficient weight on your minds, so as to leave no doubt of the prisoner being the man that committed this murder, you will, in justice to your oaths and to your country, find him guilty.</p>

               <p>How many did you attack? - Four.</p>
               <p>How did you proceed? - Gray was the first man who caught hold of one of them, and instantly desired them to stop, on which a scuffle ensued, and we all turned round to protect each other, and there were blows on each side, there was cutting with cutlasses; Stunnell had a cutlass, Caddie had a pistol, Gray had a pistol, and myself had a pistol, and I had a cutlass besides; the scuffle lasted for about two or three minutes, when I fired a pistol, in order to let the people we attacked know we had such things with us; immediately after I had fired, two or three of the people ran away.</p>
               <p>Court. There were four at first? - Yes my Lord, one run intirely away which was a lad, and one did not run near so far as the other, Stunnell and Gray pursued on to overtake those that had run away, Caddie and me was with the servant, Caddie came first up to him and pushed him in the ditch, slightly shoved him; I staid with the servant, and Caddie went on after the rest; I took from the servant five, or six, or seven shillings, a bill of expences on the road, and a soldier's pass or something of that kind, which I afterwards destroyed; I had partly robbed the servant, and done every thing with him, when Caddie returned to me, and says high over here, meaning into the field; says he they have done him, I goes over into the field, and he immediately says, says he, I had scarce got up before Frank shot him; he said, says he, he is as dead as a stone, says he I saw him fall on his back, he neither stirred head nor foot, nor made the least motion; we went on together and we all met in the field and were asking what money there was, and that; Gray gave me all that he had, which was two or three guineas, I cannot exactly say the sum, and there was a gilt six-pence; I asked him for his buckles, he said he had no buckles, he had boots on, and we we went across the fields and went to Gray's house, where we shared the money; we said nothing further about it, but I went home that evening; we met the next day, and we did not seem to say any thing about it, but kept it quite silent and said no more about it.</p>
               <p>You did not spend the evening together that night? - It was very late when it happened, it was about half an hour after eleven.</p>
               <p>You all came back into London, did not you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did any conversation at the time that you joined pass, respecting the murder? - None in the least, we thought whether it would not come to justice.</p>
               <p>I mean when you met in the fields, for you told me that after Caddie came back to you, and said that Frank had done him, and he was as dead as a stone, after that you all four of you joined in the fields, did any conversation then pass respecting the murder? - No, I cannot say particularly there was, we were proceeding on as fast as we could to get to the place.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. Gray was the first person was he, that made the attack? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were you and your accomplices all close together when the attack was made? - It is a narrow path, but we walked one after the other, the people were all in company; I was the last, I walked behind, Gray was the third.</p>
               <p>Did the other two persons then go past any of the persons? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And Gray made the first attack? - Yes.</p>
               <p>On whom? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>But you was the first person that fired, was you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far might the four be from you at the time you fired the pistol? - About five, or six, or seven yards.</p>
               <p>Then you fired the first pistol that was fired, did you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know particularly what direction you gave your pistol? - I did it merely to let them know we had such things with us.</p>
               <p>But I suppose that in commissions or acts of this kind, you are not perfectly clear what you are about, are you? - I cannot say I was confused at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160026"/>I am sorry to hear it: then you do not know what direction your pistol took, do you? - I know it went wide from the spot where the people were, for it was not my intention to hurt them, it was only done as a signal to let them know we had pistols.</p>
               <p>Caddie returned to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He made use of no expressions explanatory of what was done, but that Frank had done him, he did not say that Frank had shot him or any thing of that sort? - That means one among another, such people as us, it means killing him.</p>
               <p>Do not you apply the word in general to the act of robbing them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Not particularly to the act of shooting, do you? - No.</p>

               <p>I believe you are servant to Captain Best? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you in company with Mr. Herd and Captain Best when this unfortunate accident happened? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Relate the circumstances as nearly as you can? - On Friday the 17th of May, about twenty minutes after eleven at night, Mr. Herd, my master, and me, and a little boy was coming from No. 85, Old-street, we pursued our way by the Shepherd and Shepherdess, in order to go to Canonbury-Place where he lodged, as we came up to the ditches a little below the Shepherd and Shepherdess, we met four or five persons, who passed us singly, we gave them the way, and they turned round upon us after they had passed us, with this expression, Damn your eyes I'll blow your brains out if you do not deliver your money; we defended ourselves as well as we could, and drove them off, beat them off to the posts; I had a brace of pistols, one man seemed more daring than the rest, he came back, and I could see something in his hand like a pistol or a blunderbuss, and I attempted to fire a pistol at him, which flashed in the pan; that was the shortest person among them.</p>
               <p>Can you at all describe what sort of a person it was? - It was very much like the prisoner at the bar, but I cannot swear to his features, he was the shortest of any of teo rest: after I had attempted to fire my pistol, he attempted to fire at me, his snapped and mine flashed, after his was snapped, I attempted the second which flashed likewise, at the same time Mr. Herd and my master attempted to make their retreat and go away; they were pursued by two or three of these men, two of them got before me in pursuit of the two gentlemen, the little boy got away before the two gentlemen; as the gentlemen went away, two of the party followed them, and two stayed with me and cut me in several places.</p>
               <p>Court. Did one, or both cut you? - I believe both, they struck very violently at me with their cutlasses, I defended several blows, I was cut in my arm, my head, and my thumb; just after they had cut me they threw me into the ditch, and as I fell into the ditch I heard the report of a pistol going off, they pushed me into the ditch, one man left me, and another stayed and robbed me; the man that stayed and robbed me was a tall man, and very much like Milbourne; the night was very dark.</p>
               <p>Had you been with Mr. Herd all day? - No, I came to fetch him home at night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Best had been with him all day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After you got out of the ditch which way did you go? - I pursued my way towards the Britannia, I went about ten or fifteen yards; I saw something lay on the ground, when I went up to it I found it was the body of Mr. Herd, laying with his head towards one bank, and his feet towards the other, laying on his back as if he had been laid out; from the glimpse of the night which was very dark, I could just perceive the top of his head, and his hat was gone, he was quite dead; I took up his hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. The persons all passed you, did they? - I believe they did, they turned round very quick and attacked us all just together.</p>
               <p>He was a tall man that was engaged with you? - Yes, at the last, but I engaged with the shortest at first.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160027"/>What sort of a man was the other man that engaged with you before he left you? - That was a shortish stiffish man, but rather taller.</p>
               <p>Did you see the others that pursued your master and the gentleman? - I saw them come back, they came by me and run very fast.</p>
               <p>Did they say any thing? - Not a word as I heard.</p>
               <p>What kind of persons were they that returned? - One I know was a shortish person, and one was thinish.</p>
               <p>You cannot recollect the features of any of them? - I could not it was so dark.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you tell me whether one came back first to the man that robbed you, or whether you never saw them till they all came by you when all was over? - They came one after another.</p>
               <p>What kind of a man, as near as you can recollect, was the person you saw return? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>After you heard the explosion? - He was rather a stoutish man, and not so tall as the evidence.</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN BEST sworn.</p>
               <p>I was in company with Mr. Herd when this unfortunate accident happened. On the 17th of May last, returning from Old-street towards Islington, we were stopt between the Shepherd and Shepherdess near Islington, by four or five men; we could not see any of their faces: they demanded with a good deal of rough language, our money, and fired; on which a scuffle ensued; they got the better of us; the man was cut all to pieces, and Mr. Herd was murdered. I retreated to Islington, there I alarmed the watch; I got two watchmen, and several other persons to my assistance; I came back to the place again, and they took the body away.</p>
               <p>At what distance might you be from Mr. Herd when he fell? - A very small distance, about two yards.</p>
               <p>Can you speak distinctly respecting the direction that the ball came from? - The person stood close to him. I saw the person was a little man; it was dark at the time, but I could distinguish him by looking rather low.</p>
               <p>You are sure the person who fired at Mr. Herd was a little man? - A little man, I cannot recollect the features.</p>
               <p>Did you take any particular notice how Mr. Herd was dressed? - In a kind of pom-padour coat.</p>
               <p>Had he shoes on, or boots? - Boots; he had been riding with me that day.</p>
               <p>He was killed instantly on the spot? - Instantly; he never stirred afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. In that unhappy situation you was in, did you notice the persons of all the parties that attacked you, when they first came up? - I saw there was several men; I saw they were all middling sized men.</p>
               <p>You did not take observation enough of the parties to distinguish one from another? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>I am turnkey at Clerkenwell Bridewell.</p>
               <p>You must be very attentive to the questions I am going to ask you: I am going to examine you respecting the confession made to you, in the prison, by the prisoner at the bar. - Let me tell my own story.</p>
               <p>But I must ask you a question; I must first ask you was any thing said to the prisoner, any promise made of lenity towards him, or was there any threat made him if he did not confess? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>What he said was perfectly voluntary and unextorted? - It was Sir. The morning Gray was apprehended, I received an order to bring the evidence Milbourne before Mr. Justice Wilmot; I went with Milbourne, and when the examination was ended, Gray expressed a desire to have some conversation with the evidence Milbourne; the evidence agreed to it. I went into a private room with the evidence, and Yardley, and the prisoner;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160028"/> after some conversation had passed between them, which I do not particularly recollect, Gray asked me how I did, I told him I was very sorry to see him in that situation; he shook his head: I told he could expect nothing, but to prepare for his latter end. After other conversation, which I cannot recollect, he said he was not so bad as some of the rest; and he mentioned a circumstance respecting Milbourne, where Milbourne had wantonly cut some people; and Milbourne confessed it. Then he referred to this transaction; he said that Mr. Herd had struck him several blows, that in consequence of these blows, he retreated back, and met Stunnell, he said, he snapped the pistol twice or thrice, and it missed fire; he told Stunnell how Mr. Herd had served him; Stunnell replied, we will go back and DO him; they accordingly returned back, according to his own story, and Stunnell armed with a cutlass, struck him several blows over the head, he snapped the pistol, but it missed fire; he said he desired Stunnell to desist, Stunnell desired him to stand out of the way, and held up his cutlass, and striking at him again, the blade of Stunnell's cutlass struck the cock of his pistol, and it fired: and that was the cause of his death.</p>

               <p>Say what you have heard? - Word for word as Mr. Fletcher has said. I asked him what became of the pistol after he had fired it; he said he threw the pistol into a pond; but he hoped if I found it I would not produce it in evidence against him.</p>
               <p>Court to Captain Best. You was near enough to distinguish that the person that shot the pistol was very close to Mr. Hurd? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>You could not distinguish whether there was one person or two? - I believe only one.</p>
               <p>I suppose you would have taken notice if you had seen any body cutting him at that time? - I did not see any person cutting him at that time.</p>

               <p>In the morning I was called up at one o'clock, I went to the Crown at Islington, I saw the deceased Mr. Herd; he had several wounds: one on his head, and one on his wrist.</p>
               <p>PRISONER.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I have two witnesses out of the country; here is a gentleman in court which met them going home, which is Mr. Kirby; I had them with me two hours this morning: they are at the Four Kings.</p>
               <p>The witnesses were called, but did not appear.</p>
               <p>The learned judge summed up the evidence, observing that if a robbery is committed, and any one person is killed in consequence of that robbery, all present were equally guilty: therefore it was totally immaterial who shot the pistol, if the prisoner was present, aiding and assisting.</p>

               <p>Were the marks of taking it out fresh? - Yes, my Lord, a great deal of mortar and smut, there was some iron work missing, but we did not find that.</p>

Says I, damn you, you shall go to the watch-house; I gave him a jerk by the collar, and the cord slipped, and I saw the copper slip out of his hand, and he tumbled himself off the pallisadoes; I saw the cord in his hand, which was round the rim of the copper, he had got it just to the edge of the brick work; I thought at first it was the top of a water-tub, or something of that sort.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a labourer working in the warehouses with the prisoner: time after time we have had complaints from our employers of the tea being missed out of the chests. I saw the prisoner standing by a chest of tea, he dipped his hand into it twice, and put his hand into his coat pocket; it was half an hour after two, the 9th of this month; there were many men in the warehouse, twelve or thirteen, but no one saw him but myself; there was a man stood at the right hand of him, and did not see him. I told my employer as soon as I could conveniently get down stairs; it was not prudent to tell it immediately, because the tea would have been scattered about the warehouse. They came and took him out of the warehouse, and desired him to strip, they searched him, and found the quantity of tea now produced: I was not present then. I gave the information to Mr. Hampshire, Mr. Kemble's clerk.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. Why did not you discover it immediately my friend, there were men about that would have laid hold of him by the arm, and prevented him scattering it about? - I did according to my master's order.</p>
               <p>You are a labourer at that place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>These ten or a dozen men never saw it? - No; what I have sworn to I will abide by; the nearest was an old quaker, he was on the other side of me, he never saw it: I do not intend to be brow-beat.</p>
               <p>It was very fortunate that you should see him? - Whether it was fortunate or unfortunate, it is not my fault; I was watching him in particular, I watched them all; I had a suspicion of another man, but I cannot tell another man's heart, it is out of my power. I came here to speak the truth; I do not wish to speak any more than the truth.</p>
               <p>You are very clever? - I am not over and above clever, but I wish to be honest; and I wish you and every body else was so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. My friend, if you think this gives you any credit with the Jury, behaving so very impertinent, I wish you joy of it: but you do not behave with decency.</p>
               <p>- REYNOLDS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the warehouse keeper; I was told some tea was lost: I asked the prisoner if he had any tea about him, he said not. I had him searched, and his breeches were full; I ordered him to go to my office, and pull off his breeches, in which were two pounds and three quarters of tea, which is now in court.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. Who do you live with? - I am warehouse keeper to the customs. I know the tea was brought out of the warehouses in the possession of Mr. Venn and Kemble for the captors, it is prize tea, for Commodore Johnson's squadron; the warehouses are private property, they are hired by Mr. Venn and Kemble till next January, as I have heard them declare.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am innocent.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called eight witnesses who all gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Jury to Reynolds. Can you ascertain the tea that was found in his breeches to be the same that was taken out of the chest? - I cannot.</p>

               <p>About a fornight since I put a sum of money in my desk, in the counting house, in the evening, when I went to lock up my money, I should something short, one and an half, or two, but one and an half positively; I put in thirty guineas and an half, and I found only twenty-nine. I suspected that some person in the house had robbed me; I clear the till in the middle of the day and lock it up, an uncertain sum, it is not usual for us to tell it, but this was a certain sum I had taken of a customer; I mentioned my apprehensions to my partners, and asked them if they had taken any money from the next box, they said no. I said I would mark some money, and put it into this box; I marked fourteen guineas and an half, and put it into the same desk, in a little bowl; in the evening I found only thirteen and an half of that I am clear; the prisoner stood near me, he was clerk to us; I had not resolution enough to seize him, though I strongly suspected him.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the desk open or locked? - It was sometimes left open, and he had access to it by that means; I did not take him that night, but I told one of the servants to ask him to lend him three or four guineas, which he did, but he said he had only some silver. I put in the remaining thirteen guineas and an half; and the next evening, which was last Thursday, while I was up at tea, the servant whom I told to borrow the money of him, came up to me, and said, Sir, I am very fearful the clerk is the person that you suspected, for I saw him at your desk with the bowl in his hand. When I went down, which was not immediately, I found the money just as I had put it in, thirteen and an half: hearing that the prisoner had been at the desk, I suspected that he had found he had a marked guinea. I determined to mark some money in another way; this was a visible mark with a cross; next morning I marked 19 guineas; in the afternoon between four and five, I called the servant into the counting-house, and bid him see that I put nineteen guineas into the bowl; and between six and seven I went to the money, and told it, and found one guinea gone; I told my partners here is one guinea short of what I can swear I put in, and I suspect the <rs id="t17821016-16-deflabel84" type="occupation">clerk</rs>

I went and mentioned it to the prisoner, and told him my suspicions: he said, How can you suspect me, you are welcome to search me? I found nothing about him but a few shillings; he persisted in his innocence; I told him to pull off his shoes, I found nothing there. I was fearful I had suspected a wrong person; I was ready to make concessions to him. Then I searched the rest of the people in the house. I told the prisoner if he would confess, I would not take any notice of it, he still persisted in his innocence. The servant said, let him take off his breeches; the prisoner replied, you would not be so indecent as to have me strip. I insisted he should pull off his breeches, and he pulled them off, and immediately the guinea dropped out. The prisoner fell down on his knees, and said, for God's sake, have mercy on me, I am a ruined man. I took up the guinea, I found it marked in the same manner as the other eighteen guineas; I gave it to the constable

There was a linen gown and a marcella petticoat I saw in the prisoner's custody in her apron; and when she beat me, I took and I doubled her hands in her cloak, and I gave her a push, and made her drop the things; she said they were her own.

Did you see the things taken from her? - I saw the prisoner on the stairs, I asked her who she wanted, she said one Mrs. Wilson; I had a difficulty to pass her with the bundle, and being with child as she is, I spoke to her out of a civility, and said I hope you are not come to rob people? she said what she had was her own.

               <p>I live in St. James's-street; on the 14th of September, a little before seven, as I was going down Little St. James's-street, near the end, three men rushed by me, one of them asked me what it was o'clock; I crossed the way, and as I crossed, I heard a carriage pass me, and I looked round to see if I was clear of it, and I knew it to be the Colonel's, by the horses, they are particular horses; and I saw the prisoner with three fellows, behind the chaise; the footman was on horseback; they rushed by me, and run up the street: I suspected their intention was to cut what was behind the chaise; I was determined to see the event. I wondered the servant had not trod on them, they got between the servant and the phaeton. By this time, the chaise was facing my own house; I run very fast, and came up with the hindermost of the three. The chaise turned into Dover-street, and I run so fast that I came up with the chaise, then the prisoner and the other men fetched a pull, and down came the trunk; when the trunk was down, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160035"/> prisoner took up one end, and the other men took up the other, it was very dark, they got it up; it was down in a moment: they carried the trunk along Stafford-street, in the middle of the street I perceived a light, and I jumped in between them, says I, put this trunk down, they all three said blast your eyes; the prisoner struck the trunk against my legs; I was so hesitated I jumped back, and called, Thieves! then they all three dropped this trunk, and run away; the prisoner was hindermost; he was taken. I am sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>What sort of a night was it? - It was between dark and light.</p>

               <p>How soon after you was robbed? - In about half an hour after, I heard of it almost immediately; I went to Justice Sherwood; I made up to the Green Dragon and cried for assistance, I stopped there, and the gentleman that met them with my property took it from them, and told me had taken the man that had robbed me; there were two men in custody at the Justice's, the last was off; the two men were Thompson and West; I know West in particular, because he was pitted with the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160036"/> small-pok, and I hanged round his neck, and begged he would not kill me.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Saturday evening about eight o'clock, going between the Ship in Sun Tavern fields and Brick-street, there is a vacant space, I heard in Stepney Fields, a melancholy cry of murder, murder, oh do not kill me! I stopped a few moments to consider what to do; I looked for some person to go with me; I ran down the lane by myself, but considering it would be dangerous to go alone, I turned back and ran into the Ship for assistance; I said, I believe there is a gentlewoman murdering in the fields, there was nobody in the tap-room, I heard voices in another room, there were three men there that were smoaking their pipes, they laid them down directly, and went with me: here I must observe, that when we came out of the door the cry of murder was over, and the three men heard nothing of it; when we got half way down the lane, one said, let us go back, it will all come to nothing; I said, I will go first, and I ran before them: in this situation, near the bottom of the lane, I met West and the prisoner Thompson.</p>
               <p>Court. How far was the place where you heard the cry of murder, to the Sun Tavern? - Three or four hundred yards. Thompson and West attempted to shun me, by going close to the bank, I immediately suspected them and collared Thompson with my right hand, and with my left I pushed West against the bank; in this situation the people behind came up, I asked Thompson what they were, Thompson trembled, and made no answer; West said, damn you Sir, what is that to you, we are going about our business: when the people behind came up, I observed a bundle under West's right arm, I put my hand to it and some of the rest did the same; it was a woman's gown; a man that stood behind me and Thompson at this instant, said Sir, I have picked up a cloak that Thompson has dropped from under his arm.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Thompson hear that man say that the cloak had dropped from him? - He made no answer to it that I can recollect; he went very quietly, the other tried to escape, but was prevented; after they were properly secured, I went with three or four men to search for the woman; we called out, no person made any answer, and we found her at the Green Dragon; we brought her to Justice Sherwood's, and took her over to the public house where the two prisoners were; immediately,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160037"/> as soon as she saw them, she said these are the men; she pointed to West, this is the man that was going to kill me, and this poor fellow saved my life, pointing to Thompson.</p>
               <p>Court. What condition was the woman in? - She was much flurried, she was in her petticoats and shift.</p>
               <p>Court. Had she the appearance of a person who had been robbed? - Yes, Sir, robbed and ill used.</p>
               <p>Court. You, Mr. Lundin, acted a very spirited and a very honourable part; and the public are very much indebted to you, very much, indeed!</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was at one Mr. Clayton's, at supper, and heard the cry of murder; I ran down Vinegar-lane to the bottom; I said, where are the thieves? somebody said, here is one, that was West; I took him to the ship till he was properly secured; I saw a white handkerchief taken out of his hand by a young man.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see any thing under his coat? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>- WEST sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 14th of last month I was at the Turpentine warehouse, I heard the alarm of murder, and ran down the lane; I saw West with this gown under his arm, and the white handkerchief I took out of his hand; the other people had stopped him; I immediately collared him; coming into the ship he said, Damn my eyes I will mark you; I up with my fist, and I hit him; at the same time Thompson being in company with West was brought into the Ship.</p>
               <p>- COLE sworn.</p>
               <p>About nine o'clock a man ran over to the house where I was drinking, and said you must come immediately, two men have murdered a woman; I went to the Ship, and there I saw two men standing with twenty people; I asked them who was the prisoners, they shewed me the two men, I immediately went to handcuff West and this man together; West behaved very bad, Thompson behaved very well.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you the things put in your care? - Yes, my Lord, this handkerchief and this gown, this cloak, and this apron, and this knife.</p>
               <p>Court to Lundin. Do you know how the apron came there? - I took notice of nothing when they were apprehended but the gown and cloak.</p>
               <p>- Cole. A little boy brought in the apron and the knife, and said he found them in the fields just where the robbery was done.</p>
               <p>(The things deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Court to Lundin. The person that took up the cloak is not here? - No, Sir, nor none of the three men that helped me to stop them.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am very innocent; I was coming from my daily labour, I went home to my wife, she was gone out, I went to the Britannia, near Limehouse church, there I had a pint of beer; I met West coming over the fields, says I Jem, what have you got here? he said, they are some things that I picked up: I said, I wish I could get out of your way, and this gentleman came up and took me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner brought thirteen witnesses, who had most of them known him from his infancy, and all gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Your money was safe in the morning at ten o'clock? - Yes, and at half past ten, if the girl put the half guinea to it, which I believe she did.</p>
               <p>Then your wife went out, your girl was left at home, you went out, and when you came home you found the robbery had been committed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you any lodgers? - The lodgers go in at another door.</p>
               <p>What lodgers have you? - Five families; I keep all the lower apartment.</p>
               <p>I suppose your door that connects with your stair-case is always open for the convenience of these people? - No Sir, no access for any of these people in the part that I occupy, without they break open the door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. You put up this money yourself in the cupboard? - I counted it, and my wife put it up in my presence.</p>
               <p>The prisoner had lived with you some time? - Yes, seven months.</p>
               <p>Did you inquire whether he had been out of the house? - I understood a stranger had called him out, and he was out ten or fifteen minutes.</p>
               <p>What neighbour was in the house with you? - His name was Elphinstone; he was sent for by the prisoner and my daughter before I came home.</p>
               <p>How old is your daughter? - She is about fifteen.</p>
               <p>Is she well grown of her age? - You will see her presently.</p>
               <p>Is she a well disposed girl; so far as you know? - She has had the care of my house and shop.</p>
               <p>Is the obedient? - She durst not disobey me, I will be obeyed.</p>
               <p>Then she lives in fear of you? - She has a right so to do.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had any quarrel with her to any extent? - Never, no further than is customary.</p>
               <p>Has she any female acquaintance that ever come to visit her? - Very few, every body has some acquaintance no doubt; they are all older than her.</p>
               <p>Has she any male acquaintance? - None that I know of.</p>
               <p>It was in consequence of the frequent persuasions of the officers at the Justice's that you made searches? - No doubt.</p>
               <p>Where does the man lodge? - I hardly know upon my word.</p>
               <p>No property was found upon him? - No more than my handkerchief.</p>

The handkerchief was a red spotted one, the spots much washed out, and a stain in the middle of it, and no mark; I have had the handkerchief ever since the 14th of July, I tied up the money that day: my girl found the handkerchief in the shop.</p>

On Tuesday the 17th of September, I was in the shop, my father gave me half a guinea to put into the box, which I did, and it made twenty-two guineas, I counted it with my mother a little before my father went out, about half past ten, and soon after one Mr. Watts a publican called on the prisoner, and asked him if his name was not Allen, he went off the board out with him, and staid about ten or fifteen minutes, he returned, jumped on the board, and called for a small pen knife; he asked what it was o'clock, the boy said about half past eleven; he said he wanted to go to dinner to the Half-Moon in Church-court with Mr. Watts: I told him he should not go before twelve, but he insisted on going; he said good bye, take care of the place: I was talking with a gentlewoman in the street, about three inches from our door; I did not stop with her five minutes; the prisoner went down the court to go into our back-yard, he had just got down the court to the part of our house that goes up the steps, when I found the parlour door open and the key laid on the floor; I told him I missed the spoons and money, he coloured, and said I was joking; I insisted on searching him; I found a handkerchief, a snuff box, and a pair of gloves; he wanted to go, I could not stop him; till a gentleman that lives on his fortune, that we work for, came in and insisted he should not go: (Looks at the handkerchief.) This is the handkerchief that our silver was wrapped up in, I found it in our ware-room the 13th or 14th of July; the prisoner was between five and ten minutes in the back yard:

             sworn.</p>
               <p>The day that the robbery was committed my master gave his daughter half a guinea, and said it would just make two and twenty guineas; that was about half an hour after ten; he bid her put it by.</p>
               <p>Did he tell her where to put it? - No; he went out: and a man called Mr. Allen off the board, and he went with him down St. Martin's lane; he came on again, and asked me what it was o'clock, I told him, half past eleven; he said, you lie, you damned dog; and went off to go to dinner: I cannot tell which way he went, I was on the board.</p>
               <p>How long after he went to dinner was it, before your master's daughter went into the parlour? - About four or five minutes; she calls to me, Martin, says she, the tea spoons are gone, and the sugar tongs, I made her no answer; I heard her and the prisoner talk very high.</p>
               <p>Court. Why, the prisoner was gone? - He went round into the yard, it was about five minutes after when I saw Allen, he went into the back parlour, round about by a little court that goes backwards.</p>
               <p>He came into the parlour out of the back<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160045"/> court, where the necessary house is? - Yes. I went into the parlour a little afterwards; the prisoner sent me to look for my master, the daughter was just by, I could not find him; then the prisoner sent me for Mr. Elphinstone, to get a search warrant, to search the house: the publican over the way told me not to go. Then the prisoner sent me for him again, and I went and fetched him down. My master came in, and I went for my mistress; when I returned there was a runner there, and we all went to Bow-street: as we sat there, one of the constables told my master to search the prisoner, and they ripped the bottom of his coat, and there was a handkerchief came out, and as soon as my master saw it, he claimed a right to it directly; the prisoner said he got the handkerchief out of Wiltshire, and he claimed it as his own.</p>
               <p>Court, Had your master's daughter been at home all the morning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the woman that came to speak to her, come in? - She came no further than the step of the front shop.</p>
               <p>How far is that from the back parlour, where this money was? - It is not a great way.</p>
               <p>How long did the woman stay chattering with your master's daughter? - About five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>Had no body else been there before Watts came? - Only this woman, I and the prisoner were on the board while they were talking.</p>
               <p>You was charged as well as he? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know where the money was kept. - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he know? - Yes, he knew it was kept backwards.</p>
               <p>Did you ever go into that parlour? - Yes, they sit in that room.</p>
               <p>What sort of people come backwards and forwards to the house? - Very good people: about a week or a fortnight before, the prisoner asked me where the money lay; I told him in the back parlour. After the robbery the prisoner wanted to go, and the gentleman said nobody should go; his name was Mr. Chamiere, he lives on his fortune.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. Then it was the prisoner that desired you to go for Mr. Elphinstone? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did people come to the parlour for alehouse pots? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A publican opposite told you not to go? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is his name? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did you see the girl put the half-guinea to the other money? - I saw her go backwards, but whether she put the money there, or no, I do not know.</p>
               <p>You did not see or hear what passed between the prisoner and the girl in the yard at the privy? - No, I saw her speaking to him in the back parlour, just at the step of the door.</p>
               <p>Court to Elphinstone. What was the message the boy brought to you? - He said I was wanted, and he asked me for his master; and, then he came again for me.</p>
               <p>Court. Nothing was found but the handkerchief? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the bottom of the pocket whole or not? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was your hand in the pocket? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel to Elphinstone. What sort of man was this gentleman that was at Grant's house? - A middle aged man.</p>
               <p>To Kennaway. How old are you? - Fourteen on Christmas day; I have lived there about nine months.</p>
               <p>Does your master keep any maid-servant? - No, the little girl does all that.</p>

               <p>Do you live on good terms with that little girl? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Never quarrel with her? - Sometimes, but we soon make it up again.</p>
               <p>Court to Elphinstone. Did you examine the door that goes into the yard? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How near is the window? - There is just the width of the door, between the door and the window, it is a sash-window.</p>
               <p>Were the panes of glass whole? - All but one of the squares, which goes on a hinge on account of the smoke.</p>

               <p>Concerning what the little girl has declared now about my putting my hand into the hole, it is as false as God is true; I will relate the case to you as nigh as I can: I went to work for the prosecutor about nine on the Tuesday, about a quarter before eleven he went out, about a quarter after eleven Watts called upon me; he looked into the door, and asked to speak with me; I did not want to have any discourse with him there, I had pawned his great coat, and I was not willing he should know it; we went from the door about three yards, he told me he wanted a pair of breeches; I was to call on him that night; he asked me to take part of a pint of beer, I mentioned a house; I came back immediately; he said he would go and get a beefsteak; I got on the board, and staid about a quarter of an hour; then it wanted about fifteen minutes of twelve; I thought I might as well go off and come to work before one: I had occasion to go up to the necessary, and by the time that I had got through the passage and into the yard, the girl was in the room where the property is reported to lay; I goes into the yard, and saw the door a-jar; I made a little bit of stand, and looked at it; I heard the prosecutor's daughter ask who had been in the room? the last child was in the yard at the same time; I said I wondered to see the door open; I went into the room; she asked me if I had been in the room? I asked her how it was possible? says she, have you not got out silver spoons and milk pot? says I, how can I? she said she was only joking; she said she would run away, and would stay no longer; I told her she should not go away, nor I neither, till her father came home: I called Mr. Elphinstone, and told him the story that I believed the place had been robbed; the publican came over, and he was the first, I believe, that entered the house after the robbery; I sent for Mr. Grant, who came in presently: there is one Mr. Cooper that lays in the same room where this property lay; Mr. Grant told me he knew who the thief was; I asked him if he suspected me? he said no: at last he divulged his mind, that he suspected this Cooper, who lays in the room where the money was, but works up stairs; the prosecutor got a search-warrant, I never quitted the room; I wanted to make water; I would not stir because there should be no suspicion; Cooper's room was searched, but nothing was found; Mr. Grant said I might as well go, and I went to Bow-street; there a man, named Gregory, came in and enquired into the affair; the prosecutor felt the lump that was at the bottom of my pocket before we went to the Justice's he said it was not worth ripping; I did not know what it was myself; after pulling all the things out of my pocket, Gregory said here is something here; I said I had observed it before; the prosecutor ripped it, and if it had been in the pocket he would not have made a word of the matter, but being concealed in the lining, he said I believe I know something of this handkerchief; I said I am sure you do not, it is a rag I carry meat in sometimes when I go to work; he said he would ask his wife to be more thoroughly convinced; I said I wish you would, I can bring witnesses where the handkerchief came from; I waited in the tap-room till he returned; he said we shall hear further about it, and he spoke very freely of this Mr. Cooper; however, we all went to the Justice's, and went through our examinations. Concerning this handkerchief, I had it, so help me God, (there is a just God that knows the secrets of every thing, I would not tell a lie on this account) I had it in my possession the Saturday before; I imagine I put this rag in at the top part of my pocket which was ripped, and it must go in between the lining and the cloth: on the Sunday morning I said to a person who will be here, says I, give me a needle and thread, this hole pothers me; I sewed up the hole, and by that means did not recollect any thing of any thing being between the lining and the bottom of the coat; and when this place came to be ripped, no more thought of any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160048"/> thing of the kind being there than any thing; I saw directly when it was pulled out what it was; he swore that was the very handkerchief his money was counted in; she said she knew it to be hers by the border; I imagine they washed it; they swore to it a second time after keeping it in their own possession: the girl starts up, says she, I know it by the holes in it; so I was committed. I hope you will take it into consideration: how can any person think I could rob this man of his property, and make away with it, and few this rag in the lining of my coat? I think it is something very inconsistent to think of any such thing.</p>

               <p>On the 21st of September, the prisoner and myself were in the back shop, I discovered a parcel concealed within two hogsheads; I sent the prisoner out of the way, to see what it contained: I found it contained about three pounds of tobacco. I thought it would be most prudent to send him out again, and likewise remove these hogsheads, to sweep all round; I said I should have occasion to remove that hogshead, and I went out on purpose. When I returned we removed that hogshead, and the parcel was gone, tho' I put it in the same place again after I had opened it: I afterwards discovered the parcel was concealed between two other hogsheads, which we could not move; I put a mark on it, and put it in the same place again. I concluded he must take it when he went with things, as it was too large to take in his pocket; I told him to take a basket round to the warehouse; but I sent him first to fetch down a glass, that I might be satisfied the parcel was there; then he came down again: I observed him take the basket on his shoulders, he went to the door, he returned from the door, and he went to the place where the parcel was. The back part of our house comes into Blackfryers, into Pilgrim-street, he lodges in the Broadway, Blackfryers, opposite our warehouse; I followed him and brought him back, I took the parcel out of the basket myself, and sent for a constable immediately; he denied it, and said he knew nothing of it. We asked him if he had any tobacco in his lodgings, he said no: we searched, and found about twenty-six pounds weight in one bag, and two or three pounds in another. (The parcels of tobacco produced.)</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any opportunity of knowing where that tobacco was taken from? - This was in the back shop, and not tied up as it is now; it is sealed up by the constable, there is T. B. upon it: the value of it is at least 7 s. it would be worth more if he was to sell it; nobody was in the back shop at the time the tobacco was taken away, but the prisoner and myself.</p>
               <p>- MARTIN sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 21st of September I was sent for to Alderman Sainsbury's, they gave me charge of the prisoner at the bar for stealing some tobacco; I took him to the Compter; I said it would be proper to search his lodgings; we went in, it was dark; his wife and a man were just come in; I was in the room almost as soon as they were; the woman went to the fire-place to light a candle, and the man said, has Richard parted with any more since I was here last? I said, how do you do, Mrs. Sewell? does not your husband work at Alderman Sainsbury's? Yes, said she; I said I must search your house; and accordingly I searched, and in a closet I found this bag of tobacco secreted (a bag produced, about twenty-six pounds weight); I went to another place, and I found this loose<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160051"/> shag tobacco (a small parcel produced); I opened his box, and in his box there were four papers made up with Mr. Sainsbury and Langford's name on it, and two rolls of pigtail.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>This tobacco was my allowance that I had every night since last Christmas; it is a rule in the trade to give us an allowance; five pounds twelve ounces I bought; and sometimes I got double that allowance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. We generally give half an ounce of cut tobacco of a night for them to smoke, to prevent their stealing any; but this does not appear to be that tobacco; this was as it came from the mills, without having the dust taken from it; in the state it is in now we never give it.</p>
               <p>Court. How long has he worked with you? because if that allowance had been scrape d up for a number of years, it might have amounted to that quantity.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. What do you say to the parcel? - I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner brought four witnesses, who all gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>I was coming through Widegate-alley the 29th of last August, and in the middle of it the prisoner stopped me, as she was going up a few steps into the house, it was from three to four in the afternoon; she had a cup and saucer in her hand; she said I believe I know you, I want to speak to you; I said I believe you have the advantage of me, I am lately come from the West Indies; she said will you walk up? I did; there was another woman who went out; she asked me to drink a dish of tea, I was going home to dinner, but by persuading I did drink a dish of tea with her, and she asked me a question which I thought was not very genteel; and I said I could not stay now, I would call again in the evening; I gave her 6 d. and called again in the evening, and then there was another woman in the apartments; she said she is not within, but she will return in a few minutes; I staid about eight or ten minutes, and the prisoner came in; she said will you give me a glass of gin? I said, young woman I am not used to drink gin, but if you chuse any I will give you some, and I gave 6 d. to the other party; in the mean time she asked me a favour, and I thought it was not very genteel; I told her I was not that way given, I was lately come from the West Indies, but if she would chuse to alter her condition in life, I would take a private lodging to take her out of that bad way of life, to take care of my little property; I gave her a shilling to keep her at home that evening, and away I went; I came the next day, and she was at home, and we went to get a furnished lodging, and brought what few things I had into the apartments; we lived there to the 14th of September: in the morning I awaked between six and seven, I missed the prisoner, and looked round where my watch hung, and that was gone; then I got up, and I went to put on my shoes, I then missed my buckles and my stockings, I wear two pair, coming from a hot country; I went to my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160052"/> chest in the room, and I missed all my linen and every thing I had in the apartment; I put on my clothes, and my purse, in which was a dollar and nineteen shillings in silver, was gone; my purse was found on the prisoner; she was very intimate with a neighbour in the next room, I knocked there, the husband came, I said is your wife at home? he said no; I went to the house where I first saw the prisoner, and I asked, whether she was within? a woman said no, but two women has been here, and one had a bundle; I went home again; I asked what to do; he said there was an officer next door, better call to him; between nine and ten in the morning the officer and myself was standing at the street door, the lodger's wife came in, and I followed her, and gave charge of her on suspicion; she said I will tell you where some of your property is; she took us to the pawnbrokers, there I found several shirts, handkerchiefs and stockings, and stocks and breeches, and one article or another; they found the prisoner in Cock-lane, Smithfield, on the 17th; the two pawnbrokers are here; the prisoner said, when she was taken up, for God's sake do not hurt me! I said you did not think of that when you took my property away from me.</p>

               <p>I am journeyman to Mr. Masters in Holborn, on the 14th of September I took in a metal box watch with a silver outside case, for 12 s. of the prisoner at the bar: I never saw her before; I know she is the same person; I saw her after that; she came to sell the watch, I said it would not suit me.</p>
               <p>Court. When did she come to sell the watch? - I cannot say whether it was one day or two after she pledged it, I took very particular notice of her person because we always do; she said she lived at No. 17, Brooks-street, Holborn; I said it would not suit me to purchase it. (The watch produced.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. What sort of a watch was yours? - It was a pinchbeck box, and the outside case silver, I do not know the number nor maker's name; I bought it at Jamaica; I had a main spring put in at Plymouth; you will find the maker's name in Plymouth, I never took so much notice; I cannot read very well; the nob of it is decayed, and you must push it very hard before you can open it.</p>

               <p>I have various articles, shirts, stockings, breeches, waistcoats, &amp;c. I took them of the prisoner between the 1st. and 14th of September; the prisoner pledged a handkerchief with me for 8 d. she asked me for trust, I told her it was not customary to give trust, but if she had a mind to leave any thing it would answer the same purpose; she said I am surprized you should doubt my word; I said you are a stranger to me, I neither know Mr. Cardosa nor you: she pledged it for 8 d. and laid out 7 d. in the shop, the greatest part of the other things were left for the same purpose, the prisoner particularly observed to me, that she did not wish to trouble Mr. Cardosa for money; she would pledge things for breakfast; these things she said were for common necessaries.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you give her necessary articles for these things? - I have not taken in a single article but what was for the common necessaries of life.</p>
               <p>Court to Cardosa. What did this woman and you live upon, during the time you were at this lodging? - Every morning I gave her a shilling or two, or eighteen-pence, I have my friends where I put up at, in St. Mary Axe.</p>
               <p>Court to Cardosa. Upon your oath did you supply this woman with money sufficient to keep the house? - Yes, besides washing my things, I have given her 2 s. at a time to hire a person to assist her in the washing; I used to allow her a shilling or 18 d. when I went out in the morning, I did not come home till nine or ten in the evening; the things are my own property, here is not a quarter of them.</p>

               <p>Court. How could they do that? - I will give your Lordship a reason why, I went to the publick house for lodgings, being belated, and rather a little in liquor I do not disown; the landlord granted me a lodging, the watchman went with me, I was granted a bed by the watchman's civility, and by the landlord's good nature to myself and to nobody else; I gave the watchman a dram, I pulled out my purse, and changed a shilling to pay for the glass, and the bed; presently after this the watchman went out, I put the purse in my pocket and sat down; this woman and the other came and sat down along side of me; the landlord said that man does not want you; in a few minutes the landlord went backward, and they fastened upon me, one under one arm, and the other under the other, and drew me bodily into the street.</p>
               <p>Court. Nobody but the two women were left in the room? - Nobody that I know of.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to let them take you out into the street? - I own I was something in liquor, and I had not the power<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160054"/> that I should have at another time; they overpowered me, I struggled, they drove me up an alley and they took my purse.</p>
               <p>Court. Why did not you call to somebody? - I had not strength enough to resist them.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you no tongue to cry out? - I did cry out.</p>
               <p>Court. The landlord was only gone to draw some beer, why did not you cry out in the house? - I suppose I did, but the landlord was not come out of the cellar; when they got me out, they drew me up a street about forty yards; one held me, and the other held my arms back; and they picked this pocket first, and my two waistcoat pockets, and my coat pocket; they took my handkerchief, and my neck cloth; and then they took my great coat, it was a brighter than this.</p>
               <p>Court Could not you resist their taking off your great coat? - No.</p>
               <p>You must have been totally drunk? - No.</p>
               <p>You must have been very much in liquor, can you venture on your oath to relate what passed with certainty, when you was so much in liquor, can you remember what you had in your pockets? - I would not swear to 6 d: or 1 s. but I can remember as far as that, I know what money I had.</p>
               <p>How do you know you did not drop your purse at the bar; was your purse ever found? - No, nor none of the property.</p>
               <p>What was in your purse? - Two guineas and a half in gold, and I did suppose about a dozen shillings in silver, but I would not swear to 1 s. or 6 d. I got away from them some how, I do not know how, but in my fright I got away to the same house the next morning, where the watchman brought me.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you go to the same house directly? - I do not know how far I went about in my fright, it might be four o'clock when I got there.</p>
               <p>Court. You was not above forty yards off? - I went sometimes one way, and sometimes another.</p>
               <p>How do you know the prisoner was one of the persons? - I know she was, I have seen her more than once before.</p>
               <p>Were you acquainted with her before? - I never was, I have seen her often in that lane.</p>

He came in about a quarter after eleven, and the watchman along with him; I was going to bed, the watchman knocked at the door for a glass, and asked me if: I could let the man have a lodging, I said he was here before; this young woman (the prisoner) and another just came in before; and he treated the watchman with a glass; this young woman asked him to treat her, he said he would, this young woman and another young woman sat down, nobody was in the tap-room but another young man, a lodger; they had a couple of quarterns of gin; I asked the man if he was going to bed, he said he was going home; he called for another quartern, he changed a shilling, he had a bag with about four or five shillings, I saw no gold; he put the bag in his pocket; he put his hands round one of the women's necks and kissed her; I went backward to draw some beer, and when I came back he was walking arm in arm with the two women; I looked after him, and he was about two hundred yards from the house where this young woman lodged; the next morning he came to my house without a great coat; says I where is your great coat you Sir? says he I was robbed of it, says I, I suppose you left it for your lodging, he said he did not know, he could not tell where he was robbed; this young woman and the other passed by, says I, there is the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160055"/> two young women you was with last night, that young woman had a bundle in her apron, he followed the woman, and it was a black gown and petticoat instead of his coat; he was in liquor over night, but he was sensible of what he was doing, he never cried out; he went willingly out with the women.</p>

             at this time was from home; when he returned he took this note, and on applying to Messrs. Welch and Co. he found they knew nothing of the drawer, and that this note was a manifest imposition: in consequence of this, he caused the necessary advertisement to be printed, and had it circulated the next day very early, and the prisoner was apprehended; for on the very evening that the prisoner obtained these goods he turned them into cash; he went to the house of Mr. Paris, a pawnbroker, and there he pawned this watch to this Mr. Paris, which he had allowed seven guineas for, for the sum of two guineas and a half: Paris, the pawnbroker, the next day seeing this advertisement, recollected the person of the prisoner, and the young man was apprehended. You see therefore, Gentlemen, this matter is very short so far; that he put off this note with intention to defraud there cannot be a doubt; for if he had known at that time, or had supposed that the note was really of the value it professed to be, he would certainly have got cash for it otherwise, than by applying in that channel to raise money so much under the value of the note. Gentlemen, it is your province to determine upon this case;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160057"/> I shall call the witnesses who will prove to you, beyond the possibility of a doubt, that the prisoner at the bar is a person of the name of Hyam Levy, and that he signed the name of Lewis on the back of this note. The prisoner is likewise charged with the forgery of the acceptance of this note, which is supposed to be accepted by Mr. Olding, one of the partners, but as the marks on the note are excepted J. O. and the first letter appears to be more like an than an a, I take it for granted, an objection will be made by Mr. Sylvester, of counsel for the prisoner, that this does not altogether appear to be the word accepted.</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Paris, pawnbroker, in the Strand, I know the prisoner; on the 19th of September, in the evening, he came to pledge a watch, I have the watch here, he pledged it for two guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>The watch produced and deposed to by Mr. Chater, senior.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel to Mr. Chater. This young man never described to you who Messrs. Velch and Roger were? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>He left it to you to make a conclusion who they were? - Yes Sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. My Lord, in this case, the prisoner tendered a note, clearly in the name of Velch, Roger and Co. bankers, in London, not describing who these bankers were, or where they lived, or that they meant the house of Messrs. Welch, Rogers, and Olding; but tendering this bill to Mr. Chater, as a bill of Messrs. Velch, Roger, and Co. who this Mr. Velch and Roger were, he does not say; that is the imagination of the holders of the bill, and of the bankers: the bill has no one mark of the house about it; Mr. Olding, it is proved, by Mr. Brandford their clerk, writes accd. and not accepted, therefore, I submit to your Lordship, there is at present no evidence to say, that the prisoner, at the time that he offered the bill, meant this house of Welch, Rogers, and Co. it might mean any body else.

He went without the man, the bill-holder; the bankers knew him exceedingly well, they said will you indorse this bill as your property, he said, he would go and fetch the man; he took him with him to the bankers: the bill was payable, if I mistake not, to

               <p>Court. The bill really seems as if calculated to deceive, it may be taken for Welch in the first instance, and there is a very material thing in the V, as if there was another stroke to make it a W. I did not know at first when I looked at it, whether it was Velch or Welch.

               <p>Court. Did they demand your money? - No Sir, they turned me round on my face, tore my apron, and picked my pockets of sixpence, half a crown, and some halfpence, and a knife; I am sure I had that money in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive them riffling your pocket? - I am sure it was one of the men; I laid as still as possible, for fear they would quite kill me.</p>
               <p>How soon after was this man apprehended? - The next Monday, this was Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Where were you taken to that night? - I was taken to some publick house, I cannot say what; I live at No. 28, in Skinner-street. I bled all night; I applied to the dispensary in Primrose-street, and was cured. On Thursday after the robbery, I gave information to Mr. Wilmot's office, and came on Monday to look at the prisoner at the bar, I knew him directly, he knew me; I had seen several before, but they were not the men; I was sent for several times before; I should know the prisoner from a thousand: the first thing I accused him with was, that he had not the same waistcoat on last Tuesday night which he then had, he said he had not: I told him he had the same coat on, he said he had, which was a light drab coloured coat; I charged him with cutting and wounding me, he said I was mistaken; he said he was with his mother and sister that night, at a publick house in petticoat lane, from six o'clock till ten.</p>

               <p>Did you charge him with robbing you too? - I did, I told him I was robbed by one or the other; I told him he was the man that cut me, which as there is a living God he was; he was ordered again for examination on Wednesday, then he brought several gentlemen to prove that he was at a publick house, the St. Luke's Head, raffling for pigeons that night; I think the house was the St. Luke's Head, the corner of Bunhill-row; that being the case, the Justice told them, if they were to swear that he was on the other side of the water, he should commit him.</p>
               <p>Court. What sort of night was it? - It rained very hard about a quarter past eight, but at the time I was robbed, the moon and stars shone exceedingly bright; the moon shone right in his face, and the stars shone very bright.</p>
               <p>How long might you have an opportunity of observing the prisoner before he came up? - About half a minute; I supposed him to be a friend, I saw him as plain as I can see you this moment; I knew him again by his fluttering, which is very remarkable, and I had spoke of his stuttering to several people before he was taken.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he speak that night? - He spoke in such imprecations, such wicked oaths, that I could not, in the face of God, and you Gentlemen, repeat them; they beat me like a stock-fish.</p>
               <p>Court. Then upon the whole are you sure that this is the man? - As sure as I am a living man; there was nothing found upon h im.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. It was half past ten when you was used in this manner? - No, half after nine.</p>
               <p>You say it rained a good deal previous to this attack upon you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long do you suppose the moon had been out before you was attacked? - I cannot say to a few minutes, but it was out then; I was robbed at the bottom of Stamford-hill.</p>
               <p>How far is that from Whitecross-street? - I never measured the ground; it may be a mile and a half, or it may be two miles.</p>
               <p>Court. It is a great deal more than that.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was it beyond the turnpike to Tottenham? - It was just below the Birdcage on Stamford-hill.</p>
               <p>Jury. Then it is about two miles and a quarter, or two miles and a half.</p>
               <p>Court. Where is the person that took you up? - I do not know who they are.</p>
               <p>Court. Why did not you bring the landlord of the house? - I do not know what house it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160063"/>Was you sober at the time? - As sober as I am now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. The knife that was taken from the prisoner was not your knife? - No.</p>
               <p>Was any thing taken from the prisoner that was yours? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Court. How come you to remember it was on that night? - I had been to pay a little money down, and I had the receipt in my pocket, and I called there as I came back.</p>

               <p>How was the evening employed? - When I first went in, a young fellow came in with a pigeon, he said, Is Stephens here? and said he promised to give him a pigeon; the prisoner came in, and he gave it him.</p>

               <p>Court. Upon your oath did he say that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any body here besides yourself, that was present at the Justice's? - When he was brought up for examination on the Wednesday, he brought several gentlemen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160066"/> that are here present; they said they were raffling for pigeons, and they had sheeps-heads for supper.</p>

               <p>To prisoner. Is it true that you said before the Justice, that you spent that evening with your mother and your sister? -</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is all a falsity, I never said any such thing.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. It is very odd that you cannot recollect the house you was taken to the night you was robbed? - I cannot tell, I never was that road.</p>
               <p>Did you go home by yourself? - I went home with several, but who I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Did not you desire to know any of the people that had been so kind to you? - I did the next day.</p>
               <p>If you were able to go home, you were able to ask questions; whereabouts was it that you was taken to? - It was the first publick-house in Newington I think, but I would not take my oath of it; the gentleman was glad to get home, I suppose he was afraid of being in danger himself.</p>
               <p>Court. After these people had come to the Justice's on the Wednesday, did you express after that any doubts about the man, or any concern about him? - No, I said, if it be so, I should be glad you should be acquitted, I said, if I thought I had swore wrong I would down on my knees and beg God and you pardon.</p>

               <p>Court. Do you recollect when the prisoner was first examined by on the Monday what account he gave of himself, where he had been on the evening of the robbery? - I remember extremely well that he told me he was at his mother's house about nine o'clock that evening.</p>
               <p>You have a perfect recollection of that? - I have.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether he said where his mother's house was? - He told me it was some where near Old-street, but as to the name of the place he did not say.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing of having been in any company at a house the corner of Whitecross-street? - Whether he said so on the Monday when he was first taken, I do not recollect, any more than that he was at his mother's house, I then spoke to the prosecutor, and desired him to be very particular, and if he had any doubts on his mind that he would give up the prosecution, as the prisoner told me he lay at his mother's house; the prosecutor said, I wish I had doubts, but I have no doubts. There were eight or ten people came to prove an alibi, I told them it was nothing to me I must bind him over on a positive oath.</p>
               <p>Court. The material point that stuck with the jury, was, what the prisoner was alledged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160067"/> to have said, as to where he was on the evening of the robbery? - I believe he did not mention that he was at any other publick house; when he told me that he was at his mother's house about nine o'clock that evening, I was rather surprized when I saw so many people, apparently of reputation, come to prove he was in their company.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's counsel. Do you remember the terms of the sentence, in which it was pronounced? - I believe it was that he should be transported to some of his Majesty's plantations in America, for the term of seven years.</p>
               <p>Was it not a part of the sentence, that he should be taken back to the place from whence he came? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. The difference between his case and a palpable escape is, that he never was carried back to the gaol; an escape from the gaol of Newgate, is a different thing to this man's, he never did escape out of Newgate.</p>
               <p>Court. in the case of transportation, the carrying back to the place from whence they came, is no part of the sentence; if the transports should be ready in the river, the court would probably prefer that mode; the carrying back to gaol, is no part of the sentence: it is only to detain the person for the execution of that sentence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. He was taken with the irons on him and brought back, it is said for me to say, that he only varied the path to prison.</p>

               <p>I am very sorry to give the court the trouble, I acknowledge I got through the hole, my irons was not off, I never had any intention, till I saw other prisoners go that have been taken since, and forgiven; even my irons were not off, and I had not so much as a knife about me; I never was out of sight, even people followed me into the house. My Lord, I beg for mercy.</p>

Condon was very resolute, we were obliged to tie him again; he had his shoes off, and a pair of old slippers on, he begged for his shoes, but we would not let him have them, till after he was tied; his coat was off, and we took him to the office without his coat.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to have been at work? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you think so of Collins? - I do not know what to think of Collins, he had nothing in his hand, but his hands were all over sand. We found all the implements of coining, and aquafortis, and a flask, and fourteen pattern shillings were laying just by this box, and Dixon took them up. There was very little furniture, nothing but a few shelves.</p>

               <p>I went to the house in Irish court, Whitechapel, as soon as I had broken open the door, and went up stairs, I saw Condon standing at the window; (the lower door was both locked and bolted, I took the fledge hammer with me on purpose to break it open) and Collins was standing by him. Condon had the spray, and the tongs, and the knob of it was red hot, as red as a red hot bar of iron; I put the pistol to him, and said put it down, and make no resistance, if you do, I will shoot you; it was taken out of the flask with the tongs, he had hold of it with the tongs. Here are the candles which they use to smoak it.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen you may take the spray if you please, and just lay it down to the place to see if it corresponds.</p>
               <p>Jury (after comparing it.) It corresponds exactly my Lord.</p>
               <p>Dixon. We found the mould close by his feet, and the patterns were laying close by his feet, and the flasks were open as they are now, and quite hot; here is aqua fortis, flask, metal, and every thing that is used in that business: sand paper facings, and every thing: here is some metal which we found on a shelf on the further side of the same room; it is what they call virgin copper, I believe it has been refined in order to mix with silver.</p>
               <p>Did you observe Collins at all? - I saw him standing by Condon; and there is a little room side ways, and he went in there, we fetched him out, we tied his hands; but we had a long struggle with Condon: Collins's hands were very dirty and sandy as if he had been at the business.</p>
               <p>Court. But however you saw him do nothing, nor he had nothing in his hand? - No, my Lord I saw him do nothing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. You seem to be very conversant in this business of coining? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have had frequent experience in it? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You had your information from a woman. - No matter for that, it would only hurt your client if I was to tell you.</p>
               <p>I believe there had been a little affection between the prisoner Condon and a woman, for whom you had a little affection, - No Sir, never, I have apprehended him several times.</p>

               <p>Court. That is the mould we may call it? - Yes, it is squeezed down, and so leaves the impression on the sand, this is a composition of base metal, this is the spray that runs down in the middle, this has been a compleat mould, and there is no doubt but these have been run in these flasks; they are taken off from here and edged, and scoured, and put into aqua fortis, this phial is aqua fortis: a shilling is worth about two pence halfpenny or three pence, the half crowns about four pence halfpenny.</p>

               <p>Court. Your indictment is not for coining, for then you would have an a rgument that might be made of use to you, that is, that the coining not being compleated, the offence would not have been compleated; but for having tools and instruments in your custody proper for coining, the offence is just the same by act of parliament.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Condon. I am just come from sea, I have no acquaintance; I have been informed in gaol, with respect to them flasks, no fine worker, nor no caster, can work without them; this house was not mine: these things should be done without see or reward, and not to have 40 l. to swear a man's life away.</p>
               <p>Court. There is no reward on the conviction of coiners.</p>

               <p>On Saturday night, the 14th of September, about twelve, I was going home up Drury-lane, this woman accosted me and asked me to give her a dram, and asked me if I had any objection to go to her lodging; it was late, and I said I had no objection provided it was safe. I went there, and when I went down to the lower room, I gave the woman a shilling for the use of the lodging; they gave us a candle, and she asked me for a present, I gave her 2 s. I told her to lock the door, because I had more money, I had my week's wages in my pocket; I saw the door locked; in about fifteen or twenty minutes, she was unlocking the door, I said you are not going away; I felt in my breeches, I found my money gone, the sixteen shillings was gone, and three-halfpence left.</p>
               <p>Court. When had you that sixteen shillings in your pocket? - When I went into the room, because I counted it over; I had nineteen shillings and three halfpence when I went into the house.</p>
               <p>How did she get at your breeches pocket? My breeches was off, and my shoes were off, I did not see her take the money, but there was nobody in the room; I ran down after her without shoes, and I could not follow her without shoes in the street. The next day I heard she was at a public-house; and I told her she must go with me to Bow-street; a man and five or six women said she should not go without a proper officer, and by that means she escaped out of the taproom window; I sent for a constable and secured the man that had assisted her in making her escape, and took him to the watch-house, and I saw the woman there.

            , and Senhouse, I knocked at the door, and I was let in by a woman that afterwards turned out to be Mrs. Green, the sister of the prisoner; I came to the cellar door, I pointed out the door to Carpmeal, and Mrs. Green ran to the door, and began to thump at the door, and kick at it, I then desired Carpmeal to break open that door, he did so, I heard a noise in the cellar, I ran backwards and opened the back door, where I found another door that was open, belonging to the cellar; I saw the two prisoners come out of the cellar and run into a little shop that was within four or five yards of the door, I think there was two or three steps to come up, it was a work-shop where they had been making locks formerly; I followed them into the shop where the rest of the officers came in, and each of the prisoners picked up a gun lock, there were two gun locks that were finished, all put together ready for hardening; I took them then into the cellar where they came from, and in the cellar was a large press fixed, with the dies fixed likewise within the press; a quantity of halfpence round the press, about twenty shillings worth, they were quite finished; by the side of the press a candle had been burning which was put out, but the wick was then a-light; in the same cellar I found a quantity of blanks and sciffil, and a cutting out press; I found another cutting out press in the front cellar; and all together there was a compleat apparatus for coining, I then searched the prisoners, particularly William Yardley, and in his pocket I found a bill, in which was inclosed this halfpenny that had been struck from the dies that then were fixed in the press; there is a great deal of difference in the weight of the halfpence, I suppose it would take 2 s. 9 d. to the pound weight, and at the Tower I believe there is but 2 s. to the pound weight.</p>
               <p>What may be the profits of a day's work? - It has been proved to this court, that whosoever employs three or four of them, the master clears 3 l. a day after he has paid his servants; they strike up a piece as they call it, which is thirty, and some thirty-two which is 8 d. and they strike up sixteen of them in a day; I suppose these halfpence when finished would not be above 28 s. for a guinea, they are so good, they are the best counterfeits I ever saw: I then searched the house, and in a garret I found these halfpence on a mantle piece, with every apparatus for the finishing them, where it is supposed this young man lay, but I will not swear that, only that his box and clothes were there, and he must either lay there, or lay with his brother and sister, as there was no other bed in the house.</p>
               <p>Court. He owned these clothes to be his?</p>
               <p>Yes I delivered them to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. This house was kept by Mr. Green, and this was his wife, she let you in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Afterwards you saw these men in a workshop? - I saw them come out of a cellar.</p>
               <p>I ask you if you saw them in any workshop? - I did so.</p>
               <p>And there were instruments fitted to the carrying on a Lock-smith's trade? - Not a doubt of it: there is a cellar door which opens upon the stairs, and another door that opens and lets them into this work-shop; the other people went through the cellar, and in the cellar was the press.</p>

               <p>I went to this house, Mr. Clarke went first to the door, he got entrance, I followed him, he was asking a question of the woman, and she kept kicking at the cellar door, I put my foot and knocked it open, I saw the light of a candle when the door opened, I ran down and the candle was put out, but the snuff was then burning; before I got to the bottom of the stairs, I saw three men come out of a door that was then open, that led into a kind of back area; the two prisoners at the bar, the young man was first, and the lusty one was the last, these men run into a work-shop, which was up four or five steps, I followed them up, and Mr. Clarke met them at the top of the steps going into the work-shop, we took them and brought them back, they run and caught hold of a gun lock each of them.</p>
               <p>Court. That is their business, is it? - I do not know, it is a shop; in the cellar we found that cutting out press, one in the fore cellar and the other in the back cellar, with a die fixed; the snuff of the candle was in, and we blowed it and got a light; the other man got off, and got over a high wall, and Mackmannes could not follow him; we took them into a kind of kitchen, the dies were fixed, there was a great quantity of blanks and half-pence struck, and sciffil, and implements for coining, and in the room of one of the prisoners there was a paper of halfpence, which were made up in a 5 s. paper, it was burst and thrown under the grate, they were coloured, they appeared to be some of the same dye that was in the press.</p>
               <p>Court. What was there 5 s. marked on the paper, or did you count them? - I only suppose them to be 5 s. as they are usually tied up in 5 s. worths.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. What became of the third man? - He got away.</p>
               <p>Then there was a way to escape, and that person got an opportunity of running off? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The other man escaped, these men did not, they went into that work shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You followed Clarke? - Clarke met them I was so nigh Yardley, when he went up I had like to have cut his leg with my cutlass, I was glad afterwards I did not.</p>
               <p>Clarke knocked at the door and was let in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had not the good luck in this case to find a halfpenny warm in the die? - I believe there was a good many warm in the place.</p>
               <p>Why do you believe so? - Because they were warm, when I took them several of the inhabitants saw it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. How came they to be warm? - The striking of the dies makes them warm.</p>
               <p>Court. You said the third man got over the wall, did you see that yourself? - No I saw him go to the place that led to that wall, he was the middleman.</p>
               <p>Then he might have got into the shop, as well as the rest, if he close it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then he must have got by before Clarke met the other men? - He did not go the same way, he turned to the yard.</p>
               <p>The monier of the mint proved the half-pence to be counterfeits.</p>

               <p>Counsel for prosecution. He had so little connection that he did not talk to him? - Never that I knew of, unless it was good night.</p>

               <p>What made you knock at the door? - Clarke went and peeped between the door and the door-case, and I imagined he wanted Griffin, and I went and knocked at the door, I supposed he wanted Griffin, by his standing.</p>
               <p>Did you go into this cellar? - I never was in the cellar since Griffin had it.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect some cloaths being found in the cellar? - Not that I know of.</p>

               <p>What business is carried on in this cellar? I never saw any business carried on in this cellar.</p>
               <p>Have not you heard a noise? - I have heard a noise, but I never went down, I had no right there.</p>
               <p>Give me a positive answer, will you say it again, that neither of these two men were in the cellar when the officers came in? - I will.</p>
               <p>Court. How can you say that when you was not in the cellar? - I was folding some clothes in the kitchen, the window was open, I saw Yardley and his brother in the shop, I will venture to swear they were not in the cellar.</p>

I wish you would recollect, you are upon your oath, I would not willingly throw any aspersion upon you, you swear positively your two brothers were not in the cellar; in two minutes they might have gone from that place into the cellar? - They could not possibly go into the cellar without my seeing them, I was so close to the window that I must have seen them.</p>
               <p>Which is Griffin's way to go to this place that he rents of you? - Sometimes he comes in at the front door, and sometimes at the back door, and I imagined<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160080"/> by Mr. Clarke's standing at the door they wanted him.</p>
               <p>Court. This garret belonged to two of Griffin's people, and they had given young Yardley leave to put his clothes and his box there? - Yes by my husband's asking.</p>
               <p>Court. Where is Griffin now? - I cannot tell: I saw him about five minutes before, he went in at the front door.</p>
               <p>Did that come by you? - No only when I hear the door open, I make it a point to see who was going out and in.</p>
               <p>Did you make it a point to see who was going in at that time? - No my Lord.</p>
               <p>

               <p>(On the part of the prosecution).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. My Lord, I applied to your Lordship at the very beginning of this trial, that the witnesses might be examined apart.</p>
               <p>Macmannus. I have been out all the time when Clarke or Carpmeal was examined. - Clarke knocked at the door, and got admittance; the woman knocked at the door with her hand, as hard as she could; the two prisoners were coming out of the cellar, and the other man turned into a yard, and I run after him.</p>
               <p>Did you see these men come out of the cellar? - Yes, it was only two steps to go into this workshop.</p>
               <p>Did Clarke ask for Griffin? - No, his name was not mentioned that I heard of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. This workshop is close almost to the cellar? - There is very little way between them.</p>
               <p>There it was you saw these men? - No, we saw them come out of the cellar, and Carpmeal would have struck them, but I said do not Tom. She knocked several times; immediately after I saw these men.</p>
               <p>At the time the knock was given you did not see the men? - No.</p>
               <p>When you did see them, they were near to the workshop? - They were coming up out of the cellar.</p>
               <p>In consequence of you three rushing in, you were between her and the cellar door? - When I passed

             I was between her and the shop door.</p>

               <p>Court. You could not see them before she opened the door? - The door that she was knocking at was on the landing place; I saw three men, I saw the prisoners both, I am sure: here are some of the halfpence I got upon the shelf in the kitchen; Mr. Clarke says they were struck in the same die.</p>

In the cellar I saw a large stamping press, a great quantity of blanks, and some halfpence which had been stamped, they are here; there was a large press, and candles burning in the cellar; these two dies stood on each side of the press, and I took them and put them in my pocket; there was a pair in the press, but I did not take them out; I found all the utensils of coining.</p>

               <p>I went with Jacks to this house, it was between eleven and twelve I think; we went on the information of some goods being lodged there that we supposed were stolen: Franklin was shaving himself; we asked him if he had any lodgers, he said yes, up stairs; Delaforce went up stairs while he shaved himself, I staid with him; there was a room he was unwilling to open, he said it was his workshop, he found a key, and on going into the room, there was a desk in the room, and a parcel of halfpence, several six-pences, some in a paper; then there was a pocket book Delaforce can tell you about. Franklin said I have let a cellar to a person last Monday, a Glass-grinder; I said to Delaforce, you stay up here, I will go down to the cellar; I went down with Jacks directly into the cellar, there I found the prisoner Scott in a cellar where a parcel of coals lay, in his shirt-sleeves, and he said what do you want, he said there it is, pointing to the place where the cellar was; Jacks went to the door and pushed it open, he went in and I followed him, we found Votear and Dean in the room, with their shirts trucked up in the cellar, they wanted us to let them go: My Lord in the cellar we found a fly, and these dies, and this blank between the dies, I took the prisoner away immediately to Justice Wilmot's.</p>
               <p>This blank you found between the dies? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I wish to speak the truth of Franklin and Scott, there was no candle in the cellar; Scott brought down nine pounds of candles, and two pounds of soap, I took them in; says I, go along about your business: his hands were clean, mine and Votear's were very dirty, we had been at work; and Scott, he he went up stairs; I did not know but what he was gone home; I had no thought of his being stopped. I took the cellar of Franklin, as a glass-grinder; I was to give him 5 l. a year for it; he never knew any thing to the contrary.</p>
               <p>PRISONER FRANKLIN's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am entirely innocent of any guilt in the whole affair; I had notion that they were coiners.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you explain that letter? - That letter was for Mr. Dean, he had spoke to my wife for leave to have a letter directed for him, my wife took it and gave it to him; I never saw the directions, nor the contents of the letter.</p>
               <p>Court. It was found upon your desk, you know? - Yes, Dean had been in my apartment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Dean. I suppose in paying him for a pair of shoes, and pulling out the half-pence, I must pull out the letter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Franklin. I had several letters, as I suppose I took these up with the rest.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Franklin called eleven witnesses who all gave him a very good character.</p>

(The dies and sheet skeleton copper produced. The halfpence correspond with the dies; Storer's hands appeared black, his sleeves tucked up; he was dressed in a brown waistcoat and slippers on; the women's hands were dirty and appeared to be at work, I believe the woman who opened the door had a candle in her hand, the candles lay on the ground.</p>
               <p>What quantity of halfpence did you find? - I suppose about half a bushell of half-pence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. You are sure these dies that you produced are not the same that was here on the last trial? - As much as your brief is the same as that on the last trial.</p>
               <p>It was the evening when you went to the house? - It was not dark, but sufficient to have candles lighted.</p>
               <p>There was a glimmering light? - The light was from her that I saw the parties, sh e held a candle in her hand.</p>
               <p>Just now you said you did not know that she had a candle in her hand? - I did not say so.</p>
               <p>Yes you did. - I believe she had; I got a fall there, I fell about three or four stairs towards the cellar.</p>
               <p>What did the good woman do at the door? - She was in the passage; Payne carried her into the parlour, but not before I had a sight of the parties.</p>
               <p>Nobody was below in the cellar? - Eight or nine candles there were; I tried the nearest and pinched it, then I put my hand on the rest as they lay on the ground, and they all appeared to be warm.</p>
               <p>Then the tallow was hot? - I did not try the wicks, I put my hand on them as I took them up, there were eight or nine.</p>
               <p>This woman is a servant? - The person said so, her hands were dirty, and she was quite in a flurry.</p>
               <p>Well she might, seeing you gentlemen come into the house; how soon was it afterwards that Payne got sight of the man? - Payne had the man, I told him to take care of the man and the woman; and he kept in the parlour all the while.</p>
               <p>Have you got all the instruments for coining here, or in the yard? - No, they are not.</p>
               <p>Counsel for Prosecution. There was every thing compleat for the business of coining? - Every thing; it was supposed to be the best press in London.</p>

               <p>I was at this house with Seasons and Payne on the 19th of September about six in the evening; Seasons and I, and Gates and Payne: Seasons going down the stairs, seized Storer, he said who is that? a man answered us, my name is Storer; I followed Season immediately and took him into custody, I met the woman (the prisoner Jones) about a yard off the stairs, she had a bed gown on, to the best of my knowledge it was a striped one; upon that I took and ordered her into custody, I left them in the care of Payne and another officer; immediately I ran down stairs after Seasons, he says here they are, turn this round, and I turned the fly round, and he pulled out the dies, and round the dies there was a quantity of halfpence ready finished; the candle that had been in it was quite hot, for it burnt the tops of my fingers; after that they took the things down, and went and searched the rooms, in the room of Storer where he said he lay, I found these<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160086"/> things in the closet, and one of these dies, the impression of a woman's head; and this handkerchief he owned to be his, and another which lay in the closet where the halfpence was; when I first saw Storer his coat and waistcoat were unbuttoned.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. When you followed your friend Seasons down below, you did not discover any body below, did you? - Nobody Sir, not down below in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Have you ever been lucky enough to make any of these discoveries before? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Do you understand the process of coining? - No Sir, I do not, I should be very sorry to know any thing about it; I do not know how many people are necessary to carry on the business, and I do not want to know.</p>
               <p>You were unlucky enough to burn your self with the same candle that Seasons took hold of? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Kirby; I was at this house, and went with Payne and Gates; when we first went in, it was quite dark, we called for a light, I went in after Mr. Payne; and they sung out for a light; I thought it was Mrs. Storer that ran into the parlour; I went on in the dark to she bottom of the stairs; the top of the cellar stairs I listened, and heard some little noise, I said, who is here? a man made answer, a friend; I took him by the collar and brought him in, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160087"/> it proved to be the prisoner at the bar; he was dressed as he is now, in such a coloured coat.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Seasons see this man before you laid hold of him? - To the best of my knowledge, he did not; we were at another house first.</p>

               <p>Then Seasons did not follow Payne? - I believe Gates followed Payne, and Seasons after that, I came after immediately: Payne was the first man that knocked at the door; I do not know when Isaacs went in.</p>
               <p>Have you heard what Seasons has said? - I am but just now called in, I think it was Mr. Gates and Payne, and Seasons the third, and I was the next.</p>

               <p>Did you see him come out of that cellar? - No, I went backwards; I am sure he was either a step down, or else at the top, I imagine he was coming out of the cellar, by that, I made no observation of his hands; I took particular notice of his coat, when I got him to the light, he was dressed in the same coloured cloth coat he is now.</p>

Which is a general rule with them; the prisoner said, I am going; he and several more went out of the house together, and he turned up the lane: the boatman said, Are not you going? he went into the Green Man and Ball: it is a rule for my maid to see if the rooms are empty, and how the things stand: she came and told me the prisoner had taken the sheets off the bed; I took a sculler, and went to the Gravesend boat; I could not find him; one of the men told me where he was; I went there, and brought him to my house; I was constable of the night, and I found my sheets in his bundle: he never would give much account of himself; he says he was going to Chatham, and that he has a wife and five children, but they are in the workhouse, and have been so these two years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was out of a point of necessity, I beg for mercy; I have been in the woollen manufactory of a rug maker for seven years: the last seven years I have been clerk to different gentlemen in the lottery business.</p>
               <p>Court. What excuse can you make now to mitigate your offence?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had been out of business some time; I have a wife that lays in now; my wife has been in the workhouse, she was big with child; I had three children at home with me; I could not maintain them, and I went on the hop duty in Kent; Commissioner Scott, who was my friend, is since dead: at Chatham I had been at work, and I came to enquire after my wife, and was informed she was in labour; and she sent me word out she should be glad if I could assist her with a few shillings more than the workhouse would allow her: it was through this necessity that I did it.</p>
               <p>Court. You would have use understand that this was done on the spur of necessity; have you any body of character that can satisfy the Jury and me that you are a man of character hitherto? if you can do that, there will be no objection to your receiving favour.</p>

In the room where the prisoner slept (as he acknowledged, and his waistcoat was there) I found two blanks, and more blanks were in the same cellar where the press was fixed; I took the prisoner into custody, and brought the large press away: they certainly had not been at work that day, that is most clear.</p>
               <p>Court. Were the half-pence that were found round the press, good, or bad money? - They are bad.</p>
               <p>Are they finished for vending? - They are struck, but not coloured.</p>
               <p>Are they made to the similitude of a halfpenny? - Yes my Lord, all Tower halfpence are left bright, and these are not coloured at all, they use brimstone to bad half-pence, to make them look old and black.</p>
               <p>(The blanks and dies produced to the Court and Jury.)</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any instrument for cutting the blanks? - No my Lord, there was not.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I know the prisoner, I was a servant at No. 2, by Tottenham-court road; the prisoner was there sometimes, and sometimes not; there was a necessary that this gentleman speaks of, and there was no shutter between the necessary and the door, and he used to go into the necessary, and I saw no more of him; one day when he left the necessary door open, I did peep in, and I saw three in the place beyond the necessary.</p>
               <p>What were these three people about? - I cannot say what the men were about, they were at a distance from me; there was a little girl, and she was putting something in, it dropped out, but I could not swear positively what it was; it was put into a large thing that stood up.</p>
               <p>You have been examined before, and you know what you have sworn before, what did you see this girl do? - I saw the girl put some thing into the thing that stood up; the men were in the same place, at the same time: but I really cannot swear what they were about: they were there, and there was a noise, and there was something rattled, it was a thumping, something of that kind; the men were at a great distance, the part that I looked in at was quite different; I could see this great thing stand up in the middle: I have seen baskets come in at different times, they always had brown paper over them.</p>
               <p>What were they like? - Baskets covered with brown paper, I never saw the brown paper off; they carried them to that place, which we call the back part of the house; the stairs came down there, and I was in the fore kitchen; I told them before the Justice, gentlemen I do not know what it was like.</p>
               <p>Did you never see what it was? - I was a stranger to them, and they to me; they never shewed me, they never were lest under my care.</p>

               <p>Court. Upon your oath, did you ever see what any of these baskets contained? - I have heard mentioned, they never shewed me.</p>
               <p>Did you never see without being shewn? - I cannot say I ever did see, upon my oath, I cannot say that I ever did see; I might imagine what, but I never did see.</p>
               <p>You never did? - I never did to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Young woman, did you never swear that you did see them? - They told me so, and I told them that I made objections to it; they said, they did not stand to particulars.</p>
               <p>Who told you what it was? - I heard the gentlemen at Bow-street say they were blanks, and when they gave me under their hands<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160092"/> I made objections, I said gentlemen, as for these, I never saw, they said they did not stand to such particulars as that.</p>
               <p>Will you say that you made any objections to sign that information that you made? - Yes, I will, I said there is something here that is not as I spoke it, one thing in particular, feeding the dies; I never heard that till I heard it in Bow-street, I cannot tell what the other objection is.</p>
               <p>Did you object to swearing about seeing the baskets? - I said the same then that I say now; that the baskets were carried out and in, I cannot tell what were in these baskets, they were baskets covered.</p>
               <p>Was there any candle in the place where they were at work? - There was a bit of candle, I could not see what they were about, because the candle was very low, and by the side of a great thing.</p>
               <p>Court. Who did you see in that place? - The girl was named Poll, the other man was named Castor, and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>You was a servant? - I was.</p>
               <p>Whose house was it, who occupied it? -</p>
               <p>We were all servants, but it was Mrs. Peake that came to see us, and gave us what necessaries we wanted.</p>
               <p>What had this man to do with the house? - I do not know, he slept in the two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Who slept in the one pair? - I slept in the one pair of stairs, there was no bed in the kitchen; there were three beds, sometimes Mrs. Peake slept in the other bed; Mr. or Mrs. Peake were to pay the rent of the house to be sure.</p>
               <p>Was there any fastening to this place where you saw them at work? - There was a bolt on the necessary, that was there when I went there.</p>
               <p>When there was nobody there, how did it use to be fastened? - There was no fastening but a little door that stood against it, and it was not locked.</p>
               <p>Then you could have gone in at any time? - Yes if I had any curiosity.</p>
               <p>Did you never go? - No Sir, I had no business there.</p>
               <p>What, and when there was nobody there and you was in that place adjoining, did you never go into that vault? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Council for prosecution. What was your master? - I do not know, we were all servants, I was a servant.</p>
               <p>You said you were all servants, what was Michael? - I never saw him hired, he was there sometimes, and sometimes not.</p>
               <p>Who are these all? - This Poll and Costar, and the prisoner, and me.</p>
               <p>What business is your master? - Where master and mistress did live, they carried on cock founding, there was no business carried on at this house, I was a servant, and paid as such; I tell you all the business I know, I heard a noise sometimes; my place was to clean five rooms and make the beds, there were two beds commonly used; there were three beds in the house, the prisoner slept there, and Poll slept with me when she did sleep there.</p>
               <p>What was Poll, was she cook? - We had a young child, but she did not stay a week, but when the rest went backwards, Poll went with them, and the prisoner went backwards with the rest.</p>
               <p>How often? - I cannot tell how often.</p>
               <p>Was it often? - Only once or twice.</p>
               <p>Who went with him when he went backwards? - Sometimes Poll, and sometimes Costar.</p>
               <p>You said you had an objection to sign this information of yours? - There were two or three things in it that was not just as I spoke them, and they said they did not mind particulars.</p>
               <p>In the information you said that you saw these three people frequently at work, did you swear that? - If I swore it, it is more than I know of; I said I saw them go backwards, and making a noise frequently, they might put down what they pleased; I have seen things that they called meggs, it was like a halfpenny.</p>
               <p>So you did not swear that you saw half-pence, but meggs; are these what you call meggs, look at them? - Yes Sir, such as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160093"/> that, I saw a few on the dresser in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>You used to go to call them to dinner? -</p>
               <p>I used to go to the back door to call them to dinner, because the necessary door was fastened, so far as I know, I always supposed it to be, because there was a bolt there, I have found it fastened sometimes.</p>
               <p>Here is another thing that you swore, that you saw Coster and the prisoner bring in blanks, and likewise carry out halfpence? - I have seen them carry out baskets frequently.</p>
               <p>With meggs in them? - There was something in them to be sure.</p>

               <p>This woman has got a daughter, which I frequently came after to the house where I was taken from, I only laid there when I was rather late, and I was there last Friday week, I came there and she was not at home; she used to keep a house by Doctor's Commons, and I sat there in the kitchen, and this woman by me, she asked me to write two or three directions for her; I only came into the house after her daughter.</p>
               <p>Court. Where do you live and work? - I served my time to a Hatter, and work there at this time, in St. James's, Duke's Place: I suppose my people will be here, if they know my-trial is on.</p>
               <p>The prisoner produced no witnesses.</p>

               <p>I live in Chelsea, I am an engraver; I have known the prisoner ever since last Tuesday, it was an act of humanity that prompted me to be an evidence here, I heard a very venal character in the neighbourhood, of the prosecutor; and that the girl had neither father nor mother, and that they would swear any thing: I was very sorry to hear it. I went to the man, and he told me she had broke open the till; the man said then he had promised he would not hurt her if she would confess; I told him I was her uncle; he said if I would give 3 guineas he would slaw the indictment; he took me to a public-house in the Hay-market to make the matter up; but when we came there, he would have three guineas for himself, 5 s. for the constable, 5 s. for the witnesses, and 3 s. for what he spent at the Rotation-office.</p>
               <p>Court to Whitlow. Do you know any thing of this man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is what he says true? - No, this man came with pretences to be a relation, was sorry for the girl, and wanted me to compound the felony, and I said I could not; I never attended to any such proposals at all.</p>
               <p>Jury. Nor you never made any proposals? - None, he called on me two or three times, on the Sunday and Tuesday, he asked me to go with him, I said, I only meant to do justly and honestly by myself, nobody else was present.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ray. The publican's name was Wallis, this person took me down there.</p>
               <p>Court. What business had you in the matter at all? - It was an an act of humanity; it was the feelings of my own breast that taught me to do it.</p>
