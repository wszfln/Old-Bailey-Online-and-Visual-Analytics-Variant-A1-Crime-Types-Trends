I have also received 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. E. Norton, and if you will be good enough to have my commission made out, I will be at the office in the morning to balance. Yours truly, J.S. Nichols." A member of the firm had previously seen Mr. Postal—the 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is a further sum which the prisoner had collected and not accounted for—this receipt of 26th June is signed by the prisoner—he came up on 2nd August and saw my brother; I was present—my father said to him, "Well, Nichols so you have been robbing us?"—he said, "Yes, I have taken something, it is not so much as you think"—my father then said there was nothing but to give him in custody—the prisoner then began to cry very bitterly, and begged that nothing might be done in the matter till the 16th August, 14 days later, when he said all his defalcations should be made good; he still kept crying, and implored my father to take him on again as a traveller, that he was a very good traveller, and could collect good orders, but he could not collect moneys—eventually my father yielded to his tears and entreaties, and said he would do nothing in the matter until the 16th, but he would not compromise a felony, and that the prisoner would be as liable then as he was now, with the exception that now he could be given into custody and on the 16th he would have to be fetched—before he went away he also asked that an account of the com<lb/>mission due to him might be made up and a statement showing the ac<lb/>counts he had taken less the amount of his commission—we refused, and said we would not treat his defalcations as a matter of account—he then went away and did not come any more, and I got out a summons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Nothing has happened to my brother Joseph since the last trial, he is quite well—I got the whole of this case up—I was not called at the police-court, because I suppose one witness was considered sufficient; my brother was called at the police-court and also here last Session—I heard the prisoner tried; this 129<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque was one of the charges then—I heard my brother give evidence with regard to his ver<lb/>sion of this confession; I think he did not state the whole facts—as far as I can remember, he simply said then the Nichols confessed having taken the money, and it was not quite as much as we suspected-all three of us agreed that we would not compromise a felorty-nothing was said about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but if he had paid the whole of the money by the 16th we should not have proceeded against him—if we had got our just due it we would not have been a compromise—I heard Mr. Grain state at the last trial that these defalcations were 260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it is not true that the prisoner has increased our trade; up to June, 1887, the prisoner's salary was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, but after that there was a fresh agreement, he was in some<lb/>body else's service—he then received from us a salary of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per month, but his commission was largely increased, and his travelling expenses were stopped—the prisoner used to pay money into his own account at the bank and send us his own cheques in place of postal orders—we bank at the London and Country Bank, which has branches all over the country, it was possible for him in the country when collecting cash to take it to some local branch and pay it there to the credit of our London account</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188711210007"/>
               <p>at Shoreditch—the last cheque we received from the prisoner is dated 1st August this year; I should say the prisoner sent us 25 cheques from July, 1886, to July, 1887—I did not know that these moneys were being paid into his own account; the cheques were made payable to order, and were endorsed "Godfrey Phillips and Sons"—on 17th April in the present year the prisoner wrote us that he had closed his banking account, but we received two cheques on that same account after that—at the police-court I swore that this 129<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque had never gone through our account—we first knew of this matter of Postal's in July, and we had the interview with him in August—Mr. Bushby granted a summons on the charge of embezzlement on the 12th—the summons was not for the purpose of allowing time to elapse to see if anything was forthcoming—there are other charges of embezzlement against the prisoner for which there are indictments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> We knew when we received the first cheque of July 19th that the prisoner had a banking account of his own; all these cheques are on the Peterborough branch of the National and Provincial Bank—I have carried out the amounts of these cheques, and they are all inrefer<lb/>ence to particular accounts which he collected; I can give you the amounts of the cheques if required—the account showing what the cheque was sent for might be sent up the same day or the next—he has never endorsed our name to any cheque except this one that I know of; this cheque never came up to our bank in London—when the bank receives a cheque in the ordinary way they send the cash to us.</p>

               <p>defendant's premises with Mr. Bevis, who asked him in my presence whether his stock was clear—he said it was—he asked him whether he owed any money privately—he said "No, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would more than cover my debts"—I signed this deed of partnership on 9th August—I should not have signed it if it had not been for those statements—I am acquainted with the defendant's signature—this is his signature to this deed—under the deed I bound myself to pay 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the bank for capital in the business, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. within three months, and I paid 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down to the defendant for premium—after that I went into business, and traded with the defendant—three weeks or a month after I entered into partnership with him I went over to Ealing one morning, and found a man in possession—the defendant assured me it was on account of his. private furniture, and had nothing to do with the business—eventutually I paid the man off—I had to do so, because he threatened to take out the stock and everything the following day—I had this bill of sale made out—this is the defendant's signature to the bill of sale—after I had taken proceedings against the defendant I believe a man was again put into possession—they have cleared everything out since then.</p>

About 2.30 on the morning of 24th October I was sent for to the Examination Hall—I inspected the premises; I found no one concealed on the premises—the pantry window was broken, and the kitchen window had also been tampered with by a knife—I found 2 bottles of Bass's ale full; some one had got over the wall—I found several bottles broken inside the pantry, and a tureen—about 3.30 I heard some voices in the Savoy Mews, one said "If you don't empty that b—bottle, give it me, and I will"—I went and fetched another constable—I then went into the Mews and found the pri<lb/>soner and another man who has been discharged—one was drinking from a bottle—the prisoner received the bottle from the other one—I asked him what he had got in the bottle—he said, "A drop of ale"—I asked him where he got it from—he said "Oh, it is nothing to do with you where I got it from, will you have some?"—I said "Before I partake of your bottle I should like to know where you got it from?"—he said, "Oh, that is nothing to do with you," and would not tell me—I said there had been a burglary committed at the Royal Examination Hall opposite, and that I should charge him on suspicion of having committed it—at first he resisted being taken into custody—he was very violent at first, he kicked me—in going up Savoy Street from the Mews he said "I won't go," and as he was going over the Strand towards Wellington Street he drew a knife from his pocket and cut me on the thumb, it was not very much—I searched him at Bow Street Police-station and found on him this corkscrew, a black shawl concealed beneath his waistcoat, two bottles of ale, one empty and one full—they were shown to Smith.</p>

At 10.30 p.m. on 13th October I saw a crowd outside Peel's Coffee House—I went there and saw the prisoner fall down in the road apparently from a blow—I picked him up and asked him to go away—he was slightly drunk, I should say—another man was with him and they both went away—I saw nothing of the prosecutor, nor of the knife.</p>

On 15th October, from information I received, I went to the Broadway, Ludgate Hill, and arrested the prisoner and another man on suspicion of stabbing—the prisoner said "Where?"—I said "Peel's Coffee House"—he said "What time?"—I said "After 10 at night"—he said "I can prove I was at home in bed at that time"—I took him to the Free Hospital, Gray's Inn Road, where the prosecutor identified him immediately he passed by his bed; he failed to identify the other man—I said "Make quite sure"—the prisoner put on his hat, and the prosecutor said "I am sure that is the man."</p>

                  </hi>. I am second carman to John Taylor and Sons, of Lombard Street—on 11th November I went out with a one-horse dray, with Kirby, another man in the same employment—the dray contained a quantity of wines and spirits—we got to Mr. Deakin's, in St. Martin's Lane, shortly before 2 o'clock, and delivered some goods there, and goods of consider<lb/>able value were left in the van—we then went to the coffee-shop at the west end of Long Acre to have some soup, and were absent between three and five minutes, and when I came out I saw nothing of the dray—I went to Bow Street Police-station, and the other man went to try and see the van—at the station I saw the van with all the goods.</p>

I am a porter employed at the London Bankruptcy Court, Lincoln's Inn Fields—on 11th November, between 2.40 and 8 o'clock, I was outside King's College Hospital, and saw the prisoner galloping the dray towards me, and as he was turning into Portsmouth Street he collided with the kerb and fell off the van over the side on to the pavement—I ran after the horse and stopped it about 50 yards farther on, held it. and handed it over to the police—before that they had assisted the prisoner to the hospital—I did not go to Bow Street because I had to go back to my situation.</p>

On 11th November, in the after<lb/>noon, I was in Portsmouth Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, and saw the driver fall off the van on his head—he looked stunned, and I helped him to the hospital—he was able to walk there—he had received some injuries—I left him there, and went back and took the horse and van from the last witness, and took them to the station, where Lack identified them—the next morning the prisoner was discharged from the hospital, and I took him in custody upon this charge, searched him, and found a pouch and tobacco-pipe upon him, but no money—I asked him his address, and he said he had none.</p>

I am stabbed"—a policeman came up and the prisoner made a plunge at him with the instrument in his hand—the people shouted out "He has got a knife!"—the policeman knocked him down—he got up, and the policeman and I chased him; he went into a cab-yard and then into the street again, and was taken in custody—I bled profusely and was very weak; my clothes were saturated right to my under-shirt—when we had the prisoner in custody a gang of 50 or 60 came round and said "There is only one of them, let us settle him"—the policeman knocked some of them down and blew his whistle—I helped to take the prisoner to the station, and afterwards went to the hospital and had my wound stitched up, and went again on the Sunday morning to have it re-dressed.</p>

I am a porter, and live at 9, Lloyd's Row, St. John's Street Road—on 22nd October last I saw the prisoner near the Angel at Islington; I did not know him before—he came up to me and asked if I could give him a night's lodging or could show him some lodging house, and I showed him a coffee-house in Myddelton Street—he then began to say that some one was going to murder him—I said, "What makes you think so, have you been doing anything wrong?"—he said, "No"—I said "Then what makes you frightened?"—I thought he was not right in his mind—he said he was very queer, and I told him he would be near the hospital if he took lodgings there—he then went to his brother's in Royston Street, and I followed him and saw him go into the passage, but I did not see his brother—I went with him because he was so strange in his manner, and he begged of me to go with him—he then came out and said his brother would not give him any lodging, and asked me if I would go a little farther with him, as he was sure something would happen to him—I went with him to a friend of his in Peter Street, and he asked him if he would let him sit in his chair, but he said it was not convenient—the friend then asked me if I would accompany the prisoner home to his wife and explain</p>

               <p>his ways and manners to her, but when I got there his wife was not at home—he then opened the front window and got in, and after he had shut the window down I went away, but came back again, as I thought I would see if things were all right, and he was then gone; and then I met him coming round the corner from the landlord's, and a man living opposite opened the street door with his key, then burst the prisoner's door open—the prisoner asked if we would go round the house, as there was somebody in the house going to murder him, and we went and looked in all the rooms, but saw nobody except the three children in bed already dressed—I and the other party then Game out and bid the prisoner good night—he then begged me not to follow him any more, and I said I would not—he then came out with the children—the girl seemed to be about three years old; he was carrying her in his arms; and the boys seemed to be four or five years old—he went on with the children towards the bridge, and I followed behind; and he deliberately threw the female child into the water, and was going to get hold of one of the little boys when I popped up—the prisoner then ran to the other side of the bridge and jumped over, and I saw him fall on the path—I called out "Police!" and a lady looked out of a window close at hand and then called her husband, and Mr. Osborne came out and rescued the child—a police constable came up and blew his whistle, and another policeman then came, and they searched for the prisoner, and shined on their lamps and saw him in a sitting position against the wall about 15 yards from the bridge.</p>

I am surgeon at Holloway Gaol—I examined the prisoner on the next morning after his admission there; he was then restless and strange, and had many delusions of being followed by people and being watched, and he was under the delusion that he was to be killed in the course of a year, that it was through him his fellow workmen were getting the <hi rend="italic">sack</hi>, and that he heard voices whispering to him that he was to die—I have had him under observation for a month, and having seen his family I came to the conclusion that at the time he was admitted he was insane, and therefore was insane at the time he committed this crime—he is very much better now since, he has been taken away from his associations, but I still consider his intellect is somewhat impaired—I am of opinion that at the time he committed this act he did not know he was doing wrong, or that he was trying to commit murder.</p>

I am a coach painter, of 14, Clement's Street, Barns<lb/>bury, and am the prisoner's brother—in Jubilee week I saw the prisoner, and he then appeared rather strange—I said to him "What is the matter with you?" and he said "I am haunted," and said he was being followed about by people—about the beginning of August he was out of work, and I gave him a job; I then noticed he was rather strange—I next saw him, about 5 p.m. on 21st October, he then looked rather strange, and he said to me "lam followed about by people," and he also said "I have been to see your aunt, she is dead," and asked me if I had seen her—she was not dead—I did not think he was right in his mind—on the 21st he looked as if he had been drinking.</p>

               <p>did not seem to be of old date—after the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi> was divided a large amount of serum escaped—the membranes were very much congested and were adherent to the bones—there must have been considerable violence to have caused such a bruise, but I could not possibly say how it was caused; it might have been caused by any blunt instrument—the left eye was also quite black and swollen, and immediately underneath it there was a wound about an inch long, the instrument, whatever it was, passed through this wound and under the left eye, fracturing the floor of the orbit, and also breaking the bone of the nose, and then fractured the sphinoid bone, which forms the base of a portion of the skull—the instrument passed in altogether about two inches from the outside surface—I also noticed under the eye where the instrument had passed through a black substance resembling coal or soot—I should say this instrument produced would have caused such a wound—the wound was large enough in diameter on the outside for that to have passed through—the poker had grazed along the eye before it entered it—she died from effusion on the brain and inflammation of the membranes, and that was caused by the internal injuries, the fracture of the bones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> A push with a pointed poker like that might have caused such a wound—when I first saw it I did not consider it a serious wound—at that time I knew nothing of the internal injuries—I did not take notice whether the woman was shorter than the prisoner—the injury on the top of the head might have been caused by a fall or a blow against something—I said at the inquest "Of course the woman might have had the poker in her hand at the time, and her husband might have pushed it in her eye in warding it away from himself, but that is extremely im<lb/>probable"—if the prisoner had been wrestling with a woman shorter than himself and had let go the poker and it went in her eye in that way, I think it would have required more force, and from the direction of the injuries I should think that very improbable.</p>

I am now secretary of the Junior Army and Navy Stores, Limited—Colonel Weans, the late secretary, died after the insti<lb/>tution of these proceedings—I began to act on October 5th—I have been in the employ of the society since its foundation in 1879—the prisoner was chief of the deposit order department, for which two rooms are knocked into one—he had about 15 clerks under him—there are 11,000 or 12,000 deposit accounts, which are kept in five sets of ledgers, of which U to Z is the last—the prisoner was always there during business hours—persons who have money on deposit are allowed to draw out goods on order forms or by letter, and money by cheques—this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the printed form which was in use—they are done up in books with counterfoils, which we supply members with—the cheques are consecutively numbered like bankers' cheques, of which a register is kept—there is no entry in the register of the prisoner having ever applied for a cheque-book—application for a cheque-book would not be made to me—this bundle of Waring's cheques (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are from several books—I have never seen any cheque-book of Waring's—there are eight directors, and Major Clench is the managing director—they meet once a fortnight—for their information at the end of the June half-years it was the practice to prepare a list of debit balances from the ledgers, which Mr. Waring would present to the directors, and at the end of the year the same thing was done with reference to the whole year—that return would take a month to make, during which month a good many debit balances would be extinguished—the debit balances on 31st Decem<lb/>ber would form the basis of one item in the auditors' balance-sheet—the auditors are accountants; they do not attend in the office with Waring—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the details of the U to Z ledger—when there is no debit balance no reference would be made to the folios—the largest debit balance is Mr. Waring's 142<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that is under folio 373—this is an extract from the U to Z ledger; these two sheets are made up to January 1st, 1884, and the total amount is 426<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 1st January, 1885, the form of keeping the accounts was changed, and not only were the debit balances extracted but the credit as well, and these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the debit and credit balances prepared at the close of 1884—the date is 1st January, 1885—eight sheets refer to the U to Z ledger—Mr. Waring's account in that year's ledger is at folio 573, but there is no entry of that account in the debit balances—the nearest numbers to 573 are 576 and 679—Waring's account is not extracted or brought out under any number—the total is 726<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which should have been 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if Waring's account had been included—this return of the debit balances on 1st July, 1885, was taken out about a month before the end of the half-year—in some places there are notices that the persons have gone abroad, or that</p>

               <p>issued, but you have not given instructions to produce it—I can recollect an amount under the heading of "Mess and Canteen Account"—I do not think that is very much in excess of the average, it is about the same this year—I gave my evidence at the police-court after several remands, and before I gave it I was subpoenaed to produce the books mentioned—I did not refuse, but there were so many of them it was inconvenient to the business to bring them all, that was my only reason, and I did so under the solicitor's advice—I had found the black-book at that time—I swore before the Magistrate "I have no knowledge of the fact that Waring was paid 1$ per cent, on 65,000 shares"—I could not pledge myself to 65,000, but I did not say that I did not know anything about the commission paid on shares—the Magistrate asked me to produce the black-book—my memory was not then refreshed as to the number of the shares—I do not know whether the number shown there is accurate, it is not a book of the Company—I have not looked at the Company's books to verify the defendant's book—I do not know whether he placed that number of shares—I have not the slightest reason for saying that it is not correct—I do not know that he actually placed 65,000 shares—I did not countersign every one of the cheques paid to him for commission, only some of them—I knew he was paid some commission; there was an account kept, but it did not come within my province to investigate it—I have not the slightest reason to doubt that he has placed 49,000 or 50,000 of the Company's shares, but I do not know what you mean by placing—the directors promised him a commission on placing—he was not constantly buying up the shares and selling them again to improve their value, but he may have done it for his own benefit—I know it from hearsay—I do not know of his buying shares at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a share and adver<lb/>tising them as the property of a lady going abroad, and selling them at par, or of Major Clench being a party to it—a resolution was passed to the effect that the Staff should cease to buy shares, that was to prevent dealings of this kind—this is a copy of Waring's ledger account, in which every one of the cheques which he had paid appears, and as far as I know every one of his transactions is entered in the ledger, which was not kept by him—one clerk kept it, but there are some entries in another writing—it would lie on the ledger clerk's desk, but it was not open to any of the directors or of the Staff who chose to go into the office—cus<lb/>tomers' accounts are supposed to be confidential—these books did not go into the auditors' hands, but I never heard any direction to the contrary—the auditors could have taken the balance-sheet and turned to the ledger and verified it—the entries of the prisoner's account in the ledger are in Mr. Touzeau's writing, a clerk who is here—this account starts from January 1st, 1884, but I do not know how long before that it began—from December, 1884, to the present time the total amount paid in is 783<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., prior to which about 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been paid in—on 13th March, 1884, 743<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid in and drawn out again, which I gather from the ledger had something to do with shares, but I do not know whether he bought shares—Mr. Adamson's name is there, he is a shareholder; I don't know that I ever saw him, or whether he sold his shares to the prisoner—I cannot assist you to understand these entries—it was obvious to any one who looked at the debit balance-sheet and compared it with the ledger, that the prisoner had an account which was overdrawn; this 242<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the largest item, and anybody would naturally look to see</p>

               <p>what it was, and would see that the prisoner's account was overdrawn to that extent—I swore the original information in this case, and heard it stated to the Magistrate that no one of these debit balances of the prisoner's had been disclosed at all, but that was corrected afterwards—I did not know that he had a deposit account before these proceedings—the clerks in his office had deposit accounts but I had not—some of the officials had, and the managing director had—I do not know that Major Clench and all his family had; I am not in the deposit office—other persons' balances were also kept back from the balance-sheet; Mrs. Jackson's deposit account was overdrawn 119<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in January, 1887, which did not appear in the debit balance-sheet, and Captain Bogle's account was overdrawn 152<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in January, 1887; Major Clench, the managing director's account, was overdrawn 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 1st January, 1884, the same date when Waring's account is on the balance-sheet—on 30th June, 1875, there was a balance of 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. against Major Clench, which is not disclosed on the balance-sheet—E.

Clench and his wife could not have got 1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in debt to the Stores without the prisoner's knowledge—he must have stamped their cheques in the same way that he did his own—there is an india-rubber stamp with his signature, but it only appears on one of them; all the rest are actual writing—at the request of the defendant's solicitor I supplied him with the information you asked for with regard to the people named Clench—this schedule was supplied to them—I never wilfully kept back any book of account—I had the black book at the police-court twice before it was asked for; it is a small book, and I left it in a drawer of my desk on the first occasion, and explained that it was accidentally absent—the notice to me was to bring down all the ledgers for all the years for all the alphabet—this is the first notice, and this is the second (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it would have been a serious inconvenience to have all the ledgers away at the same time—there are I dare say 1,000 accounts in the C to F ledger—I was advised not to carry a cart load of books, and this statement was supplied to them, and the prisoner's solicitor had been allowed to come and inspect our books—in this account, copied from the different ledgers, under March 13th, 743<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is brought in in a debit entry of 840<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—if the earlier payment is a receiving of cash by</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was perfectly well known among all the cashiers that Waring had got an account—his cheques were constantly coming to be cashed by any cashier—the practice is for a cheque to be sent up to the deposit department to be stamped—one of these cheques is stamped with an india-rubber stamp with the prisoner's signature—the stamp was generally used, but the majority were signed by Mr. Waring or the ledger clerk, Tozeau, in Waring's absence—any clerk could stamp it, but it would be necessary for him to write his name on it—I was in the department myself nearly six months, from June to December, 1885,. but not as a ledger clerk—I took over for a month or two a small ledger containing accounts of public institutions—I have Been the U to Z ledger lying in the office—these cheques of Waring's have not been taken off a file, they were done up in packets and put away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a signalman in the service of the Great Northern Railway Company—I was employed at a signal-box known as the Ganny Signal-box, between Barnet and Potter's Bar—the prisoner was also employed there as a signalman—each of us was on duty for twelve hours, from 7 to 7, changing each day; one on at night, and one at day; on Sunday morning the box closes at 6—on Saturday, 15th October, the prisoner was on day duty—I went on duty on Saturday night, and left on Sunday morning at 6—on Monday morning I went on duty again at 6, there being no one there on Sunday—it was my practice to take my breakfast in the signal-box, and the prisoner also—we never quarrelled until March last—we had some disputes about our plants—I only killed one of his—he killed a large quantity of my beans, which he paid me for—I threatened to report him about some coal found on the line—he had not threatened to report me—on the Monday morning I made my cocoa for breakfast—I drew the water from the filter, boiled it, and made my cocoa—I then tasted it; it had a very peculiar taste—I drank very little of it—I then tasted the dry cocoa—that was all right—I then drew some water from the filter, and that tasted worse; then I drew some from the water butt, and found that all right—a platelayer came along, and I asked him to taste it—I first gave him some of the water from the water-butt, and then some from the filter—I could not eat any breakfast or dinner from the nastiness in my mouth—I kept on duty all day—I was very thirsty—I did not feel any ill effects till after I had my tea and went to bed—I then felt pain in all my body—I could not lie—I rose myself up, and then purging took place all night and all next day, and I was sick—at midday on Monday I sent for the station master—I showed him the filter and the water, and he took it away—on Tuesday I went and saw the doctor—I got a great deal better on Tuesday, but the effects went into my legs—on Wednesday and Thursday I could scarcely stand.</p>

Did he report that there was any poison in it?"—I said "Yes"—he said "What did he say it was?"—I said "The analyst reports that the water in the filter contains 108 grains of acid and chloride of zinc, which is poison"—he said "I did not know it was poison, I only did it to annoy him, I thought it would make the water distasteful, I did not think it would hurt him"—I forwarded</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 17, Ratoliffe Road, South Kensington; I have no occupation—about May this year I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi>, in consequence of which I wrote a letter and went to the Imperial Buildings, Ludgate Circus, and saw the defendant—I referred to the advertisement—he told me that the London and Globe Drug Company was going to be formed into a limited concern, and a secretary would be required, and my name would be put forward as a candidate; there were a number of applicants, but I should have a good chance of getting the appointment if I put some money into the syndicate—there was some discussion about the amount, and eventually 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was agreed upon—he told me other gentlemen had put money into it, and if I wanted to get the appointment I had better do the same—I do not think I paid any money that day; I paid 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 25th May, for which he gave me this receipt, dated May 27th, and an agreement was drawn up, of which I took this copy. (<hi rend="italic">This was between G.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I did not call on Messrs. Pitts and Savage—I understood that the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to promote the Company—"London and Drug Company" was on the door—your name is only written with the apostrophe in one letter; the others are signed "Beno"—I looked upon the prospectus as a proof—you did not tell me that the printers made a mistake in leaving out the apostrophe—I wrote that agreement at your dictation, and took a true copy of it—I had five days to consider it and decide as to whether I paid the balance—I do not think I objected to any clause in it—I handed you a bill of exchange, signed by Mr. McCulloch, on Whit Tuesday—I wrote to you to get it discounted; I did not then think that I had been swindled—I was made bankrupt about two years ago; I have never applied for my discharge—a short time before I gave you the bill I was arranging with a gentleman in the real estate business for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but it was not my own money—Bishop Richardson's name is on this prospectus; I believe he was a director of the Company—I remember your being summoned to the Mansion House for obtaining 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by false pretences—the case against you was dismissed—I was in Court, but I did not then know that you had defrauded me—I believe that Dr. Dalley was a director, and Mr. Blagrove—you told me that they withdrew, after Cavanagh's case—I said that I would try and obtain directors—this is my letter, dated 17th June (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he would endeavour to secure Lord Pollington as a director</hi>)—these two letters are mine, and this slip—I say in one of them "What bonus are you prepared to give me?"—Mr. Hooblank is the chairman of the Company—I was employed at Earl's Court, but I called twice a week at Ludgate Circus—since your imprisonment I applied to serve you with a writ at Holloway Prison, and it was served on you, and I have marked judgment on it; you could have defended yourself if you had liked—I have not seen Cavanagh here this morning—I think you said you did not require the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at once, and that I could pay it as you required it—I think you said the syndicate consisted of six members, and that you had paid two or three of them off because they were small sums—I was to receive 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bonus on allotment for my investment—it says "The secretary will not be required till the Company goes to allotment"—after Cavanagh's case appeared you suggested the advisability of remaining quiet for awhile—in the meantime I was endeavouring to get directors—you told me that you had got the consent of a bank—I knew that Pitts and Savage were the solicitors—you said that you and I and Mr. Cameron would be committing a fraud if you qualified him; he is the manager of the "Hop Bitter"—I was in the office on the day you were arrested, you had written me a letter the day before—the clerk told me that Dr. Dalley was there, but I did not know him by sight; I have no reason to believe he was not there—I do not know of any debts against you at</p>

               <p>Holborn or anything dishonourable, if there had been I do not know that you would have located at Imperial Buildings—you asked me to I assist you in selling some property in the States; I did not write there to see if you had such property left you by a relation—persons can trade in what names they like—the first prospectus was cancelled after Cavanagh's case, I think that was in June—I did not call upon the persons named in it and ask if they were directors—you never mentioned General Sprig<lb/>field's name to me—you asked me if I would take a vacant seat on the Board if an opportunity offered; I said "Yes," and there was an under<lb/>standing that I should resign the secretaryship if I became a director—you did not say that I could not do so because I was an undischarged bankrupt—about a fortnight before your arrest the son of the chairman of the Hop Bitter Company called; I did not then say "Mr. Kerr, half your money is already spent in the syndicate"—I understood that my money would go towards advertising the prospectus, but the prospectus had never been in the papers, therefore I thought it was funny—you entered into a like agreement to mine—I am prepared to make good the judgment under this writ if I can, but it is not my money if I get it—I understood that you were the owner of this Drug Company, the words London Drug Company are put up, and they are also on the pill-boxes; it does not state "R'Eno;" I was quite sanguine about the Company.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It was the information I got from the prisoner which made me sanguine; he made the statements as to the directors and so on, and I relied upon them—I proposed the names of the Hon. Mr. Clarke and Mr. Erskine to him, but I had not obtained those gentlemen's consent—I think it was the same day I told him that I was an undischarged bankrupt that he offered me a seat on the Board—while I was attending twice a week I did not know he was putting other names forward for the secretaryship—I considered the appointment was mine from 31st May—I wrote down the agreement of 10th June from the prisoner's dictation, but I took it home, I did not sign it on the spot.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk, and live at Bellerly Road, Clapham Common—a friend handed me an advertisement in June; I answered it and received a letter in reply signed R. R'Eno, which I have not got; in consequence of which I went to the London and Globe Drug Company, Imperial Buildings, Ludgate Circus, where I saw the prisoner; he said he was in want or a secretary for the London and Globe Drug Company, of which he was manager, and that he came from America to esta<lb/>blish a branch here for the manufacture and sale of some, patent pills which had been established a long time in America, and the turnover was 50,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; I asked him the name of the Company; he asked me if it seriously affected me; I said "Yes, if I become a shareholder;" he said "I must withhold the name, I don't see that it affects you at present;" he said that he had a number of applications, and showed me a number of letters; one gentleman, I think it was Mr. Cavendish, gave very high references, one of whom was the Duke of Devonshire; I said "I presume the appointment would be best held by a business man, do you think you would get a business man in Cavendish?" he said "No, probably not;" he handed me a prospectus and said that he should be very happy to answer any questions I put to him; I noticed that the word "Limited" was not on it, and said that it was important that it should be made a limited company, for security to the shareholders, he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188711210055"/>
               <p>said that could be altered; I noticed the names of the directors and inquired who they were—one was Richardson, another General Spring<lb/>field or Greenfield; I asked what nationality General Springfield was; he said an American, and that there were two or three Americans—I saw the names, Richardson and Blagrove, on the prospectus, I do not recognise the other names—he asked me what sum I could invest in shares in the Company; I said whatever the amount was I thought I could satisfy the directors; he said 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he ought to have 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down as a proof of <hi rend="italic">bona fides</hi>; I told him I had had to do with public companies before, and he said from my past experience he thought I should be lucky, and he would recommend me; I am certain that was in June—I put a number of questions to him touching the solvency and solidity of the concern; his answers were not satisfactory—I noticed in the prospectus that the vendor was to receive 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash and 6,000 fully paid-up shares; I asked him what that consisted of, whether there were leases or stock in trade; his answer was not satisfactory—he grew very warm indeed, and I told him I thought it was a swindle, and I would take good care to let my friends know, and he ordered me out of the office.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Requesting him to call at the London and Globe Drug Company.</hi>) I went there and saw the prisoner—he told me that the Company was about to be converted into a limited one, that they required a secretary, and he asked if I had been in the drug business—I said "No, but I have been connected with limited-com<lb/>panies"—he then dictated this agreement, which I wrote down, but the last two words, "by you," were written by the prisoner on the 28th, after it was stamped—he said that if I wanted the berth I must take a financial interest in the syndicate, which was for the promotion of the Company, and that the Articles of Association were in the solicitor's hands for amend<lb/>ment—I asked to see a prospectus, but he refused; he gave me a sheet of paper with the names of the Hon. J. Erskine and Sir somebody Clarke, upon it, and said that they were the directors—he did not show me the prospectus because, he said, he had done so to one of the applicants, who had been making inquiries of the directors, and they did not like it—I agreed to subscribe 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. towards the syndicate, and to pay 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit, the remaining 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to stand over—he said that as I had been in a company's office before, I should stand a very good chance of getting the berth—I left, and returned next day, Sept. 1st, and paid him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he said he would put my application before the directors, and in a few days they would be having a meeting, and if I called I should know the result—I</p>

               <p>did so, and he said the directors had postponed their meeting to a further date—I called again on 7th or 8th September, and he told me I had been appointed secretary at a salary of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and asked if I was prepared to pay the balance of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said that I should not be ready for seven days—he said by the time I was ready with my money the Company would be limited and registered—I asked to have an interview with the directors so as to get my appointment at their hands—he said that I should not see them in the office till I had paid my money and entered on my duties—I told him I should not pay any more money until I had more information from him about the concern—he said that he would go to the solicitors round the corner and ascertain what stage the Company was in, so far as registration was concerned—he asked me what bonus I would give him if he got me the berth without my taking any financial interest in the concern—I was not satisfied, and afterwards wrote, with<lb/>drawing my application, and went to the office and asked for the return of my money—this is the receipt he had given me for the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">This stated</hi>: "In the event of your not being appointed to the secretaryship, we agree to refund the deposit paid.")

On 12th October I took the the prisoner at Room 28, Imperial Buildings, Ludgate Hill, on a warrant obtained on the information of Mr. Bradbury, which I read to him—he made no reply—previous to that he tore up a letter in the office; I picked up the pieces, which have since been pasted together—this is it—it is written from Brighton and signed "Regan," and an envelope directed "W. W. Regan, Esq., care of George Reno, Esq., Imperial Buildings, London, England"—I found on him at the station several documents and eight pawnbrokers' duplicates; one was for a dress and one for a sealskin cape—he said "I bought them"—I also found a letter from Messrs. Wontner relating to Mr. Bradbury's claim—one of the eight duplicates was a special contract note of a caligraph pledged at Wimbledon on 12th July for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the name of Tweedy, and one of the other duplicates was in the name of Tweedy—I also found two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, 63637 and 63638, which are two of Mr. Bradbury's notes—I asked him for his private address—he said "I give my address Imperial Buildings"—I said "That is not your private address"—he said "That is my address"—I said that I was going back to the office to search for books and papers relating to the Company—he said "The books and papers are at my private address and at my solicitors'"—I went back to the office but found no business books relating to the transactions of the Company—this is the only book I found.

Bishop Richardson would like particulars if it is not already filled up"—I did not call till you sent the particulars, which are now in Court—that letter contained a list of medical firms who had made a good deal of money, naming four persons who were directors—you had not given me your name then, but you afterwards wrote it three times "George R. Eno"—I took the document to my solicitor, and saw his confidential clerk—I wrote this letter of 6th April, 1887, in which I asked "How do you propose to pay the fees?"</p>

S. Wolsley—I was not a director, except subject to my solicitor's advice, which was never given; it never went beyond that provisional arrange<lb/>ment—I never saw Dr. Dalley, or Mr. Dawson, or Mr. Blagrove, till I saw Mr. Blagrove at the police-court—I have reason to doubt every statement which the prisoner has made.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, practising at 22, Lawrence Pountney Lane, in the City, and I am a Commissioner of Oaths—in June last the prisoner, who was a stranger, was brought to me by a man named Romilly, of whom I knew nothing, to obtain for him a loan upon a legacy of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he alleged was payable to him at the death of an old lady—he required I think 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay off four charges then existing on the legacy, that he had already created—a copy of the will was brought to me, which I was told was the will under which he was entitled, and that was all the information I received—he said the old lady was 87 years of age—before I could put the matter in train to obtain a large advance I was told by Romilly that an immediate advance was wanted; that was not in the prisoner's presence in the first instance, but it was afterwards repeated in his presence—the prisoner was a tea traveller I believe, and the immediate advance was to obtain tea with, I believe—a client of mine made an advance through me of 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I took from the prisoner as security this fifth charge (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I also took this Statutory declaration of the facts as stated to me—I prepared a draft of that in my own handwriting, which the prisoner took home, and after three or four days, I think, brought it back signed "Approved, Albert Nash"—before he declared it, I read it over to him—he had part of the money before the declaration was actually made—I was present when he subscribed and declared this document before me—I saw him sign "Albert Nash"—a promissory note for 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at three months was given; the note was Butler's, endorsed "Albert Nash"—it was handed to me for my client, Mr. Darvell, I acted for him all through—that note was to cover the 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. advanced, I took it as a collateral security—when that was due it was presented and dishonoured; Nash and the drawer were sued on it and judgment recovered, but the Sheriff had to withdraw, as there was a bill of sale over the whole of the furniture—I have not recovered a sixpence on behalf of my client. (<hi rend="italic">The declaration was read. The prisoner by it declared that he had resided at 4, Newcomen Road, Finchley, for three years, and that the contents of that residence were his absolute property, and unencumbered by bill of sale, mort<lb/>gage, settlement, or otherwise.</hi>)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I cannot say who Romilly was; he was introduced to me by Mr. Thomas, who has been a client of mine for several years—I don't think I saw Romilly except in reference to this matter—I saw him a few days before I saw Nash—Thomas introduced Romilly, and Romilly introduced Nash—Romilly told me he knew a person who wanted to have</p>

               <p>an advance—the draft declaration is in my writing, I made it up from information given me by Romilly, and I believe I had what I was told was a copy of the will under which he was entitled to the legacy of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not draw it up in his presence—it is not a long document; I read it over to him after the engrossment, and I believe I read the draft declaration to him at my office a day or two before he declared it; my impression is I did; he brought it back and he had written "Approved, Albert Nash" on it—I gave the draft declaration, when I had finished writing it, to Romilly—Nash and Romilly brought it back; I believe I read it over then—Nash's name was on it when he brought it back—I read it over to him when he brought it back signed "Approved" as a matter of precaution—I have not been asked before to-day whether I read the draft to him—my impression is I read it, because there were some blanks in it that wanted filling up—every word of it is mine except "Approved, Albert Nash"—that is in pencil inked over—the ink is all Nash's—I am not certain about the "Approved" in pencil, it seems different writing—this draft was not entirely drawn up by me from documents placed in my possession by Romilly, acting for the prisoner—the only document I had was the copy of the will—I don't think I ever asked the prisoner whether there was a bill of sale on his furniture before I drew up this declaration—I swear I read over the engrossment to him—I won't swear I read the draft over—I have had Romilly subpoenaed, I don't know if he is here—afterwards the actual declaration was sworn before me—I don't think I was acting as solicitor for him—the prisoner paid my charges—the mortgagor always pays the mortgagee's charges—I said before the Magistrate I would act if I was properly retained—I never received a retainer—I was paid a guinea, I cannot say whether by Nash or Romilly—I was acting as solicitor for Mr. Darvell, but not for Nash, I had no retainer from him—I said before the Magistrate I was acting for both parties because nobody else was acting in the matter—I swear I read over every word of the declaration before it was sworn—there was some discussion as to the Trustees at the time—I cannot say if Romilly was present at the time—I was not asked before the Magistrate whether the declaration was read over before it was sworn—I and the prisoner were represented by Counsel—I don't remember that they asked me such a question—I read over the engrossment because of some altera<lb/>tion in the Trustees—we went right through it, and I altered some names—I think Romilly was present when it was read over; no one else I think but Romilly and the prisoner—I have no entry in my diary of this trans<lb/>action—it is not usual—the total amount of advance made by Mr. Darvel was 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had a guinea out of that; I suppose the prisoner had the rest—I received a letter since this matter, I think it is from Romilly—I am not very familiar with his writing—it gives his address, and deals with this case—I had great difficulty in subpoenaing him—I am not aware that a suggestion was made before the Magistrate that the declaration was given to Romilly, and that he read it over to the prisoner—he told me Butler was a good man, employed at Crosse and Blackwell's, and I find he moved three days before the bill became due, and was not at Crosse and Blackwell's—I sued Butler and the prisoner on one occasion—I signed judgment against them, and had to proceed under Order 14—I obtained judgment.</p>

I am a builder, of 41, Tunbridge Street—on the night of 7th November, about four minutes past 10, I was passing by my house and noticed a light in my front parlour, which I occupy myself—the back parlour is unfurnished—I went upstairs, let myself in, and went to the front parlour door; it was locked as I had left it before; I went to the back parlour door opening into the passage, which was open—Under<lb/>wood came out of the back parlour and tried to pass me—I collared him and brought him along the passage out on to the bottom of the steps; there I held him, and Duggan came out of the house and ran across and up the street—while I was holding Underwood Payne came across the street and caught hold of my right arm and said "Let him go"—I said "No"—a policeman came up and Payne rushed out of the crowd of 20 or 30 people who had gathered round, and went away to the back of the crowd—I gave Underwood in charge, and told the constable to bring him inside to see what damage was done—as we were going up the steps from the footway Payne kicked at me but missed his mark and just touched my calf—we went into the house—I found the middle door between the parlours was forced open and two boxes in the front parlour were ransacked—two pairs of trousers and a cricket suit and guernsey had</p>

               <p>been taken out of the boxes and carried into the back parlour, an empty room, to be carried away—nothing was taken away—when I first got to the house I noticed Payne across the street—before I caught Under<lb/>wood I looked over my short blind and saw some one with a lucifer match in his hand examining my couch, but I could not say who it was—I lot lodgings—about 9 o'clock before this I had been at home—I left the front door shut—none of my lodgers could have left the door open, I was the last in the house and out of the house—that was about nine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 21, Adams Gardens, Rotherhithe—I knew William Bottomley—I was keeping company with him at the time of his death—he was 19 years of age last birthday—on Monday night, 17th October, I was in the China Hall public-house in Neptune Street, Lower Road, Peptford—Bottomloy, James Moyse, and Mary Ann Wells were with me—a man whose name I then did not know, but whom I know now to be William Connor, was there with Susan Anderson, who I also did not know then—soon after 12 o'clock we all six left the public-house together, and at the corner of Neptune Street Bottomley and Connor left us—we walked on a short way in the direction of the Wesleyan Chapel; we stopped there, and two Italians came by—the prisoner is one of them—the other man was shorter—the prisoner said "Three to one is too many"—Moyse said "Shut it"—the prisoner then hit Moyse in the eye—I ran and screamed out for my young man Bottomley—he came running up—when the prisoner struck Moyse he returned the blow with his hand, I think, and I saw him run into the middle of the road—he did not fall—when Bottomley came up the shorter Italian hit him across the head, I think, with a stick, which he had in his hand—they had a struggle, and Bottomley fell down, and the Italian on the top of him—I pulled him off by his hair, and he ran away without his hat—the prisoner ran towards the Salvation Army Barracks, and the short one towards the Royal Oak—we all five then walked along towards Albion Street, past the Wesleyan Chapel—we stopped to say good night—I then missed my brooch, and Bottomley and I walked back towards the Wesleyan Chapel to find it; as we nearly got towards the chapel the prisoner rushed out from the chapel, like in a nook, and he struck Bottomley on the forehead and he brought his hand round, and I saw his hand go to Bottomley's side—I did not see anything in his hand—his hat was a little over his forehead, and he had his hands in his pockets, and his collar was up to his neck—he then ran away towards the Salvation Army Barracks—I screamed out; I don't know whether I said Polly or Jim, but they both came up—I did notice the others—Mysore came up directly and was going to run after the prisoner, but Bottomley said "Stop, Jim, I am stabbed," and we assisted him across the road to the chemist's shop—I then ran up Albion Street to see the deceased's sister, who lives there—I could not rouse her, and I returned to the chemist's shop—Bottomlry was still there—from some thing I heard I ran up to Union Road, to go to Bottomley's mother—as I was going along the Union Road I saw the prisoner—he was going up Union Road, on the opposite side, in the same direction as I was going—he was right opposite the Culling Road—I saw screaming at the time—I ran against a young man named Nicholls—the prisoner came half way into the road. when I ran into Nicholls' arms, and then he turned back, but I did not notice</p>

               <p>which way he went—I saw him turn back to go towards the Royal Oak.—I then went back to the chemist's shop—I did not see the prisoner there—I cannot recollect whether Bottomley was still there—I went to the police-station as soon as I got to the chemist's shop; about three minutes after, I think it was—I there saw Bottomley's sister at the bottom, of the steps, and at the station I saw the prisoner; he was then in custody, he seemed as if he was, standing coming out of a doorway—the inspector did not speak to me—no one did, but as I went to the door I screamed out "That is the man"—he did not say anything then—when he was in the dock he said "It is a mistake"—that was soon after—I do not remember the inspector asking me anything—when Mary Wells spoke the prisoner said "It is a mistake; I have been to Walworth with my young woman"—I was quite sober, and so were all of us except Conner—next day I saw Bottomley, and he was dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was the only Italian at the station—I don't recollect telling the Magistrate that somebody said "Is that the man"—when the inspector was writing some one said "Would you know the man," and I said "Yes," and I rushed to the door and saw the prisoner—I screamed out "That is the man;" not when he was in the dock, but as he was coming out of the door—as he stood at the door some one asked me if that was the man—I and Bottomley left his mother's house on this night between 8 and 9 o'clock by our two selves—when we got to the public-house we found Moyse and Wells there—Connor came in about an hour afterwards with his young woman Anderson—we got into conversation with them—Moyse had had a glass of ale before Connor came in—they did not order any drink, only for their two selves—I think it had gone 12 when we left the public-house—I did not take any notice of any clock striking—the house does not close till half-past—Polly said "I think he has had a little drop to drink," meaning Connor—there was no disturbance or noise in the house; there was some singing on the other side, but I don't know who they were—we sang one song—we sang a little in the house before we left, me and Wells and a strange young woman, to ourselves—when we left the house, Connor and Anderson said they had to go to Church Street—that would be in the same direction to that in which Bottomley and I would go and also Moyse and Wells—we walked up to the corner of Neptune Street, where the Salvation Barracks are—Wells and myself were walking together at first; the men were only just behind us; they went on talking—there was nothing to call my attention to Connor—we walked on in the same order, and just at the corner Bortomley and Connor left us—we knew they were coming on immediately; I stood there with Moyse waiting for them, and then the Italians came up—it was all done very quickly; all in a minute—the taller Italian ran away first towards the Salvation Barracks and the other ran towards the Royal Oak—I have never seen him since—after this was over we girls went on singing again—I can't say whether it was a severe blow that Moyse gave the taller Italian—I had hold of Bottomley's arm and walked along with him first—I don't know who followed—Bottomley said to me "He has bit my thumb"—I knew that the others were following us; we stood at the corner to say "Good-bye" to them, and then I said "I have lost my brooch"—we all walked back to look for it—Bottomley and I went on and the others followed—I looked on the pavement for it on the same side as the Wesleyan Chapel—then the Italian came out of the nook of the</p>

               <p>chapel; the blow was struck, and Bottomley exclaimed "I am stabbed"—it was all done very quickly—as soon as he had done it he ran away towards Neptuno Street—we could not see him then—there were two blows—Moyse ran as if in pursuit of him only a few steps before he was called back by Bottomley—I don't know what had become of Connor and Anderson at that time; when Moyse came back they were not there—he helped me with Bottomley across the road to the chemist's—I and Moyse and Wells assisted him to the chemist's—I did not notice any one else—he put his arm round my shoulders and Moyse was on the other side—we got him across very quickly, but he staggered before he got to the shop—we laid him down and I kicked at the door of the shop—then I went to Bottomley's sister in Union Street—while I was trying to rouse her I saw people accumulating at the corner, and on coming back to the chemist's shop I saw Bottomley on the pavement, and I rushed up the road screaming—it was opposite the Culling Road that I first noticed the Italian; he was on the opposite side of the pavement—I did not notice another man in front of me—I was screaming and he ran after me; it was the same man—then Nicholls met me right opposite Houghton's—I was very much frightened—I came back with Nicholls—I cannot tell anything definitely that occurred from the time I met Nicholls till I was at the station—as I was coming back with Nicholls I heard some whistles; I only heard one whistle blow—I don't remember anything that happened when I got back to the chemist's shop—I am quite positive that the same Italian that struck Moyse was the Italian who came out from the nook of the chapel with his hat slouched and his coat turned up—I did not see him with any weapon at all—Wells went for the doctor as soon as we got to the chemist's shop, and I went for Bottomley's sister—we did not go away together; we went in different directions—I did not see Wells when I got back—I did not notice any Italian women.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I saw the prisoner in the disturbance with Moyse he was wearing his hat—I could see his face; I am quite sure of that—when he afterwards came from the chapel his hat was over his forehead—I saw his face then, and afterwards when I went to Bottomley's mother in Union Road I saw his face then—when I saw him at the station two gentlemen had him in custody—I screamed out "That's the man"—some one said "Is that the man?" and I said "Yes"—I am quite sure he is the man—I had not heard that there was a man in custody—I am quite sure of that; I did not know he was locked up—I did not go to the station expecting to see the man; I am sure of that—I went to the station because I saw a crowd going up that way—when I missed my brooch we all six went to look for it; I and Bottomley were in front, the others were not very far behind—as Wells and Moyse were running up they could see what he did to Bottomley—they came up directly; the man had only got two or three steps away.</p>

               <p>Hall public-house—I left at two minutes past 12 with Camley, Wells, Moyse, Bottomley, and Connor—Connor did not look the worse for drink—as we went on, Connor and Bottomley left us, and I went on with the others—two men went by and said something which I could not under<lb/>stand, and Moyse calmed them, and they returned, and the taller one struck Moyse, who struck again, but I did not see where—we all went on, and Bottomley and Connor came round the corner; they were all struggling together—I saw the short Italian, but did not see what he did—I saw Bottomley struggling with him, but I did not see him on the ground—after the struggle the two Italians ran away—one had lost his hat, but he went on, and Cumley said when we got to Albion Street that she had lost her brooch—she turned back with her young man, and I went on by her side, but only a few steps—we were not far from the chapel when I saw Bottomley struggling with him, but I did not see him on the ground—after the struggle the two Italins ran away—one had lost his hat, but he went on, and Cumley said when we got to Albin Street that she and lost her brooch—she turned back her young man, and I went on by her side, but obnly a few steps—we were not far from the chapel when I saw a man coming to meet us—I did not see him come out of the chapel; he sprang on Bottomley and hugged him round the neck, and then I saw a flash of steel going towards the deceased's left side—I screamed, and the man ran away towards the Salvation Army, and Bottomley said "Tilly, I am stabbed"—I did not see Moyse and Wells there—Bottomley ran across the road and staggered and fell—I did not see any one help him across—I did not see Matilda Cumley there at that time—I was sober—Wells said "Come and get a doctor"—Bottomley was by a chemist's shop—I did not know the face of the taller or shorter man—I cannot say whether the prisoner is the taller man or not.</p>

I am a labourer of Rotherhithe—on 18th October, about 12.20 a.m., I was in Union Road, Rotherhithe—I heard a whistle and saw Matilda Cumley running along Union Road towards Lower Deptford Road—I saw the prisoner on the same side of the way walking in the same direction—Cumley came up to me and said "Master, master, my old man is stabbed"—the prisoner was then in the middle of the road, and when she said that he showed his teeth and walked very quickly back towards the Royal Oak—I followed in that direction with Cumley, and round the corner of the Royal Oak to the right I saw about twenty people by a chemist's shop, and the prisoner among them, very close to a wounded man—two officers took him in charge—I knew him by sight; I have seen him very often selling his ice cream with a barrow in the streets, and am quite sure of him—I did not know his name or that he had a brother.</p>

               <p>the morning of October 8th I was on a tram in lower Road, Deptford, which was standing by the Royal Oak at 12.20 as near as I can re<lb/>collect—I saw two men and a woman running round the Royal Oak from Union Road to Lower Road, Deptford—they turned the corner to the right, towards Deptford, towards the Salvation Barracks—I then heard a scream—the driver and conductor got out—the tram drove on towards Deptford—the tram arrived at a chemist's shop; I saw a man stagger and fall there—the tram went on some distance, and then I got off and saw the deceased lying on the pavement; his clothes were saturated with blood, and two men were holding him up; I don't know who they were—there were no other persons there besides the two who were holding him up—I inquired what was the matter, and heard that he had been stabbed—I got out my whistle, blew it, and the police arrived a few minutes afterwards, and a great many people.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman M</hi>). In the early morning of 18th October I was in Culling Road with Hicks, another constable, both in plain clothes—at about 12.20 I saw two men and a woman going towards Union Road—I believe the prisoner to be one of them, and the other was much shorter, an Italian—he was without a hat, and the woman had no bonnet—I could tell by her appearance that she was an Italian—as she passed us she brought her hands together and said "Oh my God!" and seemed excited, and the shorter Italian was on the trot—I did not see which way they went, but directly they passed us a whistle blew, and we ran in that direc<lb/>tion—that was half a minute from the time the prisoner passed us—we did not go into the Union Road first, we went into the Deptford Road, and to the left to the chemist's shop, and on coming up to 16, Deptford Lower Road I saw a man lying on the pavement—I don't suppose there were more than eight or ten people there—I looked at the man lying on the ground, and Hicks touched me on the shoulder and said something, I cannot say whether he was near enough for the prisoner to hear—I looked up and saw the prisoner in the crowd looking at the man who was on the ground—I arrested him, and told him I should take him to the station on suspicion of being concerned in stabbing a man—I took him away from the people; he said "It is a mistake, I have been at Spa Road"—this is a memorandum of the conversation: "I have been at Spa Road, I was at home having my supper, when some one came and said some of our people were in a row. I left supper, put on my hat, and</p>

               <p>came out to see what was the matter, and on looking at the man you took me"—during that conversation I was taking him to the station along Union Road and down Lucas Street, where we met Wells and Anderson; Wells said "That is the man"—we took him to the station, where he was charged—while he was there in our charge I heard Cumley say "That is the man"—there were no other Italians there—I knew the prisoner before as an ice cream vendor, but not by name—I did not know his brother—I afterwards saw traced of blood, across the road from the chapel towards the chemist's shop, and found this portion of a hat in Deptford Lower Road, nearly opposite Culling Street; it appeared as if it had been kicked about; the rim was all right, but the crown was out.</p>

I am single, and live at 36, Westlake Road, with my aunt—in October last I was employed as a waitress at the Lilliputian coffee-house in Abbey Road—I have known the prisoner two years; he has been keeping company with me—on Monday night, 17th October, I left the coffee-house about a quarter past 10; that was not my usual time for leaving; I had to stop because my mistress had to go to the other shop to collect her money—I had seen the prisoner at the Lilliputian in the morning; he did not know at what time I was to leave in the evening—he came in about 8 o'clock to have some tea and left about 9 o'clock—I expected to see him again; I thought he would come up to me as he always did—when I left at a quarter past 10 I went up against St. James's Church, and just opposite, by the Crown and Anchor public-house, I met the prisoner—we went into the Crown and Anchor and he had a drink—we came out about 11 o'clock—there was a one-horse tram waiting; he said "Don't go into that one-horse tram; come to the Colleen Bawn and get the two-horse tram"—we walked there; it was about a quarter or 10 minutes to 12 when we got there—we did not go into any place before we got there—we did not go into the Colleen Bawn—policeman was standing at the corner—I don't know him; I can't tell if he is here—the prisoner went over and asked the policeman if that was the last two-horse tram coming up—he said "Stop a moment, here comes one"—it came up—he said "Herer you are, Lizzie; get in, make haste, and come home"—he put me in, and said "Good-night," and left—I got of the tram at the Bricklayers' Arms—I was living at East Lane, Walworth, at that time with my aunt; the Bricklayers' Arms was the nearest point—it took me about 20 minutes to walk from there to my aunt's—I got there about half-past 12.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been waitress at the Lilliputian six weeks up to this time—before that I was living with aunt, not in service—the prisoner had not been to see me at the Lilliputian before the day this occurred; he used to come and see me at my aunt's—he first came to the Lilliputian at 7 o'clock in the morning—I got there about a quarter to 7, and he came in at 7 o'clock to have a cup of coffee—I did not know that he was coming again in the evening—I met him then accidentally by St. James's Church—he told me he had been to Peckham—I knew where he lived—I went with him to the Colleen Bawn; that is about a quarter of a mile from St. James's Church; it was in my</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman M</hi> 96). On Monday, 17th October, I was on duty near the Colleen Bawn, Southwark Park Road—I remember seeing a man near the Colleen Bawn, but not a woman—the man was on the same side of the road as myself—he spoke to me near the corner—he asked if the last tram had gone to the Bricklayers' Arms—I told him it had—I then passed on, and he passed on—I did not see a two-horse tram; there was no tram there at the time; I did not see one afterwards—as near as I can guess it was about 10 minutes to 12—I saw no tram—I turned out of Southwark Park Road altogether at that time—there was a constable stationed at the corner by the Colleen Bawn; he is a fixture there—I have not spoken to him—I believe I have been asked twice by the solicitor's clerk what I knew of this matter—I did not say that just as the man was speaking to me the two-horse tram approached and that I said "Here it comes."</p>

               <p>in cold weather—the prisoner has been living there during the time I was there—he slept in the same room as me—Mrs. Louis Petre is Mr. Romano's daughter—she was married before I went there—they slept in another room, with a baby six months old—Louis Petre resembles the prisoner—on Monday afternoon, 17th October, I went out about half-past 4, with Raphael Imborato—I had a baked-potato barrow—I went to the White Swan, at the corner of Erville Street, Woolwich—I took up a fixed position there to sell my potatoes—I left there shortly before 12 to return to Paradise Street—I wheeled my barrow in the road, and Imborato walked on the pavement about 10 or 12 yards behind me—we went up Deptford Lower Road, and passed the Salvation Army Barracks—we met a tram coming along—I saw Louis Petre outside the tram; I whistled, but he did not take any notice of it—Imborato was still about 10 or 11 yards behind me—Louis got off the tram, walked up to the pave<lb/>ment, and I saw him speak to Imborato—I did not stop; I went straight on to Paradise Street—I met the prisoner Joseph coming round Paradise Street, a few yards from the door of 1882, and not far behind him was Mrs. Louis Petre—the prisoner asked me if I had seen his brother Louis—I told him I thought he was up the road with Imborato—he went in that direction—shortly after Mrs. Louis came by, and asked me if I had seen Joseph—I said he had gone towards the Union Road, and she went after him—I then took my barrow into Romano's yard in the usual way; I had my supper before going to bed—Lanzi was in the house—after I had my supper I noticed Imborato come in with no hat on, rather excited, and I asked Lanzi what was the matter—Mrs. Louis Petre came in after, about the same time—I saw nothing of Louis Petre at that time, nor of Joseph—I never saw Joseph in possession of a weapon like the one produced—I never saw a thing like that in the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Gabriel Romano and the wife of Luigi Petre, the brother of the prisoner—I have been living with my husband and child at my father's house, 82, Paradise Street, and I am living there still—I remember the 17th October—on the morning of that day Joseph went to see his brother at Peckham and returned to the house 82, Paradise Street, about half-past 6, and then he went out again and did not return until late in the evening—I knew he was keeping company with Miss Wade—between 7 and half-past my husband went out with another of his brothers, Antonie Petre, and with my brother Eaphael, and they did not come back till just before 12; I then noticed that my husband had had a little drink—while he was at home a knock came at the side door, and my husband went and let Lanzi in, and when Lanzi came in I thought my Husband was in the yard for a moment—Joseph and Lanzi came in both at the same time—when Joseph came in he asked if his supper was ready; I said "Yes," and took the frying-pan and warmed his supper, and while it was warm<lb/>ing we had a game of cards—when the supper was ready for him I gave it to him, and he was having it when Lanzi came in—it takes a few minutes to put the barrows away when they come home—when Lanzi came in I asked him where Luigi was, and he said he had gone out to meet the other baked potato van; I said "What did you want to let him go out for when he has had a little drink?" I stayed a few minutes, and, being in a worry about him, I went, out to see if I could see him, and Joseph then took the rest of his supper in his hand and came out along with me—a few yards from the door I met Walter Ghuler and</p>

               <p>asked him if he had seen Luigi and Imborato, and he said "Yes, they are coming along"—Joseph was a few steps before me—we both went on, and when we got to the corner opposite the linen draper's I met Imborato and asked him if he had seen Luigi; he said "What, has he not come home?" I said "No, he has come out to meet you;" he said "We had a few words with somebody and I did not see Luigi any more"—we would not believe him, and all three of us' went on—at that time Imborato had no hat on—we all three then went towards the Royal Oak, and when we got there we heard somebody screaming, and we followed the screams—at the Royal Oak we turned towards the Deptford Lower Road—I know the Wesleyan Chapel, we turned down that road—some people near the chapel said "He is stabbed, he is stabbed," and me and Joseph went into the road, and I said "Who is stabbed?" but no answer was returned—I saw no injured person there; I looked to see if my husband was there, but did not see him, and I saw no one running down the road—I and Imborato and Joseph then went up the Culling Road, so as to get into the Union Road again—at the top of the Culling Road a lady asked me what was the matter—I don't remember seeing anybody pass me—I don't remember saying "Oh my God!" I did not use that expression—we talk in Italian to Imborato and we talk English to Joseph Petre—when we got to the top of the road a woman came out of the tobacconist's shop and said "What is the matter?" I said "I don't know," and then I went home—I was walking down Culling Road all the time—I parted with Joseph at the corner of Culling Road, Imborato was then a few steps before me—I saw a woman running up the road screaming, a little farther away than I was; she was going along crying—I did not notice any whistle—a few minutes after I got home I went to the door and' saw my husband coming along the street; he passed into the house and went straight into the, yard—I did not go into the yard with him, I stopped in the doorway of the yard—my husband's lip was then cut and very much swollen; I said nothing to him about it—he never came into the house again—I have never seen him since.</p>

I live at 131, Suffolk Place, Snowsfields—on 2nd November I was with John Minns, and about a quarter to 1 a.m. we came out of the Canterbury, and I knocked up against the prisoner accidentally—a woman named Meakins was with him (<hi rend="italic">See next case</hi>)—before I could beg his pardon he punched me at the back of my neck and knocked me into the gutter—I got up and made a strike at him, but instead of striking him I struck the woman accidentally, and when I turned round I saw Minns and the prisoner both or. the ground struggling in the gutter—I saw them get up—a constable came, and the four of us were taken to the station, and locked up for the night—I did not know at that time that Minns was stabbed.</p>

About 2 o'clock on the morning of 24th October I was on duty in Water Lane, Briton, and I saw the three prisoners at the corner—they crossed Brixton Hill, and spoke to a constable—I spoke to the constable, and followed the prisoners about 300 yards down Brixton Hill—they all three went into the garden of 11, Brixton Hill—I followed them—I saw Hardy come out of the area window; two constables caught hold of him—I and another constable went into the breakfast parlour, and found Ryan and Holdman—they ran out through a passage at the back, and over the garden wall; I followed—on the wall Holdman threw a brick at Ryder, which struck him on the head—eventually we lost sight of the two men at the corner of Water Lane—a plain-clothes man afterwards took Ryan in custody.</p>

Smith tells me that he received the whole of money from you this evening before he went out"—he said "It is a lie; I have not been out this evening"—I said "I shall search the room"—I did so and under the table I found this piece of tissue paper bearing four distinct impres<lb/>sions of half-crowns—I said "Banks, how do you account for this tissue paper? It has had counterfeit coin in it"—he said "You might have put it there yourself; I know nothing about it"—one of the women said "Jack, your friends are going to put you away"—he said "Yes, the same as they have done before"—I got him to dress, took him into the front room, where Maynard, Lyons, and Smith were detained, and said Now, Smith, whatever you have got to say about Banks you had better say in his presence"—he said to Banks "What did you give me this evening when I was in your room?"—he said "Nothing"—Smith said "Don't tell lies; you know you gave me the money; I gave you 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. good money when I came home"—he said "Yes, I was going to pay the rent of the two rooms with that, to-morrow"—I told them they would all be charged with the possession of the coin found—Banks said "You found nothing on me"—Lyons said "We were all together, and Smith gave me the half-crowns—I found on Banks 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in good money, and on Smith 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Banks said "You found nothing on me, and you have no evidence"—Mrs. Adams was present the whole time; she said "That money belongs to me for the two rooms.
