I am single and live with my mother, Frances Marshall, at 176, Central Street, St Luke's—on the morning of 23rd October, about 4 o'clock, I was awoke by hearing a noise in the area, the slight shaking of the window; it was dark, there is a gas lamp a little way off, I immediately got up and opened the window, which looks into the area, and saw a man getting out over the railings, I saw his face, the prisoner is the man—I called out "Police!"—he walked away as quick as he could, a policeman came up and I sent him after him—about half an hour afterwards I went to the station and there saw the prisoner, I picked him out</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The window is the kitchen window in the area—there was no catch to it—it was not a windy boisterous night; it was the upper sash that was moved, I don't think it could have fallen down by its own weight; the lower sash could not have been moved so easily, the glass is so close to the wood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of 176, Commercial Road—I was sent for and found the deceased lying dead in the bed—she had a wound on the right upper lip and there was blood from that on her face and neck, and on the bedclothes—I made a post-mortem examination—there were two bruises in the centre of the forehead close together, one on the chin and one in the centre of the upper lip, the bruises were each larger than a shilling—they would probably be caused by a fist, or a fall—they were not serious, I believe they were recent—the cut was a lacerated cut, not a clean cut, cutting through the lip to the extent of half an inch outside and inside, running to a point to the extent of an inch and a quarter—that might have been caused by a blow from a fist—on opening the head there was congestion of the membranes of the upper part of the brain generally, and a large clot of blood at the base of the brain—she was not in a healthy state, many of the organs were diseased—I believe they were not sufficiently diseased to cause death independently of the blow—in my opinion the cause of death was extravasation of blood at the base of the brain, caused by violence—I believe a blow from the fist would be sufficient to cause it—there was nothing else to account for death.</p>

Morris; if you put Emile and A. Morris, I dare say that will do"—Ming said "Had not we better each of us sign a portion of it?" and he mentioned the letters, but I cannot swear to them; Horton said "No, that might be detected"—Horton then said to me "Have you got any money?"—I said "No"—Horton then gave the cheque to Ming, who crossed the road and went into a stationer's shop—he came out in three or four minutes, came across to us with the cheque open in his hand and gave it to Horton; it was then endorsed "Emile and A, Morris"—Horton then took it back to the baker's shop and came back without it—he said nothing to ma except "We will go and have a drink"—we did so, and they very soon left me, and I went to the baker's shop, Mr. Reichter's; and there saw this cheque—from there I went to Miss Morris's school, and then went with Mrs. Reichter to the police-station—I saw a report of this case at Guildhall and communica ed with Serjeant Spittle.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 27, Red Lion Square, and have for a great many years made handwriting a study—I have a great many times given evidence in various Courts—in my judgment this pencil writing, "I O U Mr. Donald 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Charles Hunt," and the cheque of 15th October in favour of Miss Morris, signed Walter Hutchinson, are in the same handwriting—the "f" in "five" and the "p" in "pounds" correspond in each—looking at this</p>

               <p>agreement proved to be Ming's writing, this warrant endorsed "Ming and Co.," this wharfinger's note endorsed "Thomas Ming and Co.," and these other documents, are all in Ming's writing, except one, which is Horton's, but the signature to that is Ming's—the signature on the back of this warrant and the signature to this agreement are in the same writing, and I have no doubt that the cheque payable to Miss Morris and the I 0 U are also in Ming's writing—also the cheque of 18th April signed Walter Hammond—I cannot give an opinion upon the cheque found on Horton in favour of Miss Morris—I have carefully examined this bill of exchange, the signature of the drawer, "Whatley, Rimmer, and Co.," and the endorsement; they are all Ming's writing, but I cannot prove the acceptance; I doubt it being Horton's writing, and I believe it is Ming's—I find more of Horton's writing on the bill—I have seen the letter which Mr. Powell saw him write, and have com<lb/>pared it carefully with that view.</p>

Juries sometimes follow my lead, and sometimes they do not—I find it far more difficult to speak to pencil writing—when writing is disguised it is more difficult to detect, and it requires more attention on my part—it is much more difficult to speak to mercantile free hands until you come to study them, and then the more you study them the more similarity you find; I should be perhaps three months comparing 100 of them, and I might make a mistake in some of them or I might not—I began to study these papers last night at 6 o'clock, and was studying them for an hour and three-quarters—I studied them again this morning—I knew that the prisoners were in custody, and that the bill I was seeking to father upon one of them was the one in the indictment—I do not care whether I know the charge or not—I have said that I prefer not to know from which side my instructions come.</p>

Harvest's, it was not likely that he should remember their signature for so long a time; he denied telling West that he expected some money by Donald, and stated that the cheques found at his lodging did not belong to him, that he believed the cheque to be genuine which, he cashed at Messrs. Reichter's, that he gave his real name to Mr. Fortescue, who knew him to be the manager of the dining hall, and could easily find him not 100 yards off, that he went to Leeds to buy an estate, negotiations for which were still going on, and that he had acted innocently throughout</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 51, Alma Road, Bermondsey, and am a shipping clerk—at about 8 p.m. on October 30th I was accosted by one of the prisoners in Fenchurch Street, and then the other instantly after—one of them said "Where are you going, my dear?" and the other said "Are you going to treat us?" I shoved them away, and after walking about half-a-dozen yards I missed my watch—I caught Hanley and I asked a constable to arrest Williams, who was 20 or 30 yards in advance, and I saw her hand my watch to him—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it has a steel chain—I picked up my purse at the station, and handed it to the constable—it had fallen where they were standing—I do not know which of them took it</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 706, Old Ford Road—on the evening of 21ST September I, my brother Henry, and a man named Hooper went to the prisoner's house—his wife came to the public-house where we were, and asked me to go there—the prisoner said "Arthur, will you listen to reason?"—I said "Yes," and while I was talking to him he asked me to go inside—I did not want to go inside, and he said "We don't want a row out<lb/>side," and shoved me away from the door—his wife said "Bill, that is what you want," and handed him a knife—I told him he ought to be ashamed of himself to hit an old man like my father, and give him a black eye—when he shoved me from the door he stabbed me—we did not have any struggle—I became insensible—I had four stabs on my side, back, shoulder, and thigh, and two more that were only like scratches—I went home—the doctor saw me—I was taken to the London Hospital, and was there a month.</p>

My father and the prisoner had some words early that day; I sent a message that I intended to punish him unless he apologised—I only had one glass of ale at the public-house—the prisoner's wife told me he wanted to see me—I did listen to reason, but the prisoner shoved me from the door while I was talking with him—the conversation took place in the front garden about 7.45—no scuffle took place, only when prisoner got hold of me and shoved me away from the door—I did not see the knife, but my brother did—I was sober.</p>

On the faith of that letter I employed the prisoner as butler—he stated he was a Catholic, and for further protection I wrote to the Catholic priest at Newport, and on receiving his reply I said to the. prisoner "I find you are unknown to the pastor of your church where you represent to have been for four years, which in a small mission of that description is incredible, and I also find</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 3, Staple Inn—I made advances to Bell from time to time on bills of sale, upon which money was due to me on 13th August, and I agreed on that day to make a new bill of sale—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it includes all former bills of sale; it amalgamates two loans in one—Frederick Boyd came with him on. 13th August—Bell said</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187811180042"/>
               <p>that he had no debts, and that his rent was paid up to 25th March—this bill of sale was to be paid off at the end of September, but it was not, and I gave instructions to put in possession at both places—the men remained in possession till October 5th, when I consented to their being withdrawn in consequence of what my solicitor said—I would not have advanced the money but for Bell's representations—I was not present at any interview with Craven.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DAY</hi>. I was served with a notice of bankruptcy on the Monday, and went to my solicitor and then to Bow Street—I took out a summons against Bell for fraud, and against Bell and Craven for conspiracy—I went to the Bankruptcy Court several days after, and filed three affidavits—I wanted to prevent Craven being made trustee—affidavits were made on the other side, I believe, and after hearing the whole matter the Court decided that Mr. Craven should remain trustee, and I believe he is trustee to this day—I opposed one or two proofs; all my objections were overruled, and I have been ordered to pay the costs—I sent in a proof in bankruptcy; I do not know whether it has been allowed or not; I think it was withdrawn—I gave a proxy to Mr. Collins, Mr. Smith's clerk, before the meeting of creditors—I did not attend myself, I placed the matter in my solicitors hands, Mr. Smith—I see him every day) he is the person I trust to—he is not my family solicitor; he has done matters for me—Mr. F. Boyd is an auctioneer in Milman Street; he Was formerly in Essex Street—I have employed him to sell people up under bills of sale—I do not always take possession and sell—he has some business for me now—I have not lost my confidence in him—I have taken measures to get him here, but have not seen him this morning—these representations were made in his presence, and I think his brother was there on one occasion; I believe he is here—I believe they are partners—the first representations which induced me to lend the money were made on 11th January and on other occasions, always in the presence of one of the Boys—August 31ST was the last time he represented that he owed nothing, and I believed him—I knew him before January, and had discounted bills of exchange for him, but not, I think, promissory notes—this promissory note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of his—I advanced money on promissory notes to him and to my friend Boyd—the first dealing was on 11th January, when I let him have 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., taking 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for interest for three months, and the bill of sale was for 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the next advance was 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on February 11th, taking 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for interest—that was payable in two months, so that he got 175<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on a liability of 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the January bill came due, I think, on 10th April—he did not pay me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for discount, nor did I get 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the next transaction—the next transaction was not in March—I have not got my books here—they were asked for at Bow Street; I do not know about over and over again—they were not produced; I have not seen a notice to produce them—I renewed the bills of sale on April 10 for a month, as far as I remember—I do not think I got 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on March 8—I believe the bills are here—I cannot state what I received at certain times—I could give an account if I had my books—I have not received altogether in costs and interest 309<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., nor anything like it; I should not say it was very much over 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I received; it is certainly not over 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that I swear—I gave my books into Mr. Collins's hands, the proxy; I cannot say the date—he had them this morning; I thought you asked the date I gave</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187811180043"/>
               <p>the proxy—I had not those two books under my arm in Court this morning, or within 100 yards—I gave them to Mr. Collins in my office; I simply handed them over to him—I do not know that he is keeping them out of Court—we did not come here together, he started before I did, and I suppose he took them with him—I suppose they are here—I have not got them—I can see Mr. Collins now; I do not know whether he is sitting on them—I swear that I have not received 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Bell—I cannot remember exactly what I received—I said at Bow Street "I cannot reckon it up in my head in a moment"—I believe I have not received 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not think I got 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on April 10, or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on May 8, or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on June 14—I may have received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 24th June, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on July 19—I do not remember 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on July 29, or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on August 13—I nave received several ten pounds, but I do not remember 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at all—I received this I O U (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and I had 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that—I have not received the whole of it; it is cancelled; the signature is torn off; I received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it and gave up the I O U for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I swear I did not receive 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—I got 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. some time in September, I dare say it was September 9, but not 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on October 5, received for me by Collins—he has certainly not paid it over—I had received nothing like 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Bell on 13th August to my knowledge—I took several fresh bills of sale to avoid registration—Boyd assisted me in most of these transactions—Collins has not interposed—the costs that were paid went into my pocket—I went with Collins and called on Bell on 31ST August, the day that the man was put in—I mean to tell the Jury that I took possession either on 31ST August or 1ST September, I believe it was 31ST August—I do not remember Bell asking me to let it rest till September 3, to give him a day or two to turn round; that did not take place—Collins was with me and the man who was to be left there—I did not get 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a day or two after August 31 to induce me to take the man out—I do not remember stipulating for 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe an agree<lb/>ment was written for 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month to be paid to me for 12 months—I believe Mr. Smith has it—he is here—I believe the first 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be paid at the end of a month from September, but instead of getting 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the end of the first month, October, I had 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the beginning of September; but there was another arrangement that I was to receive 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the men were to be taken out of possession—I do not know what is in the agreement; Mr. Smith negotiated it, and I told him to do the best he could for me—I could have sold Bell up before if I had wished—I have taken the word of a great many clients—I do not practise upon them—I thought Bell was solvent—he told me his profits were very large, and he could not carry out his orders without money—he said so on numbers of occasions, both in Boyd's presence and to me alone—I am a solicitor, that is not a cloak for money lending—I sometimes take a statutory declaration, but, not generally—I did not take one here—I believe I have not got one word in writing about Bell's position—the bill of sale is for 327<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the agreement for 12 times 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not carried out, and the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. came out of the 327<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid off the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, and then there was nothing more to pay for three months—if the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid off the man was to be withdrawn from Mr. Bell's private house; that would leave 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but the agreement was not carried out, because Mr. Bell did not get the guarantee—I believe the men were in possession at Hammersmith and Margaret Street from August till 5th October—Clayton and Bell are respect<lb/>able</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187811180044"/>
               <p>people—I believe my solicitor applied to them to undertake not to distrain—I do not know whether they did so—I believe I was in possession at that time—I believed Bell to be solvent with a man in possession, both at his private and his business house—I have not requested Mr. Boyd to say that 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would relieve Mr. Bell from his difficulties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi>. I won't swear I advanced Bell more than 265<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but afterwards it was taken to be 327<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was not to pay me 432<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by 12 instalments, and pay me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nothing like that—I believe an agreement was made, but it was not carried out—it was proposed that I was to have 12 monthly instalments of 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the first of which was to be paid a month afterwards; that would be September 7th—I had 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which was paid to Mr. Collins about 9th September—the proposed 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been, spoken of at that time—I believe that was to be paid off the debt on con<lb/>dition that the man at Hammersmith was withdrawn—I have heard so since—I know nothing of an arrangement that the man was to be taken out, and was not to return for a month—I cannot say whether he was out for throe or four days and put in again—early in September I heard that Bell was largely indebted to his landlords for rent; Mr. Smith said about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as far as I recollect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I put the whole of these matters into Mr. Smith's hands, who managed them by his managing clerk—the proposition about his having 12 months to pay it off fell through entirely, as he could not get a guarantee—he paid 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get the man out at Hammersmith—I also heard that he performed his promise by paying the additional 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that the man was put back in possession—Boyd was called as a witness for the defence at Bow Street—I sought to prove for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the bankruptcy, but I believe the proof was afterwards withdrawn—I opposed certain proofs at the Bankruptcy Court; it was decided against me, and the matter is now under appeal—the money became due on 30th August, and on the 31ST I ordered a man by this authority (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be put in possession—I received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the <hi rend="largeCaps">IOU</hi> for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the other 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was added to the security—I did not receive the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money—the representation in the bill of sale is "that all sums for rent and taxes at Hammersmith and Moorgate Street up to 25th March have been fully paid and discharged;" that turns out to be untrue.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of Mitre Court—I am Mr. Day's solicitor—on 31ST August he consulted me respecting a bill of sale—I advised it to be registered, and then placed it in Mr. Collins's hands to carry the matter through—he had the entire conduct of the matter so far as to putting the men in possession—I was present in my office on 4th October with Mr. Collins when Craven came—he presented this card: "Mr. Bell, introduced by Mr. Craven"—I had not known Craven before that—Craven came in, and an interview took place between him and Collins—Craven said "It is very inconvenient to have men in possession, and I have called for the purpose of seeing whether some arrangement cannot be made to withdraw them—I said "I have recently heard that rent to the tune of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is due for the premises at Margaret Street"—he said "It is so; you will get nothing, for the landlords claim their right of distress"—Mr. Collins said "Do you know that Mr. Bell is perfectly solvent?"—he said "I have acted for Bell's brother's firm for a number of years, and I have examined his (Bell's) books, and believe him to be solvent"—Mr. Collins said "Will you give me a letter, stating that in your belief he is solvent?"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187811180045"/>
               <p>—Craven said, "As a professional man I cannot give that letter, but I will supply you with a balance-sheet"—Mr. Collins then left the room, and Craven said to me, "You know you won't get anything if the landlords force their powers of distress"—I said "I am not so sure about that"—we then had some general conversation as to Bell's solvency—Mr. Collins, returned, and I said to Craven, "Is there any process of law, or any judgments and executions, or County Court proceedings, or any demands in Bankruptcy? or is there any fear of the man filing his petition for liquidation?"—he said "No, there is not"—those were each distinct questions—Mr. Collins then drafted a letter, and I went to his desk, looked over it, and suggested some alterations—the landlords had to sign that letter—Craven then left, and arranged to come back at 5 o'clock, to bring the letter and a cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to cover the expenses of the men in possession, but he did not come until 11 o'clock on Saturday, when he said in Mr. Collin's presence "I have come to see you; I have not got the letter signed, as Mr. Clayton is out of town"—it was then arranged that if Mr. Bell, the brother, would sign the letter and undertake to get his partner to sign it on his return, I would take that as sufficient—Mr. Collins asked him again as to Bell's solvency—he replied that he was perfectly solvent, and if we adopted that course we could reap the benefit of our security and get our money—Craven then left—I was not present when he came back.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been Mr. Smith's managing clerk since June—I heard of Mr. Day coming about a bill of sale; I did not see him then, but Mr. Smith put the matter into my hands—I was instructed that a man should be put into possession of both houses on 31ST August, I think, and I took possession that day, Saturday—Mr. Bell called on Monday, September 2nd, and saw me—I proposed that some arrangement should be made to prevent the constant renewals—he said that he had been paying 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. every 20 days to renew the bill of sale—I said that no man could afford that—he said it was very awkward having a man in his private house, he did not mind having one in his other place, because he could give him some work to do—I suggested that he should enter into arrangements to pay the 327<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then due at 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month, in lieu of the amount to go to the extinguishing of the debt—that included the addition for interest, because the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for 20 days did not go off the amount, it left the debt still existing—he was to give me a guarantee from his brother and two responsible householders—412<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the aggregate he was to pay back, and he asked me to put the terms into writing; to write a letter to him embodying those terms—this is the draft of it (<hi rend="italic">This was dated September 2nd, offering that Mr. Day would withdraw the man in possession upon payment of all expenses incurred, two good securities being found, and an agreement made to pay</hi> 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a month for</hi> 12 <hi rend="italic">months to liquidate the debt and interest</hi>.) Bell said that he could find sureties, and he wrote to me to send him a form of the guarantee I should require the sureties to sign—I sent him a copy of a draft guarantee (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said that his brother, Alfred Bell, would be one guarantee, and he could get two others—I saw him on the 4th or 5th—he said that he could not get the guarantee signed, as his friends were out of town, and he proposed to have the original agreement signed for 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—I had already prepared that; I filled in the dates and he examined it, undertaking to get the guarantee signed—I said that I would get Mr. Day to execute it and would immediately withdraw the men—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187811180047"/>
               <p>then said "Supposing I cannot get the guarantee signed, what will yon take in money to let the man leave my private house?"—that was after September 7th—I said "From what I can see of the contents of your private house I should think 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be its value; if you will bring me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will advise Mr. Day to withdraw from your private house, execute the agreement, and give you a receipt for the first three monthly instalments"—he said that he would do it, and made an appointment to call next day and bring the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but he did not come—he called one day soon afterwards, he had to pay me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for costs, and took out a large quantity of notes; I said "You are going to pay me the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Mr. Bell"—he said "No, I have other things which are pressing me which I must pay; if I give you some on account and make it up during the week, will you take the man out of possession?"—I said "Yes, if you give me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and undertake to make it 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before the week is out"—he said "I cannot part with 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., will you take 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—he paid me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I gave him an order to the man in possession to withdraw from the private house, he undertaking to make it 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before the week was out—I gave him this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced, dated 9th September</hi>) for the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he called afterwards but did not pay the 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he said that he had not received it from the country—he repeatedly telegraphed to me—on 14th September I wrote to him: "Dear Sir,—I am sorry that you broke faith to-day, and fully expect you will be with me on Monday by 1 o'clock;" I then got this telegram: "Am detained by important business, but will'be with you on Monday by 1 o'clock"—I wrote on the 21ST: "Telegram received; unless appointment is kept on Monday I must resume possession"—he did not come and pay me the 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and therefore the agreement for paying off the money by 12 monthly instalments was not executed by Bell—he did not bring the guarantee and never paid the balance of the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">The draft of the agreement was here put in, which stated that the debt was</hi> 327<hi rend="italic">l., which, with</hi> 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">for interest, made</hi> 432<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.) The guarantee was never signed, and I did not lay it before our client, but we were in possession of both places at that time—if I had taken the men out without a guarantee we should have had no security at all—the man had never been out of the business premises; but I replaced the man in the private house on, I think, 27th September; but before that I went to Bell's house and told him if he did not pay the money I must put the man in possession, because Mr. Day did not know he was out—he begged me to give him another day, and I did so; I did not care whether he brought me the guarantee or the money—I saw him at my office on, I think, 30th September, and I think, Mr. Boyd was with him—he said that has till hoped to be able to bring me the money—he said that he owed 12 months' rent at Margaret Street—I said that he had always represented that the rent was paid up in full; he said that it was his brother who was his creditor, and he would never trouble him and was coming forward to assist him to pay off the money—en 3rd October I got this letter: "Dear Sir,—Matters stand as they were till to-morrow, so it will be useless for me to trouble you with a visit to-day"—I do not think I saw him after that letter for a considerable time—on 4th October Craven called—I had never seen him before—I think Mr. Smith said, "What do you call about?" he said, "From Mr. Bell;" Mr. Smith said, "Mr. Collins will attend to it"—Craven handed in a card and said, "I want to make some arrangement with regard to your man in possession," or "bill of sale"—I think Mr. Smith said, "What arrangement do you want to make?"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187811180048"/>
               <p>Craven said, "I want you to give me an order. to remove two glass windows from Margaret Street, as the man declines to let them go without an order signed by you;" I consulted Mr. Smith by a look, and declined to allow the windows to be removed-Craven asked me why, I said that it was only on the 30th we found out that there was a large amount of rent in arrear—Craven said, "That makes little difference, as my brother is the landlord and he would never put in a distress"—I said, "Very likely not against his brother but as against an outside man he would;" he said, "You might safely withdraw from possession of the furniture and stock in trade I have been through Bell's books, I find he is perfectly solvent, he has book debts and orders in hand to the extent of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Mr. Smith said "Is there any County court judgment against Bell, writs or Bankruptcy proceed<lb/>ings?"—he said that there was nothing at all against him, and that Bell's brother would pay the cost of the men in possession if they would with<lb/>draw—I or Smith said, "Oh, we can't withdraw except we have some guarantee that the landlord does not distrain"—he said there would be no difficulty in getting a letter to that effect, and asked me to draft one; I did so and handed it to Craven—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he took it away with him to get it signed and get a cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and we agreed then to withdraw the men—he never brought the letter signed or the cheque, but he called next morning, Saturday, and said, "I was unable to get that letter signed by Clayton and Bell, as Mr. Clayton was out of town, consequently Mr. Bell could not bind his partner—I said that if Mr. Bell would sign it I would accept a letter from him undertaking that his partner should sign it on his return, and said, "May I rely upon your statement"—that was as to Bell's solvency—he said, "I would not have made the statement had I not made myself aware of the fact I have acted for the family a great number of years, and I have investigated Bell's books, you may take my word:" he then left-at one of the interviews he said, "I will let you have a balance-sheet"—he never gave me the slightest intimation that he was concerned in pre<lb/>paring for Bell's liquidation on his own petition—he returned at 2 o'clock on the Saturday, and brought me this letter written on paper from Regent Street, signed by Clayton and by Bell, in which the two last lines are differ<lb/>ent from the draft I supplied him with—he also brought a cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>-before I took the cheque I said, "Am I to rely on Bell's solvency? You know the position my client will be in if any procedings in Bankruptcy or liquidation are taken," or words to that effect—he said, "You may rely upon it there is nothing of the kind, he cannot file a liquidation petition, he owes nothing"—upon that I signed two letters directed to Emerson and Pocock the men in possession, to give up possession—I would not have given those letters if I not received the assurance from Craven that Bell was perfectly solvent-that was Saturday, and on Monday morning Mr. Day went out of town, and did not return till 5 o'clock, and then he found at his office a notice restraining him from enforcing the bill of sale, and likewise a notice from the Bankruptcy Coupon the Tuesday morning I searched at the Bankruptcy Court and found the petition had been filed at 11 o'clock on Monday morning and that John Berkeley Craven was appointed receiver and manager, and that the debts were 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

From C. C. Smith, Emigration and Shipping Agency, 23, Leadenhall Street, London. Passages booked to all parts of the world. The writer has a connection and can be seen any day at 10.30.")—I spoke to Smith with reference to that memoran<lb/>dum, and he told me he had a business and was a shipping agent for the Queensland Emigration Commissioners, and sometimes sent out wines to the Colonies; sometimes in wood and sometimes in cases—he said he would call at my place, which he did a few days afterwards, and tasted some samples of claret—I afterwards received this memorandum of 17th January, "Can you guarantee it to keep on a long voyage?" and he subsequently ordered five has. of claret—I forwarded the order to my principals, and wrote to Smith on 19th January for a reference, and in reply, on 21ST January I received this letter: "Queensland Emigration Agency, 23, Leaden<lb/>hall Street, London, C. C. Smith. Dear Sir,—In reply to your favour of 19th, I have much pleasure in referring you to Mr. F. Smith, 144, Gresham Street, which, although the same name, is only a business reference," &amp;c.—I accordingly went to that address and saw a person who called himself Frederick Smith—I said I had been referred to him by C.

This was the office of the Massicot Cement Company, of which he was shipping agent—I was satisfied and executed the order—C.

Smith—he spoke about some samples of brandy, and I asked him what kind of brandy, and what price he would require—he said, "The best you have at the lowest price you have"—I sent him samples and called on him again, when I saw the prisoner Hardinge—I asked if they had tasted the samples of brandy, and Davis said "Yes, but I prefer the one at 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he gave me an order, which I took down in my pocket-book, for eight quarter<lb/>casks of brandy—it was to be marked D and a diamond—when I got back I found an order which Davis said he had sent, and which was for 16 quarter-casks—I called again and saw Davis, and he then altered the order to eight quarter-casks—these letters are in Davis's handwriting—I asked the mode of payment, and he said a three months' bill—I forwarded the order to my principals—before I received the bill of lading I wrote to Davis and Co. for a reference, and received this letter in reply, in Davis's writing, dated April 6th, 1878, marked T.: "109, Fenchurch Street. Messrs. Gabriel and Co. Gentlemen,—In reply to yours of to-day, we beg to refer you to Herbert, Thomas, and Co., Water Lane, Eastcheap," &amp;c.—I went there and saw some one, and inquired for one of the principals, and said I had been referred by Davis and Co.—he said he had known Davis for several years as a most respectable man—I asked him if I should</p>

C. Smith, and also the reference to Herbert, Thomas, and Co. and I believe the bills to be reliable documents—Davis on one occasion said he believed Hardinge to be a rogue.</p>

I cannot give you the exact date when I first saw Hardinge—I think it was about 25th or 26th March, and again two or three days afterwards at the same office, sitting at the table writing opposite Davis—it was about a fortnight or three weeks after that that Davis told me Hardinge was a rogue, when he was accepting the bill in my office, which was afterwards not paid.</p>
               <p>By the <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. The transfer of the eight quarter casks of brandy was effected after I had given up the bill of lading, but not before I had given up the goods.</p>

Those were sample brushes—enclosed was this order for brushes amounting to 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went to F. Smith's, and was told he was away, and I applied for a further reference, and Smith sent me the same of Hardinge, 109, Fenchurch Street—I went there and Hardinge said he had had dealings with Smith, and thought I was perfectly justified in giving him credit to about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he had always found Smith quite correct—I was satisfied and executed the order, and they were delivered, packed in one case, to the carman Maybery at my office—on June 24th I received a further order from him for brushes, and on 10th July, I received this order for samples (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the samples were sent to the amount of 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 13th July I received this further order for samples—they were never sent—I also received this memorandum of 24th June, asking me the price of the best brown Windsor soap—that I did not supply—when the second order was supplied the first had not been paid for—I have applied several times for payment and have got nothing—on 28th October I went to Mr. Attenborough, in the Minories, and there saw the cases of brushes that I supplied to Smith—I have also been to Messrs. Barker, pawnbrokers, of Houndsditch, and there seen the sample brushes supplied on 10th July—about the 17th October I had a visit from Hardinge, who said he had seen this case in the papers, and was very much annoyed, as it would do him a great deal of harm, having his name mixed up in the matter, and he begged of me not to mention his name as having been a reference for Smith—I said I did not wish to take any action in the case at all—he said there was a bill for 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. owing to him by Smith, and I told him what I had lost and that I considered the money gone, and was not going to do anything more—I parted with the brushes to Smith on account of the reference I had to Hardinge.</p>

W. 1 to 4—he wanted them in by 10th August—I think they were in town by the 7th—this is the invoice, it is dated 7th August, which would be the time they left Glasgow—Smith said they arrived too late for a certain ship he wanted them to go out in, and in consequence he had lost the ship<lb/>ment by that vessel—this is the letter I received from my principals in Glasgow: "Dear Sir,—I have only to-day received your advice saying I have lost the ship, causing me delay and loss," dated 12th August, 1878—I told Smith my mode would be 5 per cent, and an extra 1¼ if he paid in a month, and being the first order I should require payment—about the beginning of September I applied for payment, and he said he should want a little more time as the goods had lost the ship—I said, "Very well, Mr. Smith, I will give you the time, shall we appoint a day?" he said, "Yes, if you like we will say 20th September for payment"—I was ill on the 20th, but I applied to him on the following Monday, at his office, for payment—he said he had been disappointed of some payments he was to receive, and could not settle—I applied two or three times afterwards, but did not get payment—on 2nd October I received this memo<lb/>randum marked A. R. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "To Edward Cherer, from C. C. Smith. Dear Sir,—Mr. Smith would feel greatly obliged if you will draw on him for the amount of account at one month,"etc. "Yours truly, Scott") I did not do so—I afterwards received this post-card—I think it is dated 2nd September: "I presume you fully understand I require a duplicate shipment of tumblers at once"—he had said nothing about a duplicate shipment, and I did not execute the order, the others not having been paid for—I supplied the goods, as he was introduced by my friend, whom I had known for about 12 years, and Smith made it appear that he had been appointed Queensland Emigration agent entirely to this country, for that country, and upon that I let him have a small quantity of goods.</p>

On Sunday, 27th October, I was on duty at Mabledon Place, Euston Read, at 1.10 a.m.—I heard a man groan<lb/>ing and a cry of "Police" and "Thief"—I saw a man lying on the ground and two persons leaving him, they ran very fast, and when I was 20 yards from the spot, I saw the prisoner strike the man on the side of his head, he was 15 yards behind the other two and was the last to leave—he ran in the same direction—I kept him in sight for 400 yards, and caught hold of him in Dicker's Road—he was very flurried and out of breath, and his shirt front was torn—I said to him "I shall take you in custody for robbing a man in Mabledon Place"—he said "You have made a mistake, I have only 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. search me if you like"—Mr. White came to the station and complained of being robbed—I put the prisoner with nine or ten others, some of whom were in custody, and others volunteered, and White said in a moment, "That is the <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> that struck me"—the prisoner said he knew nothing of it</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. He said again at the station, "You have made a mistake," and again at the police-court—that has been his defence from the beginning—<hi rend="italic">E</hi> 69 was about four yards behind me—I laid hold of the prisoner first—White had had a good deal to drink; I should consider him drunk, but he was not incapable—when the prisoner said that he had only a shilling he held it up to me—I searched him and found no more—I will swear there were nine persons put with him—he was remanded till the following Saturday, and admitted to bail—I did not see White at Bow Street on the Monday, I saw him on the Tuesday—he did not tell me that the man he saw get out of the police van was not the person, but he told the Magistrate so.</p>

There were about six policemen in the charge room<lb/>White had been drinking, but he knew perfectly well what he was about—he was nearer drunkenness than sober—he might have managed to get home—I saw him outside the police-court on the Monday before the case came on—he was told to come at 10 o'clock—the prisoner was not brought from the House of Detention—he was detained at the station, and had not then been before the Magistrate—I did not hear White say anything about him, he only said that he felt very ill and could hardly breathe, and he did not give his evidence—we two constables gave our evidence—I was examined again on the Saturday—the prisoner ran 40 yards up Crescent Mews, and then turned into Draper's Place, that is a sharp turn, but wide enough for me to see round it, and when I came up he was in Buttell's hands.</p>

               <p>Essex Road—the back of that house adjoins the back of 14, Quadrant Road—when I went to bed at 11.15 on 2nd October, the place was properly shut up, the windows fastened and the doors bolted—I came down at 7.30 and found the kitchen window open wide enough for a man to get through—I missed a pair of boots from the scullery, belonging to my master—these are them—the boots had a tree in them, and I found that tree next morning in the garden—the scullery door had been forced open—they had got in at the scullery window.</p>

I was on duty at 10.30 on the night of 2nd October in Marquess Road, Canonbury, and saw the three prisoners there together—they went through Clephane Road into the Essex Road, and turned into Elmore Street, where I lost sight of them—between 1 and 2 in the morning I was in Canonbury Street, and heard cries of "Police!" coming from the Quadrant Road—I went there immediately and opposite No. 14 I saw Foster lying on his back in the road, bleeding from the head—two constables had got there before me—Gentry was staggering on the footway bleeding from the head—I took him to a surgeon's—about 5 o'clock next morning I made a search on the spot, and found this pair of boots in the garden of 14, Quadrant Road under a bush, and in front of the house in the road I found this piece of steel where Foster had been lying, it is used for the purpose of slipping back the catches of windows.</p>

I live at 24, Elmore Street, Islington, which is about a quarter of a mile from the Marquess Tavern—on the night of the 2nd October, about 11 o'clock, I was passing the church of St John the Baptist, at the corner of Elmore Road and Clephane Road, I heard a noise and looked round and saw a man get over the gate from the church porch and another man waiting close by—I saw a third man waiting at the corner of the street under a lamp; that was Amber—I cannot swear to the other two, but to the best of my belief they were Foster and Ross.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Foster's Defence</hi>. I should like to explain how I came into possession of these tools. About 12.30 I was at the Angel public-house, and met two men, a description of whom I gave to the inspector. They asked if I was out of work. I said "Yes." They said "We will put a job in your way; carry these down to the Essex Road, where there is a seat Be there at 2.30, and if we are not there place them behind the wall and we shall find them" I went, and finding they were not there, I walked along Quadrant Road and met Gentry. He said "What are you doing here?" I said "I have to meet two men. He said "You look cold." I said "Yes, where is there a coffee-stall?" He struck me on the head, and broke his truncheon over my head with a second blow. I said "You cowardly rascal, to hit a man like that behind his back," and I hit him with my fist The jemmy was in my pocket. Another constable came up and knocked me about, and I was</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Messrs. Colls and Sons, builders—they employ about 1,000 men, and are engaged on some buildings in Great Eastern Street, Shoreditch—I employed the prisoner about June—he is fairly skilled in making staircases—his wages were 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per hour-<lb/>the piece-work arrangement was for him to have, I think, 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for preparing and fixing stairs—the materials were Colls's—he worked on our pr mises, and had men under him—he engaged workmen subject to the general fore<lb/>man's supervision—that arrangement was put an end to by his overdrawing—the arrangement was then for him to go on day-work, and finish them as cheaply as he could—he was to draw 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an hour for himself, and whatever he paid the men we would pay him—the foreman had said to him, "You have made a pretty mess of this; you have considerably overdrawn; how<lb/>ever, you can go on day-work if you like"—he said, "I hope you will let me pay the men as usual, because I think I can get the work done cheaper"—I said "Yes"—it was early in September when piece-work was changed to day-work, and from that time it was usual for Jemmett and Taylor them<lb/>selves to make the return on the time-sheet, and for Hickey to make his return on his time-sheet—Mr. Devonport vouches the time-sheet at the yard, and Mr. Tripp at Great Eastern Street—Mr. Tripp is foreman at the job; his duty is to write his name on the time-sheet and and return it to our offices—that goes to the principal office at Camberwell, where the pay-sheets are made out in conformity with the time-sheets made out by Tripp, and then I send cash down to pay—from September Jemmett, Taylor, and Hickey were paid four weeks at Great Eastern Street and one at the yard, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>—I know Hickey's writing—I did not know that he was putting in the figure 9 on Jemmett and Taylor's time-sheet—T. 1 is Taylor's time-sheet and J. 1 is Jemmett's—C. H. 1 is the pay-sheet for the week ending 4th October,</p>

               <p>to which these time-sheets refer—T. 1 shows 49 hours at 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I find on the pay-sheet Taylor's name for 49 hours and Jemmett's time 47 hours at 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; he was paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on two occasions at the yard—T. 2 is Taylor's time-sheet for the week ending 11th October, and J. 2 is Jemmett's—C. H. 2 is the pay-sheet for that week; Taylor is there carried out 47 hours at 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per hour; that exactly accords with the time in the rate-book—Jemmett is down in the pay-sheet for 52 1/2 hours at 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2., exactly as repre<lb/>sented on the sheet—T. 3 is Taylor's time-sheet and J. 3 is Jemmett's for 18th October, and C.

"—he said, "Good God, Mr. Hamilton, you would never do that! "—I said, "I shall, indeed, and there is the man in blue "—I had a policeman waiting—I asked Jemmett and Taylor in Hickey's presence what he was paying them—they both said 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an hour—I showed Taylor Hickey's bill for 29th October, and said "Is that figure 8 on Tuesday your writing? "—he said that it was not, and that he had only charged 3 1/2 hours—Jemmett said that he had only charged 4 hours—Hickey said that he would take the responsibility from the men—he had no authority to charge a higher rate than he actually paid, and the printed table with the rate on it distinctly shows that he knew he had no right to put his figures on Jemmett's or Taylor's paper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I have known him since June, when he came to ask for work—he produced a letter, which purports to come from an architect, but I find it is only from his clerk, Mr. Dudley—I have not heard that the archi<lb/>tect was ill—Hickey entered into a verbal contract to do the stairs for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was obliged to employ his own men, and to draw money on account from time to time—he had another contract on at the same time for our firm at High Street, Shoreditch—that was for stairs—I do not think there was an agreement in writing at first for that (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">here put in the agree<lb/>ment</hi>)—he had the superintendence of the men who fixed the stairs—Tripp had the daily superintendence of them, but the actual work was done by Hickey—this was the only piece-work in the shop—if Hickey had bolted with money which he had drawn on account, I should have considered myself bound to pay Jemmett and Taylor for the credit of the firm—I should never let any work man go without his wages—I should have been bound to pay the men if Hickey had bolted with the money we had advanced, because his contract had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187811180075"/>
               <p>expired—in course of time the stairs wanted alteration; from somebody's blunder they had to be converted from <hi rend="italic">dog-leg</hi> to <hi rend="italic">well-hole</hi> stairs, which caused expense—the contract of 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would not anything like pay for the stairs when they were completed—when that contract was finished and a new arrangement entered into, Hickey was still to pay the men who worked under him—Jemmett and Taylor were not skilled men—Hickey did not ask me to allow him to employ his own men on his own terms and draw their wages and pay them what he liked; he simply requested me to let him pay them—they were under his control subject to the approval of Mr. Devonport—that was the only piece-work in our shop—those were not the only men Hickey had, he had others occasionally—he was looked upon, at his request, as the sub-contractor for that particular department of the stairs—it is not an everyday occurrence in jobs like this for a sub-contractor to employ men, draw money, and charge 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an hour more than he actually pays them—I know Mr. Moore, he is an architect and surveyor, who has been more than 40 years in the trade—I do not know Mr. Quinn, a builder, or Mr. Pell—if a sub-contractor employs men and pays them 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an hour, drawing 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from his employer, it is a fraud—although Hickey took the full responsibility upon himself, he denied making the alteration from 3 1/2 and 4 1/4 to 8—he kept a tally in his book—Jemmett and Taylor returned 3 1/2 and 4 hours, and that was sanctioned by Tripp—if Hickey was not there he could know by applying to Tripp how long the men worked—Tripp was there the whole day—there were 21 men on the premises that week.</p>

This is the paper with reference to the stairs at High Street, Shoreditch: "To preparing and fixing four flights of stairs 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Michael Hickey"—that was to do the work, not for the materials—I do not think there is a memorandum for the 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. job—this is piece work—we did not permit him to devote his time and energies to any other master—he does not keep a shop or carry on any business—I could direct him to go to work where I pleased—I could discharge Jemmett or Taylor; I always reserved the right to discharge any man—I have never heard till to-day of a superior workman charging a fictitious amount with the sanction of his employer for the wages of the men employed—he said nothing to me about being allowed to do so, he was to receive 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an hour and we were to pay only the exact amount he paid his men—that was said in words, with a caution that as there had been so much robbery going on, we should prosecute any man who did other<lb/>wise—I have never known of papers being falsified with the master's consent, and it would have been quite impossible for him to have done it if Tripp had sent the papers in—I do not know Hickey's writing sufficiently to say that this "9" is his—Tripp has to check the time of every man on the work, going in and coming out—he endorses the documents—we do not require any signature where the word "Yard" is, because there is no foreman at the yard, but on the Great Eastern job, where Tripp was foreman, he signed and he vouches the pay sheets as well there.</p>

I live at Wolseley Street, Mile End—the female prisoner is my aunt—I know 236, High Street, Shadwell; it is a good 20 minutes' walk from my house—on the night of 27th September the prisoners came to my place about 9.30—I was very ill with a fever, and my aunt said she would remain with me for the night; she did so—when I went to bed at 11 she was in the front parlour; I put a small mattress in the room for her—the male prisoner had gone away again directly after he came; he had not returned when I went to bed; there was nobody but us two—I locked my bedroom door; but the street door had no lock at that time; anybody could come in—I only occupy the two parlours; I slept in the back parlour—I got up next morning at 7 o'clock and went into the front parlour, and my uncle was standing there near the window—he was dressed—my aunt was there also—she went out soon after 7; he stayed a little while; I don't know at what time he left—I believe my aunt said that she was going home; he did not come back all day; he returned in the evening, and was then taken into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>.

               <p>him early on Friday evening, 27th September, about 6.30 or 7 o'clock; his wife was with him—we had no conversation then—about 11 o'clock he came in again alone—he remained about 20 minutes; he had a pint of ale and was talking, but nothing that attracted my attention—he left—I was out when the fire happened; I arrived shortly after, about 1.15; the engine and escape were then there.</p>

He used to come in for his supper beer of an evening, mostly about 10 o'clock—at times he would come in afterwards and have a glass—there was nothing unusual in his coming on this particular night at that time—there were other persons in the bar, neighbours that he knew—he did not take any supper beer away with him that night; he was talking of business matters—I gave evidence about this on the following Monday—he did not say where he was going when he left; he did not say he was going for his wife—the rent of his house would be about 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; it was a sea<lb/>man's lodging-house; that is rather a rough sort of business—I do not remember a disturbance taking place there two or three days before; I do not remember two Mulattos threatening him in the street, or any sailors making a disturbance in front of his house—I never heard of anything of the kind—I did not say anything before the Magistrate about a dispute with a sailor—he turned a sailor out four or five days before, but there was no bother; I heard of it afterwards, I was not present—when I got home on the night in question there was a crowd in the street eight or nine doors from the house—I did not see any sailors about that night; I did not remain outside; I went indoors and got my wife up.</p>

Let me go in"—she then went in, and I followed her to the back kitchen—she said, "Have the upstair rooms been burnt as well?"—I said, "Yes, but you cannot go up"—she said, "I must go up; I have got a quantity of things there"—the salvage man said to her, "You cannot got up"—she then put her hand in her pocket, pulled out her purse, and emptied the contents, about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and silver, on to the table, and said, "If you will allow me to go up, you can have that"—I said, "You may put it back in your purse; you cannot go up"—I then said, "Where is your husband?"—she said, "He left last night with me at 9 o'clock, but he came back at 11 to look after the dog, and I have not seen him since"—I said, "Where is he?"—she said, "He has gone to Harry Box at the West End"—I said, "Do you know the street or number?"—she said, "No, but I could show you"—I said, "I will go with you, as I want to know whether he is insured or not"—she then said, "I cannot go; I don't know the place; but if you will allow me, I will fetch my husband within an hour"—she then left the house; I followed her—she commenced to run, and I lost sight of her; that was near upon 8 o'clock—about 2.30 in the afternoon she came back; I then gave her into custody, and she was then taken to the station—I there asked her where her husband was—she said, "I have not seen him; he has gone to the Docks to look after two mulatto men"—I asked her what office she was insured in—she said, "My cousin wrote it down on a piece of paper"—she took her purse from her pocket, and offered me a two-shilling piece; she shoved it into my hand, and said, "Take this"—I laid it down on the window-ledge—she then took a piece of paper from her pocket; I have not got it, it has been mislaid somewhere—it had on, "Mrs. Milller, No. 3, Wolsley Street, Commercial Road"—I read it, and she said, "That is not the piece; give it me back"—she then gave me this other piece of paper, upon which is written "Mr. Samuel George Brown, 97, High Street, Shad well, agent for the London Fire Insurance"—I told her I should detain her—she said, "I will go to the Victoria Docks with you and show you my husband"—we left the station for that purpose and went to the Shad well railway station; when we got there she said she could not find him, and she would not go in, and I took her back to the station—a little after 3 that day I went to 3, Wolsley Street with the piece of paper I had got, and I waited there till 7.30, when the male prisoner came and knocked at the shutters and went in—I followed him—I said "Is your name Julius Ehmes?"—he said "Yes"—I then said "lama police officer, and shall take you in custody for being concerned with your wife in setting fire to your dwelling-house"—he said "You will have to</p>

               <p>prove that"—on the way to the station I said "Your wife tells me that you left your house with her last night at 9 o'clock"—he replied, "Yes, that is sot but I was in Mr. Bailey's beerhouse at 20 minutes to 12 having a glass of ale"—I said "Where did you go then"—he said "I walked the streets"—I said "What, all night? "—he said "No, I went to the house you have just brought me from"—I said "Have you seen your wife since 9 o'clock last night? "—he said "Yes, she slept on a mattress and I slept on a chair"—I said "Have you seen her this morning? "—he said "Yes, she got up at 7 this morning, had some coffee, and went to look at the house"—I said "Have you seen her since? "—he said "Yes, I remained there until she returned"—I said "Did she tell you anything when she returned? "—he said "Yes, she told me that the house had been burnt, and that the fireman wanted to see me"—I said "What did you say to that? "—he said "I shan't go; I want to go to the Docks to look after these two men"—the prisoners were then both charged with setting fire to their dwelling-house—the woman said "I don't want money; I have got plenty; I should never do such a thing to gain money"—the man made the same observation as before, "You will have to prove that"—when I first entered the house I saw a dog alive in the first-floor front room—I also saw a dead dog in the back parlour with its legs burnt off.</p>

I lire 16, Ashdown Street, Haverstock Hill, and am a clerk at the North Western Railway—on the evening of 1ST November I was at the Westminster Aquarium and left at 11 o'clock, and went to supper at a public-house at the corner of Bridge Street and King Street—at about 12 o'clock I walked slowly towards Leicester Square—my watch was in my waistcoat pocket—it had a black guard—I saw seven or eight people talking outside the Alhambra, I went up to within about three feet to listen, when the prisoner struck me in my stomach and I fell on my back—I had not said a word to him—I got up and found my coat unbuttoned and my watch gone—I found a policeman standing there, and he took the prisoner—just before that I took hold of a woman, and said, "I think you have got my watch"—she commenced to cry and said she knew nothing about it, and I did not charge her—the prisoner was standing close by and no doubt heard this—she was one of those outside the Alhambra talking—I am not aware that the prisoner made any answer when I charged him—a cabman named Hurst came up about the same time as the policeman—I had had four or five glasses during the evening—my watch was safe before I came into Leicester Square.</p>

I should have told you if I had not been sober—I left home between 7 and 8 in the evening—I dined between 1 and 2 and was at work all the afternoon—I got to the Aquarium between 8 and 9—I met with two friends—the sisters of one of them keep a stall there, those were the only ladies I spoke to—I had about two glasses of ale, and left when the place closed—one of my friends supped with me—I had two or three glasses of ale with my supper—we had it in the bar—we sat and had a smoke after—I had nothing to drink between there and Leicester Square—I did not speak to anybody in Parliament Street—I was going to walk part of the way and then have a cab—I looked at my watch in Parliament Street, it was then about 12.30—it was a gold watch with a white face, and a vulcanite chain to hook in the button—I am certain I went through St. Martin's Court—I did not wish to go through Seven Dials-—I am under the im<lb/>pression that I was walking in the direction of the crowd—I did not go into Leicester Square to look for a woman—I lost no money—the policeman was standing close by when the altercation took place—the prisoner was not smoking—he was standing with his face towards me—I did not run against him—I did not notice him quarrelling or with speaking to the others—he had a walking-stick—he did not strike me with that, "but with his fist in the pit of the stomach—I did not see the stick used—the blow gave me a sudden shock—I don't know that I was stunned—I don't think my coat was unbuttoned while I was on the ground, but immediately before---</p>

               <p>I did not see any one else do it—I did not see any of the women come near me while I was on the ground—I fell with my head towards the Alhambra and away from the crowd—one of the witnesses picked my cap up—I was excited—I wish I had given the woman in charge—she wag the next nearest to me—it is difficult to give people in charge without you are sure—I am sure the prisoner knocked me down, but I am not sure that he took my watch—I am sure the watch was not gone before—it was a cold night rather, and I had only one coat on and I kept it buttoned—the prisoner did not run away—he went quietly with the policeman. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. No one pushed against me that I remember—I buttoned my coat after looking at my watch, and it was so when I came into Leicester Square—I came in at the corner of Leicester Square—I don't know the names of the streets in that neighbourhood—I went down a turning very near Trafalgar Square—I thought it was St Martin's Court.</p>

At the police-court I did not say anything about the female speaking to the prisoner—I didn't know it was anything—I have not talked to anybody about the matter since—they never asked me the question—my cab was two doors from the entrance to the Alhambra—the crowd was in front of me—I had not been out for a fortnight or three weeks—the females were third-class we will say—they looked like women of the town—there were one or two other men besides the prisoner—I saw a stick in his hand—no pipe—I fancy he put the stick in his left hand and hit the prosecutor with his right—the prosecutor was standing behind—I swear he did not strike the prisoner—I saw him all the time he was there—I did not see the prosecutor speak to any one—I was perfectly sober—the prosecutor was excited by the blow, but not with liquor that I saw—I don't think the prisoner was the worse for drink.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman R</hi> 202). On Thursday morning, 10th November, about 2 o'clock, I was on duty in the Avenue leading from St John's Park to Blackheath—that is at the rear of No. 2, St John's Park, the house of Mr. Burness—in passing that house I noticed the flickering of a light in the drawing-room at the back of the house; I watched it for some little time, and then went in search of another constable; I found Girling; he accompanied me back, and we both made observation of the drawing-room; we noticed the light more from the drawing-room into several other parts of the house—I was then assisted by Girling on to the garden wall; Sergeant Brown then came up, and he helped Girling on to the wall, and went round to the front of the house and rang the bell; immediately upon that the light I had noticed was extinguished, and the prisoner came out from the drawing-room window, which opens on to the lawn of the garden; Girling then jumped off the wall into the avenue, and I jumped into the garden—I was in uniform—in my jumping down I broke some glass, which made a noise—I then saw the prisoner run towards the bottom of the garden; I immediately followed him—as I was following him he turned round and pointed a revolver at my head—I was then about 6 yards from him—it was a moonlight night; I could see the revolver—he said, "Keep back, keep off, or by God I will shoot you"—I said, "You had better not"—he immediately fired three chambers of the revolver at my head, two of the shots passing to the left of my head and the third over my head; I heard the shots whistling past my head—I then made a rush at him, and he fired a fourth shot at me, passing to the right of my head; he aimed at me—I then closed with him, and struck him in the fare with my left hand, and with my right I guarded my head; the prisoner then said, "You b——, I will settle you this time, "and immediately fired a fifth shot, which I received through the right arm above the elbow—I closed with him again, and threw him down—whilst we were on the ground he said, "You b——, will give you something else, "and he placed his left hand towards his</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I was 6 yards from him when he turned; I got closer to him, I ran towards him—before he fired the first shot I was about 2 yards off him—I had not my truncheon drawn at the time—he fired the three shots in succession when I was within 2 yards of him, threatening me in the same way that he did afterwards, when he hit me—the shots went close to me—after the three shots had been fired I made a dash at him and struck him—I struck him very hard—the fourth shot came almost immediately after that—the subsequent wound was in the arm with which I guarded my head; I had it up in that position when the fifth shot was fired—I did not move my arm before the last shot was fired; I kept it in that position; at the same time he struck me in the face and fired at me—I did not hear the prisoner say after the struggle, "I only did it to frighten him.

On this morning I was with Robinson and Girling at the back of No. 2, St. John's Park—I told them to guard the rear, and I went round to the front, and knocked and rang several times—shortly afterwards I heard some shots fired; they appeared to come from the back of the house—I also heard a cry for assistance—I immediately ran round to the back of the house, got over the wall, and there found that Robinson had been shot—he was lying above the prisoner, who had this six-chamber revolver in his hand; his elbow was resting on the walk, and the revolver was pointing at me as I came up—it was strapped round his right wrist—I at once went to Robinson's assistance—after striking the prisoner on the hand with my truncheon I got the revolver from him—I struck him on the right arm because I could not get the revolver out of his hand—I held him till Girling came—he was then secured, and I searched the place to see if there was any other man—I found no one else—I found on the prisoner a silver pocket-flask, a banker's cheque-book, and a letter-case, which have been identified by Mr. Burness—I also found this small crowbar in his left-hand trousers pocket—I went into the house and found the dining-room window open, and on the table some of the plate, a crumb-scoop, a sugar-basin and spoon, and a decanter stand, ready for removal—it was not packed; he had been disturbed apparently—I took a gold ring from his hand at the station; that has not been identified.</p>

"—she said "So she is "—I said "Why should you say so, she has never done anything out of the way, she was never in prison"—she took up a knife and hit me in the forehead and said "Was I in prison?"—I said "Yes you were, Kate"—Mr. McCarthy came round from the other end of the table where he sat, and she hit me over his shoulder across the nose with the knife, and the same blow cut my lip and</p>

P., who is manager of the Company—I did not watch them—I remember one of them coming in that evening, but the two Seths are so much alike, I don't know which it was—I think it mitigates their conduct very much that they only obeyed the orders of their chief—these four decanter-trays are my daughter's property—they have on them the crest of the company from whom I received them—they are part of a service which was given to me by a great company—they were in the house when it was broken into—I did not miss them till the police found them—I watched and noticed that a great deal of theft was going on by the representatives of the company who broke into my house—I identify these spoons, these 18 forks, and this soup-ladle—these two spoons and these two dessert knives also bear the crest of the company—they are my daughter's—I also missed 7-lb. quicksilver—it was not mine, but was left with me by a friend to make some experiments with—the bottle is marked 7-lb.—I found it empty—it was worth about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce—this soap-box produced is mine—it was taken out of my dressing-case, and has been changed in shape—I never gave the prisoners authority to take these things—I abstained from all communication with them—there was to be a mock sale in my house by order of the Chancellor, but it never took place—I never gave authority for a quantity of waste paper to be taken from the house, but I saw at the station a moderate size eack full of valuable papers, plans, and drawings.</p>

"he said, "From Mr. Scott Russell"—when Mr. Benjamin came home I told him there had been a young man from Mr. Scott Russell's—he said, "Oh, for the money for the bottle of quicksilver; when he comes again tell him that it was of no use"—that was about two months before I gave evidence at the police-court, or a little longer—the same man called again next day, and I said that Mr. Benjamin said it was no use—he said, "Tell Mr. Benjamin to return it"—about a week after that Robert Seth called to have a coat mended; he sat in the kitchen, and Mr. Benjamin mended it, and said to him, "I can get rid of all you can get hold of"—that was all I heard—I saw some plated articles on the table; that was a week before George Seth's first visit, but I did not see this ladle, or soap<lb/>box, or the bottle—Mrs. Benjamin said to Benjamin, "Where did you get these? "—he said, "From Scott Russell's"—she said, "You had better take care what you are doing"—he said, "I won't have them here; I will take them to London"—he took them off next morning, and was away all day this ladle was the first thing brought to the house; he brought it when he brought the waste paper, and maps, and oil cans; he took it from his pocket at the same time, and said, "Take it indoors"—I was helping to unload the barrel of paper—I took the ladle in, and put it in the kitchen—it was then two or three days, and then it disappeared—I did not see it again for two months; I then saw it in the warehouse; I took it to the police-station, but did not give it up—Mrs. Prop went with me to the station; I took it to her house; it was given to Mr. Prop, who took it to the station.</p>

"he said, "Yes, first class"—I said, "How could there be a sale on when the bailiffs are only just in?

On 6th November, about 1 in the morning, I saw a fire On Purbright Common—I ran to the spot, and saw three men run away—the prisoners are two of them—the fire was burning when I got up to it—I took Saunders into custody that evening, and charged him with setting fire to the common—he said he did not do it—he afterwards said if he had not seen me he would have had another fire—I then showed the spot where the fire was to Mr. Hacker, a clerk in the war department—I had some difficulty in putting the fire out—it took me a quarter of an hour—I don't call that hard work, but it was rather warm work.</p>

The fireworks I hare alluded to were on Purbright Green, about a quarter of a mile from the place where I saw this burn<lb/>ing; they were let off at half-past 10—I dirt not see any let off at 1 in the morning, most people were in bed then—I had a view of the prisoners' faces as they ran past me—the moon was shining brightly—I had known both of them before, and I recognised them when they passed me—when the two came back three quarters of an hour afterwards, I was hiding in a bush, they did not see me before they came up to me, they were going towards where the fire had been.</p>

I am a groom in the service of Major Armstrong, at Purbright—on the morning of 6th November, about 1 o'clock, I was in company with the two prisoners—we had been together from about 10—we went to see some fireworks at Nap Hill; we started from Purbright village about half-past 10—the fireworks were over about half-past 12; they were let off about a mile from the common—after they were over I</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Alfred Sullivan, baker, of 394 Wandsworth Road—on 2nd November the prisoner came for a twopeuny loaf, for which he tendered a half-crown—I recognised him as having been in the shop before—I saw the coin was bad—I marked it with a knife at the police-station—when I told him it was bad, he said I might try to bend it—I told him I had no right to give him change for it or give it back, and if a policeman were passing I would call him in—he did not move away until I turned my head to open the trap to call up the pastry<lb/>cook, and then I saw a policeman passing, and called him in, and the policeman brought him back to the shop, and the prisoner asked me if he were the man who gave it me, and I said he was, and that he brought me a bad two-shilling piece a fortnight before—this occurred in the kitchen, where he was searched—I gave the bad half-crown to the con<lb/>stable—on the former occasion I think it was twopenny worth of cakes he asked for—when he me gave the bad two-shilling piece, as I told him of it, my husband happened to come in, and I passed it to him, and he said it was bad—he then paid with a good sixpence and went away—I believe he put the bad coin in his pocket.</p>

                  </hi>.
