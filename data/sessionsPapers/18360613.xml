                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 24th of May I was on duty in Battersea-fields about half-past one o'clock in the morning, and saw the three prisoners in Sleaford-street, Battersea-fields all together going towards the prosecutor's house—about then minutes after that, I saw Swinford stand<lb/>ing at the back of the prosecutor's house—I asked him what he was standing there for—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183606130007"/>
               <p>said he had been to Greenwich fair, and got drunk and lost his way—asked him where he came from—he said from Chelsea—I asked him where his two companions were gone—he said he had bees asleep, and did not know where they were gone—I directed him to Chelsea, and he went on—about twenty minutes after that, I was at the top of New-street, Battersea-fields within about twenty yards of the prosecutor's house, and heard a call—I immediately ran to the place and found the three prisoners walking along the road together, in quite a contrary direction to where I had directed Swinford—I asked them where they came from—Brown said, "From Lambeth"—Swinford immediately ran away, and I took the other two into custody—I saw something under Hawkins coat which appeared a lump at his breast—I asked him what it was—he said it was key of his box—I put my hand in his pocket and took out a lot of keys—as I was taking the keys from him, I saw Brown throw something away—that was in the high-road—there are no houses near—there is a pale-fence and a hedge—he threw it into the hedge—when we got about sixty yards they said they would go no further—part of what Brown threw fell on one side of the hedge, and part on the other—I saw the police sergeant pick up one spoon, and Pace picked up another on one side of the hedge afterwards—I could not see what Brown threw away at the time, but it jingled like spoons or keys—I got assistance when they refused to go further, and took them—as they were sitting down, after throwing the things away, I saw some<lb/>thing in Hawkin's hand—I asked him what it was—he said it was a bit of rag—I took it from him, and it was a piece of candle wrapped in piece of rag—I asked Brown if he had any thing about him—he said he had not, but he would not be searched, he would go to station-house—I took him to the station-house with assistance, and searched him there, and found on him a pack of cards, a lucifer-box, three combs, a hand<lb/>vice four skeleton keys a latch-key, a handkerchief and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money—he said he had found them all tied up together in a handkerchief lying in the road—when I first saw the three prisoners together they all hand their shoes on, and when I took them into custody, Hawkins had no shoes on, and Brown had only one shoe on—I afterwards apprehended Swinford on the 28th of May and found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a pocket-knife on him—I had never seen the prisoners before to my knowledge—it was getting quite light when I saw them the last time—it was a light morning when I first saw them, at half-past one o'clock—it was very light all that night—it was by moonlight, I saw them—there were no lamps—there was sufficient light to see their countenances—I was so near them that I could have touched them—I spoke to Swinford afterwards, and walked a considerable distance with him—and some time after when I had heard the alarm, I saw them all three together again—I have no doubt whatever the prisoners are the men.</p>

On Thursday the 9th of June, I had occasion to go to Fleet-street to a tradesman of mine; and when I had transacted my business with him, I was returning home; and when I got a little beyond St. Dunstan's church, I was hustled—it was a little to the westward of St. Dunstan's church, near Hoare's banking-house—there were seven or eight persons about me, pushing me about—shoving me about—they knocked my had off—I was trying to recover it; and when I got on my legs again, I found my watch was gone—I had felt a tug at my fob—my watch was in my fob—there was a chain and two seals to it—it was loose in my pocket, but my coat was buttoned—I really cannot tell any of the persons who were shoving me about—I was so frightened, and pushed from one to the other—I was trying to get my hat; and when I recovered my hat, I lost my watch—they had knocked my hat off—I was stooping to get it, and my watch was taken.</p>

About nine o'clock on Tuesday 7th June, I was at the end of Union-street, Shadwell, and heard "Murder" cried—I turned round, and saw some people running from the opposite side of the street, over towards No. 4—I directly went up to No. 4—when I got against the window, I heard "Murder"cried in the parlour—I tried to get in at the street-door, but it was fastened—I went to the parlour window—there was a square of glass broken—I put my hand through, and pushed the curtain on one side, and saw the prosecutrix bleeding very much at the head—the door was open at No. 5, and I went through No. 5, and got into the yard of No. 4 into the passage and into the parlour—I saw the prosecutrix sitting in a chair by the window, bleeding very much at the head—she told me she was stabbed, and the man was gone out—on turning round, and looking about he room, I saw the witness Hesketh sitting in a chair—she said, "That is not him"—I went into the yard, and found the prisoner in the privy, and brought him through the passage into the parlour—he was dressed all but his hat—the prosecutrix said, "That is the man that stabbed me"—I told him he must be a brute to use a girl in that his hat—I told him he should have it if he went quietly—he wanted to go up-stairs for it—I told him he should not go up-stairs, and then he called out for the people outside to shut the window-shutter—it was shut, and then we were in darkness in the room—I had got him by the collar, and was trying to make my way to the street-door—I trod on something in going across the room—I stooped down, and found it to be the handle of a jug—when I got the street-door, I held him by one hand, while I open the street-door—a little scuffle ensued between us, and he got hold of the door-post—he was trying to get away—he got me back into the room, and I trod on the handle of a knife—I stooped, and picked it up—we were in darkness; and in the scuffle, I put him back in a chair, and dropped the knife again—I called out to the people to open the shutter—Serjeant Denny came by at the time assisted in taking him to the station-house, and he was committed—I saw the prosecutrix afterwards—she had two wounds on the forehead, one on the top of the other—one on the top of the head, and one on he thick part of the arm—I took her to Mr. Croucher, and he took her to the surgery, and dressed her—he is not here—I cannot say the wounds were given by a knife, more than from what the doctor said before the Magistrate—I picked the knife up in the room—I did not see it done—she was taken into the surgery, and I waited in the shop while Mr. Croucher dressed her—when she came out, she had three plasters on the fore<lb/>head and one on the arm—I saw the wound on the arm—the blood I saw was on her head—I took a double handfull of blood out of her hair—there was a <hi rend="italic">goodish</hi> drop of blood on her arm and on her clothes—I did not see any blow that was given by the jug.</p>

                  </hi>. I work at the docks. I was at the house on this evening—it is a lodging-house—the person who keeps the house is a friend of mine—I had received some ill usage at the public-house in the Highway, and went there to take some rest—I seated myself on a chair, laid my head on a table, and went to sleep—hearing a little noise, I raised my head up, turned round and saw the prisoner and the prosecutrix—knowing they had been in the habit of living together, I merely remarked to the prisoner not to be so very rash, and laid my head down again—knowing they had had words before, I did not like to interfere—I saw him use some sort of an instrument off the table—they had a scuffle together—I was very much stupified from the ill treatment I had received from some Irishmen at a public-house, and I sat down again—I saw them have a scuffle, he took up a knife, but I was so stupified I could scarcely tell what he did—I can scarcely tell what happened—I saw a good deal of blood—it came from the prosecutrix—I afterwards saw that knife—I saw it on the table first, and in the prisoner's hands.</p>

               <p>her something to drink, which I at times did—one day she came so often to one house, quite in liquor, that I said I would give her nothing—that in about three weeks ago—she took off a jug from the mantel-piece a the public-house, and made a blow over my head with that, and knocked the crown of my hat in, and I received a wound on my head as big as an egg—I went into the back of the premises, fetched a ladder, and whet to work, leaving her there—I went to her at eight o'clock next morning, which was my breakfast time—I said, "I will not stop with you any longer; you served me as bad as you did three years back"—she had then inflicted a wound on my head, which I have got now; it is more than three inches long—I said, "I shall go down to the Archbishop of York's and go to work there—I will go off to-morrow"—she said, "Don't go"—she went down on her knees, and begged of me not to leave her, and she would never do the like again; and I forgave her—she said, if I would furnish her a place, as she knew I had a trifle by me, she would go to it; and we were, in a short time to be united—I furnished the place; and after I had done this, she had these words with me on Tuesday, the 7th of the month, and gave me in charge at nine o'clock; and at half-past nine, after her wounds were dress<lb/>ed, she came and asked me for the key of the house—I told her where it was—she took it, and went and sold every thing off by ten o'clock that night, and kept he money; so that I was completely destitute, and had not a penny—I was then sent here to take my trial on this capital charge—had I had my goods, I should have been able to sell them myself to procure a solicitor and counsel; but I have not had the means of doing so—a witness, named Mason can prove she has-said, since I was committed, that she would not have said what she did before the Magistrate only to get rid me; and what she said, she could not positively swear to, for she had no doubt she was in liquor, and could not tell whether she hit me, or I hit her—I own partaking of thirteen or fourteen half-pints of liquor that morning among three or four persons—I do not know whether Mason is here.</p>

Hall"—believing the prisoner to be in the service to Mr. Hall, I furnished him with it—I have three fourpenny pieces and a great quantity of sixpences—the water of the note was wet—it was addressed to Mr. Joseph Cockerton.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable. On the 21st of May, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, I went to No. 3, Kennedy's-court, Church-street, St. Giles's, with Ashton, Fink, Hall, and Duke—they are all officers—the street-door being open, I proceeded up-stairs with Ashton and Fink—the other two waited outside—the room door being rather ajar, somebody inside ran to shut it—I heard them do that, and I forced it open against them, and entered the room—on the right-hand side of the fire<lb/>place stood Newland, Leonard on the left, and Kelly on the left-hand side of the window—I laid hold of Newland and Leonard, and pushed them towards the window, and Leonard threw something white out of the window with her right hand—I could not see what it was—I put them into one corner of the room, and from the window I saw Hall stooping and picking something up in a public-house yard, which faces the window—I kept the prisoners in the corner of the room till the other officers arrived—I was seized by the left leg by a large dog, which held by my leg till it was knocked off by Ashton—I saw a pen-knife lying just outside the the window—on a little shelf on the left-hand side of the fir-place, I took off this half sheet of scouring paper—I searched Newland—he said I should find nothing on him, nor did I—I searched Leonard, and found on her a</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of counterfeit coin to His Majesty's Mint, and have had experience in examining coin for a great number of years. This is a plaster-of-Paris mould, intended for casting counterfeit shillings—it is composed of the pieces produced by Hall—it has the impressions of the obverse and reverse sides of a shilling—there are five shillings produced, which are all counterfeit, and cast in white metal—I have compared two of them with the mould, and believe they were cast in it—there is an acci<lb/>dental break in the mould, with which they exactly correspond—the other shillings I have compared with the mould and I believe they have been cast in it, but the break has been removed from these—that is some surplus metal which could be field off—these are in a more finished state—this file might be applied to remove the surplus metal—there appears to be white metal in the teeth of it—the iron spoon might be used to melt the metal before it is poured into the mould—there is white metal in it now, which appears to have been an imperfect cast—the mould is made of plaster of Paris, and is similar to the plaster of Paris now produced.</p>

On the 30th of May I went to Fleur-de-lis-court, Peter's-lane, Cow-cross, about two o'clock in the afternoon, with Duke, Hall, and Palmer—I went to the door and found it fast—I had a crow bar with me—I put it to the door and forced it open, and went into the room—the with me—I put it to the door and forced it open, to lay hold of me, to prevent my going in—the male prisoner was sitting in front of the fire on a small box—he rose up, threw something down on the ground, and tried to break it with his feet; he had it in his hand when I entered the room, and with his left hand he threw something into the fire—Duke and I a strong scuffle with him for some time, he being a powerful man—I picked up, in front of the fire-place, these pieces of mould, in a broken state; near to where the pieces of mould were, I picked up one six<lb/>pence</p>

On the 7th of May I was washing my own clothes, and hung them in the beck garden to dry—about nine o'clock I was in the back room, which looks into the garden, and in consequence of observing something, I ran out, and my clothes were gone—I saw a dark shade when I ran out, and saw the prisoner on the wall—he dropped from the wall—I called out "Stop thief" as loud as I could, and ran to the front of the house, and stopped him myself—my niece ran out—I knew him to be the same man—he had no shoes on on the wall, nor when I stopped him—I laid hold of him and said, "Tell me where my clothes are"—he said, "I know nothing of your clothes"—I said, "Tel me where they are, and then you shall go"—I afterwards found the shift and counterpane in the next garden, under the wall where he dropped, and gave them to the policeman—the counterpane belongs to my niece, Elizabeth Hollington, who is the wife of George Hollington—he rents this house—my aunt live with us—I ran out when the alarm was given, and saw the prisoner drop from the</p>

I have no partner—the pri<lb/>soner was in my employ for a considerable time—having heard something from the foreman, I thought it necessary to go to the prisoner, and told him he was short in some silk—he said he did not know any thing about it—I said he had secreted some silk in the shop—he said he did not know; if he had,</p>

I was walking in the Harrow-road, between six and seven o'clock, on the 10th of May, alone—it is about ten minute's walk from my house—I had a bag in my hand, which contained the articles stated—this is it—it was on my arm—there was a man walking a few yards before me—he stopped till I passed him—he then came round to the other side, and pulled my bag—I held it for about two minutes, and then let it go—he pulled the bag, and I held it against him, and that pulled me across the road—we were about two minutes together—I cannot say I should know</p>

I received a parcel from my mother on the 27th of May, to take to Mr. Brown—I took it in a basket—as I was going along I met the prisoner—he asked me where I was going, if I was going to his house—I asked which was his house, and said I was going to Mr. Browns—he said Mr. Brown was out, and the servant had sent him to meet me—if he met me in the field he was to take them—I said he must not tumble them—he told me to wait in the field till he came back with the money—I said I could not, because mother wanted me—he ran across the filed with them, and I went on with the other two shirts to Mr. Cullen's—I called at Mr. Brown's as I came back, and asked if they had got the shirts—the groom ran after the prisoner, and caught him against Thirty-Acre-bridge—I ran after the groom.</p>

My little girl, named Martha, had a coral necklace on, and was out with two other little girls, on the 13th of May—about seven o'clock in the evening, I was informed of this, and found her without the necklace—I took the prisoner into my garden, and he staid there till the officer came—the necklace was picked up—it appeared to have been broken—there were a great many beads gone.</p>

I am a publican, but have lately been driving a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> On Sunday morning, the 22nd of May, I was in Bond-street, at the end of Oxford-street—I saw a gentleman and the prisoner at a public-house—there were five or six persons round—the gentleman spoke to me, and asked if I had a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and if I would drive him—I said I would, of course—this was a little after seven o'clock—I took the fare, and was away half an hour—I came back, and saw the same party there—the gentleman, who gave his name, "Simpkins," them asked me to drive him home—he got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and I drove on with him—he pointed to me to go on—I went on in the direction of Baker-street—the prisoner jumped up behind as I was going—I have seen the prisoner before, driving a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he got up behind, and asked the gentleman to give him some halfpence, and then to give him some silver—I said, "If you have promised him any thing, you had better give it him, to get rid of him"—he said, "D—him, I will give him something to drink"—we went on to the corner of Baker-street, and got out at the Globe, but I would not have any thing—he got in again, and the prisoner snatched the gentleman's watch and ran off with it—we pursued him—a milkman caught the prisoner, and the watch was thrown away—it was found, and given to the gentleman—the prisoner ran about two hundred yards, and was taken, in Oxford Mews—I did not know the gentleman's name till he gave it at the station-house.</p>

Bailey made inquiry about the cheque, I inquired into there ad<lb/>dress, and no such person was known—I believe this was within a week—no such person had ever lived there—a communication was made of this circumstance by our house, to Mr. Howell of Gracechurch-street.</p>

               <p>(The prisoner Chuck put in a written defence, stating that Cocks had asked him to go to Shoolbred's with him to purchase the cloth, as he had been in the habit of dealing there; that he called Norman, a tailor, out of the Gun public-house, and they went there together, where Cocks gave him the note to purchase the cloth; on coming out he gave him the cloth and change; he took him to the Gun, where he left the bundle, and Cocks got him to change the £5 note with the landlady; next day he offered him more notes to change, which he refused, having his suspicions; that he used the expression alluded to on his second apprehension, conceiving Cocks capable of convicting him by perjury to save himself.)</p>

The said George Wilkinson on his oath, says, I reside with my mother, at Tottenham-court Green, in the said County, widow—on Friday, the 22nd of February, I went to town, and returned about four o'clock in the afternoon, and brought with me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in sovereign and half-sovereigns, and two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—I gave the two notes to my mother and kept the gold myself, which I put into my left-hand trowsers pocket—my watch pocket—about eight o'clock that evening I went to the Swan Inn, opposite Tottenham High-cross, kept by one Jonathan Gurr—I sat in the bar, and had some gin and water—I left the Swan at about eleven o'clock at night to go home—my mother's house is on the West side of Tottenham Green, a short distance from the Swan—when I was within about twenty yards of the front court gate, I was suddenly seized from behind and pulled down on my back—some one put his hand over my mouth, and another pulled open my great-coat, my under coat and waistcoat—I felt a hand in my left-hand trowsers pocket, where the gold was—the party then left me on the ground and ran away—I got up and went in-doors—I discovered the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was gone, as well as my gold watch, chain, and seals—the persons who robbed me never spoke—it was momentarily done—the night was dark—I did not see the faces of the party, nor do I know how many there were; but I think I can safely say there were two at least—shortly after I went in doors, I, together with William Collier, my mother's footman, went to the spot where I had been pulled down, and picked up some keys and a</p>

On Friday, the 20th of May, the prisoner and another came to the shop to purchase stockings and some ribbon—they bought the things—the prisoner kept walking about the shop; and being confused, I asked her what she had under her shawl; and before she could answer me, I took three pairs of shoes from under her arm, under her shawl—she said nothing, but en<lb/>deavoured to make off—I caught hold of her shawl—she left it behind her—the boy caught her on the curb-stone, and brought her back, and I gave her in charge.</p>

About eight o'clock on the evening of the 16th of May, the prisoner came to purchase a pair of shoes—my wife keeps a shoe shop there—the prisoner tried three or four shoes and said none suited her, and she asked me to look out a larger pair against she came back—about half an hour after she was gone the policeman came with this lace and these shoes—this lace I can swear was taken from my shop window, where I had several cards of lace—these shoes resemble mine, and I believe are mine.</p>

On the 21st of April, the prisoner came to me for employment in the shirt-making—I gave her work—she stated her name to be Betsey Harris—I gave the girl that was living with me some cotton cloth for two shirts, to go with the prisoner to ascertain whether the address was correct—she took them from the girl's hand, in my presence, and said she would carry it for her, as she had the child to carry—I never saw her again—I met her on the 22nd of May, and asked her about the property—she said she never saw me before—the cloth has not been found—I am sure she is the person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman to Messrs. Johnsons, paviors. On the 23rd of May I was directed by Mr. Chadwick to take some old stones from London-wall to the City Stone-yard—I had been one week in Messrs. Johnson's employ—I never saw the prisoner till past eight o'clock that morning, when I saw him at London-wall—before he came up I had ob<lb/>served him talking to some of Johnson's men—after I had laden the cart full of stones, the prisoner said, "You are going to the City Stone-yard with these stones?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I am in Messrs. Johnson's a employ, and am going to use a few of them"—I said, "Whereabout?"—he said, "Come along with me, I will show you; it is all in your road going along"—we went down Milton-street, and, at the corner of Type-street, he said, "I am going to use some here"—I said, "Very well"—I took out the tail-board, and we got out these stones—he said, "These will do for the present; I shall see what more I want"—I went on to the City Stone-yard, and unloaded; and then the policeman came to me—I did not count what stones I left, but I belive it was seven.</p>

I do not know that she opened her mouth—she did not desire me to watch her hands for fear she should throw away the purse—there was the sergeant—I believe he was close to me—when we were going down Cable-street, the prisoner made a kind of faint, and I said to my sergeant, "You take one hand and I will take the other"—Mrs. Terry did not desire me to watch her hands—I thought she had the purse—that</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the White Bear, at Hounslow. I saw the prisoner drive a horse and small cart into my yard, on the 21st of May, about half-past seven, or a quarter to eight o'clock in the morning—he was muddy half way up his legs—his boots were very muddy, and the lead was all over mud, as if it had been thrown down off the roof—I saw him wiping the mud off the lead—I then went and looked into the cart—he said, "I want a feed of corn for my horse—I sent the ostler for it, and sent for Hall, the constable to come, but before he came the prisoner took the horse and cart and lead into Bonsor's yard—the constable came—I saw him lead the horse and cart out of the yard, and pointed him out—he went into my tap-room—the officer took him, and he said, "Do you think a respectable man like me would be guilty of stealing lead? I can show you I am a respectable man, and a dealer in marine stores"—the constable said "Whose horse and cart is that"—he said, "Oh, my own", but they found a ticket on him that it was hired for the day—I saw the lead matched to the different buildings, and every bit of it matched.</p>

I went with Mr. Entwistle to the prisoner's house, and told her I had a warrant to search her house, as blankets and sheets were thought to be at her place, stolen from the parish workhouse in Bethnal-green—she said, "I suppose it is about that sheet that Mother Moody brought here," and that Moody told her she had received it from her daughter, who told her it was given to her from the workhouse—she directed her daughter to go up to the first-floor front room with me, and the daughter handed me a sheet, out of a little cot, folded up, with "Bethnal-green Workhouse," marked at each corner, and as O—I made a further search in a little back room adjoining the shop, where there were six or sever hun<lb/>dred different parcels, with small labels on them for figures; and in a large bundle full of sheets, linen and various things, I found two sheets with the ends cut off, but there was a little of the mark of the same colour as the other sheet was marked—that place was not pointed out to me by her—I went there of my own accord—when I found the first sheet, I said, "There is Bethnal-green Workhouse" in full length—she said, "That is the same sheet I had from Mother Moody"—when I found the other two sheets I asked if she knew any thing about them—she said, No; she had had them a long time—I pointed out to her where the marks appeared to have been cut off—she made no remark to that—part of the mark was visible—it is a little tinge, but very trifling—one of the sheets had been begun to be hemmed—there was a needle and thread in it—the mark of the other so trifling it was impossible to say they were marks—there is exactly the same colour</p>

On the 2nd of June the prisoner Larner came into the yard about four o'clock, and asked me if any thing had come—I said, "Yes"—he went up the yard to the dwelling-house, and on the ground floor of the house there was some clover and straw—that was what I meant—it had recently come to the premises—I afterwards saw Larner moving the straw, and saw two or three trusses of the clover at the street-door—I told him he should put that in the passage, and he said, "Yes"—I then went away—he put it out at the street-door—I thought it had no business there, and told him to put it in the passage, which was within the house—Larner worked on the premises—he was in master's employ—he was putting the clover a little to rights, to clear it away to cut it—he was employed to cut it, but did not cut any—he put it out into the street—I did not know there was any intention of it being taken away—there was not much room on the ground floor to cut it.</p>

I apprehended Dimock in the prosecutor's shop—I had seen him at the Bull public-house, where he brought in two trusses of clover—I said nothing to him then, but when the second truss was brought, I followed them—the other prisoner helped him in with it, and held the public-house door open for him—I followed them, and saw them go into the prosecutor's house, which is about 200 yards off—I knocked at the door, and asked if Mr. Saunders was at home—he came down stairs, and I asked him if he had given these men orders to move his clover hay—he said he did not know he had any men on the premises—the prisoners said they had not taken any hay into the Bull—I have the hay on my premises at home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mrs. Sarah Avila, a pawnbroker, who lives in Mile-end-road. The prisoner Barrow was in her serviceon the 16th of May I searched in his trowsers pocket, and found this letter which is in his handwriting—I went, in consequence of that, with Low and Hunt, to the residence of the prisoners Ruffs, in Wellington-place, Stepney, about three quarters of a mile from my mistress's—they keep a toy shop—we arrived there about a quarter after three o'clock—we found both Henry and Robert Ruff in a little parlour behind the shop—I went in first, and said to them, "You are the very men we want"—they said, "What do you want us for, William?"—I said, "You must know what we want you for"—the officers then came in—we proceeded to search the back parlour, and among other things we found this dagger, these five wine<lb/>glasses, and the other articles stated—this dagger I can positively swear to—it was the private property of Mr. Samuel Avila, who died on the 16th of March—since then it has been my mistress's property—we had missed articles similar to these other things from the shop—they had been pledged there—the prisoners were then taken into custody—when I found this letter in Barrow's pocket, I took it to Mrs. Avila, and then went for a con<lb/>stable—he went into the parlour first, and then I called Barrow in—I told him I had found this paper in his pocket, and asked him what it all meant—he said, "I will tell you all about it"—I then commenced reading is to him, and asked him who these Ruffs were—he said they were two brothers, and he seemed very anxious to have them taken into custody—he gave me a list of the articles that had been taken, and I wrote down the list as he stated it—(<hi rend="italic">letter read</hi>)—"Mr. Henry Ruff,—I wish to see you on Sunday morning particularly, when I go for the milk, at seven or a quarter past seven o'clock—my father is coming to meet me, and I cannot come to year house in the morning—I will be sure to come in the afternoon—I have five wine-glasses, and one pair of glass salts, which were in for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—bring me half-a-crown in the morning—I hope you will be sure and come at that time, or else I shall be found out.

On the 19th of May, between ten and eleven o'clock, a young man came and gave me a note to take to mistress, while I was cleaning the steps—I asked him if there was any name, because we have got lodgers—he said, "No, no name, it is only for Mrs., No. 11"—I took it up-stairs to a lady, leaving him on the steps, and when I came back he was gone—about ten minutes afterwards, I missed a clock which had hung in the passage—I had seen it there half an hour before—nobody else had been to the house—I saw the prisoner at the office a few days afterwards, and am sure he is the young man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Engley—he lives at Rother<lb/>hithe-wall now, with my daughter. We left the Castle public-house, which we kept, on the 8th of December last—the prisoner was neighbour and customer, and used to come backwards and forwards two or three times a day—we were in great difficulties, and I got her to pledge some sheeting and some table-linen, and other things—I have found means since them to take them out, and found that a number of them were changed, and inferior things put in, which had her name on instead of mine, this led me to think that she had other things of mine, as I had lost a great many—her husband had come to my house, but he never came except to the tap-room or bar—she has been in our private apartments—a great many things were found at her house belonging to me—I went and spoke to her, and told her if she would give up my things I would say nothing about it—she denied having any things of mine—she said she had nothing at all belonging to me—all these things found in her house are mine—here are four pictures, framed and glazed, one shawl, one blanket, one decanter-stand, some knives and forks, five scale-beams, three umbrellas, five brass cocks, one dark lantern, one tea-tray, two sheets, one night-gown, one apron, five table-clothes, two silk handkerchiefs, three napkins, my husband's set of razors, two German silver spoons, my spectacles, and some other things—none of these were delivered to her to pawn—they were all stolen—they were found on the floor floor at her house, locked up in drawers—the picture and all the</p>

               <p>things—I had not authorized her, when we were in distress, to remove any of these for safe custody—they were taken from time to time without my knowledge—I have discharged one servant through it, though I have since given her a good character—the prisoner was constantly coming as a friend and had free access up and down stairs.</p>

The prisoner Dowdall is my daughter—I left her at the home alone on Friday, the 27th of May, when I went out at half-past six o'clock in the morning to go to work at Highbury-place—I expected her to remain in my house and take care of the things—I came back at nine o'clock at night and found the door locked—I got in the back way and missed all the things stated—in consequence of information, I went first to a house in Britannia-row, and from there to a house near Shoreditch church—I found the property and the three prisoners at the house near Shoreditch church on the Sunday about twelve o'clock—they had taken the back-parlour there, and were all together—there was another little girl with them, but she was liberated—Walter had a frock and a pair of stockings of mine on, when I found them, and I think Frost has my gown on now—I asked my daugh<lb/>ter to help me to pack up my things, which she did—she has been a good girl till she was led away by these other two.</p>

On the 6th of June, I went to the house where the prisoner lives—I gave her the message that Mrs. Carden gave me, which was, that she had seen a shift in her box the preceding night, that she thought belonged to Mrs. Church, and wished me to take it to her—the prisoner went to her box, took out this shift, and gave it to me—she said "You may take it to Mrs. Carden, but it is my own—you are quire welcome to take it"—I saw that the mark had been picked out—there had been a little "C" which had been picked out—the mark of the red cotton was still there—there was enough left to show that a "C" had been there—it is a stout linen shift—she did not tell me where she got it from, nor say that Mrs. Donog<lb/>hue had given it her.</p>

On Thursday, the 26th of May, my money was locked in my box—I left the prisoner in the room for two minutes by himself, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning—I came up again and went down again—the prisoner left the house before me—he had time to open the box—I missed my money about an hour afterwards—nobody else had been in the room—I found one things broken off the box, and the sixteen shillings and four sixpence taken—he did not return to the lodging—I met him in Club-row on the Sunday morning, and asked how he came to take my money—he said he had not—I asked him how he came to take the best of his kit (meaning his tools)away—he said, "If you won't hurt me, Bill, I will tell you"—I said I would not hurt him, but at last gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Tytherly, who is employed in the surgery at King's College—we live in Pitt-street, Fitz<lb/>ory-street. On the 23rd of May I was at Greenwich Fair, and lost my purse, containing two half-crowns, and one shilling—I think it was be<lb/>tween six and seven o'clock in the evening, but I am not exactly certain of the time—I was walking with my husband, and coming through the fair, leaning on his arm—I felt somebody annoying me through the fair, and saw three young men behind me—I thought they were countrymen and did it more from ignorance than any thing—when we stopped they stopped—soon after we got into a terrible crowd, I felt a pressure and looked round—I saw the same three young men, and said to my husband, "These <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> annoy me so I cannot put up with it any longer"—he said, "They have not picked you pocket have they?"—I felt, and said my purse was gone—he run after them—the prisoner was one of them—I saw no more of my husband till he came home—my purse has since been produced by the officer.</p>

On the 21st of May, I was in the Eight Bells there—I had been in the house but two or three minutes—I went in between two and three o'clock in the morning—a man challenged me to fight—he broke the glass I had with some bran day and water in it—there was no place to sit down—I took off my coat and lost it, but I do not know who took it—I put it on the counter of the bar—we did not fight—the man ran away, and I ran after him—it was not the prisoner but another man that wanted to fight me—I missed the coat before he ran away, and I suspected he was connected with the parties who were there—there were seven or eight persons standing together when I went in—they appeared to be conversing about different subjects.</p>

I pray you leave me alone—I don't want to play with you"—they laughed, and said many disagreeable words, and squeezed my legs—I complained many times, but it was useless—they did not understand—during that time we had passed one gate, where the carriage paid the duty—they stopped at that time, and then went on again—I called the carter to stop the cart—he said nothing—he smoked his pipe, and I knocked him—he was sleepy all the night—he says, "That is very bad; you make very bad manners with that gentlemen"—then I get over the cart to go and get my portmanteau—he would not let me have it—I said, "You must let me have it"—I cannot tell the precise time when I lost my skewers—it was about one o'clock in the morning—the two prisoners were by me when I lost them—they did not push me before they left—I suppose they came to London—they stopped till I got down, but I stopped about half-road—I got my hat and port<lb/>manteau, and went to find the policeman—Stone's hand was on any pocket to get my watch out, but the skewers taken before that—I was sensible they were taken from me—Stone took them, I am certain—when they were out I was much more comfortable—I was not so squeezed—the other prisoner knocked my head to give him facility—I was not knocked at all before the skewers were taken—I was squeezed before I felt them go.</p>
