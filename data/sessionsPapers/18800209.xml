Lovett's clerk said "Have nothing to do with him, as we have the matter in hand let him settle with us, he has nothing to settle with you"—I told him not to come any more into my office, and he went away—I believe the 31st December was the day fixed upon for hearing the debtor's summons before Mr. Register Hazlitt at the Bankruptcy Court—I was present at the hearing—after I told my claim the prisoner was called, and said "I don't own Mr. Kos<lb/>minski Anything, I have got a note of settlement"—I can't say who Actually produced the document, I think it was produced by himself (<hi rend="italic">Read, marked C:</hi> "8th December, 1879.

               <p>Barnard had the abstract of title of my cottages—I went with the prisoner to Mr. Barnard—he did not know further than that it was a straightforward transaction—he called Mr. Dixon to his office and said "I give you a deposit to buy these cottages, the business will be transacted, and in a fort-night or three weeks you shall have your money"—Mr. Dixon went to the bank and took up the bill on that condition; but it was merely a sham, nobody ever had a loss on it; that was the whole transaction—the date of it was in April, 1879—Mr. Dixon did not at any interview with me and Robshaw tell me that he believed that the cottages I had contracted to sell did not belong to me at all; nothing of the kind—I did not agree to give Robshaw 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in consideration of the fictitious sale of the cottages; I wear that. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just listen to this, this is a letter that you have already admitted is your signature: "June 30, 1879.

Meyers, wholesale furriers—I believe I paid for that with the two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes which the prisoner gave me—an applica<lb/>tion was made by Mr. Lee, the defendant's solicitor, to Messrs.

I am a solicitor of the High Court, and have been so 12 years, and before that for many years in the profession—I carry on my profession in King William Street, City—I had acted for Mr. Kosminski previous to the 4th or 5th of December, 1879, for perhaps a month, not more—I received instructions from him to recover a debt from Robshaw—my first step was the letter of 5th December—I was then supplied with the details, upon which I wrote—I think I claimed something like 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think a writ was the next thing—that was dated 8th December—the summons in Bankruptey, I think, was a few days afterwards—I saw Robshaw at my office for the first time, I think, on 13th December—I had previously had placed in my hands by Kosminski the document marked A—at the same time he brought one of the bills; I think the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—that was the day before, on the Friday—at that time the ink erasure of the name was on the face of the white paper—it is not true that I scored it out; it was scored out when first brought to me—it was brought to me on the 12th, and on the 13th I had these papers in my possession—Robshaw came in and said he had come to see if he could settle the differences between himself and Kosminski—I said "I hope we can," and I immediately took up these papers and asked him what the moneys were—he said that he had suggested or arranged with Kosminski to accept two bills of exchange which he had given him, alluding to the bills of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash in settlement of his claim of 1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said "Are these good bills?"—he said "I suppose so"—I said "I suppose, then, you would have no objection to endorse them?"—he said "Oh, yes, I have a very great objection"—I said "If they are good bills why object to endorse them?"—he said "Well, I do object"—he said "Very well, then, I am afraid you will have to fund some better bills than these, and likewise some more cash"—he said "No, this is all the cash I can spare"—I then advised him to see Kosminski with a view to make better terms, and he left—I don't think I saw Kosminski on that day at all—he may have been in the outer office—I don't remember seeing him—this conversation took place with Robshaw alone—on Wednesday, the 17th, Robshaw came again with Kosminski—the papers were still in my</p>

I am Mr. Robshaw's clerk—he and Mr. Kosminski were friends—I have written 50 or 60 letters for Mr. Robshaw—the body of document C is in my writing—it was written on the day it bears date, 8th December, in Mr. Robshaw's office, and in his brother's presence—there was no signature to it at the time it was written—document B was also written by me; it was perfectly plain, except the heading, before I began to write on it; it is on a billhead, a memorandum form—when I had written it I handed it to the defendant, who left the office with it, and when I saw it again it had Mr. Kosminski's signature to it—I was not present when the receipt was signed—on 13th December I called at Kosminski's office with Mr. Robshaw, who said "Will you give me the receipt you signed in my office on 11th December?"—he said "I have not got it, my solicitor has it, and if you want it you will have to go to him for it"—Robshaw said "Will you give me the receipt for the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash which I paid you?"—Kosminski said "I have received it, but I shall give you nothing until I see my solicitor"—an altercation ensued, and I left the room—I waited outside some time, as there was a tremendous row between Robshaw and Kosminski, but the door was closed and I could not hear what it was about—Mr. Robshaw had to my knowledge a claim against Kosminski for goods delivered not to sample—I have not heard that discussed between them; I know it as Robshaw's clerk.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in West Street, Bromley, and am cashier at the head office of the Union Bank, Princes Street—at about 1.30 on 7th January the prisoner and another man came into the bank—the prisoner presented this bill for payment (<hi rend="italic">This was dated October</hi> 28, 1879, <hi rend="italic">for</hi> 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">at two months after date, to the order of Edward Raby, Esq. Accepted. Payable at the Union Bank of London. Fruhling and Goschen. Endorsed, E. Raby</hi>)—we have no customers named Fruhling and Goschen—I had no authority to pay it—I communicated with the chief cashier, and he sent me to Fruhling and Goschen—subsequently a constable was called in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have a fellow-clerk in the bank named Nathaniel G. Dodworth—I believe the prisoner came two days before to the bank with Parrot—on 7th January they came two days before to the bank with Lewis at the Mansion House withdrew the case against Parrot, and he was discharged—when the prisoner handed me the bill I said. "What a moment and I shall be able to attend to your bill"—I was attending to some gentle<lb/>man who had presented a cheque—the chief cashier asked him into the private parlour, and they waited about an hour while we were making inquiries—then a constable was brought in, and they were given in custody—I have seen a good many bills—this bill is drawn in a usual form for a Foreign merchant—it would be my business before paying it to see that it had a foreign bill stamp on, and had it been genuine I should have returned</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188002090033"/>
               <p>it for a stamp—I have frequently seen them presented without a stamp, and have returned them—I cannot say whether it is in foreign writing or not—there is a certain difference between English and foreign writing—it is not a thing I could speak positively to.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It would be useless to present a bill that was not an ordinary formal document—my suspicions would be aroused at once—I saw it was wrong directly—there was no opportunity for the prisoner to escape. Alexander H. Goschen. I am a member of the firm of Fruhling and Goschen, bankers and merchants, of 12, Austin Friars—the signature to this bill is not ours, nor was it written with our authority—the drawers are correspondents of ours—they do not as a rule draw on us for large amounts.</p>

I was called to the Union Bank on 7th January, where I saw the prisoner—I said, "This bill for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is a forged bill"—he said, "I got it over a net; I had a big net with a man named Schlotte; I bet him four monkeys to one about Bagman for the Cambridge, and I afterwards had 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to draw of Schlotte. I saw him one day at the Criterion and ho gave me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he afterwards sent me this bill and another bill for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," which he produced, "as payment for the other 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. He sent them with this letter," handing it to me—I said, "Have you the envelope in which the letter came?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Did you acknowledge the receipt of it?" and he said "No"—I asked him where Schlotte could be found, and he said he did not know—he said "I called at the bank the day before yesterday and asked if Fruhling and Goschen kept an account there, and I was told they did not"—I took him to the Old Jewry police office and told him he would be charged with uttering this bill knowing it to be forged—I understand by "monkey" 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—if he had lost he would have had to give the other man 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">The letter was addressed to Edward Baby, Esq.</hi>, 2, <hi rend="italic">York Terraes, London, from E.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was not after the prisoner's committal that I received that letter from the German consul in consequence of a communication made to him—it was after his arrest—Parrot said he had simply come with the</p>

               <p>prisoner to cash the bill because he owed him some money; but previously he had been to his solicitor, and he advised him to present it—I don't think he said in company with Raby—he said he went the day before yesterday to the bank to ask if Fruhling and Co. kept an account there—he did not say that Raby put his name on the bill—one of the prisoners said that Mrs. Parrot had been to Fruhling and Goschen's to make inquiries, as she could speak German.</p>
               <p>——<hi rend="smallCaps">LUNAU</hi>. I am managing clerk to Messrs. Kleinwort and Co., of Fenchurch Street—this bill for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., purporting to be an acceptance of my employers, is a forgery.</p>

I arrested the prisoner on 29th January at 42, Cheapside, where he was that day employed as jobbing porter—I charged him with obtaining goods from messrs. Cook, Son, and Co. by false pretences—he said, "I did go for some goods for a man who asked me to go for them and to sign his name as John Howell; I don't know who that is"—I took him to station, and he made no answer to the charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was called off the porters' stand at Milk Street by a gentleman who said his name was John howell. He asked me if I was a porter. I told him "Yes." He said, "if you will come with me I will give you a job." We went across Cheapside and Bread Street, and he said, "I want you to go into Cook, Son, and Co.'s and get for me seven pieces of George Walton's linsey cloth." I said, "I shall want an order." He said, "Not if you use my name and sign sign in my name," They gave me the goods, and I took them to the corner of Cannon Street, where he was waiting, and he gave me a shilling. That is all I know of the goods. I have been thirty years in the City of London as porter and packer, and have never been in trouble before.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 12, Boswwell Court, Bloomsbury, and am a blind-maker—on Saturday morning, 10th January, between 5 and 10 minutes past 10, I went to the Italian Church, Hatton Garden—after I had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188002090037"/>
               <p>been ther about ten minutes I saw the prisoner—I did not know him before—I went into the church to worship—I was kneeling—the prisoner entered from the Clerkenwell Road entrance—he had his hat on—he did not take it off—he looked sound booth sides—he then looked round the top pillar on that side towards the altar to see if the priest was there—he then went towards the middle of the altar, turned round to the people and said. "All you go away," or "go out"—he was just before the center of the opening, below the steps—I then saw him fire a pistol—Father Bakanowaki was the pries standing at the altar—he was standing in the middle of the altar, with his face toward it, and his back to the prisoner—I saw the pistol in the prisoner's hand, and saw the smoke come out of it—he pre<lb/>sented the pistol at the priest—from the front of the altar where he stood to where the priest was, I should say was from 16 to 18 feet—he then went up the steps of the altar and fired again in the same direction, to the altar or the priest, only slightly towards the right-hand side—he was siming at the altar or the priest when he fired the second shot—he then fired a third shor, but where he was then, at what distance from the altar, I can't tell—Irushed up to the rail, looked round to see whether I could see the priest—the priest had moved from there—I did not see him on the altar, but looking round I saw him escape on the left-hand side—I did not go up to the altar—I went up to the rail by the pillar, and looking towards the altar I saw the priest turn round to the left-hand side and he ran down the steps towards the door—I then saw the prisoner on the altar steps close to the altar, standing in front of it, fire again towards the direction of the door by which the priest escaped—that is the Back Hill door—The priest was still visible when the shot was fired—he was escapring through the door—I turned my head towards the door in Clerkenwell Road to call for assistance, and I heard another shot—I did not see that fired—I then heard a noise as if there was a hammering, and I went back to the church after hallooing at the door, and saw the prisoner trying to break in the tabernsele door, and I saw him throw the candlesticks and candles about, and he put his hand in the tabernacle and threw something on his right-hand side, what, I could not see—there were two candlesticks alight on the altar—the chalice and the Host are kept in the tabernsele—I did not see what he did at the tabernacle—the first three shots were fired almost instantly, one after the other—the other two might have been about a minute afterwards, they were fired almost instantly, the one after the other—I than saw the prisoner go as if to jump on the altar with his knee so as to get a rise, to pull down the things—I then ran to the door, and screamed for help—on coming back I saw the prisoner by the side of the altar—I looked round the church to see if I could find anything to hit him with, or to aim at him, but not finding anything I went and hallooed at him to came down—I wa then about 18 feet from him—I was standing by the altar rail—he turned round and held the pistol at me, and said, "You go away"—he said that in English—he seemed to aim towards me, as I thought, and I ran to the Clerkenwell door—I then saw that he had a dagger in his left hand—them were two police and some bystanders, labourers and others, coming through the opening of the door—I pointed him out on the altar—we retired a few steps back beyond the pillar, when we saw the prisoner come down the steps from the altra into the middle of the body of the church</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188002090038"/>
               <p>and go along, and syddenly he stopped before a gentleman, who I did not notice before, and the gentleman suddenly laid hold of him, and then there was a rush made, and he was seized—I saw the pistol and dagger wrenched from him—he struggled hard to hold the dagger—I never saw him before that morning—I could not tell whether he was sober—he seemed sober from the manner in which he spoke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw him enter the door of the church with his hat on—he looked round, and walked deliberately enough and quietly—I was certainly very much surprised to see him walk into the church with his hat on—I did not see the pistol in his hand at that time—the first shot was fired almost within the middle of the altar—I certainly was under the impression that he did not fire at the priest I don't know what he fired at—it was not partly my impression that he fired to frighten people, without intending to do any harm—when the second shot was fired the prisoner was standing on the steps of the altar, inside the rail; I mean the sanctary steps, the steps leading up to the altar rails—I did not see the priest come down the steps and pass the prisoner—I take it the prisoner was behind the altar when the priest escaped, as I did not see the prisoner was behind the the priest, he might have followed him—I did not see the priest go round the altar; I saw him come from the left-hand side—in order to get behind the altar the prisoner must have passed the place where the priest was standing at the time he was fired at first—I did not see the priest when the third shot was fired.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Gloucester Street, Bloomsbury—I am not in any business—on Saturday morning, 10th January, I was at the Italian Church, Hatton Garden; I was there at the 9 o'clock service, and I waited for the 10 o'clock service—I saw the prisoner there; he came to round at the altar a few seconds; he did not come into the church; he was in at the door, and he looked round at the altar and round the church; he looked retired, and I did not see him for a quarter of an hour—I did not see where he went—there was no service going on at that time, and no prient at the altar—I was about the centre of the church—in about five minutes Father Bakanowski came to the altar, and commenced the service; after the service had been going on about 10 minutes the prisoner again came to the same door, and looked in in the same manner as before, to the alter and round the church; he then came in with his hat on, came scross by the altar rail, and ascended to steps in front of the high altar, and fired at the priest, who was on the altar, with his back towards him—Father baks<lb/>nowski was the only priest there—I saw the pistol in the prisoner's hand, and I saw him point it direct at him at the top of the steps—he was about six or seven yards from him, perhaps it might not be quite so much, it is merely a rough guess—the priest did not turn round instantaneously; he turned round in about a few seconds, and saw the prisoner coming towards him with the pistol in his hand; he came down the steps to go round the back the prisoner fired again at him—the priest went round the back of the altar to the right, and there the prisoner fired again, but I did not see that shot fired; I heard it—the priest then came round to the other end of the</p>

               <p>alter, the left, and crossed over in front of the alter, and then the prisoner fired again at him—I saw that shot fired; I saw Nos. 1, 2, and 4, but not 3; I think there was a fifth shot, but I won't be certain of that; the priest was then crossing the front of the alter, and he went into the sacristy; That was the last shot I saw fired—I should not think it was above a minute or a minute and a half from the time the first shot was fired to the priest making his exit into the sacristy—than saw the prisoner ascend the alter where the priest had been officiating, and take one of the candlesticks off the altar, and light one end of the altar cloth, and then go to the other and light the other—he then went with the candlestick reversed in his hand, went to the tabernacle door and broke it in—I then left the church for assistance, and when I came back he was in the hands of the police—I did not see the prisoner before that morning—he seemed to come along rationally enough, only he seemed to forget himself, coming with his hat on—I did not see anything more particular about him.</p>

I am one of the priests at the Italian Church, Hatton Garden—on Saturday morning, 10th January, I went to The alter for the purpose of performing service; it was a few minutes past 10 when I commenced—I came from the sacristy door, and went to the Front part of the alter—I had been there about 10 or 12 minutes; I was alone, and my servant behind me—I heard a shot, and there was imme<lb/>diately a great noise—I was standing facing the altar, with my back to the congregation—I immediately turned to the people to see what it was—I then saw the prisoner with his arm directed at me, with a pistol in his hand—I think he was 16 or 17 feet from me—I went to the sacristy and tried the door, but it was closed—I ran behind the alter; I heard the prisoner follow me; I did not see him, but I heard him follow me, and then I came again before the altar and went to the sacristy door; no, the door going to Back Hill, and then I escaped—I can't say how many shots I heard, because I was so excited—I heard one first, and afterwards, when I went to the sacristy door, there were three, four, or five shots fired, I don't remember, only I heard shots, and I escaped and left the church; always I heard the shots, about how many I can't say—when I first went to the sacristy door my attendant had gone through the door; he had fastened the door—I do not know the prisoner—I had never seen him before that morning.</p>

I am one of the priests of the Italian Church, Hatton Garden—on Saturday morning, 10th January, I was in a room over the sacristy—some time after 10 I heard several shots fired and a ringing of the bell—I did not come down at once because I did not understand the meaning of the ringing of the bell—shortly affterwards some men came up, and I went down and went through the sacristy door into the church: that was two or three minutes after I heard the shots fired, perhaps less—as I came into the church I met the prisoner coming towards me on the sanc<lb/>turary—I did not notice anything in his hand immediately, because he kept his hands down—when he got within 4 feet of me he presented a revolver in my face; I reppidly bent my head and sprang over the altar rail and made my way into the centre of the church, and on turning round I saw the altar cloth in flames, and the prisoner throwing right and left the candelabras and candlesticks and the decorations of the alter, and shouting to himself—he them made his way behind the altar, ascended some steps behind the altar,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188002090040"/>
               <p>and threw down one of the large iron candlesticks, smashing it to pieces, and the golden throne or stand to put the Host on for benediction—I cried out to a body of ten or twelve men and two policemen standing inside the Clerkenwell Road door—I called out to them to go in a body to put out the flames to save the church—they did not stir—when the prisoner threw down the massive iron candlestick and the throne, it made a gap in the decorations so that he could see in the body of the church, so he must have seen me standing alone in the church—he at once left the work of demolition and made his way to me, holding something in both his hands—I went forward to meet him, and on a nearer approach I saw the revolver in his right hand, but the black handle of the knife being held downwards I thought it might be another revolver—the blade was up the sleeve—I went forward, and when I got within about 2 feet of him I seized him by both wrists, and afterwards I saw the knife—he struggled very violently with the left hand, which held the knife—I held his cuffs—a woman, the housekeeper, came to my assistance—I could scarcely hold him any longer—she caught his arm and screamed, and then the crowd came forward, and the prisoner was secured, and the revolver and dagger were taken from him—I had never seen him before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—I remember seeing the prisoner on the 6th of January last at 39, Great Portland Street, at 1 o'clock—he said, "I called to ask you if you received a letter that</p>

               <p>I left on Saturday"—I said, "I have received two or three letters"—he said, "It was enclosed in one of Mr. Cooper's envelopes"—he said he had come from Mr. Cooper, of 39, Great Castle Street—I said "I have never received that," meaning the one enclosed in a second envelope—he said, "I have called and am most anxious about the letter"—I said, "At what hour did you leave the letter?"—he said, "At half-past two; I had knocked three times at the door, and being in a great hurry and receiving no answer I gave it to a woman who said she was coming into the house"—I said, "It would be impossible for any one to knock three times without receiving an answer"—he said, "Not I, but the woman told me she had knocked"—I said, "I will go and see Mr. Cooper, of 39, Castle Street, and see if he can tell me whom the letter came from"—I then said, "Can you tell me if it was a pink embossed stamp on the letter"—my husband was in the habit of receiving letters from his father at Norwood which were enclosed in an envelope with a pink embossed stamp—I never saw one without—the prisoner said "No, but if it will assist you at all the post mark was S.E."—I said, "That is the letter, that contains money"—he said "I hope not"—I rang for my servant, Sarch Hallett, and asked her in the prisoner's presence if she had received a letter—she said "No"—I then said to the prisoner, "Have you given the letter to an utter stranger at the door and not seen her come into the house?"—he said, "I have, that is why I called"—I said "The cheque had better be stopped at the bank"—the prisoner said, "Mr. Cooper had better go at once and stop the cheque"—on the Saturday afternoon referred to there was no one in the house besides myself, Sarah Hallett, and a charwoman named Jane Buckingham—my assistants had gone for the day—the servant has been employed in the family four years and the charwoman three—a person could not have being heard—between 9 and 10 the usual businesss was going on, but the house was very quiet and a knock must have been heard—I was at house then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Persons have knocked at my door twice before being answered, but not several times—I am a wholesale dressmaker—my business is not at the top of the house—my husband is a costumier, and assists in the business—I told the prisoner I expected a letter from over the water, but I did not say it would be a pink embossed stamp and would come from over the water—he mentioned the S.E. postmark before I told him I expected a lesster from over the water—the conversation did not occur in the order nor in the sense you put it—the prisoner did not say after my mentioning that I expected a letter from over the water, "If it would be of any assistance to you it would have an S. E. postmark"—my husband was not at home—I have not seen the letter purporting to accompany the cheque—ladies do call at my house on business, but not many.</p>

I am Chief Clerk at the Clerkenwell Police-court—On Saturday, 27th December, I went with the Magistrate, Mr. Hosack, to The Great Northern Hospital—the inspector of police was there, and the prisoner—the deceased, Milcha Boyce, was in bed in the hospital, in a room by herself—the Magistrate asked her evidence—it was read over, and she assented her—I took down her face was visible, and only part of that; her hands were bound to her sides, and she was not able to move—she had some difficulty in giving her evidence—we were a long time in taking it—she spoke in a very low voice—she was parched, and constantly calling for water, and the room was very offensive.</p>

My husband was not at home then; he came home, I think, about 11 o'clock; he was very drunk. He got swearing; he wanted something neat, and I said 'You must give me some money, as I have not got any'. He said 'I don't intend to give you any.' I said 'Jaw to yourself while I wash my face.' He kept on jawing, and I went down stairs, and I was running down the stairs and I saw him take up the lamp off the coal-box outside the room. I don't know whether he knocked it off the coal-box or threw it at me, but the paraffin came all over me, and I was at once all on fire. I ran on into the passage, and I don't know who came to my assistance."</p>

I had had some drink; I was neither drunk nor sober. I lit the lamp, and put it on the box out<lb/>side the room. When I was asked who had done it—set me on fire—I said 'I think Jack has done it,' meaning my husband. He had been in bad before I left the room. I did not see him get out of bed. I am almost positive I did not knock the lamp over myself. I cannot tell whether I saw my husband come out on the landing or not, I was so excited. I did tell my daughter Alice that I did not know how it was done."</p>

I am a sailor, a Russian Fin—on 20th January I was living at a boarding-house in High Street, Shadwell—about 12.30 that night I was going with a girl—I met the two prisoners; Hurley caught hold of me by the throat, and Murphy put his hand in my right trousers pocket, and took out my purse, containing 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I struck them and knocked them down, and picked up my purse from the ground, but the money was gone—the prisoners got up and ran away—I had had my purse and money safe about five minutes before—I ran after them, and came up to Murphy; the policeman had hold of him—I did not lose sight of them; I am quite sure they are the men—I was quite sober—I had a knife in my pocket; I did not take it out or use it.</p>

Between 12 and 1 o'clock on the morning of 21st January I heard a disturbance in Cable Street, and saw the prisoners in Antony Street; Hurley was at the corner of Cornwall Street—I did not know him before—he said that he would give the prose<lb/>cutor, who came up with Murphy, in custody for stabbing Murphy—I could not understand the prosecutor—I asked him if he had a knife; he said "No," as I understood, and slipped a knife inside his trousers, which fell on the ground closed—there was blood on Murphy's eye, which appeared rather like the cut of a knife—Hurley was urging Murphy to give him in custody for stabbing him, and the prosecutor was trying to explain some<lb/>thing all the time, but I could not understand him, and Murphy said that he would not charge him—the prosecutor took his purse out of his pocket and threw it on the ground, and by signs explained to me how he had been robbed; I thought he meant that 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was taken—I took Hurley in custody—Murphy had gone away—I wrote this down afterwards; Hurley said "I should not remain here and talk to you if I had done it"—Brown and I went to the Great Eastern Chambers, which is a common lodging-house, and took Murphy in custody there—Hurley said to him at the station "Through being in your company I have got into this"—Murphy made no answer, and they were both locked up—the prosecutor appeared quite sober.</p>

I came up to where the last witness was—Hurley was there talking to the prosecutor, and Murphy came up a second or two afterwards—Hurley said "Give him in charge, George, for stabbing you"—Murphy said "No, I will forgive him," and went away—the prosecutor then complained, in Hurley's presence, of losing 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—as well as I could understand him, he said "These two men came up, Hurley caught me by the back of the neck, and Murphy put his hands in my pockets, and took my purse out and my 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he said that he picked the purse up off the ground—I did not see it thrown on the ground—he did not show it till we got to the station—I went with Robert Brown to Great Eastern Chambers, took Murphy, and told him the sailor charged him with the other man of robbing him of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said "Why should not he forgive me for robbing him, when I forgave him for stabbing me?"</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The prosecutor said that he had no knife, but the police<lb/>man picked the knife up at the same time—I wrote this as soon as I got to the station, and it has been filed there ever since—I have not read it through.</p>

He shut up the knife when he saw the constable." Murphy says: "I have got nothing to say. What the prosecutor says is false. I want my witnesses to prove that the prosecutor was blind drunk."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Murphy in his defence stated that the prosecutor, who was with a girl, pushed against him, and he said "what are you doing?" and the pro<lb/>secutor pulled out a knife and cut him across the eye, which bled a. great deal, but he could not say whether the knife was open or shut. That he went to the station with the policeman, thinking he was wanted to charge the pro<lb/>secutor, but denied saying anything about forgiving him for robbing him. Hurley stated that the prosecutor was telling lies to save himself from being locked up, and that he had never been locked up before.</hi>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Sidney Road—in September last I put an advertisement in the papers—I had saved about 120?. in twenty years, and in answer I received a letter enclosing a card, and I went down and saw the prisoner at 23, Cadogan Terrace, Victoria Park; he said "I am a manufacturing chemist and M.D. as well, and for many years past I have been carrying on the business of a manufacturing chemist in Berlin, but having a wish to live in England I have sold the business and premises which were mine, with the stipulation that the machinery remains, and it will be forwarded to England shortly; I want an energetic young man like you, an Englishman, to assist me in working up a business in London; I have discovered a machine for making butterine from vegetable oil, a perfectly wholesome compound, scarcely distinguishable from butter"—that he had patented that method and sold it to the authorities at Frankfort, but the patent did not extend to England; he said "I also hold a certificate of merit for my manufacture of Eau de Cologne," and showed it to me, it was not in English—he also told me that he had discovered, after many years of study and immense cost, a luminous paint, which Mr. Bush had offered a good round sum for, and mentioned several other inventions, and told me that he had made a great deal of money by his business in Berlin, but had lost a great deal in buying Turkish Bonds, and since being in England his expenses had been very high, sometimes as much as 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day at the hotel, in consequence of which he wanted a temporary advance for about three weeks or so until he received the purchase money of this property at Berlin, 50,000 marks, and whatever was advanced he would repay—he showed me his furniture, which he said he had paid for, and he had been, put to a great expense in furnishing his house at Cadogan Terrace—he said it was his and was paid for—I told him I would think the matter over and let him know—he showed me the deed of purchase of the factory at Berlin, and translated it to me, but not at the first interview—he wanted me to advance him some money to help him over the temporary difficulties and to make samples before the purchase money arrived in England, and I told Fourth Session, 1879—80.</p>

               <p>him I would consider it and let him know—I went to see him next day and he was out—I said I would call again, but I think I wrote to him afterwards declining it—I then went to the North of England to my home and on 28th October I received this card. (<hi rend="italic">This was from the prisoner, making an appointment at his factory</hi>)—in consequence of that I went with my wife to 46, Osborne Road, Victoria Park, and saw the prisoner there, another young man, a German, and two little girls, who were labelling bottles of stuff of some kind—it is a four-roomed cottage with a warehouse at the back; one room was fitted up with shelves and glass bottles, empty, and up<lb/>stairs there were full bottles, and some empty boxes; some bottles were labelled "Eau de Cologne, double distilled, manufactured by Dr. Mellinger, of Cologne, on the Rhine"—the little girls were labelling them, and stamping them with wax J.M.—he gave me a sample bottle, which was pretty fair—it smelt of Eau de Cologne—he said that Mr. Bush had sent him 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods, and showed me the invoices, some of which were for essential oils—he said that Mr. Bush would take a large quantity of the manufactured articles, he buying the raw material from Bush, and that Cannon and Brown, of Windmill Street, had given him orders which he was then executing, and he showed me more stuff which was being sent out—he then said "You see your first decision was an unwise one," and that he did not like to owe any one money, and wanted an advance of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay for the goods from Bush, if I would agree to his terms, and as security he would make an assignment of the goods—he also said that he should want to have my name in conjunction with his, but did not want me to incur any responsibility, or advance any money whatever—he said "I have more money myself than I can use," and mentioned property in and near Berlin, in addition to the chemical works, and he said that the factory was at 22, Frederick Street, Berlin, as far as I remember the number—I did not advance him any money at this interview, but I saw him almost daily, and he took me and my wife from the factory to his house, and showed us the furniture, and said that it was his own—he subsequently offered me a bill of sale, and on the 4th of November I advanced him 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in two sums of 51. and 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he gave me this promissory note for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable 31 days after date, as he said that I could not have the money till he got it from Berlin—when I advanced him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the factory he gave me a sort of assignment of the goods there—I drew it up and he signed it—I know that it was not a legal instrument because it was not stamped, and therefore I did not preserve it—he wanted me near him, and about that time I' removed to Homerton to be near the factory—I afterwards advanced him other sums—I went a good deal to the factory, but did not do anything, as he would not let me interfere—on the 26th of November I advanced him 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making the amount 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he gave me the promissory note for 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he showed me a letter stating that 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been sent him from Germany to his bankers' agent in Thames Street, but said "I have hot the means even to go to the City for it"—I said "What have you done with the money you had from me?"—he said "I have not spent more than 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the business, but have had very heavy expenses, and it is all &amp;6ne," and he asked me to borrow 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of my brother, who was there messing about, but not working, and then he would get the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and hand me over half of it, which would carry me over the week, and on Monday I should have all—I borrowed the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the evening, and in the morning, as soon</p>

               <p>as the house was open, and a poor German gentleman stepped in and had a short conversation with the prisoner in German—the prisoner said "Give me that 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; this is my friend Dr. Saxe, of Norwood, and I am going with him to the City for the money"—I gave him the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., they left together, and he told me to take charge of the factory till he came back—he was away four or five hours, and when he came back I asked him for the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I was to receive—he said that awing to some irregularity he had not been able to get it, but was to have it to-morrow certain—I then complained bitterly about the way he was treating me and he pulled out a half-crown and a florin, and offered me the station with my brother, and saw him there, and said "What about my money? I think I am in a fair way of being swindled out of it"—he said "Oh, no, you shall be paid your money; you shall have your money"—I went to 25, Cadogan Terrace, and found that his wife and family had gone, and a constable was in possession of the house—a little time after that I obtained a warrant—I afterwards examined the Ean de Cologne at the factory, and found it to be methylated spirit in the bottles, and in some of them water—I have never been repaid a halfpenny—I lent him the money on the faith of his being a manufacturing chemist, and having sold this business in Berlin, for which he was to receive the money, and of his having machinery value 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was in transmission to England, to be put into the new factory, and because he said that he would guarantee that before a year was out I should receive good wages, not less than 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went to Mr. Ogle, my solicitor, on the 28th of November, the day after the prisoner was locked up on a charge of indecent assault—I went and swore an information the same day—I was first examined by word of mouth in the presence of the prisoner and his solicitor—I do not know how I got the warrant, I was so excited over the loss of my money that I did not know what I did—I knew what I was talking about to my solicitor—my age is 36—I was a goal warder at Huntingdon three years, but that is ten years ago—my wife was allowed to live there—we have no family—I had a salary—I have not been a policeman, I have been a marble mason—I was never warder of a lunatic asylum—I was a photographer, but only for my own amusement—I know nothing about business—I can manage to write a letter, and make what I have to say intelligible—I was born of poor parents in Suffolk, and had to go to work in the fields at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and had no education whatever, I could neither read or write—I have had no education but what I gave myself—these three letters are in my writing at the prisoner's dictation—he did not tell me how to spell "opodeldoc," I knew—when I made my complaint I said that partnership was to be a thing of the future—he was to repay me my money, and give me the option of a partnership, but I was never to invest any money in the business, because he said he had plenty of his own—my brother sued him for wages in the Shoreditch County Court—I went into the witness box and said that no partnership existed between us, not that there had been no idea of one—I did not advertise that I wanted a partnership, but I expressed a desire to meet with somebody who would take me into partnership if it was proved to be sound—I said at the police-court that</p>

               <p>a certificate of merit for manufacturing Eau de Cologne was shown me—I heard the Magistrate discuss with Mr. Ogle whether it was a false pretence or not—Mr. Ogle asked me if I had money to bring witnesses from Berlin; I said "No, I am swindled out of every penny;" he said "Then you can<lb/>not put written evidence before the Court"—I found out Dr. Saxe when Mr. Ogle told me to do so—I did not mention him at the police-court—I don't remember whether I mentioned 22, Frederick Street at the police-court, I did if I was asked—what I said was read over to me—I just went into the factory every day, but I did not go up each day into the chambers—I did not stay there daily from morning to evening—I wrote down this inventory of the property, at his dictation, and thought it much too high, it came to 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw some of the articles (<hi rend="italic">This was a list of fixtures, chemicals, and other articles amounting to</hi> 89<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.)—this "idiotine" is Mellinger's name for iodine, you will see it so printed on the bottles—all the essences and essential oils were received afterwards—he asked me to draw the form of a bill of sale for him, but I never saw one in my life, and could not do such a thing—I drew an assignment of all this property to secure me the money, but as it was not stamped I thought it was no good, the promissory note covered it, and therefore I preserved the promissory note only, which I thought was as good as the assignment of the property—I also started on a draft deed of partner<lb/>ship, but it was never finished; I was going to submit it to him at the beginning of the new year, when he agreed that the partnership was to begin—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I swear, in the face of any number of witnesses, that this is the paper I produced at the police-court I got it from Mr. Ogle yesterday—it is my writing, but it is not all my composi<lb/>tion—he objected to it, as he said there were a lot of things which were quite unnecessary, and he would strike them out—I copied it from a form in "Beaton's Partnership," and altered it as I thought proper—I have got the original draft, but it is not here; the one I placed before him I took home and burnt—this is the one I produced at the police-court—my charge on the 5th of December was not obtaining 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I believed he would have both money and machinery—I told the Treasury that I had no funds—I did not know that Mr. Green had come from Berlin till I saw him at the police-court—I had seen Mr. Wontner and given him the general particulars—February 5 was not the first time I mentioned 22, Frederick Street and Lanberger Street, I mentioned them to Mr. Pollard at the Treasury—I do not remember being asked before the Magistrate whether he gave an address in Berlin, and saying that I could not remember—there may been an argument about it being of no use getting a witness from Berlin as I could not give the number of the house—I put the name of Hines and Mellinger on a piece of stone so that we should see the number—I do not know whether it is there now—I did not represent at the factory that I wanted, as partner, to buy a plot of land belonging to Mrs. Bates to erect a factory, but I heard Mellinger say so—I did not contradict it—I heard him tell two other gentlemen the same thing—I did not write a letter about it signed "Mellinger and Hines" to Mrs. Bates nor to her solicitors—the prisoner asked me to write some letters about it, one was to a gentleman named Swift, and I forget the named of the other—he told me to order labels to be</p>

               <p>printed in the name of Mellinger and Hines, and I did so, as he said that the partnership would be arranged, and I should get my money back—I was to become a partner, and have back all my money, and take half the profits of the business; I was to work up the business, and afterwards retire and receive nothing—I would have taken half if he would give it me, but I did not suppose he would—he said that if I proved energetic he would deal very liberally with me—I asked him if he would object to half, seeing that I was only to be in for a short time; he said that it should not exceed three years—I did not tell Miss Alice Bates that I was a partner of Dr. Mellinger's; I said that I wanted a house, and Dr. Mellinger sent me; I will swear I did not say, "I am a partner"—I ordered jointly with the prisoner a guinea's worth of these papers to be printed, to be in readiness for 1st January when the partnership was arranged—this is the 50,000 marks document which was shown to me—I received from the prisoner when he was in custody a little key of Mr. Moody's writing-desk—I did not go and take possession of all that was there when I found the police in possession of the private residence—I did not go to the factory and take possession—Mellinger gave the key to my brother in my presence just after I put a new lock on—my brother had the key of the factory all the time—I did not represent to the Country Court Judge that I had the key of the factory in my pocket—I have never threatened Mrs. Mellinger—I met her once in the street and she spoke to me—I did not say that I should be very glad to get back my money and did not care about punishing Mellinger, or that I liked him very much and did not want to see him punished; I could not say that after he had done me out of all my money—I did not say to her, "If you do not give me up your trinkets and jewellery I will have him sent to prison for seven years"—she speaks German and I English—I have said that it would be a greater punishment to me than it would be to him—I swear I do not remember using the pharse, "Seven years"—I did not write, or dictate, or cause the letter to be written to Mrs. Mellinger, nor did I know of it being written (<hi rend="italic">This was signed "Adam Shornfeldt</hi>")—my interference with her was just mentioned at the police-court, but I did not hear one word of reproof from the Magistrate—I had nothing to do with getting a box to pack her clothes to go abroad—Mellinger had his letters at his own house, and I never saw them—I remember nothing about a letter or a post-office order being sent for—I do not know whether the furniture was made in Berlin—as near as I remember only 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid to Kelner Brothers for goods—I did not buy them in Mellinger and Hine's name; I took a written order and paid an account—I did not represent myself as a partner to them—Maw supplied goods to the amount of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that is part of the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Adams, of 30, Bangor Street, Notting Hill—on Saturday night, 10th January, about half-past 11, I was coming from Acton from my work, and crossing Bangor Street I saw two women and a man standing at the corner—the prisoner was one of the women—I had my purse in my hand with 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—the prisoner caught hold of me and asked me whether I had any money—I said, "Money, no, 1</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant P</hi>). On Tuesday morning, 6th January, in company with Inspector Peel and another constable, I went to Bowling Green Lane, Clerkenwell, shortly after 5 o'clock, and watched No. 36—at 8.30 I saw the male prisoner at the bottom of Corporation Row—he was walking very sharply away from No. 36, and away from where we were standing; he must have passed us or come out of 36—I went after him, came up with him, and told him I should take him into custody—before I had time to say any more he said "You won't take me, God blind me, let me go;" I had taken hold of him—he became very violent, and tried to wrench himself from my grasp—he struggled for some time, and I was thrown down twice—he bit my thumb, and struck me in the face—I was nearly exhausted when Inspector Peel came to my assist—once, and the prisoner was taken to the station; he was very violent all the way—I searched him, and found on him 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, a small silver writing pen, and a watch-key—at the station Inspector Peel told him that he would be charged with breaking into a house in Westbourne Grove—he made no answer.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Inspector Peel was about 150 yards from me when I overtook the prisoner, out of sight—I was in plain clothes—I seized him by the collar of the coat; he struggled for about 10 minutes—Peel and the others were not sure he was the man, and I was not certain myself—he had no whiskers and moustache before that.</p>

I was in company with Mel<lb/>ville and the others, when I saw the prisoner stopped and taken—I and Miller went to 36, Bowling Green Lane—we knocked at the side door, a little girl opened it, and we went in; the parlour door was partially open, we went in and found the female prisoner in bed with a little child—Miller said I believe your name is Brown?" she said "It is not Brown; my name is Armstrong"—Miller said "We are police officers; your husband is in custody, and we are going to search the rooms"—I commenced searching a chest of drawers in the room, and in it under a dress I found this large Indian scarf shawl, which Mrs. Tufts has identified—I also found this diamond ring, which has been identified, in a bureau at the top of the same chest of drawers, and in the same drawer as the ring I found these two revolvers; one of the revolvers has a leather strap to it to fasten round the wrist—at the station I found two rings on the woman which have not been identified—I saw Sergeant Miller find in the room two dresses tied up in a white sheet on the couch; they have been identified—I also found another dress hanging behind the door, and two more lying on a chair, and the handsome blue silk in the bottom drawer, all of which Mrs. Tufts has identified—I also saw a quantity of other property found there, consisting of jewellery and other things, of which I have a list. (<hi rend="italic">This list contained a large quantity of property of various kinds, jewellery, clothing, &amp;c., also a jemmy and hammer combined</hi>, 68 <hi rend="italic">keys, a dark lantern, and other articles.</hi>) There were also two bottles of hair-dye.</p>

He is obliging and willing to work, and leaves me, as I am going abroad. Crab and Lobster, Ventnor, 23rd September, 1879. Up shall left me on 6th September last." On the faith of that letter I engaged him, about 30th September,. as butler at 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. year—I paid his wages quarterly, and his book for petty cash once a fortnight—tradesmen's bills were always paid by cheque sent by post—on 12th October I paid him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and on 15th October there was about 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. due to him—he remained in my service till 24th December, when I discharged him, with a month's wages, telling him that I should remain in the house till he left—I have never dealt with Aplin and Co. for wine, or authorised him to order any there—I never heard of it till some time after he left.</p>

I am 25 years old—I was working with my father at Brooker's Farm, at Stonewall, near Edenbridge, Kent—I left him just before Christmas—he has a machine of Clayton's; he goes round the country with it; I used to drive the engine—I have known Collins ever since I could run alone—he is a fanner and landowner—he had the Old Bannister Farm, and Mr. Diver holds a farm tinder him, and I hired one under him of about 35 acres last Michaelmas—I called that Bannister Bank Farm—there are some sheds and barns on it—I had no machine of my own, only the one of my father's, which I worked with—about 28th November I applied to the National Deposit Bank, Covent</p>

               <p>Garden for a loan, in consequence of an advertisement in a newspaper—I first wrote to the manager, Mr. Thompson—I saw Collins when I hired the farm, and told him I had no money to stock it with—I dare say I had got 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but I had got no pounds—I ask him if he would go up to the bank with me—he said he would, but he would not be no security, and would not put his hand to anything—I showed him the letter I received from the bank, and we went up to London—he paid for my train—we saw Mr. Cochrane, and I said "I have brought up this friend, who is my landlord"—I then asked Collins whether he had let me the farm, and he said "Yes, Bannister Bank Farm"—I told him I had got a machine and engine working, and I dare say he could have that for security, but no horses and nothing else—he said he would send a man down to inspect the engine—this is my signature, but there wornt so much wrote upon that when I signed it: I can tell you that—this is the letter I received from the bank. (<hi rend="italic">This was addressed to Messrs.

(<hi rend="italic">This stated that the engines and machines were all there, giving the numbers of several engines and elevators, and stating that four of them had no numbers.</hi>) I took that to the bank when I went with Collins—Mr. Cochrane asked me what we had got—I said that we had got a traction engine—he said "I will send a man down"—I had told Collins I wanted to borrow 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I wrote this letter produced—I did not show it to Collins, he never saw it. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Sir,—I have nothing to do with my brother now, he has paid me my part") I produced that at the bank, but not when Collins was there; it was the one which is dirty that I produced at the bank—all that Collins said at the bank was that he would not distrain on the engines for no rent—the manager asked him whether I had got the engines mentioned in this list, and he said "Yes"—the manager said that he wanted my brother's receipt—I said "I will very soon get it for you,' and I afterwards took up a receipt—Collins knew my brother—my brother never had no machines; he does not live in the same place—he Uvea four or five miles off—this was written by John Harris; I asked him to write it; it says: "George Killick paid William Killick his part belonging to him. Settled November 5, 1879"—I did not show that to Collins; he never saw it; what has it to do with Collins 1—he said "Has your brother got anything to do with it now?"—I said "No, he don't work for me"—he said "You can get his receipt then"—I said "Yes," and he asked my brother one day whether he had anything to do with it, and he said "No".</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the directors of the National Mercantile Bank, Covent Garden, which is registered as a limited company—this letter of December 2nd is my writing—I had seen Killick when he called previously, but had no conversation with him—he came again with Collins on the 12th, and brought my letter; he said "I have come up about the loan; I am unable to find sureties to guarantee the repayment of the money, but I have brought my landlord, Mr. Collins, who has let me a farm of 400 acres, and he can speak to my respect<lb/>ability, and also will tell you that the machines are my own"—I said "I require the receipts for the machines"—he said "I have no receipts, but the machines were left to me and my brother by my father, who died three years ago; since I applied for the loan I have paid my brother's share out that he has in the business, amounting to 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I should feel obliged if you will lend me 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the machinery and other effects that I have—I said to Collins "Is this correct?"—he said "Killick's father died three years ago, and I know the machines belonged to Killick, and to my know<lb/>ledge he paid his brother 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the half share of the business, and I am willing to be answerable that I shall not distrain on any of the machines for rent on the farm that I have let him, or on any other farms I have adjoining there; I have let Mr. Killick a farm of 400 acres; I have known him ever since he was a baby, and I wish to assist him"—with that information, and partly at Collins's dictation, I wrote this undertaking, and he signed it—I said "I shall not grant the loan to-day, for I require the brother's receipt for the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he received, also a letter from the brother stating that he has no further claim on the machinery"—Collins said "We must go and get the letter and the receipt which you require," and that Killick was to bring up an inventory of the machines, together with the numbers—on 18th December Killick came by himself and brought this inventory and a letter from his brother and the receipt—I asked him to make a statutory declaration, and he made it before Mr. Irving, and he also executed a bill of sale—350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was handed to him in bank notes and he went away—we have not received any of the money; it is not due yet—we have not received the interest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have prosecuted about four times, but have only con<lb/>victed once, the other cases never came on for trial—they were not settled, they satisfied Mr. Besley, our standing counsel, and that satisfied us—we brought an action in the Nottingham County Court two or three months ago—the case was lost, and I am appealing—it was not an action, it was merely a motion at the suit of Mr. Henry Isaacs, who is a shareholder in the bank—I was a witness for Isaacs—the Judge did not say, "The execution of the bill of sale has been obtained by conspiracy"—he de<lb/>cided that it was bad through want of consideration—Isaacs was simply the transferee, the innocent holder—the bank was registered on 23rd May, 1878—it is partly a money-lending office, but it is a registered bank, where cheques are issued—we have about 250 accounts with depositors, but hardly a dozen current accounts—there is about 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposited—the nominal capital is 500,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in 10,000 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. shares—I am the principal shareholder—I have 1,978 shares—I am not the bank—I have nothing to conceal—Isaacs has 40 shares—this is our prospectus—we discount good bills at 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent—this loan to Killick was at 20 per cent—the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the messenger to go down, was paid into the bank, and I should think the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I had made no demand whatever on Collins or on Killick—I know nothing about it, I simply went down to see the machines—the repayment was to spread over two years, at 20 per cent.—this hill of sale was read over to Killick by the solicitor who prepared it, and explained to him—we do business to the amount of half a million a year—we have from 5,000 to 6,000 clients, some of whom have been with us 10 or 15 years—I lost 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. over the matter at Nottingham; some one had given a bill of sale to another person, which he transferred to Isaacs, and the County Court Judge said it was not a legal document—Mr. Isaacs suffered the loss and has appealed—I was only a witness for him—I made inquiries at Edenbridge, in consequence of which I discharged Taylor.</p>

One ruby and diamond ring, 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—the defendant was frequently out of London on business—I cannot change my memory with his stating that his wife assisted him in the books—had the defendant said he was a bad bookkeeper I should not have believed him—I have no recollection of his doing so—I said before the Magistrate that the amount Harris was indebted to me at the commencement of the second proceedings was 2,651<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that is made up of the whole 2,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was due, and the amount since accrued—it was an error when I said I was simply proving for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—my books are correct, but the amount I was untitled to was settled by the solicitation on both sides, and it is more a matter of law than for me—I really cannot answer your question as to what Harris put me down a creditor for—the last dealing with him appears to 5th June, 1878, showing 166<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of new debt—that added to 2,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would make the</p>

I returned it on 30th May, 1878—that was the most expensive ring I hid from him—on the same day I returned with it an emerald and brilliant half-hoop price 34£—I remember his bringing me a ruby and brilliant ring, and a diamond ring value about 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I purchased the ruby and brilliant one, and returned him the other, which was a gipsy ring, three rubies and two brilliants—that was also on 30th May.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have had many dealings with him—transactions of that kind have gone on between us for four or five years—the person leaving rings with me leaves an approbation note, which is filed, and when a ring is returned an entry is made "returned approbation"—I remember giving back to Harris some cheap rings and lockets after 14th August, 1878, but I do not remember his questioning me about two rings then—he left on 27th August for the south of France—he was in the habit of taking jewellery to the Continent on approbation—I have a great many things entered on approbation, and two ruby and diamond rings among them, and a sapphire and ruby, and a sapphire and brilliant—they would answer this description—I will not pledge myself that two rings were not left by Harris, because other people in my establishment could receive goods from him—the two rings are sold which answer the same description, which we have only found out through Mr. Spire-no one has applied to me to return those rings to them—if you suggest that they were left with me by the debtor, I have no means of saying that that is not so, except that I have two rings answer<lb/>ing the same description which are in surplus-when we settled up my father's goods, we presumed that these were on approbation, and if we were asked we should not know which they were-we have searched and can</p>

I am an accountant, of Gresham Buildings—I was receiver under the proceedings against the defendant in August, 1878, and prepared the statement of his affairs from the instructions of Mr. Spire, his solicitor-Harris gave me a deficiency account; it is really a statement taken down from his mouth on the morning of the meeting—I have no copy of it—I gave it to the solicitor; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I heard the defendant questioned at the meeting, and he confirmed these items—I asked him to sign it, and he refused—I objected to sign it or to be responsible for it—I prepared it by his instructions by word of mouth, not from his books—I received certain of Harris's stock, which I locked up in the safe, and on 3rd February handed it to Mr. Garrett, the trustee, according to their inventory—this is his receipt for it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not object to this account to the defendant—I told him before the meeting that most likely the creditors would require him to give some particulars, and he gave me that—I did not analyses any of tile statements, but I can tell you about some of the items—after paying 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound off the actual amount, 11,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the odd sum was allowed for my costs-Mr. Garrett told us only to put down 1,438<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. because the debtor torn me Mr. Garrett would not prove for the whole amount, only for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—I paid tuck and Godfrey their composition myself, excepting the list bill—there is only 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. unpaid to them—if they are in the present account again, that is treating their debt as revived—the defendant estimates his household expenses for two and a half years at 260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, but from his examination at the Bankruptcy Court 360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be nearer the mark that mistake is against himself—I prepared this amended deficiency account (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which shows about 630<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. unaccounted for.

I had con<lb/>siderable difficulty in going through the books, as there were no account! with creditors, and therefore the whole lists had to be verified by getting accounts from each creditor—I attended at his place of business on 3rd September, 1878-Mr. Carter was present part of the time, Mr. Wilson part of the time, his clerk part of the time, and the defendant the whole of the time—I saw the stock given up with this inventory, and checked it with Mr. Wilkinson and Mr. Garrett; it agreed at that time with the inventory—I have been through it since, and it is in precisely the same condition—there was not with that stock the five rings and the pin men<lb/>tioned to-day—the defendant gave up a sold ledger; a day-book, a book for ordinary approbation goods, a pocket journey book for his travels, and an approbation book—I have been through the books from time to time, and cannot find any entry of the sale or disposal of these five rings, except the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. ring—I have made very careful search, and have had the trustees' assistance—there is an entry in the pocket journey book of the return of the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. ring by Mrs. Thomas on 16th August—the prisoner had no other single ring of so great a value as 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I have traced that ring as left on approbation with customers from time to time, within a fortnight of his having it from Mr. Garrett, on 7th April, 1877 it was first sent to Leeds on 24th April, 1877 ', being returned from there, it was sent to Hancock's, in Bond Street, on 8th August, 1877; then to Vassal, of Scarborough. on 4th September, 1877; next to Thomas, of Bond Street, on 17th February, 1878, and returned on 30th May I was present on 23rd May 1879, when the prisoner was questioned in Mr. Garrett's office—I asked him about a debt due to Jones and Son, of Liverpool—I complained that I could not find the goods in the journal, although there was the debt in the ledger—he said he had not sent anything; it was a false entry, that he had made it shortly before he gave up the books—I heard him asked to the rings 545 and 950 he said he had no recollection of having had them</p>

               <p>at all—him that it was a very recent purchase—he said that if Thomas of Bond Street, had had it must have been stated—there is an entry in the prisoner's journey book: "27th May, 1878, Thomas, two rings, 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, one kept and one returned:" there are no numbers put—he was asked as to an emerald ring with two brilliants which Mr. Garrett had mentioned, and he said it was sold to a dealer in the north for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was asked the dealer's name: he said he did not know it—I asked him as to the cat's eye pin—here is an entry in the approbation book: "May as 7th, 1878, Messrs. Orton and House," among other goods, "a cat's-eye pin 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., own stock"—before that entry was shown him he said he had sold it, he did not say to whom or from whom he had it—I then called his attention to these words "own stock"—at last he got into a muddle about it altogether, and could give no explanation, it was so long ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> In making up the deficiency account, I have not allowed anything for liquidation expenses—I cannot, because there is no entry in the books for it; he kept no cash book—the book debts turned out 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. better than they were estimated at; they were estimated at 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. they realized 1,321<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the next item is a composition of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound, 1,381<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he did not pay; that is treating the old debts as received, because he failed to pay the composition—1,160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is the amount of the unpaid composition to Mr. Garrett—truck and Godfrey is 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't allow for the whole of their accounts—there is a proof of J. Truck, seen for 252<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., subject to revision—Miss Skelton's revived debt is 177<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the balance of her dividend; she held securities, but they were not then realized—I have been an accountant about 20 years—my office is in the same building as Mr. Garrett's—I did not hear the prisoner complain that these question had not been put to him until eight months after his bankruptcy, and that his memory had been shattered by his worries—I do not find the five rings in the stock sheet—he kept no ledger—Jones's debt is 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said that he had borrowed 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Jones, and that he wished to hide him from being a creditor—there are eight or ten creditors besides that, not entered on the schedule—nearly 100 creditors are omitted—Mr. Pearce is not a creditor, he is a debtor, a customer—I found out the eight or ten creditors four or five months ago—I mentioned it to the solicitor—the prisoner never explained about the cheque for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Pearce—I only knew of it from his own accountant—the 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. described as the same ring—I have no reason to disbelieve it—there were other ruby and diamond rings, but at less prices, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not made any inquiry as to where he got the cat's-eye pin from—in the 2,054<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deficiency account which the debtor claims there is nothing about the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—I have allowed him the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound as if it was paid, and then charged it back again because he has not paid it.</p>

I am a manufacturing jeweller at 18, Swinton Street, Gray's Inn Road—I am one of the committee of inspection in this matter—I was present during the greater portion of 3rd September, 1878 at the prisoner's office, when the stock was handed over—I went through the stock with the inventory with the exception of the first few articles—I have been through the stock with the inventory since; I found them agree—I went through them with Mr. Clark, Mr. Tuck, and Mr. Garrett—none of the articles the subject of this charge were included in the stock given up to the trustee—I was present at the examination at Mr. Garrett's office in May, 1879—I took down a portion of the examination—he was ques<lb/>tioned about the ring 955 bought by him on 5th June from Mr. Garrett; he said he had no recollection of having had it from Mr. Garrett; there were two rings that he had from Mr. Garrett on 31st May; he had no recollection of having had them—he was asked as to an emerald ring obtained from Mr. Garrett; he said he had sold it to a dealer in the North of England for 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not mention the dealer's name—he was questioned about the cat's-eye pin left with Orton and House—he said he of it for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from a customer at Leeds; he declined to give his name—he was shown the entry of the pin in the approbation book, "own stock"—he said, "Oh, that is a different thing; I sold that to the dealer I sold the emerald and diamond ring to;" he at first said for about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and after<lb/>wards for between 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was asked about the entry 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to Jones of Liverpool—he said that was incorrect; he did not sell them any goods, but he made the entry just before he gave up his books because he did not wish them to appear as creditors; he did not wish them to prove.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> In my opinion only one cat's-eye pin was spoken of at that interview—I am a creditor for 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in fact more than that, because I am liable on a 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, an acceptance of the prisoner—I have been through his books from time to time, but not to make a thorough investigation—I have not noticed other cat's-eye pins in his book about that time—I have not noticed one from Brownhill value about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner said at the examination that his memory had been much shattered.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and lire at 85, Tavistock Crescent, Westbourne Park—Annie Jane Fanny Maclean was my niece; she was the daughter Of Colonel and Mrs. Maclean, and was 33 years of age is August last—Colonel Maclean has been dead some years—Miss Maclean was living with her mother in London, once at 40, Eastbourne Terrace, and latterly in Craven Road—they lived together in London ever since she was born, up to March last—I was in the habit of visiting them, sometimes once a week, sometimes twice a week, constantly—Miss Maclean had a spinal deformity, she could not walk very well, there was something the matter with her hip, and in consequence of the deformity she walked always lame; sometimes she walked with a stick, not latterly, she made use of her umbrella generally speaking instead of a stick—she was very short, I can't say what height she was—she did not leave London with her mother, her mother left London in March, she had taken a house at Broadway, about 12 miles from Worcester, called the Shrubbery, and I went down with her, Miss Maclean stayed with a friend in London—Mrs. Maclean died on 1st April, suddenly, at Broadway, I was with her at the time—she died at the house of a Mr. Allcock, where she had taken apartments until the Shrubbery was ready—her daughter was not with when she was taken ill—she was in London, but she was telegraphed for and came down, and was with her when she died—Mrs. Maclean also left a son, Norman Maclean, he is a doctor—Mrs. Maclean left a will—the son and daughter came into some property, £3,000 between them; after the mother's death Miss Maclean came to my house and lived with me for about a month at my house in London, until 3rd of May—I know the prisoner Paine, I only knew him since Mrs. Maclean's death, when he came to my house—he was known to Mrs. and Miss Maclean before that, but I did not know him—I did not how whether he was married or single—he came to my house to see Miss Maclean, much to my surprise; he called perhaps once a week, sometimes, he might perhaps have called twice in the week, I can't Say exactly how often he called—I was present when he first came to the house, but I left the room immediately—he did not at any time tell me the object of his visits—I did not learn from him what his business was I did not know where he was living—on 8th May I and my niece went down to Broadway, to the Shrubbery—I stayed there a fortnight with her—I did not see while I was there—he did not come to the Shrubbery at all—I returned to London alone-about a month afterwards my niece came to London to stay with me for a short time—Paine came soon after—two or three days after she came up she had occasion to go down into the country for some days to find some deeds and papers of administration, or something, and then she returned to me</p>

               <p>in three or four days, I can't say exactly; her brother was with me at that time—during the two or three days before she went into the country Paine called to see her, and after her return he also called—she was only with me two or three days then—after that she went back to the Shrub<lb/>bery with her brother—at that time I did not know her position with regard to Paine, not until the evening before she left my house—she did not tell me, but she did tell my servant—I heard her say it—her brother had been staying with me, and went down with her to the Shrubbery—her brother left for America at the end of August—Miss Maclean came up to town then, and I saw her—she came to my house for about an hour—she went to live at 11 Alexandra Street, Westbourne Park, 10 or 11 days—Paine was with her then—she afterwards went back to the Shrubbery—I did not see her again till I was called to her at the coffee-house at 128, Seymour Place—that was on a Sunday evening just a fortnight before she died—I was fetched by Mr. Fitzpatrick—I went with him to a bedroom at the first-floor back—my niece was in bed—when I had last seen her before she was in good health—in regard to drink she took what other people did, she drank moderately—one night, when she had been out the whole day with Paine, she came back a little the worse for drink—that was in May—when I went to the coffee-house Mrs. Powell and a nurse named Mrs. Wright were there—my niece was very ill indeed—she did not seem to have the free use of her hands—I spoke to her and she spoke to me—at times she was very collected, but at others she would wander—I stayed with her all night till about 7 o'clock the next morning—Mr. Fitzpatrick remained about half an hour—Mr. Waller was sent for—I believe he is a surgeon—he was sent for at about 1 o'clock, I believe, by Mrs. Powell—he saw her and examined her—he remained about 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour—Mrs. Powell's servant was there, also Mrs. Postlethwaite—I noticed the state of Miss Maclean's night-dress, it was stained with something down the front—it looked dark, as if it was brandy—I saw two tumblers with spirits in them beside her bed—one looked dark like brandy, and the other was lighter, like whisky—I did not smell it—I saw one bottle on the mantelpiece—I examined her feet and hands—she complained of great pain and cold, and would not let any one touch them—her hands were as if they were para<lb/>lysed—she could not put them to her face—she said "Look at my mouth"—I looked at her mouth—her hands seem convulsed—her mouth was very red and almost raw—she did not get out of bed at all in the night—she did not appear to be able to get out—she did not seem as if she could hold anything in her hand very well, she tried, but could not do so—she had nothing to eat or drink while I was there—she asked for a glass of beer, but just put her lips to it—I left at 7—I had not seen anything of the prisoner before I left—I returned there, I think, about 12 or 1 o'clock—I went back alone—I went to the house, but did not see her—I went to my soli<lb/>citor, Mr. Taylor, of Field Court, Gray's Inn, to fetch him to see Miss Maclean—she said said she wished to see him particularly—he met me at the coffee-house between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I saw Dr. Thomas there—I went into the room with Mr. Taylor—my niece then appeared a little better—I stayed about half an hour on that occasion—Paine came in whilst I was there—I said to him, "Do you call yourself a man to ill-treat a little orphan deformity as she is, and rob her of her money?"—I said, "You are beneath a man to bring her into a coffee-house to</p>

               <p>die. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. I only wish I was her brother; I would thrash you till you hadn't a piece of flesh to stand on"—he said, "You get out of this. This is my place, and I pay for it"—"You pay for it!"I said; "not with your own money, you don't"—he said, "That's my wife"—"Your wife!"I said; "You had better take care what you say; you've a wife living. Instead of robbing her and bringing her to disgrace, you ought to have been a protector to her at your age"—I implored my niece to think of what she was 'doing, and what anguish it would have caused to her mother if she had' been alive—she said that she would not come with me, and that she, did not want to be interfered with by me, but she seemed to be quite under his influence—I said, "Annie, if I can be of no further use to you I will gay good-bye, sometime, perhaps, you may want me when it will be too late"—I left then—on the previous day she had been very anxious to come with me, but after she had seen Paine she seemed afraid to speak—it was about 5 when I left—that was the last time I saw her alive—I heard of her death afterwards and saw her body—I attended the inquest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> What I have said is true—I was examined before the Coroner once, and I was called up a second time a fortnight afterwards to contradict a statement—I did not say then a single word of what I have said now; I was not asked to do so—I said that he ordered me out of the room, but that is the only portion of the long story I have told to-day that I told the Coroner—my niece was not able to assist herself in any way—she appeared very much attenuated—I have not said that she was next door to a skeleton—I said that her poor hands and arms had got very much thinner, and her face also—she looked as if she had not had sufficient food, I think—she looked half-starved, and in a very different condition to when I saw her last—she was generally very thin—as my niece, I had entertained a deep affection for her—I made no inquiry about her between then and the time of her death, because I did not wish to be insulted, and my affection for her yielded to that—Mr. Fitzpatrick vent to the police the first night I was there, leaving me in a cab—he went on my account—he is here, I believe—I learned from him that they would not interfere—I sat with her all night, and left at 7 a.m.—before I left I sent for some gin, as she wanted something to drink—she was allowed weak spirits—there were two tumblers there, but castor oil had been put in and she would not take it—I call it brandy from the colour—I did not try to make her take it, but the nurse tried in my presence—I do not know whether it was neat brandy—I saw the nurse put it to her lips but she refused to take it, she said there was castor oil in it—the whisky had castor oil in it too—the nurse also tried her with the whisky and she would not take that either because of the castor oil—I did not mention that before because I was not allowed to speak—I did not tell the jury about sending out for gin, because I was not asked the question—I paid 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the gin—she was craving for something to drink—I did not smell the castor oil, but it looked like it, you could see it swimming at the top, and it looked like brandy at the bottom of the tumbler, and the same with the other, the whisky at the bottom and the oil at the top—Mrs. Knowles is the friend she remained with when her mother went to Broadway, she is not here, she lives at Kilburn—the deceased drank wine, beer, and brandy and water, but I</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I had not noticed that her habits were in temperate before her mother took the shrubby—after her mother's death, when she had been out with Mr. paine the whole day, she came home in the evening and I noticed that she had had a little too much—when I sent for the gin it was because she expressed a desire for it, she was very thirty—I gave her some mixed with water, she had very little of it.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.P. and M.R.C.S. I am not residing at 275, fulham Road—I was educated at wellington college, and left about 1867, when my sister, the deceased, was living with my mother at Eastbourne Terrace—I studied at st. mary's Hospital—I have since lived at various places—my father, Lieutenant-colonel Maclean, died in 1854, and my mother's myself, and my sister formed the family—on 30th August last I went to America, and I returned for the vacation—paine visited my mother's house, but I never saw him there—when I came house I saw him twice—he professed to be a commission agent—I did not know much about him, but my mother objected to his coming to the house because his character was not good—I communed practice for myself and I left my mother's home—after 1876 I lived at several place—in 1879 I had chamber in Barnard's inn—I was then married—my mother died on 1st April—I was there about nine hours before she died—after that on sister went to live with her aunt—she was very amiable and apparently happy, considering the deformity she had—she had the same average abilities as most young ladies possess—about a month after my sister in death I went to my solicitor to get a settlement prepared for my sister in consequence of what some one said—I got it prepared, and afterward handed it to my sister; she said she would not sign it at Broadway it consult my co-executor, Mr. Clark—I afterwards saw it at Broadway in her possession still unexecuted, and so far as I know it never was executed—it was only a draught—in may my wife and I went to the shrubbery,</p>

               <p>and I stayed there on and off till 23rd August—Mrs. Bryson my mother-in-law, and Mrs. willison were there—paine was staying there part of the time I was there—before I went to Broadway and while paine was there he told us all that he had been married to my sister since march, and my sister who was present, conformed it—I had no actual reason to disbelieve it—while I was at the shrubbery the question arose whether my sister was married—I had executed a deed by which all her mother a property to which she was not entitled under the will should be hers for a certains monetary consideration; and Mr. Taylor, my mother's solicitor wrote to my, that he understood she was married, and another deed would have to he prepared, after which I saw paine and my sister and told her what Mr. Taylor had said, and if that was the case, there could be no half-confidence between her and her solicitor, that I had heard from her that they were married, but if they were not married—paine was not in the room then but afterwards he heard what had been said, and admitted that they ward not married, but that he was perfectly ready and willing to marry her—I did not know that he was already; I asked him and he said he was not—I left with my wife and did not tell her the state of a hairs—I agreed to sell my share in the house and the state of sister—I arrangement was carried out before I sailed for America on 30th August settle in America—I received two letters in New York from paine, one containing a doctor's certificate respecting my sister—the next information I received was that of the death of my sister, and I then came to England—before my mother took the shrubbery, my sister was living with her in craven Row—I was not in a position to know my habits, but I should say she was not intemperate—my mother complained to me that when she went out she sometimes came back having had more that was good for her—I never saw her what I could say intoxicate—when I was saying at the shrubbery I thought she was taking more stimulant than was good for her, certainly—I spoke to her about it, but she said nothing in paine's presence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have not great experience in female drunkenness, and cannot say whether it is difficult to control—I have been in practice since 1875—I had chambers in Barnard's Inn—soon after the death of Mrs. Maclean my sister came to see me there—she called once with Mr. paine—nothing was said about her being in the family-way—they were not there five did not come to say good-bye—I was staying at the shrubbery when they were there, but I do not remember being called up one night by paine to see my sister, who was in great paine—the size of her stomach was noticeable by anybody—I could not have discovered whether she was in the family-way—I was called up one morning because she had noticed a blue mark on the said of her abdomen, and she was rather anxious about it, and paine asked me to come and look at it—he was present while I made the examination—I formed no impression as to her being in the family-way—I did not examine her to that extent, but I recom<lb/>mended her to have an obstetric physician for that purpose—medical man do not hazard opinions—paine said that she complained of great plain, and in consequence of the her body he wished me to examine her—I do not think I know at that time they were not married; it</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Smith, who keeps a lodging-house, 1, Alexander Street, Westbourne Park—on Saturday night, 30th August last, I was sent for to a neighbour's house, where I saw the prisoner and the deceased—they were introduced to me as Mr. and Mrs. Paine—Paine wished to take my rooms—he said he had come up on business, and also to see some doctors—he took the dining-room and the second-floor front bedroom—the next Sunday, the 31st, he and the deceased came in a cab between 1.30 and 2 o'clock—Paine assisted the deceased out, she being a cripple—he did not carry her; he merely gave her the assistance which a gentleman would give to a lady—they went into the dining-room together, and I went there very shortly after—the deceased was half sitting, half lying, in a large arm-chair, fast asleep—her face was very much flushed—I asked Paine how it was she was so face asleep, and he told me that she was prostrate with grief at her brother's having just left for America—I did not then see any bottle in the room—they had dinner soon after—I thing there was a bottle of brandy on the sideboard during some portion of that day—in the evening I has some conversation with Paine about the condition of the deceased—he began it, and the substance of it was that she was pregnant, and not in a good state of health—he made allusion to her being deformed, and told me that she was gone just half her time—I said I thought she ought to have the best advice—they remained at my house about ten days, till Sept. 10—during all that time she was principally in the bedroom; very seldom in the dining-room; but they went out daily—during their stay I conversed with the prisoner frequently about the lady's supposed pregnancy—I asked her in his presence why they did not have a doctor—he continually put it off, saying that he was going to, or that she was not well enough, or not willing that day—he asked me what I thought about the coming event—I said I could not tell—I asked him if he had had good medical advice, and he said that he had, and that cripples had the best of times—he said that Dr. Norman Maclean, her brother, who was a doctor, was very uneasy at the state she was in with her deformity—one day I saw some baby linen lying on a chair—I can't say who brought it—I said to Paine, "You have been buying the baby linen, I see"—he replied, "Yes, I have had to buy it; she's such a funny little thing; she wouldn't trouble about it"—I was only aware after they left of the number of bottles they had; I believe I said at the inquest seven bottles of brandy—every morning the servant used to bring one bottle down, and it was only after they had left that I found out what number had been used—there were seven bottles of brandy, one bottle of whisky, one bottle of gin, one of sherry, two of ginger wine, and eleven of claret—in the bedroom we found three or fount flair bottles, such as you see sold at railway stations, empty—I waited on Mr. Paine on the day he came, as my servant had gone for a holiday, but I did not see more if him when he dined in the house—they both dines in the dining-room when they had dinner at home, but she principally reside in the bedroom—they left on 10th September—Paine</p>

               <p>asked me if I could find a servant for her, and I suggested that she should have a proper nurse with her—he said he was going back to the Shrubbery—the servant was very seldom able to get into the bedroom till late in the afternoon—up to that time the door was locked, I believe—the lady ate comparatively nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I could not say whether she was in the family-way; she being deformed—it was not patent—my servant is not here, she could answer no questions that I can't answer—she went up to empty the slops, and I went up afterwards to make the bed; I or my servant opened the outer door, whichever was the handiest—I cannot say how the bottles got into the house, I suppose Paine brought them, but the claret he wished me to get in for him, it cost 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a bottle—I do not know how the seven bottles of brandy were brought in—I was surprised when I saw them empty—Miss Maclean never went out alone, always with the prisoner—I never saw her drunk, but I saw Paine drunk several times; he seldom came home at night without being drunk—I saw very little or the deceased, I daresay there were three days out of the ten that I did not see her; she was seldom out late in the evening or downstairs—I saw her return with him late once or twice, and she then appeared sober, he seemed very attentive to her—I noticed to harshness on his part, but the contrary—they had no dinner parties, there was only one proper dinner, the others were little bits—on that occasion there was a pair of soles, a leg of lamb, and a pudding; Paine told me before that he had invited two ladies, and any servant said two ladies came—there were some callers, one gentleman called one morning, and two ladies came—there were some callers, one gentleman dined there—I never saw any time of potted meat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Sometimes Paine brought in the little they had, haddock or bloater; I spoke to him daily about the smallness of deceased's appre<lb/>tite, and he said that she would not eat, and had not eaten since she had been in the family-way; my servant's name is Ellen Parry, she ill with ulcerated throat—when Paine came home drunk he was alone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor at Worcester—on the 16th September last the prisoner called upon me, introducing himself to me as being of the Shrubbery, Broadway; he first said he wanted me to transact a little matter of business of a private nature; that he had formed a con<lb/>nection with a young lady at Broadway, who was reputed to be his wife, but that he really was not married to her, and that she wished to make over to him all her property, and he wished to do the same with regard to his; he then handed to me a document which he said had been sent by some solicitors in London, saying that he thought that was not the kind of document they both required; he asked me to peruse it, I did so, and I told him that it was merely a settlement of property belonging to a Miss Maclean, and that the effect of it would be to vest whatever property Miss Maclean had in the hands of trustees; it was a marriage settlement; I told him that the mouse simple plan to adopt, and the least expensive one, would be for each party to make a short will in favour of the other; to this he assented, and I took down the instructions; he did not say where Miss Maclean was then staying; he wanted to know when the wills would be ready for signature; I said they would be very simple documents, and could be ready by 11 o'clock the following day; and that time was fixed for Paine and Miss Maclean to come to my office—he said she believed herself to be in the family-way and was in a great fright—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188002090110"/>
               <p>next morning Paine came with a lady, who he introduced to me as Miss Maclean—I explained to her the instructions I had received, and the conversation which had taken place on the previous day, and that I had prepared wills in conformity with those instructions—she said "That is exactly what I wished"—I then read over her will to her and his will to him, both being present—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she approved of her will, and afterwards executed it, and he executed his, I and my clerk attesting—these are the wills—they are the same, except that in his will there is a policy on his life, and in hers there is none—at Paine's request she paid me my charge, and I then returned to him the draft marriages settlement which he had given me the previous day—at that time Miss Maclean was, so far as I could judge, in perfect health, and quite robust; in perfect possession of her faculties—they left together—on 21st September I received a letter from Mr. Paine, dated the 20th—the signature appears the same as that affixed to the affixed to the will. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Dear Sir,—Miss Maclean wishes you to prepare a simple deed of gift of the leave of the house, 40, Eastbourne Terrace, to me." Signed L. J. Paines.) Wanting further particulars, I wrote this letter to Mr. Paine and seen it to him by pose to Broadway. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated September 22, asking the prisoner to supply him with document for the preparation of the assignment: a letter from Paine in reply, dated the 24th, was also put in, enclosing the deeds.</hi>) I then prepared the draft deed, got it engrossed, and wrote to Paine that it was ready for execution—it was an absolute assignment of the house in East-bourn Terrace—on 4th October the deceased and Paine called at the office together—I read it over to her and she executed it—Paine asked me to keep it for the present, and he would let me know what to do with it—on 12th October I received a letter from Paine, dated the 11th and saying "We are in receipt of the lease, &amp;c., of Eastbourne Terrace"—I had explained to him that in order to complete the title he ought to be is possession of the original lease of the ground on which the house was built, and I sent it to the Shrubbery by post, and never saw either Paines or Miss Maclean after that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw Miss Maclean twice; on the first occasion when she made her will, for about half an hour, and on the second occasion for 20 minutes to half an hour—I noticed that she limped into the room lamely, but I saw no deformity—she did not appear to be all acting under compulsion—she seemed a perfectly free agent—there was not a word, look, to sign from Paine as if he was influencing her—he was exceedingly polite to her in every way, taking her shawl and her gloves, and so on—to the best of my judgment she was not drunk, or I should not have allowed her to sign the document—this is the deed she signed.</p>

               <p>my hand under her clothes, at her back and round the pelvis—I believe it was on the right side—the indication of the deformity was the promi<lb/>nence of the spine backwards, and the elevation of the hips on the right side—my attention was not drawn to the liver by any considerable swelling, and when I asked if she had any liver trouble, she said, "No. I have not"—I know a disease called cirrhosis—that is an advanced state of liver disease—I never heard the name of rottenness applied to it—practi<lb/>cally, that is the nature of it—it is substantially an extraneous growth, the healthy tissue of the liver has become destroyed by the presence of a new deposit—it is brought on rather quickly—I did not examine the kidneys.</p>

I keep the Swan Inn, at Broadway, Worcestershire—on Monday, the 3rd of November last, I sent a waggonette to the Shrubbery—my driver was a man named Kyte—Mr. Paine had ordered it on the previous Saturday—on the Monday morning I went to the house, between 9 and 10 o'clock, and saw the prisoner, who asked me to carry Mrs. Paine out of the bedroom to the carriage, because he was not able—I then went upstairs to the bedroom on the first-floor, and found a lady sitting there dressed, ready for travelling—she appeared to be in a very bed state, I should think, for travelling—she could not speak to me—I took her in my arms, lifted her from the couch, carried her down the stairs, and put her in the waggonette—she could not stand—her face was swollen—Fanny Matthews was standing in the hall dressed, ready for traveling—there was no one else at the house besides myself, Paine, Fanny Matthews, and the driver of the waggonette—after I put the lady into the carriage I went away, leaving it at the door—I had known the lady before at Broadway as Miss Maclean—the Swan Inn from the Shrubbery is about 200 yards—I had not seen the lady out for a month, perhaps, or more.</p>

My father lives at Broadway—he is a gardener—before 11th September last year I had been a domestic servant in London—I left my service at that time and went back to my father—he was not exactly working for Mr. Paine; he had been laying the garden, getting it ready for the time Mrs. Maclean was to come there—in consequence of something my father told me, I went to the Shrubbery to seek a situation there; it was on Saturday, 13th September, I went first about 10 o'clock in the morning—the Shrubbery is at the bottom of the village—there is a house adjoining it, it is what is called a semi-detached house—I saw Mr. Paine first, he asked me into the kitchen, and called Mrs. Paine down<lb/>stairs to me—I had seen her before in Broadway, but not to know any<lb/>thing about her—the result was that I was engaged as servant, and I went in about two hours afterwards to stay for good—there was no other servant—Mr. and Mrs. Paine and myself were the occupants of the house—I remained there until we left for London on 3rd November—Mr.</p>

What does she want?" and he said "Oh! drink, of course, as per usual"—he then I said was to clean myself and go out, and I then asked him if I might go up and make her bed first?—he said "No; you go out; I will attend to that"—I said it was not a right thing for a gentleman like him to be emptying basins and making beds—however, he said he would do it—on the same day, after I had cleaned myself to go out he came into the kitchen and asked me if I had heard any one say that they were not married—I said "No sir"—he said "Well, to prove we are, wait a moment and I will fetch a certificate"—he went upstairs and came back with a piece of paper in his hand—there was on it "Lewis Paine and Annie Mclean, married the 24th day of March"—he said "If any one should say we are not, you can say we are"—I went out about 4 o'clock and stayed out till about 9 o'clock—he said he was going to lock up all the doors and go to bed, and I was to take the back kitchen door key so that I could let myself in—when I came back I went to Miss Maclean's room—she was in bed—Paine was not there—she was caring—she was undressed in bed—she seemed very much distressed—I had some conversation with her—she asked me to get her a glass of milk—I got her the milk and she drank it—I did not notice her mouth—Paine came in after a little time—he said to Miss Maclean, "Well, how are you now,</p>

"Dec. 31, 1879.

To relieve the pain in the back I suggest that she leaves as all stimulants for a time, keep to the bed or sofa, take a little cooling and slight aperients medicine. I would also recommend her to have, for a night or two, a warm hip bath. I think this will relieve her pain, and very likely bring on the monthly courses. After the bath you may apply a bulla-Donna plaister. You have not sent me your New York Insurance paper, which I am desirous of seeing before' filling up the medical report. I enclose a prescription; please to have it made up at a good druggist's.") Paine had said that he was insured in the New York Company, and that he wished to increase his insurance, but that it would be necessary for him to be re-examined—I had examined him for that purpose—after the examination I made of the lady I formed the opinion that she had indulged too freely in stimulants—I believe the liver was congested—I did not detect any enlargement of it—in her condition it would certainly not be a proper thing for her to take raw spirits.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, residing at Broadway—I knew the deceased and also her mother—about 20th or 21st September I was called to the Shrubbery to see Miss Maclean—I can't fix the exact date—the girl Matthews fetched me about 2 o'clock in the morning; I got up at once and went to the Shrubbery, where I saw Miss Maclean in bed—I had no conversation with Paine before I saw her—she was in a very excited state—I thought that perhaps it was due to stimulants—I did not notice anything else in her condition—I prescribed for her—I had conversation with Paine about her, and he was in the room—he said he thought she had taken stimulants—I can't recollect his exact words—I told him that stimulants should be avoided—I saw her again, next day I think; she was then better; I think I also saw her the next day, she was then convalescent—about a month later, I think about 21st October, I was fetched by the girl Matthews about 7 o'clock in the evening—when I got to the Shrubbery I found the deceased in bed, in a state of great excitement; she complained of pain in the abdomen, and also of being occasionally faint—I then also supposed it was due to stimulants—I prescribed for her—Paine was not there on that occasion—I saw her again the next evening but one, the 23rd; I did not see Paine then—she was still under excitement—I prescribed for her—I did not attend her after that—on that occasion Mrs. Porter was nursing here and I gave her directions with regard to her treatment—I ordered her a little weak brandy-and-water if she felt faintness coming on—I believe that was the last time I saw her—on the following morning, the 24th, about 9 or 10to'clock, Paine called on me—I told him that I should prefer her consulting a London obstetric physician, as she imagined herself to be pregnant, and as she was so greatly deformed; that she would have friends in London, and I thought it better that she should be removed to where her friends were and be surrounded by her friends—I understood from him that he would remove her to London—I declined making any examination of her—I saw Paine some time afterwards; he called one evening at my house and said, "I have taken her to comfortable lodgings in London,: and two doctors are attending her, and I have asked them to give a statement of the disease she is suffering from, that it may be sent to her brother in America"—to did not give me the names of the medical men—from what I saw of the condition of the lady I did not think she was in any danger, not in imme<lb/>diate danger at any rate—I supposed her to be Mrs. Paine—I had attended her for an eruption on the face, eczemas perhaps six weeks or a month before the time I was called in in September—I had also attended her for an extraordinary twitching of the muscles of the mouth and neck; that was during the time she had the skin eruption—I thought that might be due to a nervous feeling, she had been bitten by a little dog.</p>

               <p>not examine her heart—a person suffering from fatty degeneration of the heart may die at any moment—her tongue was foul on the 21st or 22nd September—furred—I did not think the pulse feeble; it was rather fast—it may be fast and feeble—the tongue was certainly not in a state of ulceration—I observed no blisters; she made no such complaint—I don't think I mentioned to Miss Maclean the dangerous results of indulging in alcohol—I felt some delicacy about it—I agree with Mr. Shepherd that when a woman has once become addicted to drinking it is most diffi<lb/>cult to break her of it—I should not think she would require any forcing to take liquor; if any one said so I should disbelieve it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I think if a woman took half a tumbler of raw brandy it would cause pain—it might make the mouth raw; it might produce small ulcers or blisters—I did not look underneath her tongue—I told Paine that I thought she ought not to have stimulants—I can 't remember toy remark that he made upon that.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at the Broadway, Worcester, and am the wife of Charles Porter—I knew Miss Maclean and her mother—I knew the prisoner first in June last—I was called into the Shrubbery on Saturday, 18th October, and I went there every evening up to the following Thursday—during that time Miss Maclean was ill in bed, and complained of a pain in her side and her chest—I assisted in the attendance upon her, and called in Dr. Beadles—I never saw Mr. Paine till the Wednesday evening, he being away; I then gave him Dr. Beadle's orders, and said I thought it advisable to send for him, as she was in a very low and weak state—I said I had given her a little medicine which Dr. Beadles had ordered, and some weak brandy-and-water, and he said, "That shall be seen to"—that was all that passed then—the next evening I went to see the deceased, and Paine came into the room while I was there—she had been crying very much, and I asked her what was the matter—she said he had been very cross with her all day—she asked for something to drink—Paine said "I suppose you want some more brandy?"—she said "No, I do not"—he said "She has drunk a bottle of brandy since I came home last night"—she did not speak at all in reply—I said to Mr. Paine "You should not have given it her; you have exceeded Dr. Beadle's orders altogether"—he said "It is her own money, and let her have it," and left the room—that was between 8 and 9 in the evening—I was in the room about half an hour—I saw no spirits except a little drop, about a wineglassful, which Paine showed me at the bottom of a three-half-pint bottle which he took out of the top part of the wardrobe—after he left the room I helped to get her into bed, she having been on the couch, and then I went home—she could not then stand without support, nor could she do so on either of the previous days that I was there—she asked me to go again, and I went on the following Friday, but was not admitted—I saw Fanny Matthews—I never saw Miss Maclean again.</p>

I would not take it," and then she said "He makes me drink it"—during the time I was with her she showed no inclination for raw spirits, and she never had any—I did not know of any raw brandy being there—I believe she was a perfectly sober woman, and I believe be now, notwithstanding what Matthews told me—I did not know Mist Maclean till April last.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mrs. Wilson told me that Miss Maclean wished to make her will, but when I saw her she was utterly unfit to give any directions—she was under the delusion that Paine was lying in the bed with her—she said, "Poor fellow! he had gone out early; he is lying there and has gone to sleep"—she was quite unconscious of what she said—she was possessed of a very small annuity from the East India Company—she was very weak, but her mind was perfectly clear—she was suffering under the extraordinary delusion that Paine was in bed by her side, therefore she was not fit to make a will—she was the very reverse of appearing to be in terror of him.</p>

                  </hi> I keep a coffee-house at 128, Seymour Place, Mary<lb/>lebone—I have lived there twelve mouths last August, with my wife—in November last we had a servant named Ann Slaughter—in March or April last Paine came to my house with his wife, the one in Quebec Street, and two children—they stayed five days—J did not know him before—I saw him twice between that time and the November following—on those occasions he came alone and had a bedroom—at the end of October he sent me to take care of a large wooden box, like an ordinary travelling one—on Monday, 3rd November, I received this letter: "Dear Sir,—Will you kindly send the heavy box I sent to you to No. 9, Great Quebec Street, with the enclosed letter; also get a bedroom ready for to-morrow night, Monday, and oblige yours truly, Lewis James Paine." A letter was enclosed addressed to Mrs. Paine, 9, Great Quebec Street, and I sent the box and the letter there at 10 or 11 a.m.—on the same day, about five o'clock, a cab came to my door, and I saw the prisoner, Fanny Matthews, and a lady in it—Paine asked me if I had received his letter that morning—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Have you a bedroom?" and I said, "Yes"—he said, "I have had a little trouble lately, and I hire with me an invalid lady who is entrusted to my care, with money: it will pay us well, as there is money in it; you won't have her in your house long; she is very ill; I think she is dying now"—he asked if I would get her carried upstairs—I then went to the cab—the lady appeared very ill, and said, "Oh, dear, "Or something—I took her in my arms—it seemed to hurt her to move her—I carried her up to the bedroom, the back room on the first floor—I laid her in an arm-chair—I can't remem<lb/>ber whether she said anything—Fanny Matthews had come up, and the servant was lighting the fire, or had just lighted it—I then left the room—my wife was at home—about ten minutes after I left the room I saw Paine going away—he said, "I have brought her up to get a certificate for her"—he did not tell me where he was going, or when he would return—the next day I saw him at 9 or 10 in the morning—he came downstairs and asked me to change a cheque, giving me one of his own on the Union Bank for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he told me to keep the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. balance on account—he said, "I want the money to go out to buy Matthews a jacket, she has been so kind to her mistress"—Matthews was, I think, then upstairs—shortly after Paine went out with some one—I don't know who it was—I and my wife then went to Miss Maclean in the bedroom—that was about eleven in the morning—she was in bed—I don't remember seeing any one with her—I noticed two tumblers on the table near the right-hand of the bed—some spirits appeared to be in them, and my impression was that it was either brandy and whisky or brandy and rum—in one glass there was brandy and in the other rum, the colours being different—each tumbler was more than half full—I put them both on the mantelpiece—I and my wife spoke to Miss Maclean, and she replied—she appeared to be very distressed—I was not in the room more than five or ten minutes—she spoke to me in a rather wandering way—I did not see her again that day, but I think I saw Paine in the afternoon—he went away on Tuesday, the 11th, to Worcester, as he told me, and came back on the Saturday evening, when I had some conversation with him after he had been upstairs—I said to him that Miss Maclean had been asking for something to drink—he said, "Oh, let her have all she wants; it is a sin to prolong such a life as that"—upon that he left the house—this con<lb/>versation</p>

               <p>occurred about 7 in the evening—I did not make any reply when he made that observation—he did not tell me what he went to Worcester for—I saw Miss Maclean on several occasions while he was away—she remained in bed and was very ill—I do not remember seeing her up—I was in the bedroom once when Paine was there—I think it was after his return from Worcester—Dr. Thorman and my wife were also present—I had only looked in, and meant to go out, when Paine stopped me—he said, "I want you to hear this; I want to get at her"—he then poured something out of a bottle into a tumbler; it appeared to be spirits, and said, "Now, Annie deary, I want you to take this"—I don't remember what she said in reply, but she took it very reluctantly—Paine then said to Dr. Thorman, "I want you to hear this. Now, Annie deary, what did Norman give you for his share of the house in Eastbourne Terrace?"—she answered directly, "Six hundred pounds"—Paine said to her, "You are an artful little devil"—that is all I remember—I don't remember what sort of a bottle it was that he pointed the stuff out of; I did not take particular notice of it—I do not remember how much was poured into the tumbler—Miss Maclean during that time was sitting in a chair—I was with her about an hour before she died, on Monday, 17th, at 9 in the evening—I had seen her on the Sunday, when she seemed more herself—she did not then appear to wander so much in her mind—I sat with her below she died—she then seemed to be rather anxious about her end—Dr. Thorman had been attending her—he was called in on Thursday, the 6th, and he came daily from that time—I did not know him before—Mr. Waller was our doctor, and I recommended Mr. Paine to get him before Dr. Thorman came, Mr. Waller having attended me during a fever—this was on the Wednesday—I told Paine that I would fetch him—I asked him whether he was not going to get a doctor, and he said, "She has seen several doctors"—that was on Wednesday or Thursday morning—when I offered to fetch Mr. Waller he said he would get one himself, and soma time in the afernoon he came with Dr. Thorman—I called in Mr. Waller about 9 o'clock in the evening of the same day—I did it at the suggestion of my wife—Mr. Waller saw Miss Maclean that evening, and I believe he spoke to her, but he declined to attend her as another medical man was attending—he was called in again on Sunday night or Monday morning at 1 o'clock—I saw Paine about a quarter of an hour or 10 minutes before the deceased died—two females were with him; one of them he introduced to me as his daughter—I don't remember his saying anything to me about the other—they were in the bedroom—I should think each of them was nearly forty years of age—I heard the lady whom Paine introduced as his daughter ask if there was not a doctor attending Mis Maclean, and he said, "Yes, two"—about that time I left the room—I saw the ladies shortly after on the doorstep—I then went up to the bedroom again; and Miss Maclean did not live 10 minutes after—I saw Paine with the ladies, and he went with them, and in less than 10 minutes afterwards Miss Maclean was dead—I was paid 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether; part of it, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., being for damage to the room—there were nurses employed who sat up with the lady at night—I charge ordinary persons 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per night for this room.</p>

Maclean about it, and probably he would pay me—I did see Dr. Maclean—I am quite sure I had given my evidence before that—it would be six or seven weeks after I had given my evidence at the inquest that I received the money from Dr. Maclean—I am not quite sure as to the date, it was about three weeks ago—I have perhaps said some things to-day that I did not say at the inquest—I can't remember I and my wife having a row with Paine in the inquest room about the money—I won't say we had not—I don't remem<lb/>ber; that I swear—I said before the Coroner "Paine asked the deceased what she gave Norman for his share in the house"—that is true—I may not have said before the Coroner that Paine repeated the words twice, "I want you to hear this"—when I say that the deceased took the spirits reluctantly, I mean she did not wish to take it, she offered some objection to taking it—I don't remember anything she said—I know by what I saw that she did not want to take it—I may not have stated that before to-day—I am not thoroughly acquainted with my evidence before the Coroner, not all of it—I have not studied it—I have not read it—I read it at the time but not since—I omitted that, because I was never asked—I saw him force the spirits on her that once—I heard it from the deceased's own lips—I think it is all in my wife's evidence, something to that effect—she was examined before me—my house is a perfectly respect<lb/>able one.</p>

I will not leave her in your house many days," Or words to that effect—he asked my husband to can you her upstairs—he carried her like a baby, and placed her in an arm-chair before the fire in the first floor back room—she groaned very much—I said, "You appear very ill; would you like something after travelling?"—there was a great smell with her of spirits—she said she would like a cup of tea or a hot glass of whisky-and-water—I told Paine I had no whisky, and asked him if I was to get some—he said, "No, she does not want anything, if she has anything it must be milk-and-water"—I said that I should get a cup of tea—he said, "No, she does not want say. thing; you know, Annie, you won't drink it"—I then left the room and sent the servant up with a glass half or three parts full of milk—before that Paine came down as the cab was still at the door—he said he had brought her up to get a certificate for her—he left her, and I did not know he had returned until on going upstairs I heard high words in the room—I went in and saw the lady in her chair, and Matthews in another char crying—Paine was there also—I did not go in—I said, "I just wanted to see if you wanted anything on the fire"—Paine said sharply, "No; we don't want anything," and I withdrew—he went out again, and later on I was fetched up to see the deceased by Fanny Matthews—it was wet time after 10—the deceased was lying on her face on the floor, apparently in a fit—she had only her chemise and one stocking on; no other clothes—I gave my servant 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and sent her for half-a-quartern of gin—I mixed a little with sugar and hot water, and went on my knees on the floor and lifted up her head and brought her round—we then lifted her into bed—there was no night-dress for her to put on, because Fanny said that Mr; Paine had the keys—there were two boxes and two portman teas, but they were all looked—having put her into bed I left her and looked in again about 11, but did not speak—Fanny Matthews was lying on the bed in her clothes alongside of the deceased, and I thought she was asleep—I lifted the deceased into bed because she was helpless from weak<lb/>ness, not from intoxication—on the next day, Tuesday, 4th November, about 9 o'clock, I popped out of the closet and saw Paine on the stairs with his arm round Fanny Matthews's neck, whispering something—he said that he had been to sleep at his sister's and had been taken very bad—I left them on the stairs—Paine came down a few minutes after and asked my husband to change him a cheque for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my husband only had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by him, and Paine said that would do—he was going out to buy Fanny a jacket, as she had been so kind to her mistress, and as he passed me he said, "Don't you think she deserve it?"—I said, "If she has been good to her mistress."—they went out together about 10 o'clock and deceased was left alone—after this my husband and I went up into the deceased's room—as far as I knew she had not had any breakfast that</p>

I wont have her here, she knows too much for me"—then I ran upstairs—Paine had gone before me—I said, "You said you were going to leave Fanny Matthews"—he replied; "Didn't she stay?"—I said, "No, she went away directly after you"—I said I would not have allowed the lady to have slept alone in my house in that condition without somebody with her—I don't think he made any reply—the deceased did net join in the conversation with Paine—Paine afterwards came down-to the kitchen—my,</p>

I lived at 16, Hay's Place, but I have removed—I am the wife of Alfred Bowden, a constable, Metropolitan police—on Monday, November 10th, I called in at Powell's coffee-house about 9 a.m.—Mrs. Powell spoke to me about an invalid lady upstairs—I attended! her after<lb/>wards—I first went up between 10 and 11 on the Monday morning, and stayed there all day till between 10 and 11 p.m.—she seemed to "be very well in health, except that she had lost the use of her hands and legs—I saw Paine in the morning before going up, and afterwards in the bedroom in the daytime—I was there when he came into the room with Dr. Thor<lb/>man—while Mr. Paine was present the doctor said I was to give her very weak brandy and water and plenty of food, and whatever she wished for—Mr. Paine followed the doctor downstairs—Paine came in again in the evening—I don't think he spoke to me—he asked the deceased how she felt—she said she felt very well—in the evening she asked me for some weak brandy and water, and Paine said that he would give it to her—he turned his back to me, and poured a small glass of neat brandy out of a bottle, lifted her head up, and gave it to her—some of it went down her throat and some on her nightdress—he then rinsed the glass and told me I was to give her the brandy and water stronger—it was not strong enough—I told him that Dr. Thorman said she was to have it weak—he said, "Never mind what the doctor says; do as I tell you"—I was there when Mrs. Wilson came, and Dr. Thorman came while she was there—this was on the same Monday evening—Mrs. Wilson came about four or five o'clock—Mr. Taylor was with her, and Mr. Paine came in after a little while—Mrs. Wilson asked Mr. Paine if he was not ashamed of himself to take a poor little deformed orphan away from her home and ruin her, and also to rob her of her money—he said, "She is my wife"—Mrs. Wilson said, "She is not your wife"—Miss Maclean said, "We were married at Gloucester"—Paine then said to Mrs. Wilson, "Who sent for you? these are my apartments, you go out, and don't enter them again till you are sent for"—Mrs. Wilson turned to Miss Maclean, and asked if there was anything she could do for her—Miss Maclean said, "No, no"—Mrs. Wilson said, "Very well, then, I will wish you good-bye; perhaps you will be glad of me when it is too late," and then she and Mr. Taylor left—Dr. Thorman was there, but I do not remember that he said anything—there had been a little conver<lb/>sation between him and Mrs. Wilson before Mr. Paine came in—after they left, Paine told me that if Mrs. Wilson came again I was not to admit her into the room; all that were to go into the room were Mr. and Mrs. Powell, Dr. Thorman, Paine himself, and myself; and if any one else came I was to shut the door in their face—he said, "I have brought her up here away from all her friends and relations, thinking that none of them would ever find her out, and now to think that b——d——has come"—I think that was all that passed—Dr. Thorman had left; he left a minute or two after Mrs. Wilson—after the conversation with me Paine spoke to Miss Maclean, hut I did not hear what he said, and then he left—I think he came back at about 9 o'clock that night—I saw him in the room—he said, "Well, Annie dearie, how are you now?"—she said, "I am very well, thank you, Lewis"—he turned round then and took, some<lb/>thing out of a box, and went away—he did not return that night while I was there—I remained until half-past 10 o'clock—during the day I had</p>

I live at 10, Upper Dorset Street, Bryanstone Square—on Thursday, 6th November, about 10 p.m., Mr. Powell called on me—I had attended his family—I went with him to his house—we got there about 10.10—I saw a lady in a bedroom on the first-floor—she was in a helpless state—my opinion was that it was from the effects of drink—Mrs. Powell and her servant came up immediately—I mean the chronic effects of drink: the effects of long-continued drinking—her pulse was very feeble, showing that the heart was very feeble in its action—beyond her being very weak I did not 6ee anything else the matter with her—I examined her stomach, in consequence of what Mrs. Powell said, and found it very large, and the liver very hard and enlarged—it felt very prominent—the stomach and bowels were very much distended with flatu<lb/>lence and gas—she seemed a little dull of comprehension, but, after pressing, she would answer questions—she seemed drowsy and dull to talk to—her face looked like that of a person who had been drinking, or was waking up out of sleep—there was nothing particular about it, it was not swollen—it was as if she had just woke up after drinking—I stayed with her a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes—I learned that some medical man had been attending her—I told Mrs. Powell that I considered the state she was in was due to the influence of drink, and told her to give her a little weak spirit and water, and a milk diet—I then left—I called again the next morning, and heard that another doctor was in attendance, so I did not go up—on Sunday, the 9th November, Mr. Powell called again about midnight, and I went with him to the coffee-house, and up into the room—the lady was still in bed—I found Mrs. Wilson there, and two or three other persons—the lady was a little better—her stomach was not so distended—she seemed the same as to her strength, and she seemed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188002090151"/>
               <p>blighter on the whole—I was called in to say whether she was in a fit state to make her will, and I examined her as to her state of mind—I think she might have been in a fit state from what she said—I asked her if she was married—she said "Yes"—she was not fit to be removed from the room to another house—I was with her a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes—I saw her again about the 12th or 13th November—I called to inquire how she was—I went into the room—she appeared to be brighter in her mind, and better a little in herself—I did not examine as to her general state—I merely walked in, and said "How do you do?" and asked how she was—I saw she had a nurse there—from the condition in which she was, I think raw spirits would not be fit for her—I believe the congestion of her liver had been going on for some time, and drinking raw spirits would be injurious if continued for a long time—she died on 17th November; and I believe if she had been in the habit of drink<lb/>ing raw spirits from the beginning of October, a small quantity, even a wineglass a day of raw spirits, would have accelerated her death—I did not consider her in immediate danger for a day or two, or two or three days—she might have lived for several weeks, but I thought there was a doubt as to her recovery—she required the greatest care and attention.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Forman is a neighbour of mine within three or four minutes' walk—I was called in casually—I should not continue to attend another doctor's patient—I did not communicate with Mr. Forman—I did not interfere with his treatment—I was not personally acquainted with him—I did give directions to Mrs. Powell the first night—I do not bow who started the notion of making a will, but Powell wanted to know whether she could do so, and whether they could move her, or what could be done—if she had died at that time, having made a will, I should have been prepared to give evidence that she was quite competent to do so—I have seen a good many drunken patients in all stages—drunkenness kills gradually, but sometimes it terminates suddenly by apoplexy—some livers would require longer than others to bring them into a state of cirrhoses, but I should think a year of habitual drinking would do it—I am acquainted with the text books on this disease—some cases come on much quicker than others—I do not think the liver could be brought into that state much under a year—I cannot say whether it would take two years' habitual drinking—there is nothing in a liver in that state to pro<lb/>duce sudden collapse—it is what we call a drunkard's liver—it would not produce sudden death—people linger a considerable time and the brain gets affected, and ultimately there is a shrinking of the brain—the sub<lb/>stance is not softened, it shrinks and fluid is thrown off—the technical term is effusion on the brain—that may be gradual—drunken patients are difficult to restrain—I have known them recover themselves of their own accord without being kept under restraint, but then they turn teetotallers—unless they do determine to correct it, it is almost impossible to recover them—if a person had been drinking for eighteen months she would be extremely difficult to restrain—although persons may try themselves and determine to do so, if they have been under the effects of liquor for a great length of time it is necessary gradually to reduce the stimulants: it is dangerous to stop them all at once, there would be a collapse—a person who had been an habitual drunkard to a large extent and had left off drinking altogether for six or eight days would, if she had a diseased heart, he very likely to collapse and die—I did not know then that this</p>

What I mean to say is, that a person suffering from fatty degeneration of the heart may die at any moment, independently of other disease—I should expect it to be sudden, and if they had been addicted to drink and had left it off for seven or eight days, there might be collapse, and death would ensue—I should give such a person weak spirits and water and ammonia—I should not think it right or prudent at all to administer raw spirits—I do not say that a small wineglass of raw spirits just on one occasion would be dangerous if a person was in a fainting condition of the heart, but I should not give the spirits if there was not that fainting condition—where there is no fainting condition it would be proper to administer a little brandy occasionally, if there was a very feeble pulse—brandy is a general remedy that everybody flies to.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I am Divisional Surgeon to the Police—I made the post-mortem examination of the deceased on 20th November—she was a woman of diminutive stature, with curva<lb/>ture of the spine, and one leg in consequence shorter than the other—the skin presented a waxy pearl-like appearance—the abdomen was very much distended and a little discharge was issuing from the vagina—post-mortem changes were beginning, and the body presented a greenish aspect in some parts—internally I found the vessels of the dura-mater and brain were congested, filled with blood, and some fluid was effused over the surface of the brain, and the meshes of the arachnoids under the membrane—there was none in the ventricles—the brain itself was natural—the right lung was healthy—the left lung in its upper and middle part was somewhat congested—both lungs were somewhat adherent to the chest walls—the heart was a small, weak organ—the ventricles and cavities were empty—the bowels were healthy—the heart presented a pale appearance, and to the naked eye there was somewhat the appearance of fatty degeneration—I subsequently examined it microscopically, and found evidence of commencing fatty degeneration, which had not advanced to a mature stage—the liver was enlarged—its weight was 60 ounces, which is excessive for a female—the average weight of a healthy liver of a female is 45 ounces, and this was about 15 ounces in excess—I should sup<lb/>pose it rather below 45 ounces than above in this case—it was flattened out somewhat by the curvature of the spine, and so presented a somewhat un<lb/>natural appearance, and to the naked eye the appearance which is connected with a fatty liver and commencing cirrhosis indicating that the disease had been progressive—I should think that such a condition had existed a year or two progressively—a disease like that would progress in some persons more rapidly than in others—I have no doubt that its progress would depend upon the character of the life—it is not possible to predict the duration of time which a disease of that kind has been in progressing—microscopically the liver presented markedly the characteristics of fatty infiltration—the kidneys and uterine organs were healthy—the intestines were considerably distended with wind, and contained a little billiard matter, but otherwise were empty throughout, with the exception of the colon—the stomach contained about half a wine glass full of a brownish fluid—the stomach itself was healthy—the inference I draw from the</p>

               <p>condition of the heart and liver is that she had been a drinker—I have no doubt that the administration of raw spirits in small glasses to a person in that condition would accelerate death—if a person had been habitually a drinker I should expect them to crave for raw spirits—I gave evidence before the Coroner that the cause of death was syncope, from failure of the heart's action while suffering from liver disease.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> As soon as a cell forms, degeneration of the heart has taken place to a certain extent—the disease has then established itself in a portion of the heart—the evidences I saw under the microscope were only a commencement, because the fat cells were few and far between—there were fat cells—degeneration had commenced, but it might go a great deal further if nothing happened to hasten the catastrophe—with care the person might last for a considerable period—it is very difficult to diagnose disease of the heart—there are other causes of weak heart besides fatty degeneration, which no ordinary person would guess in its earlier stage—the ventricles were empty, showing that the death had been sudden—the stomach was healthy, with the exception of a patch of redness 2 or 3 inches in size—that would not indicate anything—if the administration of raw spirits, sometimes two-thirds of a large tumbler, and at other times a wineglass, had continued up to a short interval before death, I should expect to find the stomach inflamed—I should expect the gut to be in an inflamed state, but more especially the stomach—the spirits go down the ordinary canal into the Stomach, and then are carried through the liver, and the reception of a large quantity would cause the stomach to be inflamed—ulceration of the mouth would arise from many causes besides drink—if raw spirits had been poured into the woman's stomach shortly before death, I should expect the stomach to exhibit an in<lb/>famed appearance—by shortly before death I mean within a day or two; but if it had been a month before, I believe the stomach would have re<lb/>covered from the possible effects of it—the fact of finding the valves of the heart healthy induced me to come to the conclusion that her death was attributed to a feeble heart rather than to alveolar disease—there was no alveolar disease—in my opinion the valves of the heart had nothing to do with her death—that is merely a circumstance which does not help us at all—I should say that the disease of the liver had been increasing for a year or two, but I should not like to say that it was impossible under a year, it is so entirely dependent upon surrounding circumstances—the liver in some cases might become enlarged much more rapidly than in others—if Dr. Norman Maclean saw a blue spot on the deceased's stomach early in July, it would probably be from an enlarged vein; but it is possible there might be a spot independently of that—if there were enlarged veins on the abdomen during life, I should draw the in<lb/>ference that the liver was congested—I examined her body thoroughly externally—there were no signs whatever of violence—it was fairly nourished—I drew the inference from that that the body had deteriorated to an extent, but she was not emaciated; I am not in a position to go further—it is usual in certain circumstances for the medical man who attends a patient to be present at the post-mortem, but he was not, and I knew nothing whatever of the circumstances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Finding the body fairly nourished, I came to the conclu<lb/>sion that she had a reasonable amount of food—if she had taken a very little food I might still expect to see fat on the body, it might be stored</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188002090154"/>
               <p>up irrespective of nutritive food—it would be quite possible for her not to have taken much food for a considerable time before her death and yet for her body to be fairly nourished—if the taking of raw spirits had continued uninterrupted to within a day or two of her death, I should have expected to find inflammation of the stomach; but supposing she had been drinking considerable quantities, and then ceased, say for a week before her death, and only took weak spirits and water, I should not expect to see any inflammation—if she had ceased to drink raw spirits for four days or a week before her death I think the mucous membrane of the stomach might have recovered itself, and I should not expect to find any trace of inflammation, and the stomach might not have presented an unhealthy appearance—from the appearances I saw on the post<lb/>mortem, the immediate cause of death was the enfeebled heart, or syncope—that is, from some cause or other, the heart ceased to act, and the patient died—from what I could judge on the post-mortem, and from the evidence, the syncope of the heart was due to the diseased condition of the liver—that is, the cirrhosis of the liver—the effect of cirrhosis is to contract the liver and diminish its size—this liver was larger than usual—that is what we frequently find soon after the disease has set in—the ultimate effect of cirrhosis is the contraction of the liver, but the earlier effect is otherwise; it is somewhat enlarged, and in cirrhosis its structure is altered; and as the disease goes on the structure becomes more and more altered, and it results at length in contraction—an excessive indul<lb/>dence in alcohol is nearly always, I believe, the cause of cirrhosis—excessive drinking produces a nervous collapse, and degenerates the whole of the tissues, and the collapse of the nerves affects the muscles—it would be likely to produce syncope of the heart if it was accompanied by organic disease in consequence, such as cirrhosis of the liver—I did not see Dr. Forman at all.</p>

When I say syncope of the heart 1 mean the result of a disease existing in the heart—the fatty degenera<lb/>tion of the heart causes syncope, and that was the immediate cause of death—it was the result of fatty degeneration in this particular case-fatty degeneration of the heart can be associated with the enlargement and cirrhosis of the liver, and frequently is—you may get fatty degenera<lb/>tion of the heart without any disease of the liver—you may have the fatty degeneration of the heart without the liver having anything to do with—it may cause death without the liver operating in any way to assist it, but usually where there is fatty degeneration the other organs are also affected—I have never met with any case in which a person with fatty degenera<lb/>tion of the heart had all the other organs healthy—I should not like to say whether the person might not die of fatty degeneration such as I discovered and yet the liver be a healthy organ, that is beyond my experience—in my experience it is extremely difficult to restrain anybody who has been once a drinker—I never met with a case of a man or woman yet where I could alter it when they have once assumed the habit, that is, after they had once given way to it chronically.</p>

                  </hi>. I a member of the Royal College of Surgeons—in November last I was living at 31, Nutford Place, I was staying there in apartments—I carried on my practice there—my name was not on the door—I first became acquainted with Paine on Thursday morning, 6th November, he was staying at the same house, I did not know it till that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188002090155"/>
               <p>morning—I did not know that he was staying there with Matthews—he came that morning to consult me about the lady who was at the coffee-house—he said she was passing under the name of Mrs. Paine, or in other words, as his wife—he did not tell me then what her real name was, afterwards he did, when I wrote the certificate that went to his brother: that was on the 12th—I am not quite sure whether he told me that her brother was Dr. Norman Maclean, then in America—I knew that I was writing the certificate for the brother's use—he did not tell me that Miss Maclean was the daughter of Colonel Maclean—he gave the brother's name as Norman Maclean—I don't remember whether he gave the prefix "doctor" or not—I did not inquire—in the course of my attendance on the lady I did not make any inquiries from Paine as to who her friends were, nor from her—I saw her first on the afternoon of that same day, the 6th—she was then in bed—she appeared to be very ill; indeed, she presented to me the appearance of a person who had evidently been having, vulgarly speaking, a long bout of drink<lb/>ing; she presented the appearance of a drunkard: medical men know that state under the term of alcoholism; her face was bloated, swollen, dusky in appearance, the pupils of the eyes were contracted, the con<lb/>punitive, or white parts of the eyes, were very much congested—she seemed quite powerless—her mind was not at all clear, she rambled during the time I was there, that is, she did not seem to be at all sensible of what was going on around, in a kind of stupor—my instructions were that she should cease to have spirits in any quantity, but that she should have weak brandy-and-water—it would be very bad for her to drink much raw spirits, either raw or diluted—raw. spirits would be more prejudicial to the patient than diluted—in my view the proper course of treatment was gradually to cease taking stimulants—I certainly did not think it would be wise to cease altogether, but to take weak brandy-and-water—i gave those instructions to Paine, and expected them to be carried out—I thought, under the circumstances, that the patient might rally, supposing my instructions were carried out—if my instructions were not carried out, I considered that life would be materially shortened—I think that in the condition she then was it would have been very dangerous to administer much stimulant, either raw or in any form—I thought that the patient did not require any medicine, she only required to leave off stimulants—I could tell that the liver was enlarged and congested—the symptoms were excessive hardness of the structure itself—a congested liver is not necessarily a result of excessive drinking, still it is more commonly due to that cause, and often leads to cirrhosis—cirrhosis may be described as a destructive inflammation of the tissue of the liver, and the ultimate result is that the liver becomes empty and puckered up, contracted—that is a very common result of excessive drinking—I did not, from what I saw of this lady, suspect cirrhosis—I attended her daily until her death, from the 6th to the 17th—on Wednesday, the 12th, I gave this certificate, "I hereby certify that I am at present attending Miss Annie Maclean, also known as Mrs. Lewis Paine, who has been suffering from mental and physical derangement, the latter referable to congestion of the liver; she is now improving, and I think will soon be convalescent"—I was induced to believe there was mental derangement, as Paine had told me about the adventure at Stratford-on-Avon, about the discovery of a pistol; according to his statement that worried her a good deal, and then her brother</p>

               <p>going away—I found that she did at times wander in her talk, imagined people were in the room when they were not, and so on; the physical de<lb/>rangement I have already described—I had not the slightest doubt in my own mind that it was a case of alcoholism—at the time I signed that certificate she was better; she was progressing, so far as I could judge under the circumstances, satisfactorily, hence the certificate—I saw her on the Thursday, Friday, and Saturday; her mind grew very much clearer—I was not present when she died, I was there a few minutes afterwards—I gave a certificate of the cause of death—the primary cause of death was congestion of the liver; the secondary cause was disease of the heart terminating in fatal syncope; the certificate is in the form of primary, secondary, and tertiary—the immediate cause of death was fatty degene<lb/>tion of the heart—by syncope I mean that the heart became so enfeebled that it ceased to act; syncope is simply the result of a feeble heart—the primary cause was congestion of the liver; I don't mean to say that that set up the syncope; in my view the lady died thus early from ex<lb/>cessive drinking; that would produce congestion of the liver, and probably cause the state of the heart I have described—the first effect of excessive drinking is collapse of the nervous system, that operates on the muscles and so enfeebles the heart; the sooner a drunken person leaves off stimulants the better; not suddenly, gradually, and then altogether.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not present at the post-mortem—I came to the conclusion that there was a feeble heart during my attendance upon her—I gave my certificate before the post-mortem—I heard when I came back 10 minutes afterwards that she was dead, and I assumed from that that the feeble heart ended in syncope—I had previously ascertained the existence of congestion of the liver—the death might have been occasioned by the state of the heart independently in any way whatever of the operation of the liver—either of those symptoms might have killed her—supposing cirrhosis killed a person it would be a very lingering death—I had not known Mr. Paine before the Thursday morning—he heard that I was a medical man and spoke to me—he gave me the history of the case—he said that he had brought a lady to town to have medical advice—he was pleased to find that there was a medical man in the house—he said the lady was passing as Mrs. Paine—she was under the impression that she was pregnant, he wished me to see her to satisfy her on that point, at the same time telling me that she had been for a length of time addicted to habits of intemperance—we then arranged that I should meet him in the afternoon at 128, Seymour Place—on our arrival I found the lady in bed, and in the presence of Mrs. Powell and himself made the required examination—I found that pregnancy did not exist—the appear<lb/>ances were owing to the enlarged condition of the liver, which was rendered more apparent from the pressure caused by the curvature of the spine—I did not prescribe medicinally—I instructed Paine that the stimulants were to be reduced, and that she was to have plenty of light food—I saw her every day from that time to the day of her death—it appeared to me there were occasions when my directions had not been carried out—I spoke to Paine about it, but I cannot remember what be answered—she appeared to me to be improving; in fact, on the Sunday following there was a very marked improvement—I judged that my instructions had not been carried out from her wandering in her speech more than I thought correct—I saw spirits given to her upon the first</p>

               <p>occasion only—I think it was rum which Paine gave her then, mixed with water—he took it from a flat bottle in his, pocket—having poured out the rum, if rum it was, he turned round to me and said, "Now, doctor, I will show you her weakness," upon which she replied, "Lewis, I don't want it"—he then said, "You artful little devil; you would take it if he were not here," meaning myself—when he used that expression, it did not seem as if it were in unkindness, it seemed more as if it were in joke than anything—there was no repulsion on her part towards him—I saw her frequently alone—she never made any complaint, and always spoke of Paine in the kindest way—I am not aware that Paine ever gave her any stimulant after that day—I did not ask her any questions, I was guided by her general appearance—I remember Friday, the 7th of November—I deny that he uncorked a bottle of whisky while I was there—I never saw him uncork any whisky—it is not true that he gave the deceased some, and that I took some too; there is not a word of truth in it—I remember on the morning of the 17th, saying that she would live for twenty years yet—I will explain that—on that morning I found her very bad—her face was dusky and she was complaining of shortness of breath, which I ascertained to arise from congestion of the left lung—for this I ordered a linseed-meal and mustard poultice, and administered to her spoonfuls of hot diluted brandy—at this time Powell came into the room and said audibly, "Anybody can see she is dying"—I said, "No; she is not dying in the sense that you understand dying"—when I called in the evening she had considerably rallied—observation was made again that she was dying, and I, with a view to calm and reassure the patient, said that she might live for twenty years, or as long as any of us—that was not my real view or impression, but was simply given with a view to cheer the patient—I did not expect her to die so suddenly; but still, I was not surprised—she might have rallied and lived for months, perhaps even years—if spirits had been given five days before death inflammation would have been quite distinctly visible—her tongue was always what we call clean, by which I mean not covered with fur;—it was not ulcerated or raw at any time—I know of her having beef tea, I gave her some myself—after my instructions I have seen tumblers, probably containing a third or so of diluted brandy—I ordered no castor oil, nor did I see any—I have been in practice about eighteen years—I prescribed no medicine at all—if any spirits were administered according to my directions they were in water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The administration of raw spirits would produce inflam<lb/>mation of the stomach—if the patient had been accustomed to take con<lb/>siderable quantities of spirits, it would only intensify the effects—if the administration ceased, I should still expect to find the stomach inflamed at the end of a week or 10 days—assuming that raw spirits had been taken for weeks previously, it would have taken weeks to have recovered from it—the history of her case, as I understood from Paine, was that she had been drinking in excess up to the time I saw her—excessive drinking would produce inflammation of the stomach—I should have expected that the post-mortem examination would have revealed those appearances; even if my instructions had been obeyed, especially in a constitution such as hers, where the power of recovery was so singularly small—it was a very strong stomach—I think a strong stomach would inflame as readily as a weak one, in fact more readily—as a rule, in all cases of persons dying from excessive drinking, I should expect to find the</p>

               <p>stomach inflamed—I have invariably found it so in my experience—it is almost a sign positive—catarrh of the stomach is one of the results of inflammation, and invariably associated with drink—large quantities alcohol would excite catarrh of the stomach—persons suffering from prostration by fever can take large quantities of alcohol, live on it, in fact you may say, entirely for a period without exciting catarrh, without setting up inflammation—a person very much debilitated could not take I arge quantities of spirit—a debilitated person, in all probability would haw catarrh set up from raw spirits, or, in fact, if spirits were diluted to any extent; still, it would be more likely to occur in a healthy person—I remember the prisoner saying, "Now I will show you her weakness"—I am not quite clear as to what he gave her; I think it was rum, with a little water; I won't be quite sure; it was my first appearance on the scene, consequently I was taken by surprise—I thought it rather strange—it was not at all necessary for me to be convinced of her weak<lb/>ness—I think she took a sip of it after he made use of that expression—I don't think she took it all; I can't be certain about that; I won't be quite sure—the rum was taken out of a small flat bottle, as far as I recollect; but the transaction altogether was so quick, and I being a stranger, I had not time to notice; he took it out of his pocket—I think the cork was simply removed by finger and thumb—I am not sure whether it was a glass stopper—I have no recollection of a cork being drawn—I think I can say that I am quite positive about it, and that I never had any of the spirits with Paine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Charles Harrington, of Bermondsey Market, a dealer in hides—on 21st December the prisoner came to me in the market, and said he had got three hides to sell for a man; he had them in a cart—I bought them; one of them was a bull's hide—I cannot say whether it was a roan bull hide, as I was busy at the time—it was afterwards sold to Osier and Palmer with 11 more, perhaps two hours afterwards—I got 38<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I bought all the three.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. George Allison, of 17 in the Meat Market—on Saturday, 10th January, the prisoner came to our shop between 1 and 2 o'clock, with a man named Robinson—I did not know them—the prisoner asked if we had any borsch tubs—that is a substitute for butter packed in tubs—I showed him some, the market price of which was as per cwt.—he asked how many we had—I said we had 11 and could only spare 10 of them—he agreed to the price—it would come to 10 guineas—he asked me for the bill—he then wrote this cheque in my presence for 10 guineas—I took it to Mr. Allison and let the goods go by the carrier Orchard—we have no more to do after we see the goods delivered to the carrier—the cheque was paid in on the Monday—I have nothing to do with the cash—I next see the prisoner on Tuesday, the 13th, with Robinson—he asked me if we had any more bosch tubs left—I said I had not, but I had something that would suit him as well in the shape of six boxes of the same article—he chose the lot—he also chose some American cheese at 70<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt, and five sides of bacon at 74<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt, total 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and including the Saturday's goods 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I made out a bill and he wrote out a cheque for 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the clerk referred to Mr. Allison—Mr.' Allison hesitated—the prisoner said "Well, Mr. Allison, you had a cheque of mine on Saturday, and you have had one or two before," and he referred Mr. Allison to Messrs. Towers and Cheshire, in the market—I went away and inquired and came back and told Mr. Allison about the reference—then the cheque was taken and the goods were taken away—we took possession of some of the goods and some were returned from Kennington Lane Police-station.</p>

George Allison. I carry on business in the Market—I had no trans<lb/>action with the prisoner prior to 24th December, when ho bought some salt pork amounting to between 21. and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is the cheque that wag then paid me for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Mr. Catt handed me this cheque on 10th for 10 guineas—I did not see the prisoner then—I paid the cheque into the Capital and Counties Bank, Ludgate Hill branch—I saw the prisoner on the 13th—the cheque came back to me later that day, marked "Refer to drawer"—the prisoner that day offered me a cheque for 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said "I have already received a cheque from you for 10 guineas I want a reference for this"—he said "It will be all right"—I said "You are not personally known to me"—he said "I can give you any amount of references"—I said "Who are they?"—he said "Gurrier knows me," that is a salesman, "and Messrs. Tower and Cheshire"—I said "Well, I should like to know something about you"—I then sent Catt to Tower and Cheshire's—he came back and said they had had one or two small cheques—I said "I will take it this time, but I don't care about it"—he said "Oh, it is all right"—afterwards the two cheques came back together—I went over to the prisoner's place, at 117, Lower Marsh—it is a small cupboard of a shop—I waited two and a quarter hours—I then went to the Capital and Counties Bank and got a report from the manager—then I went and saw Orchard the carrier to know where he had taken my goods to—I then took Orchard's horse and cart with my two men and went to a little dairy in Sussex Street, Limehouse—I found nothing in the shop—in the back kitchen I found the bacon, the cheeses, and the boxes of butteries; the whole of the goods represented by the 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque with the exception of one gammon of bacon—it was about 4 p.m on Tuesday, the 14th—I saw the prisoner in the shop—we put the goods in Orchard's cart and took them away—I did not see the tubs of bosch—they were afterwards given me by the police.</p>

I am one of the firm of Charlesworth and Austin, tobacco manufacturers, of 48 and 49, Blackman Street—Mr. Eastley, of Potter's Bar, is our traveller—we send him the packages by rail for dis<lb/>tribution—on 18th December I caused a case to be packed up with various parcels of tobacco, each parcel being addressed to each individual consignee,</p>

               <p>the whole case being addressed to Mr. Eastley—this tobacco is mine—in consequence of hearing of the loss of this parcel I communicated with my solicitor and with the police—I received instructions from them, and made an arrangement, in consequence of which, on 2nd January, I went with Detectives Walsh and Harvey to 42, Harmon Street, Hoxton, Gill's house—I saw a man outside who said "This is the man who is going to buy the tobacco"—that was in Gill's presence—I said "Where is it?"—Gill said "In my house"—I left the detectives and went into the house with Gill, down stairs into a room—it is an eight-roomed house—Gill closed and locked the door after us—he had told me his wife knew nothing of it—he unlocked a side cupboard and brought out the tobacco on the table—it is all here—he said "I am not in the tobacco trade, I want 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound for it"—said "How much have you?"—he said "From 70lb. to 80lb."—we there estimated the quantity between ourselves by overhauling it—I offered hut 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the quantity of about 76lb. or 78lb.—he said "I cannot take that amount, as I gave 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and I have to share the profit with another man"—estimating that 70lb. odd at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound in round figures, I said "You must have sold some, or else you will not have much to share," and I said as 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not agreeable to his wishes, I would buy 4lb. weight—I then arranged to take out six packages from this box, which he put in his pocket, and I took this loose tobacco out of a 4lb. parcel, and put it in this box to make up the 4lb.—it is a 4lb. box—the bargain was then complete, except I I had not paid for it—he put the remainder away, and went with me to I show some to another party, whom I told him I was buying this for, after locking the door—I then told the detectives "This man has more of this tobacco belonging to me"—he was then taken into custody—I then heard somebody say "What's o'clock?" or some such remark—the value of the big parcel was about 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
