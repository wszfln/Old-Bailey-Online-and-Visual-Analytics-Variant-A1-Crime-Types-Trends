There were many strong presumptions against him; as, that they lived untowardly together; that he had threatned her of late, in case she did not comply with his humour to part with some Estate which he could not dispose of without her. Nor was the manner of her death less suspitious: For he takes her with him on horse-back to Barnet, under some pretences,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16791210003"/>and in the evening, as they came back, in a lonesome place by a Wood-side, she was kill'd. He pretends that three Thieves came to rob him, and that she skream'd out; which so incensed the Robbers, that one of them knockt her down with so violent a blow, that he then believed it mortal, as afterwards he found: And besides, that they made at her with their Swords. That thereupon he did fight with the Thieves, who cut him, at least his Cloaths; for he produced his Hat and Coat, which had several gashes, so also had his Stick, which was found by the Body, though many suspected these might be made on purpose; for himself had no considerable wounds, onely one small hurt on the head, and another on the arm. He further told his Story, that having so destroy'd his Wife, and master'd him, two of them forced him into the Wood, and that he saw the third drag his Wife such a way: that they turn'd his Horse into the Field, and took from himself seven or eight shillings in money, all that he had, and then bound his legs with a string, and his arms behinde him with a piece of the Reyns of his Bridle, and so left him: That with much struggling he got his feet at liberty, but with his hands so bound, went to an house about half a mile off and got them to loose him, though the man that did swore it was so indifferently done, that he believed he might have got them open himself. Whilst this horrid Act was done, there was a man doing some business in a field neer the place, who testifies that he did hear one sudden violent Shriek, and no more noise; upon which, fearing some mischief might be done, he hollowed five or six times, but received no Answer: And this very man happening to be employed to drive the Cart that carried the Body home, the Prisoner understanding that he was the person that had so been in the said Field, askt him the same Question six times in driving that two or three miles, though he returned him a plain Answer; which some attributed to the guilty apprehensions and terror of mind, that the Prisoner was then under. When he raised the Countrey, as aforesaid, to seek his Wife, they found her drowned, as well as otherwise Murdered, for she lay in a very obscure place (which was observed he directed them unto) near water, in which her Head had been, for her Hoods and upper part of her cloaths were wet; she had a Wound in her Head, but many that saw it were apt to believe that it was made with a pair of Sizzars, &amp;c.
