Ridley, Whitley, and Co., at their branch establishment, 292, Essex Road, Islington, floorcloth manufacturers—I have been acting as manager since 1st July—on the 1st October, about two o'clock, the prisoner came to the warehouse; I had ever seen him before to my knowledge—he said, "I want to buy a job lot of floorcloth," or words to that effect—I took him through and showed him several lots of goods, and quoted the prices for them—he came up close to me and said, "I will make it all right with you, you understand," and he pushed a sovereign into my hand, which I gave back to him—I showed him three or four lots together, and offered them to him for £20; he said, "Take £10 and £2 for yourself"; I said, "No, I can't do that"; he then offered me £12 and £2; after that £14 and £2, and eventually, when we got back into the office, he offered me £16 and £2—in the office, before we came to a final agree<lb/>ment, he slipped a sovereign into my hand again; I opened my hand and let it drop on the office floor, and he picked it up—finally I agreed to take £18 for the goods; that was the lowest price I was autho<lb/>rised to part with the goods for—the prisoner paid £15 10s. then, and promised to come later and pay the balance and take the goods away—I think there was a small cheque, and the rest cash—I was not there when he returned; I understand he did call; I waited until three—on the next afternoon I mentioned what had taken place to Mr. Holding, one of the principals—and I mentioned it to one or two fellows in the office he same afternoon, Mason was one of them—on the following day,</p>

               <p>October 2nd, I again saw the prisoner about five—he said, "I want you to make me up a job lot, and I will give you a <hi rend="italic">fiver</hi> for yourself"—no business was done that day; I told him I was very busy, I had letters to write, and I put him off till Monday—that day I wrote to Scotland Yard, immediately he had gone—on the Monday morning I sent a telegram to the Islington works, postponing the matter till Wednesday—meantime, on the Saturday, I communicated what had happened to Mr. Whitley, one of the principals—on Wednesday, 7th October, about half-past three, the prisoner came to the office—at that time Detective Drew was there, under the counter; I took the prisoner round to the warehouse, and showed him three or four lots of goods; among them was a lot of 184 pieces, which I offered him for £150—I told him that was the lowest clearing price—he counted the number of pieces, but did not say any<lb/>thing special about them—we then went back to the office, and he took a sovereign from his purse and offered it me in the same way as before—we were leaning over the counter talking—I refused it—he took full particulars on paper; I gave him the quantities—he said he did not see his way clear to buy them—we then talked about other things—I asked him what he was going to do with the goods, if he had a warehouse—he said he had a warehouse in Fashion Street, Spital-fields, I think, but I am not very clear—he said he would think it over and come back next day; Drew was still in the room—on the next day, the 8th, he came to the office about eleven in the forenoon; Drew was again there, in the same position as before—the prisoner began by asking if I would have something to drink; he followed that up by saying, "You're a teetotaler, ain't you?"—I said, "Yes"—he then said he had been looking through the particulars of the goods, and that he could not buy them—I said they were a very cheap lot, and I could not take less—£150 was mentioned several times—he went up and had another look at the goods; I did not go with him—I sent one of my men with him—he came back, and then he saw a grease spot on my trousers, and called my attention to it—I said it was an old pair of trousers—he said, "I wish you would give me your private address, I will send my tailor to you and make you a new suit of clothes"—I laughed, and said, "Do you deal in cloth, then?"—he said, "I deal in everything"—at last I said, "It is clear we are not going to do any business, let us go and have some lemonade;" we went out, and went first to a tobacco-shop a few doors off, where I got some tobacco, and then went across to the Northampton Arms; I had some lemonade, I don't know what he had; he paid for it; we sat down in a private bar, and he again offered me a sovereign, which I refused—he said, "This is nothing to do with anybody else what I will do"—I then put the sovereign in my pocket, and afterwards in this envelope; this is it—he then said, "I began to be suspicious of you; I began to think you were not all right, you would not say anything"—I said, "It is not for me to say any<lb/>thing, that is for you"—he said, "Well I began to think you were one of the governors, it kept me awake all night thinking about it; I mid to myself, 'Good God! what have I done?' another thing made me suspicious; I saw several gentlemen go in and out of your office yesterday morning, and I did not like it; and another thing, one of your gentlemen came and looked through the window of your office while we were talking"—he described the gentleman's appearance—I said, "Then you were</p>

               <p>about there all the morning yesterday?"—he said, "Yes"; I said, "where were you? I did not see you"—he said, "Never mind where I was, I saw you"—he showed me a pocket-book with a lot of notes in, he turned them over and said he had £45 in notes and £15 in gold in his pocket—he said, "I will give you a piece of paper, but not here, I would like you to give me your private address, I would rather give it you at your own place"—I gave him my address, 11, Bedford Road, Tottenham, on apiece of paper—he said, "You know this ain't robbery;" he also said, "I always pay well; the last job I sent the man something to his private house, and nobody ever knew where it came from"—he then said he would come down—I said, "When will you come? you had better come this evening at seven"—I arranged with Drew to be there—the prisoner arrived soon after seven; I let him in, and took him into the room where Brew was secreted, after he had taken off his coat—my daughter was in a room on the other side of the passage—I gave him a seat, and locked the door and said, "Now let us get to business; what is it you want me to do?"—he said, "I will give you a piece of paper";—I asked what he meant by a piece of paper—he said, "A £5 note"—I said, "Which lot do you propose to buy?"—he said, "The 184 pieces"—I said, "What do you propose to pay for them"—he said, "£80"—I said, "When are you going to fetch them away?"—he said, "To-morrow; what will be the beat time?"—I said, "About two in the afternoon is the quietest time; when will you give me the £5, now?"—he said, "No, when the goods are on the van, and I have paid for them, I will shake hands with you with a piece of paper"—his pipe had gone out, and he could not make it draw, and I reached up to the gas burner to light a piece of paper, and it caught my thumb-nail and accidentally turned the gas out—directly after that Drew came out of his place behind an American organ, and arrested him as I went and opened the door—I heard the prisoner say a lot of things, one was asking to be forgiven, and he said, "Do, Mr. Dash, get me a knife to cut my throat"—I think I showed the sovereign that I have produced to Mason and one or two others when I got back.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not hear all that passed between the prisoner and Drew—when I turned the gas out the room was in darkness till I opened the door; there was a light in the passage—Drew was quite concealed behind the organ—my employers carry on business at 48, New<lb/>gate Street—the warehouse in Essex Road was in my' charge since 1st July—it was in contemplation to give it up—there were perhaps four or five thousand of these pieces in the warehouse—they were not samples or remnants, they were the remains of old stock—the price at which I offered them was 25 per cent. off the list price and 5 per cent, discount for cash; that was the lowest limit I had to offer, that was Mr. Whitley's authority, the head of the firm—that was my general instruction—the prisoner told me he had been to Newgate Street, and had been sent on from there; he showed me one of our labels, which I recognised—I think the first time he men<lb/>tioned the warehouse in Fashion Street was on the 7th—he said he acted as cook at the soup-kitchen in the warehouse—he never connected that with his warehouse—I don't remember that anything was said as to my position at the warehouse, I think he would take that for granted—when ho first came he said he wanted a job lot, I showed him perhaps six or seven lots before I came to this lot—I asked him if he would buy</p>

               <p>by the square yard—he said he only wanted to buy job lots—I did not say he could have the first lot for £12—I did not say I should want £30 for the lots I ultimately sold him—he did not say that was too dear, it was not worth £14—he did not then offer £15, nor did I say he should have it for £22; there was no such conversation—£16 and £20 were mentioned, but not in the order in which you put them—he said, "I will give you all I have got in my pocket"—I said, "It depends how much you have got," and he emptied his pocket—I said they were worth £20, and that he would clear £10—the money in his pocket, including a small cheque, came to £15 10s.—the price of £18 was agreed on before the money was counted—no one else was present at that moment—the negotiation between us lasted twenty minutes or half an hour; when we got back to the office he put the sovereign into my hand before we had agreed the price—I deny that there was no offer of £1—I heard he had been to the office in the afternoon and taken away the goods; I did not see him then—it was about five o'clock on 2nd October when I caw him; the only offer made then was that of a <hi rend="italic">fiver</hi> to make him up a job lot; there was no actual offer of coin—the conversation was open, and took place in the warehouse; about fifty men were about there, but it is a large place, and there was no one near enough to hear what was said—he was a stranger to me before the 1st—the second time on that 1st I let the £1 drop on the floor, and no doubt he picked it up and put it into his pocket again—I cannot say whether there was any question in his mind on the 1st that I was not likely to take money; I made it pretty apparent what my conduct was; I was rather surprised that he offered it a second time, and I was still more surprised that next day, I having twice refused the £1 on the first, he should offer me £5; I expressed my surprise to the men in the office—I said to the prisoner I could not do that sort of thing—I next saw him on the 7th, I think—on the 8th we went to the public-house—I did not say to him, "You can afford it; you made enough money out of that lot; you did not behave well to me," nothing of the sort—I did not say, "I should not care very much if I could get a pair of trousers out of it"—in the office he noticed my trousers were spotted with grease, and suggested that I should have a new pair—nothing was said about trousers at the public-house—he did not say, "I did not like to offer you anything, I took you for one of the governors"—I did not say, "No, I am only manager, they took me away from the shop in Newgate Street and sent me here to be salesman to clear out the goods," I don't remember that—he said he took me for one of the governors, but the other things I don't remember—<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say, "I thought you were one of the governors," and then "If I don't offend you there is a sovereign," handing you one? and did you say, "Thank you," and take it? and did the prisoner say," I have concluded my bargain and made something out of it"? intimating that if, in clearing the warehouse, you came across anything you was to keep it, and let him know and he would come—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The only things about that that is true are that he thought I was one of the governors, and that he gave me a sovereign; I don't think anything else of that is correct—it was not suggested to me that if I came across any more remnants I should let the prisoner know, and that he would come—I did not say, "Yes, I will; if there are any job lots left when we come to clear out the warehouse I will let you know"—I produce that sovereign</p>

               <p>—we had a lot of pears last summer, I mentioned that to him—he suggested he should come to my house, and fixed the time—nothing was said about pears then, I think; in a previous conversation I said I had about 2,000 pears—most of them were given away; we have some at home now—I did not hold out as an inducement that he should come and dispose of these pears; I don't know what he had in his mind—I did not hear him say anything about pears when he came to my house; I did not suggest that he should eat one, and he did not do so; nothing was said about pears, and they were not produced, to the best of my recollection—there was no tea—he did not say, "I did not come to transact any business, I came to look at the pears"—I had the policeman behind the organ—the conversation was not that I said, "How much are you going to give me, £10 or £5?" and that he said, "What do you mean? I don't know what you mean"—he did not say anything of that sort; he offered me £5 directly—I did not hold out my hand—the prisoner did not then say, "Are you a Forester?" he spoke about being a Forester or Oddfellow when he said what he meant by shaking hands with me with a piece of paper—I did not say, "I am not a Forester, I am an Oddfellow; never mind all that, you give me £5 now"—nothing was said about that—when I asked him if he was going to give me the £5 now, he said he had brought no money with him—I did not say, "Come to-morrow and bring £5 with you, and then I will shake hands with you;" he said that—the prisoner's pipe had gone out; I tried to light it, and while doing so the one gas-burner which was alight went out, and as there was no other light in the room, and that produced complete darkness, I went out to get a light, and as I opened the door to do so I heard the organ moving—I did not see the constable jump out and seize the prisoner by the throat—with regard to the £150 lot the goods were patterns which were out of print, old designs—a sovereign was offered three times altogether on the 7th, once when the detective was there—I have no recollection that the prisoner ever made an offer for the £150 lot—I heard the detective say he heard offers of £75 and £80—on the 8th I did not tell the prisoner I had sold some of the 184 pieces, but I told him I had sold some of the other lots—when the £1 was offered on the 7th the detective was under the counter, we were leaning over the counter; the prisoner was speaking in a very confidential tone then—in my original statement to the solicitor I said that the prisoner said, "I always pay well; the last time I sent something to the man's private house, and no one knew where it came from"—it was not asked me at the Police-court, and I did not say it there—my evidence was not read over to me there; I asked to be allowed to read it through, and they said they could not let me; they had not time and could not wait, and then I signed it;—I don't know if any goods had been stolen from the warehouse before I went there on 1st July; the stocktaking on 30th June showed a large deficiency—there was no stocktaking between 30th June and 1st October—I do not know if it was in consequence of the deficiency that I was put in charge of the warehouse; I should say not—I did not know of the deficiency then, not till the beginning of September probably—I knew it when the balance-sheet was struck, which was perhaps at the end of September or beginning of October; it took some time to work out the figures—it was before I saw the prisoner—my predecessor was one of the firm, who retired on 1st July—stock is only taken once a year—I did</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We think there was a large deficiency of stock on 1st July—stock was taken on 30th June, and the amount was estimated fully two months afterwards—we had not taken stock between 1st July and 8th October—a member of our firm had had charge of the Essex Road warehouse to a certain extent, but he had managers under him who had to pay attention to the business generally, not only foremen—one foreman is not in our employment now—a number of persons are not in our employment now, but it is not consequent on the deficiency, but because we had made up our minds to dismiss a certain number of the staff there before the stocktaking was finished—we were not able to find out in any way how this large deficiency of stock had arisen.</p>

On 3rd October I received instruc<lb/>tions from Scotland Yard, and went to these premises in Essex Road, where I saw Mr. Dash, who made a statement to me—after seeing Mr. Whitley I suggested sending off a telegram to alter the date from Monday, 5th, to Wednesday, 7th—that was sent—on Wednesday, 7th, I went to the premises and to Mr. Dash's office, and there I concealed myself under the counter—about half-past three p.m. the prisoner came in—Mr. Dash was there, and left the office with him—shortly after they returned, and a conversation took place between them; I heard part of it, it was in reference to the different lots—the prisoner asked for par<lb/>ticulars as to each lot that had been shown—I heard £60 mentioned: for one lot, £150 for another, £210 for another—an appointment was made for the prisoner to come back next morning, and he left, taking with him the particulars of the different lots—I could not hear all the conversation from where I was concealed, as they moved about the office—the next day, the 8th, I again concealed myself in the same place—the prisoner came in about half-past ten, and there was further conversation about pieces and prices, and then he and Mr. Dash left the office together—I could not hear all the conversation—afterwards Mr. Dash returned alone in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes' time, and an arrangement was made between me and Mr. Dash that I should go to his private house that evening; he also showed me a sovereign—that evening I went to 11, Bedford Road, Tottenham, shortly before seven—Mr. Dash let me in, and I saw Miss Dash there—I went into the front room ground floor, and effectually concealed myself behind a small American organ drawn diagonally across the room; I was between the organ and the corner—after a short time the prisoner came in; Mr. Dash entered the room with him—I could hear pretty well what took place—Mr. Dash said, "Let us get to business; what is it you want me to do?"—the prisoner said, "I want to give you a piece of paper for yourself"—Mr. Dash said, "What do you mean, £5 or £10?"—the prisoner said, "£5; which lot is the 184 pieces?"—Mr. Dash said, "The £150 lot"—the prisoner said, "When would be the best time to take them away?"—Mr. Dash said, "About two o'clock to-morrow afternoon; when are you going to give me the £5?"—the prisoner said, "To-morrow, when you give me the goods to take away"—Mr. Dash said, "Why not give it to me now? You had plenty of money this afternoon, £60; what did you do with it?"—he said, "I left it at home; there is the other large piece there, the other lot, could you put them in for me with them?"—Mr. Dash said, Yes"—the prisoner said, "When I come to take the things away I will shake hands with you, and put it in your hand"—the prisoner said he would give £80 for the £150 lot; Mr. Dash said, "What do you propose to pay?" and he said £80—he asked if he was a Forester, and he would show him how Foresters shook hands; that was in connection with the giving of the money—the gas was turned out, and Mr. Dash opened the door and let in some light From the hall, and then I emerged from my hiding-place, and in doing so the organ was pushed on one side, and directly the prisoner heard the organ move he made a rush out into the passage, and I caught him just against the street door, and before I said anything to him he cried out at once, when</p>

I have been led into it"—he asked me to give him a knife, and he would cut his throat, or to get a knife and cut his throat for him—I was unable to say anything to him; this lasted very nearly five minutes, and for the whole of that time he was crying and halloaing out—when I got an opportunity I said, "lama police officer; I am going to take you into custody on a charge of inciting Mr. Dash to steal from his master"—he began again, and said, "Oh, forgive me! I have been led into it"—we pacified him; I put his coat and hat on, and took him to the station, where the inspector charged him with inciting Mr. Dash to steal; he was crying; he said, "I did not steal anything; I have not stolen anything"—I said, "You are not charged with stealing; you are charged with inciting Dash to steal"—he said, "I have been led into it"—he gave his name and address as Jacob de Kromme, 54, Cornwall Street, Shad well, and described himself as a costermonger; that was his general business—I went to 54, Cornwall Street—his name was not up, but there was a board with "Dutch Pickles Sold" on it—it was a very small one-storied house, with ground and first floors—there was a very small shop—there were Dutch pickles, in bottles and half-barrels, as they are usually sold—I have been to Fashion Street, Spitalfields; there was no warehouse there belonging to the prisoner, but I made careful inquiries—there is a soup-kitchen there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that there was no case to go to the Jury. With regard to the counts charging the inciting the witness Bash to commit larceny, if the facts did not disclose that there could be any felony in Dash for disposing of his master's goods, there could not be a misdemeanour in the prisoner for inciting him to commit that offence. If Dash had sold the goods for less than their proper price, that would be a breach of his duty; but he could not be indicted for stealing, as he would not have appropriated the goods to his own use, but only sold them for his master, deriving for himself some pecuniary benefit by the transaction. As to the counts charging an incitement to conspire to cheat and defraud the prosecutors of their goods and moneys, there could be no such conspiracy, because no moneys had passed into the prosecutor's possession, and a person could not be defrauded of what he had not got, and no goods would have passed into the possession of Dash. It was no more than a corrupt arrangement to let the prisoner have a good bargain. The last count charged incitement to conspire to steal, and the same arguments would apply. An incite<lb/>ment to commit something which did not amount to a misdemeanour could not itself be a misdemeanour. Upon the whole, therefore, the counts, although good in form, failed from want of evidence.</hi>

If Dash had fallen in with the suggestion made by the prisoner, and had allowed the goods to leave the premises on payment of a less price than should have been paid, a joint felony would have been committed by them.</hi>

I am a widow, and keep the Admiral Carter public-house—on Saturday, 14th November, about 2.47 p.m. I cleared the till—I saw the prisoner in the bar about 2.55; I heard him ask my bar<lb/>maid for a glass of ale, and as he was going he asked her if we made penny<lb/>worths of Barton, which caused me to look up, and I noticed him—I saw him go out—he came in again about five minutes afterwards by the back entrance, which brought him into a different compartment—I walked towards him, and he asked me for half a pint of ale—I called to the barmaid, and she brought it—he asked me if I sold pennyworths of bitter—I said, "No"—that raised my suspicion, and I looked at him again—he tendered a sixpence—I went with the barmaid to the till, and tested the coin with a bottle of acid with which I test silver; it turned black—I took it to the break, and broke it in two pieces—this was the second coin—I said to the prisoner, "You nave been here before"—he said, "No, I have not"—I said, "You came in at the front entrance"—he said, "Oh, no; I did not"—I then went to the till, and there was only one sixpence there, the first one; I put the acid on it and it turned black—I said to my barman, in the prisoner's hearing, "Just see to this man, will you?" holding the broken sixpence in my hand the last one tendered—the barman said, "What is the meaning of this?"—I did not hear the prisoner answer, but I saw him tender a shilling to the barman, and say, "See, is that a good one?"—it was good—I said to the barman, "He has given another bad sixpence; charge him"—I sent for a constable, and he was given in custody—I do not know what became of the first sixpence.</p>

I am a widow, of 58, Fort Road, Grange Road, Bermondsey—on 18th October, I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">People</hi>; similar to this—my son answered it, and ordered a ton of coal, which I received on the 20th, a few pounds overweight—the carman gave me this paper, which was signed—I paid 18s. 6d. to the carman—I tried to burn the coals; they lit, and then went out; they only burned for about five minutes; just flared up and then went out; we put more on, and lit them again—the sulphur was dreadful, and I think they are bricks, tiles, and all sorts of rubbish—they only make a fire for about five minutes—I tried to cook with them, and could not cook a good dinner on Sunday, but in the week I could, with very great patience, by keeping on lighting it, and putting fresh on, and stirring it up—these are some of them; I have made a fowls' run with the rest; these have been through the fire—a few days after I received them I took a sample up to Messrs. Rymill and Co., in the King's Cross Road, and left them with an old gentleman—I went to a small office in the large yard, and then to a smaller place—I got the address from the <hi rend="italic">People</hi>; it was not the same number as that on the delivery bill—I never heard anything from them—I wrote two letters, as well as taking the sample, but got no answer—I" showed the stuff in my coal-cellar to a gentleman who called last Satur<lb/>day evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Penny, a commercial traveller, of 22, Petherton Road, Finsbury Park—on 14th November I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> giving an address at 202, York Road, King's Cross. (<hi rend="italic">This advertisement was in the same terms as before</hi>)—my husband wrote to that address, and on 16th November I was present when a ton of something was delivered—this bill was presented, and I paid 18s.—I thought I was getting good coal, the same as was advertised—I tried to light it the same day in the dining-room; it burns for a little while and then goes quite dead, and leaves these lumps of slate—next day I tried it in the kitchen, but it was worse, if anything,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189112140027"/>
               <p>than before—then I tried it in the dining-room again in the evening, and we had to go to bed early because we could get no fire, and it was so cold—on Wednesday we had no fire, and I got some in from the greengrocer's, and afterwards from the Darfield Main—I used a gas-stove for cooking—these are samples of Rymill's coal; it is in my cellar still; I have not touched it since—last Saturday two men connected with Rymill, I believe, came and looked at the coal—my husband wrote to Mr. Rymill on the Tuesday night, and on the Thursday I went to King's Cross and walked up York Road to find him; I was going to 252, the number on my bill, but I saw "Rymill" on the window of 202, and knocked at the door, but no one opened it—I went to 252 and found it was a sweetstuff shop, and I did not find him—on Friday, 20th, I went to the Police-court and a warrant was granted—after that we received this letter, dated 23rd November. (<hi rend="italic">This apologised for not previously replying; regretted that the wrong coal should have been delivered, owing to the loaders error, and expressed willingness to take it back, refund the amount paid, and allow any reasonable com<lb/>pensation for expenses that might have been caused.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The coal were brought to me about 10.30 a.m. in ten sacks; it was the first purchase I had made from Rymill and Co.—I counted the sacks, but I did not look at the coals; they were put in the cellar—at 4.30 I lighted the dining-room fire with them—I have all of the coals left now but about three pailfuls—we took these pieces from the top of the front of the coal, we did not move it; I did not tell him which pieces to pick out—I do not know that that is a piece of <hi rend="italic">sigillaria</hi>; there is a great deal of it in the ton—this piece has been passed through the fire—I said at the Police-court I could not find Rymill; I did not, to my knowledge, tell them there that I saw the name "Rymill and Co. order office"—I swore an information—the prisoner may have carried on business for a great many years as a coal merchant—I took the Magistrate's advice and got a warrant—the prisoner was arrested that afternoon, and next day the Magistrate admitted him to bail after he heard the case—when the two gentlemen came to my house they saw nearly the whole of the ton—they asked for specimens; I refused to let them have any, because I was not told to do so—I did not know they had got specimens from other people; if I had known that they should have had some from me—I have no reason to doubt that I had the proper and true weight—I said at the Police-court that the best coal might be at 27s. a ton; I do not know the price—I expected to get good Wallsend coals for 18s., as advertised—I said at the Police-court that I expected to get the best coal for 18s.—I did not try to bum these coals with any others—I said at the Police-court they must be burnt by themselves—I have been paying at the rate of 22s. a ton for the coals, which I have been buying by the cwt., ever since.</p>

Office of Works—I have had thirty years' experience in reference to coal—I have examined the samples in this case—of this sample, TK 3, this piece is coal; all the rest is impure matter which is found in coal; this consists of shaly seams, and is commonly called slate; and these contain stones and pyrites; they are found in a very large number of coals, but they vary in proportion; some coals have very little, others have much—the shale is slightly combustible; you can extract bitumen and paraffin from it; it is not coal—of MB 2 this piece has been through the fire—there is a small piece of coal here, but that is veined with impure matter; all this is shale and slate—it is not possible to make a fire of this in an ordinary grate; you could ignite the pieces of coal if you had sufficient wood, but you could not maintain a fire—AM 3 is all shale, there is no coal in it; this is a piece of stony</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Coal frequently extends over fifty or sixty feet, interstratified with sandstone and shale—it would cost between 7s. and 8s. 6d. per ton to bring coals up to the North-Western wharves from the coal districts—I did think you could not get any coal at the pit's mouth under 4s. a ton—it costs about 2s. 6d. to 3s. to take a ton of coal from the wharf to a private house—this lump of sigillaria is not a specimen of all the ton of coals Mrs. Penny got; I consider she has made a selection of what she calls the defect in the coal.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 34, Erdley Road, Camberwell, and am a coal merchant—friends of the prisoner have called on me to examine, as a coal merchant, certain coals supplied by the prisoner, who is un<lb/>known to me—on Saturday last I called on Mrs. Penny, at 1.40, and told her I called to see the coal; she told me it was inconvenient, and did not allow me to see it—I returned in about half-hour and saw the coal; there was about 18 cwt. in the cellar; I asked Mrs. Penny to let me take a sample; she consulted her husband, and they declined—I should say it would be a fair coal to deliver at 18s. a ton, taking the Working expenses into account, and so on—I know the coal trade in London well—the cheapest coal at the pit's mouth would be 3s. or 4s.; the railway rate would be 7s. to 8s.; the railway wagon would be 9d., the loading 8d., and the cartage to any place in London 2s. 6d. to 3s.—office expenses and advertising would be reasonable at about 1s. 1d. a ton—I should say the prisoner could make 1s. 5d. to 1s. 8d. a ton, a very slow fortune-making business—the expense of bringing coal from the collieries is according to mileage and weight—Wallsend coal has been extinct for years, and it has become a trade term now—there is no colliery called Wallsend; New "Wallsend does not mean anything; it is a trade term—Mrs. Penny refused to allow me to take any coals—I went with Mr. Toms, a coal<lb/>dealer, to the Red Lion about 3.30 or 3.45—we saw two or three hundredweight of the coal left in the cellar; it was very small, and we took away this sample—the word Wallsend conveys the meaning that it is the best coal; it is used by all coal merchants—I got this piece from Mr. Maryon's cellar; there was about one sack and a half at the bottom, and we raked this up; he made no difficulty, but was very courteous—I pointed to a fire, and asked whether those were the same coals burning there, and he said yes; that they burnt very well when mixed—I should say the coal we saw at Mr. Maryon's would be a very good coal to deliver at 18s. a ton, taking working expenses into account—the same day I called at Mrs. Banks' about four o'clock, and saw the four or five hundredweight she had left, and took a sample; it was very fair coal for the price—the quoted price for the very best coals in the</p>

               <p>market is now 26s. per ton—afterwards I went to Mrs. Reynolds, of 87, Chatham Street, and examined the coals, and took a sample; they would be a fairly good coal to deliver at 18s. a ton; I did not pick out this sample; most of the coal had been burnt—this coal produced by Mr. Kirby is very good coal at the price; I should call it tolerably good; it would burn—the coal in all these samples is merchantable and combustible—it would burn—I went to another place, where there was no coal left—I went to Mrs. Marsh, who had about 50lb. left—I took a sample; it is very good coal to burn; its appearance is against it; it is coal, not slate; it would bum on a fire, and would be fair coal to deliver at 18s., taking working expenses into account—these samples have not been out of my possession.</p>

               <p>not call these the best burning coals the world produces—these would probably fetch 3s. 6d. a ton at the pit's mouth—I do not agree with Mr. Price that the major portion of what the witnesses had was composed of material other than coal—I don't think coal should burn like these pieces of Mrs. Banks's, but even in the best of coal you get slate like this—this, which has not been through the fire, is coal, but it is not a very favourable sample; it would burn, and might come out like this other piece; there might be a mixture of dross with it—I see no reason why this coal should not burn in the ordinary way—I don't know if the County Council know my address, I have never been troubled by them; I am not supposed to give them my address.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Smith, of 21, Hamp<lb/>shire Street—the prisoner came to lodge with me in December last year—she told me she was married—a man named Edwards used to come to visit her; he did not lire there altogether—she had one child when she came, about sixteen or seventeen months old—after she had been with me three months she was confined of a second child, a female—I saw it after it was born—I washed and dressed it when it was born; it was a strong child—the prisoner suckled it, and took care of it properly until about the middle of April—after that it was fed by bottle with con<lb/>densed milk—after the middle of April it became ill—on one occasion I and the prisoner took the child to Dr. Mayberry, and he told us that it was fast sinking away into eternity—I asked the doctor if it was in a consump<lb/>tion—he said, "No"—I think that was either in June or July—a bottle of medicine was supplied to her—she took that, but did not get any more—the child seemed a little better afterwards—it was constantly fretting and crying, and seemed to get worse—I told her more than once it was getting awfully thin—she said, "Mind your own business; it is nothing to you"—the prisoner did nothing for her Jiving while she was with me—she put some flowers on a dozen tobacco pouches—she did not stop at home all day—she would stop out frequently for hours at a time, leaving the children in the room—on one occasion she went out about eleven in the morning, and returned between four or five, without anyone to attend to the child—on another occasion she went out at seven in the evening, and returned at a quarter-past three in the morning; no one was attending to the child then—while the mother was away the child was frequently crying—I frequently went up to the room, and so did another lodger—I never found the bottle dirty, but nearly always empty—the child was left in a very dirty state; its lower part was all raw, and there was vermin about it—I spoke to the prisoner about it, and said she thought it was the thrush—on one occasion I saw the prisoner cross with the child, and she slapped its face and said, "If you cause me much more bother I shall throw you into the waterbutt"—on 22nd September the Relieving Officer, Mr. Wheatley, called—the prisoner went out that morning about eleven—she had not returned when Mr. Wheatley came—I took him in to see the child, and he gave me some money to buy some milk with; I did so; I gave some to the child, and I gave the prisoner the remainder when she came in—two days afterwards, on the 24th, Mr. Wheatley came again—the prisoner was</p>

               <p>not at home then, Mr. Wheatley left a note for her; I gave it her when she came in, and she crumpled it up and threw it in my face—after she had been in a few minutes two men came in, they stayed a little time; she said one was her brother, and the other a friend of her father's—after they had gone she put on her things and went out, leaving the child by itself—I went up to see to it, and I gave it some more broth, and I brought it downstairs and showed it to my husband—I took it to the workhouse at nine that evening—the prisoner paid me 2s. 6d. a week for her room.</p>

I live at 57, Cross Street, Islington, and am an agent of the Liverpool Victoria Legal Friendly Society; the prisoner is my daughter—in April last she spoke to me about insuring her baby, Agnes Mary Edwards, in my society, and on 30th May I effected an insurance on its life for thirty shillings, payable by a penny a week for three months, two pounds for six months, and so on up to five pounds for ten years—I cant say that I told my daughter I had insured it, she knew it of course (she did not pay me the penny a week, I paid it)—I think her mother told her about it; I don't know it of my own knowledge—I don't think she knew anything about it herself; after a time she did, not at the time it was done, perhaps a week or two afterwards—she asked me in April, and I effected the insurance in May.</p>

I live at 77, Patshull Road, Kentish Town; I am Relieving Officer for that district of St. Pancras—on 22nd September my attention was called to this child by Mrs. Smith—I went to the room occupied by the prisoner at noon that day; I there found a child about two years old, and the child in question; it was lying partly naked at the toot of the bed, near the window, which was open—there was no food near it—the child was very dirty and very emaciated—I requested Mrs. Smith to tell the prisoner something, and on the 24th I called again; between the 22nd and 24th the prisoner came to my office—I offered</p>

I am Resident Medical Officer of St. Pancras Workhouse—on 24th September the deceased child was admitted into the workhouse—I examined it; it was pale and emaciated and hungry—I weighed it, it weighed 7 lb. 4 oz.—the normal weight of such a child should have been about 14 1/2 lb.—I examined the body and limbs, they were vermin-bitten—the groins were abraded and inflamed in the sur<lb/>rounding parts—that would be due to the want of cleanliness; it was suffering from cold in the eyes, inflammation of the mucous membranes of the nose and bronchial tubes—while in the workhouse the child gained about six ounces in weight—it died on 15th October in convul<lb/>sions—I made a post-mortem examination—the brain, heart, liver, kidney, spleen, and lungs were all in a normal healthy condition, except being rather bloodless, in an enaemic condition—the body was not well nourished; there was no fat about the body—the lining membranes of the stomach and intestines were in a state of chronic inflammation; the whole alimentary track and glands of the mesentery were enlarged—if the child had lived it would have been consumptive—the immediate cause of death was convulsions, brought on by the enaemic condition of the brain, result<lb/>ing from chronic catarrh of the intestinal track—in my opinion it was the result of irregular and improper food, and exposure and want of proper clothing—I have no doubt that the child had a tuberculosis taint, which would no doubt have developed acute tubercular disease under any circumstances if it had lived—the convulsions were not due to tubercular disease, but in my opinion to the enaemic condition of the brain; there was want of power to assimilate food, on account of the peculiar condition of the intestines.</p>

I live at 2, Alcroft Road, Hampstead—I have known the prisoner about two years and a half—I was in the habit of meeting him and having drinks with him—on Monday, 26th October, about half-past one or two, I was with Emily Peachey near the King's Cross Metro-politan Railway Station—the prisoner came up and spoke to me, and asked me to have a drink, as he did not care to have one by himself; I took my friend with me to the Bell public-house, and ordered a glass of bitter for each, the prisoner had some whisky—he said, "You don't believe what I told you on Saturday?"—he then told me was going to poison himself on the Wednesday, as his brother had done before, put he bad to wait till he had taken leave of his lady, either at Epping Forest or Wimbledon—he took a bottle from his pocket and said, This is the poison I intend taking, will you have half of it?"—I said, "No, thanks"—he said there was quite sufficient in the bottle to kill fifty—he put it to his lips and said, "There, I am not afraid of it, you see, I will drink half of it if you will drink the other half"; he pretended to pull the cork out; I could not see whether he did or not—he attempted to put something into my glass, but I did not see it, he was between both of us; I did not drink the beer, I left it on the counter—I had some claret afterwards, he paid for it—he did not put anything into that—he put the bottle in his pocket—he then left and went to his brother's house in Caledonian Road; he could not get in, and went across the road to a public-house—he looked about the same as he does now, he seemed rather stupid; I never saw him any different—I met a policeman, and he was taken into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This occurred in the private bar of a public-house; my glass was standing on the counter—there was a barman behind the bar—he took out the bottle quite openly, and attempted to pour out some</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot-laster, of Essex Street, Kingsland Road—on September 22nd of between 12.30 and 1 o'clock I was sitting on a barrow in Hackney Road, with Sikes, a boot-laster—I was in work, but not going to work that day—I saw a woman ejected from a public-house, and then looked towards our trades union office, and saw the prisoner and his brother making indecent gestures towards the window—they put their thumbs to their noses, and then turned up their coats and turned their posteriors to the window—we went to see what it was done for, and I heard the prisoner make a noise with his mouth—when I got close to him he drew something similar to this (<hi rend="italic">an iron bar</hi>) from his pocket; he struck me with it, but I received it on my elbow—he then struck at me several times in the same manner; I could not ward off two of the blows, and he struck me twice rapidly on my head—I felt stunned, and apt exhausted from bleed<lb/>ing, but I kept my feet—I was smothered in blood—I tried to seize him, but he broke away and ran to the Roebuck public-house, 100 yards off; I followed him; he went in at one side and left by another door; I tried to stop him, and he ran into a policeman's arms about 100 yards from the Roebuck, and I charged him—there was no crowd before I was wounded—I did not see Mr. Stacey till after I was wounded, and then he was trying to get this instrument out of the prisoner's hand—I had done nothing by word or gesture to arouse the prisoner's anger, and never have—I do not know him—the inspector asked him at the station what made him attack me—he said his shop was broken into the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189112140044"/>
               <p>night before, and he had every reason to believe I was the man who did it—I had not done so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He did not say at the station that what he did was done in self-defence, but he did at the Police-court—he came up and struck me without the slightest provocation—I am a member of the National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives, and was sitting close to the office—I was recovering from the day before's drink—the Union are conducting this prosecution for me—I had heard of the two Bates, and that they were in Messrs. Greenwood's employ—I did not know that Greenwood's place was blocked; I know it now, and have heard since that the Bateses took work backwards and forwards to the Greenwoods, and that they were under police protection—as a member of the Union I took part in their processions on Sundays—we go right through the streets with a band, and when we get to the house of an objectionable individual we slow up to the goose-step, and play the Dead March in <hi rend="italic">Saul</hi>, and all who wish take off their hats if they have a respect for the dead—I swore before the Magistrate, "The Dead March and the hats off is an intimation that the workers at Messrs. Greenwood's ought to be dead"; and I did wish him dead after he struck me on my head—the procession increased, and at last it got up to 3,000 or 4,000—I have never been present when the prisoner has been guarded by the police in taking his work to Greenwood's—I heard at the Police-court of his being attacked in the street—I closed with the prisoner, and he fell—Mr. Stacey came up, I think, then—he was not dragged through the mud—he was covered with mud when he was taken by the police—he complained of my butting him in the face after he had received the blow—I do not know Mr. Square; they were all strangers to me—I think the prisoner and I had a little struggle when he struck me—of course I should not be such a coward as to run away from him—when he ran into the public-house the Union men increased; they did not call to the landlord, "Throw him out!"—he cried like a child—I do not know that his place had been broken into the night before and his windows broken—I never worked for Messrs. Greenwood.</p>

               <p>Holloway—I have been employed about three months at the North London Club, Rodney street—on 17th September the steward and his wife went out about 12.45, and I was left alone—in about ten minutes there was a knock at the door, and I went down to answer it, and saw the prisoner—I had never seen him before—he wore white glass spec<lb/>tacles, and had a little moustache of bristles of three or four days' growth, and bristles on his chin—he wore light-coloured clothes—he said, "Is the steward in?"—I said, "No, sir"—he said, "Is there anybody in the house?"—I said, "No"—he said, "lam a collector for the bank, and I want you to sign for a cheque," giving me this fastened envelope with "Steward, North London," on it—he then tore a piece of paper out of a red book like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and asked me to make a receipt—this, "17-9-91—Received from Mr. Jones, collector, one envelope enclosing cheque. N. K." is my writing—I wrote it up flat on the door, as he dictated it—I had nearly finished it when he struck me on my left temple with a hammer-head without a handle—I fell down and put up my hands, but received several more blows with the ham<lb/>mer-head; and he knelt on me and tried to strangle me with a piece of string which he threw over my head, but did not get it quite over—I was bleeding—I got away and ran to the front door, the same door—I got it open, but he pulled me back, and as he did so the hammer-head fell; he was going to take it up, but I kicked it away and got out—he followed me part of the way and then ran—when I was at the foot of the stairs I said, "Oh!" and he said, "If you halloa I will shoot you"—I went up to the top, and heard the street door open in a few minutes; my head was bleeding then—I waited a little while and then went down and washed my head, and looked the street door—after that I called out across the road, and Mrs. Holloway came and took me in a cab to the Royal Free Hospital, where I saw Inspector Radley, and made a statement to him. and described the man—I was at the hospital five days, and then went back and lived with my father—while the pri<lb/>soner was talking to me he was fiddling with the cutis of his coat, shifting his hands about like this, before any assault took place—on November 4th I went with my father, and Mr. Pettit, and Sergeant Robinson to the Albion beer house, between eight and nine p.m.—we three went in and the Sergeant remained outside—my father ordered something to drink; the prisoner was behind the bar serving—I recog<lb/>nised him as the man who had done this sis weeks before—he was in black clothes, but had no coat. on; he was in his shirt-sleeves—I was in the house ten minutes, and then went out and said something to my father and Robinson—I was taken to Clerkenwell Police-station next day, and picked out the prisoner from a number of others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had not observed him much before he struck me—Inspector Radley took down my statement the same day, and I used the expression, "a two or three days' growth of beard" to him, and I said in re-examination on the second hearing, "He had then a moustache, a little moustache; and a day or two's growth of beard"—after I recovered, Sergeant Robinson took me to various places; we went to a music-hall to recognise, if I could, the man who struck me—when I went to the Albion beer-house they told me to look all in the bar and the partitions to see if I could see the man—there were not very many persons there; some were playing at dominoes and some sitting down drinking—the</p>

               <p>prisoner was standing by himself—he was not the first man I looked at—I could see through all the partitions—I could see the prisoner from every part of the place I went to; he was prominently before me—I had to look at him for three or four minutes before I was sure he was the man—he was perfectly clean-shaven then—he was in such a position that he could see me the whole time I was in the bar—his shirt-sleeves were turned back, but I did not notice the position of his hands—I had not seen the witness <hi rend="italic">Posh</hi> Price before I went to that beer-house, nor had I heard his name mentioned by my father or Robinson; nor did I know him as Faulkner—when I identified the prisoner next day at tie station he presented precisely the same appearance as when I saw him behind the bar a very few hours pre<lb/>viously, only he had his coat on—he wore a black waistcoat behind the bar—the man at the club had a light jacket, I did not notice whether it was a whole suit; his spectacles dropped off when he hit me—his eyes and his voice struck me particularly when I saw him at the beer-house—the first blow half stunned me—I was in a terrible state of agitation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I went to the Albion, I was told to look round and see if I could see any one; my father was in the partition with me, and I noticed that the prisoner left the bar and went somewhere at the back, and then came out again—he afterwards left the bar a second time; he saw me in the bar, but I noticed nothing in his appearance or manner when he saw me; he had a full moustache then—when I said he was clean shaved, I referred to his chin.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When the charge was read over he said, "I am innocent of it"—the first name in this red book is <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Simmonds, the second is <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Harper, and the third <hi rend="italic">Posh</hi> Price—I know two Harpers; one is a milk-carrier and the other a publican—the police have seen the publican—I am informed that <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Harper does not know anything about it; he appears as a subscriber, and Simmonds for one shilling, and <hi rend="italic">Posh</hi> Price for five shillings; here is also an entry, "North London ten shillings," and "Radicals fifty shillings"—the prisoner is a man of undoubtedly good character in every way; he has held a licence for two or three years.</p>

I also wont to the Royal Free Hospital on September 17th, and Case gave me a description of the man—since his discharge from the hospital I have been with him to various places—a little while before November 4th I received information, and between eight and nine p.m. I went to the Albion beer-house with the boy, but did not go inside—he and his father went in, and he came out in a little time very much flurried—he appeared all right when he went in—he made a statement to me and was sent home—next day, at twelve o'clock, Sergeant Blythe and I went to the Albion with the boy's father, and after a time I saw the prisoner on the public aide of the bar, and Mr. Case said, "This is the man that Harry picked out last night, and I charge him with beating him with a hammer"—I said to the prisoner,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189112140054"/>
               <p>"We are police officers, and are going to arrest you for wounding a boy at the North London Club, Rodney Street, Pentonville, on 17th September"—he laughed—I said, "It is a serious matter"—he asked if he could send for his employer—we took him to King's Cross Police-station, where he was placed with several others and iden<lb/>tified by Case—when the charge was entered he said, "I am innocent of it; if I had the pocket-books that are in my coat pocket at home I could prove where I was on the 17th"—I then went with the Sergeant to the Albion beer-house, and received from the prisoner's wife this coat with two black-covered books in the pocket—these light-covered books were handed to me by his employer the next day—I took them all to the station, and the prisoner went through them, but said he could not find the date—he seemed rather fidgetty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He asked me to go to Mr. Charles Peters, in Hackney Road, and ask him if he could recollect on what day he was driving a brougham for him; I went on the 6th; Mr. Peters went through a book and said that on September 18th Dove drove a brougham for him, but on looking at the 17th he said that Dove was not driving a traveller on that date, but he was working for him, driving him about—the dis<lb/>tinction was that Peters said he was driving him and not driving a gentleman—I asked him if he could recollect any place where they called; he said, "I cannot"—the prisoner is a man of most excellent character; Mr. Wells, who has known him upwards of seven years, gives him a very good character; and another man spoke of him as being in his employ—I accompanied Kanes to various places, and about October 20th took him to Foresters' Music Hall, Hackney, where a benefit was being given for the prisoner; I do not know whether the prisoner was present, as I did not enter the inner part of the house; the boy went in with Sergeant Blythe, and I remained outside with his mother—I first saw <hi rend="italic">Posh</hi> Price on the 18th, the day following the boy being assaulted—I did not show him the red book, nor did he say anything about the book being red—he made a statement to me, and I gathered what I could from him—I believe he is a sporting publican and an ex-pugilist—benefits are constantly given in the class of life to which he belongs—he is a well-known man who might be called upon to subscribe to benefits of this kind—that also applies to <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Simmonds and <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Harper; they are both well known in the sporting world—a man named Jones is in custody at Clerkenwell; he is somewhat like the prisoner; he is about his height, and is dark—I cannot say as to his features being like—Jones is a notorious individual, so far as the police are concerned—some of the cases in which he is said to have been concerned took place about the middle of September—he is charged with being concerned with others in a series of housebreakings—he is a mem<lb/>ber of what is known as the postman's gang, he is said to be associated with Charley the Postman; that name is because he was in the Post Office at one time—I know that Jones has been to the North London Club more than once—I do not know whether he is a member—I was informed that he has been seen there—I often saw <hi rend="italic">Posh</hi> Price between September 18th and November 14th, but he never mentioned anything about the red book; he first saw it at the Police-court—<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Simmonds and <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Harper are not able to throw any light upon this case—I heard portions of <hi rend="italic">Posh</hi> Price's evidence at the Police court; I cannot say that</p>

Important, Watling and Co., Buckingham Palace Road, Pimlico."—I went with my wife to Watling and Co., and found they knew nothing about it—there was a benefit at the club on 14th and 15th September, which was advertised in the newspapers and by tickets—the money was in my possession upstairs—when I got back I found that the boy was at the hospital.</p>

               <p>and said he was much obliged, as he was on the <hi rend="italic">knuckle</hi>, and it would do him good—I asked him to have a glass of bitter ale, and he had it—I asked him if he had been round to any houses; he said, "No; but I will go to-day"—the reason he gave for having the benefit was that his brother had robbed him—I noticed that he had not shaved for a day or two—he wore a check cut-away coat, which went down to his middle—a day or so afterwards he brought me some bills and tickets; I think he had a black coat then, and was clean shaved, except his moustache—I know one of his brothers, and a very good man too.</p>

               <p>but only these sheets of foolscap were used—the receipts of the benefit came into my hands, and I paid for the hall and the printing, out of the money; he used to come to my house with these sheets of paper and give me the money, and I copied the names off—I saw that he had been to <hi rend="italic">Posh</hi> Price—his name is on the sheet which is here, but not in the black book, because that was simply the money we had not got in—these are the sheets by which the prisoner was working; here are the words <hi rend="italic">Posh</hi> Price, which I copied from the paper—I cannot tell why this has been cut off from a larger sheet of paper, it has been worn out—I hare not had these papers in my hand since I took the money—he got 5s. from <hi rend="italic">Posh</hi> Price.</p>

I am a porter, of 3, New Court, Spitalfields—on 25th November, about midnight, I was walking in Wheeler Street, with three persons—I bade them good night, and a man from behind put his hand into my trousers pockets, which were empty—I said, "I have got nothing"—he threw mo to the ground, and I got a violent blow on my head from a stick—I went to raise myself and received another blow on my forehead; I went again to rise and saw the stick coming, and received a second blow on my forehead—I caught hold of the stick and got a kick on my knuckles, and the stick was wrenched from me—I put my hand over my head and caught a violent blow on my arm, which I thought would break—they kept beating me across the arm which I kept up to save my head; both my arms were bruised down from my elbows—I did not see who did it; I cannot say if there was more than one—I was bruised all over, and had a large gash on my head; I have not been able to do much work since—I became insensible, and when I came to they were gone—my head was bleeding shockingly; both my coats were swamped right through—I must have holloa'd—when I looked round no one was near me; no one came up while I was on the ground—when I got up I saw no one—I ran towards Quaker Street, and stood against a post, and I was told I was wanted at the station, and I went there a few minutes after it happened—I could not recegnise anyone at the station; I saw Warner there—on the following Saturday I saw Loftus at the station, but did not recognise him.</p>

               <p>November I was with Evans, and left him about 12.40 a.m. of the 25th, standing at the corner of Quaker Street—I was talking with Pennicant and another man, and saw Pennicant run away, and I ran after him in the same direction that Evans had gone, and I saw Evans running back with his hands to his head, and his head all bleeding; I noticed no one near him—he complained to me, and then I ran after Pennicant to see what was the matter, and we met a policeman at the corner of Commer<lb/>cial Street, outside the chocolate palace, and gave him information.</p>

Rottger—this purse was also in the cash-box—it contained 4s. or 5s. German money, and a gold stud value 25s.—the stud in it is a common one, they are three or four a penny—I went there on the 19th about 10.30 p.m., and noticed that the door had been forced open; the woodwork had been broken away—the cash-box and contents had gone—I know nothing of the prisoners—this paper with my name on is one of my memorandum forms—some Cardigan jackets were also missed from the shelves, also a cheque for £6 16s., a tobacco pouch, and other things.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical prac<lb/>tioner and House Surgeon at the Metropolitan Hospital, Kingsland Road—George Rose came there on 19th October about 1 a.m.—I attended to him; he had three wounds on his head and face, one behind the right ear at the juncture of the scalp; one in the centre of the right cheek, and the third just above the forehead—the one behind the ear was most of it a clean cut, about an inch and a half long, at the upper end; that might be caused in several ways, by a sharp instrument, or by a fall on some sharp projecting object—the one in the cheek just penetrated; that must have keen caused by some sharp projecting point or a sharp instrument; that went right through into the mouth—the wound in the forehead was not deep, it was just through the skin; that might have been caused by a fall on a stone, or by a blow from a stick—I don't think it could have been caused by a knuckle, unless it was a very hard knuckle—I do not think the-three wounds could have been caused by one fall; two falls might—there were no bruises on the face, except very slightly round the mouth and cheek—I did not find any sign of a knock-down blow on the jaw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was a great deal of mud in the wound behind the ear, that wound might have been caused by a fall on the muddy kerb—the wound in the cheek might have been caused by a piece of broken glass in the road, or by the sharp point of a stone—I don't think it could be caused by a bite; it might by a sharp-pointed stick—he was under the influence of drink—none of the wounds were immediately serious.</p>

I am Medical Superintendent of the Islington Infirmary at Highgate—Rose was admitted there on 20th October—he was suffering from three wounds, as described by the last witness—I agree with his evidence, but the wound behind the ear had been sewn up—on 5th November he got seriously ill; lockjaw set in, and he died on the 26th from exhaustion following tetanus—I was present with the Magistrate on the 17th November, when the deceased made a statement in the prisoner's presence; he was sworn—the prisoner had the opportunity of cross-examining him—Rose made his mark to his deposition.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I knew nothing of the prisoners—I was working in the City; this was the dinner-hour; I was smoking—I was attracted by Wilson's manner; she was looking about in a very suspicious way—it all took place in a very few seconds—I saw Wilson pass the purse to Lynes—I said so before the Lord Mayor—the purse slid down on the ground between the prisoners—I am certain I saw Wilson take the purse out of the bag.</p>

The stamps are all alike, there is no distinguishing letter to show the Presidency to which they go—there are other checkers besides me—for all I know four or five consign<lb/>ments may have gone to India this year—there is no difference in this year's colouring or marking from last year—this is the first larceny of stamps within the last five years as far as I know—these stamps are not circulated in England—I think that anybody having them must be dealing improperly with them—I heard that the Agra Sank had bought them; I should say improperly, knowing them to have been stolen.</p>

Yours truly, T. F.

French; he was a stout man, with a slightly grey moustache and grey hair, slightly bald, of rather a florid complexion, and having the appearance of a sea captain—he was dressed in dark blue—to the best of my belief Humphries was there at the time—French offered a sheet of two-anna Indian postage stamps over the counter for sale—Hum<lb/>phries said he would give him half-price for them—the man demurred to that, but eventually he gave in—17s. 6d. was given for 239 stamps, worth 29 rupees 14 annas; it was a complete sheet, with the exception of one stamp—after the man had left, Humphries made a jocular remark, to the effect that the man might have stolen them, from his appearance, and as he had accepted our price so easily—the price was about sevenpence to the rupee—on 2nd July French came again (I believe Humphries was present), and he offered another complete sheet of two-anna stamps; they were taken and 16s. 8d. given for them, which was at the rate of 6 1/2 d., I think—French came again, and brought in eight or a dozen sheets; it might have been the same as the first lot—Humphries said if he left them with him he would get him a price for them, or something to that effect, and French left them in the office—about that time I heard a conversation through the telephone between Humphries and Bother—I believe about that time I had a conversation with Humphries after I returned from Ludgate Hill, with regard to the firm not having accepted—Humphries said he thought it was very silly of them not letting him do any business with these stamps, as the Agra Bank had offered him 1s. 5d. the rupee for them, and that he should do it himself—I cannot say for certain when the man gave the name of C. French—the name and address, "C. French, 3 1/4, Dalmain Road, Forest Hill, "as it was written down, was filed in the office—I think when he brought in the third lot, it was rather a large amount—French said the stamps had been sent home from India in payment of a debt—when French returned, after these stamps had been lying in the office, Humphries, to the best of my belief, went out with him—a few days after that I was sent to the Agra Bank, where I was given this cheque for £37 13s. 9d., which I brought back to the office—Humphries did not tell me what it was for—I signed this receipt at the bank for it; it says, "For eighteen sheets of postage stamps"—I may have seen that at the time—after that, French came to the office about a dozen times, and Humphries went out with him—there are only entries in the books of two purchases of these stamps; there is no record of the transactions with the Agra Bank.</p>

Cook and Sons—he called on me on 15th July—I was at 6, Lombard Court then—he said, "I can put some business in your way"—I said, "I am obliged; what is the nature of it?"—he said, "I have got some stamps to sell"—I said, "What stamps are they?"—he said, "Indian stamps, which were brought to me by a customer; I think you can sell them"—I said, "Is the business perfectly regular, and are the stamps in order?"—he said, "Yes, perfectly"—I said, "Do you know your customer?"—he said, "Yes, he has been at the office in Gracechurch Street on several occasions"—I said, "Do you know his name and address?"—I wrote it down—I said, "Why don't you buy the stamps for your firm?"—he said, "The firm has already bought several lots of these stamps; I bought one or two lots at Grace-church Street; I have received instructions not to buy any more"—the address given me was, "C. French, 31, Dalmaine Road, Forest Hill"—he kept a lodging-house near the docks, and said he bought the stamps of sailors who lodged there—he gave me a parcel of two-anna Indian stamps, in perfect sheets, value between £9 and £10, and asked me to sell them and hand him the proceeds—I agreed, and took them to Messrs. Keiser's, the money<lb/>changers in Cornhill, and sold them for 1s. 3 1/2 d. the rupee—I men<lb/>tioned the name of Mr. Hornier, but he was away at the time—I got £9 15s. 5d. for them, and gave it to Humphries, at my office, in cash, in the afternoon, and he gave me £1 2s. 6d.—three or four days after<lb/>wards he brought a second lot of two-anna stamps, in sheets; some were in single sheets—that was double the first quantity—he said he got them from the same party—I handed them to my clerk, Dixon, who brought me a cheque from Keiser and Co.—I met Humphries the same afternoon, near his office in Gracechurch Street, and showed him the cheque, it was for £18 Os. 4d., and in favour of Napoleon Argles and Co.—he said he did not want to pass it through his firm's bank, and asked me to pass it through my bank, which I did—I was paid £2 5s.—he showed me a postcard, and said he had written to Mr. French to call for the money, offering him one-fourth of the money—he said he had been offered three hundred sheets of the stamps—after<lb/>wards, in consequence of something which came to my know<lb/>ledge, I saw Humphries, and told him that there was something wrong about it; that I had seen Mr. Best, Mr. Hargraves' partner, who had ques<lb/>tioned me on the matter, and asked him to meet me next day at eleven o'clock at Lombard Court, to corroborate my statement to Mr. Best—Humphries did not come; but I afterwards met him and Mr. Best accidentally, and went up to them, and Mr. Best said he had questioned him about it, and he said he knew nothing about it—I said, "Surely, Humphries, you do not deny it?"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I said, "Well, one man's word is as good as another's"—Mr. Best said, "One of you is telling a lie," and went away—I then said to Humphries, "Why do you deny knowing anything about this matter?"—he said, "Mr. Best is a stranger to me, and I will not admit anything in his presence"—I have heard Humphries's statement read; it is not true that I was in the office at Gracechurch Street when French came; I never saw him; I do not know him.</p>

Cook—I showed them to the assistant general manager for India, who had just returned, whe said they were proper stamps, and I purchased them at 1s. 4 3/4 d., the current rate of exchange, deducting 1/4 d. for additional postage; they came-to £37 13s. 9d.—if I had not believed they were from Messrs. Cook I would not have bought them—the cheque was made out to Thomas Cook and Sons; we had not bought stamps from them before, but we bought a few from a bank.</p>

               <p>—I said, "Can't you tell whether you have or not?"—he said, "Yes, I have," and finished the statement about the Agra Bank—on the 21st we went to him again, and I said, "Humphries, I have been instructed to apprehend you for receiving upwards of 10,000 Indian postage stamps, knowing them to have been stolen; one lot, 240, was in July; 1,200 on July 17th; 232 on July 20th; 4,320 on July 29th; 239 on June 27th; and 114 on some date that I can't give now"—he said, "It is a lie; I have told you all I know of the matter"—I searched him, and found this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), in which is entered, "Clarke, 44, Chantler Road, Custom House, Victoria Dock"—he said, "I can't go with you now," and I left an officer with him—he was taken on the 23rd to Bow Street Police-station and charged; he made no reply—in consequence of Clarke's address in the memorandum-book, on 24th, at 9.30 am., the prisoner Clarke answered the door—I said, "Your name is Clarke?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I made an appointment with you last night through your wife"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Well, a man named Humphries is in custody for receiving a large quantity of stolen Indian postage-stamps, and he got them from you; where did you get them from?"—he said, "I got them from a man named Smith, who used to lodge with me; he came to me in September, 1890, and left in January, 1891. He said he came from India, and he sent me the stamps from Bombay in July last to pay a debt he owed me of £20 for lodgings. He sent me about 400 rupees' worth; I can't say the exact amount; I sold some of them at Cook's, at the corner of Gracechurch Street, and some at a money-changer's near the Bank of England. I have an entry of Smith's name in my books; sometimes my wife books the names of the lodgers. I don't know any address at which Smith stopped at Bombay, and I have not got the letter he sent Mr. I think I got £19 for the stamps; it may be more, or a little less. I took two lots to Cook's the first time, 150 rupees' worth, and the next 200 or 260; I received about £16 for them"—I said, "Considering 400 rupees may mean about £40, I don't believe what you say, and I shall take you in custody for receiving the stamps, knowing them to have been stolen; they were stolen in London in June, from the <hi rend="italic">Astrea</hi>, in the Royal Albert Docks"—he is a stevedore's labourer, and he lets two or three furnished rooms—I took him to Bow Street, and as we drove through Cornhill we passed Kuld and Co. 's, No. 16, and he pointed to the window, on which the name was, and said, "That is the place I sold them at, near the Bank of England"—I went to India to make inquiries, and brought Gaiety and Hardy back.</p>

I said, "I am a police-officer; is Mr. Laun within?" he said, "Yes, I live here"—I instructed Hutt to go and ask Mr. Laun to come to me; he came from the front of the house, and I said to him, "Is this your stable?" he said, "Yes;" I said, "I found this man delivering forage here;" he said to Giles, "Oh, what have you put in here?"—Giles said, "It is only a bit of straw from the bottom of my van"—I told him he would be charged with stealing forage, the property of his employers; he made no reply, but when I told Laun the charge, Giles said, "I have a right to give the straw away"—I charged Laun with receiving it, knowing it to have been stolen; he made no reply—I said, "I shall take possession of that," pointing to the straw—I pointed to the bin, where there was a quantity of provender, and said that I should take possession of it; Laun dived his hand into the bin sixteen or eighteen inches, and said, "You are not going to take this away," and brought out a sieve; I told him to leave it alone, but he dived his hand in again, apparently to mix it—I took him away from the bin—I took this provender (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), nearly half a sack, from about the depth he brought up the sieve from—about a quarter of a sack remained—I then, in his presence, took this sample of that which was underneath—I am acquainted with horse provender; the samples from above and underneath do not correspond—I placed the straw in the empty sacks in the van, and told Laun he would have to accompany me to the station; in the meantime Laurence, a fixed-point duty man, had come, he was in uniform; I told him Laun was my prisoner, and ordered him to take him to the station; Laun then became violent, and said to Laurence, "If you put your hands on me I will b----soon knock you down"—I went to the end of the stable—we both laid hold of him by each wrist; he struggled violently; we got him outside, and I blew my whistle; another constable came, and Laun asked to be allowed to ride to the station in his own cab—he keeps two cabs, I believe—I said, "Owing to your previous violence I shall not let you do so"—I sent him to the station in custody of two constables—Giles behaved very quietly—I had seen the prosecutor's brother that day—next day, at the station, Giles said to Mr. Marley, "I hope you will forgive me, and not press the charge"—after the charge was read over, Laun said, "That is wrong; I did not know he was in the yard," apparently meaning Giles.</p>

               <p>a.m., I found this safe in this sack in the forecourt of the Salvation Army barracks, Peckham—I had to cut the sack to get it out—I took it to Peckham Police-station, where Mr. Hastings identified it—I went to his house and examined the latch of the street-door, the bolt was bent, showing that considerable force had been applied to the door—about eight o'clock that morning I went to Fryer's house, 46, Garsden Road, Peckham, and found this sawdust swept up under the grate in the back kitchen, and some more in the back yard; it is the same sort of stuff as the safe was packed with—I found marks in the yard which corresponded with the safe; it weighed about 1 1/2 cwt. Betts, who was with me, found these three pieces of metal, the hasps of the lock of the safe, which are minus, and this piece of metal, which had been freshly broken—I could not compare it because the rest of the back of the safe was gone—there is a mark on the safe which might be made by this pickaxe; it was in the yard, and it showed that it had been recently used—shortly after I went there Fryer came in at the front door; I said, "You know me, I am Inspector Fox; I shall arrest you for being concerned in committing a burglary last night at 83, Camden Grove North, and stealing a safe and contents, value £40"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I said, "It is your kitchen and your back yard"?—he said, "Yes"—I said "I wish you to see this saw<lb/>dust here and these marks, as they will be mentioned in evidence"—he said, "That dust came from the oak wood I broke up"—I said, "There is no indication of any wood being broken up"—he said, "Well, my wife is innocent, do not take her"—he said at the station, "How did you get on to me"?—I said, "Carroll, Sheehan, and Kent are concerned with you, they were at your house last night late"—he said "Yes, you are quite right; do not say I said so, I should not like them to know; you treat me all right, and I will let you know something; the things these pawntickets refer to are all right; I cannot answer for the clock and watch"—at twelve o'clock that night Blower brought Carroll into the station—I told him the charge; he said, "an you prove it?"—I said, "You, Sheehan, and Kent took the safe on a costermonger's barrow to Dick Fryer's house"—he said, "I shall prove that I was at Chatham at the time"—I had mentioned the time—Betts afterwards brought Sheehan in and I told him the charge—he said, "Who has been <hi rend="italic">rounding?</hi>"—I said, "Fryer has for one"—he said, "You will have to prove it; if I get done I shall do it like a man; I can prove I was in Gravesend on Monday; I got back at six in the evening; George Hem<lb/>mingway and Mike Smith will prove I was at the Lord Hill all the evening"—that is a public-house near Fryer's place, and near the Salvation Army—later on Kent was brought in by Betts; I told him the charge—he said. "All right, say what you like, I shall prove I was at Gravesend; I know we had all three been <hi rend="italic">boozing</hi> together the last three days, but that has nothing to do with it; I was at the Rose of Den<lb/>mark, Queen Street, Gravesend, on Monday night; I can prove it"—I said, "I can prove you were at Peckham on Monday night and early on Tuesday morning; your mate Carroll says he was at the Rose of Denmark, Queen Street, Chatham, on Monday night"—he said, "Never mind, I know where I was"—they were then formally charged.</p>

I am the wife of George Southgate, of 11, Has<lb/>land Road, Peckham, about two minutes' walk from Commercial Road—on Monday, 25th November, about 9.45 p.m., I left a barrow safe in our front garden, and missed it about 10.15—I saw it next at the Police-station on the Wednesday morning, and my son brought it home—it had on it "Bailey, No. 77."—I gave no authority to anyone to take it away; it was stolen.</p>

How do you know we were there?"—Sheehan said at the station, "I know I had some of the money; they must have got it crooked, but you know what it is, when they have got it you must go with them"—I found on Sheehan 5s. 9d., and on Kent 5s. 9 1/2 d.—on 24th November, about 8 a.m., I examined the rear of 46, Garsdale Road where Fryer lives, and found these two pieces of brass (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); they correspond with the safe—I produce a sample of sawdust which I found in the back yard; it corresponds with the sawdust packing of the safe.</p>

               <p>there—we stayed at the public-house till about ten minutes to ten; we left the prisoner and his companions behind—nothing had passed between our party and his—we came to Camberwell Green, where we stopped to talk to two friends—I then saw the prisoner and his com<lb/>panions, about as many as were in the public-house, behind—his com<lb/>panions were singing and kicking up a disturbance coming along there; it was about ten o'clock—a voice came from behind, I cannot say whose it was, "That is Patsy Lynch"—the strangers were three or four yards off me—before I could look round I got a blow from a fist from behind that knocked me behind the ear and made me fall, and I was kicked all over the place—I was a minute or two on the ground—I did not see who kicked me—my friends came to pick me up and they got knocked by the prisoner's companions—those attacking were the largest number—my friend hurried me away aid got me into a tramcar, a little further on, by the Father Redcap—a minute or two after they got on the same car—there were a lot of passengers on the top at the time—there were garden-seats, and the people who got up sat on the opposite seats to us; we were on the right and they on the left—we went as far as the Horse and Groom, East Street—just before we got there I got up to get down, seeing they had come up, and I was knocked down on the top of the tram as it was going; the conductor had just come up to give the tickets—I rose up to go away, and saw I was followed by some of the men—I saw the prisoner on the tram-car, I swear—when I got up to go down I was struck on the back of the neck—I did not see who struck me—I fell on the roof of the car—I got up, and got another blow, and got a black eye through it; that was the second time I was struck on the tram-car—my friends assisted me up, and then the prisoner's companions began knocking them about—then I went to get down the staircase, with my face to the street, and I was stabbed on the back of my head by the prisoner; I saw him; he rushed between my young woman and two other passengers and got to me, and directly I felt the blow, before I had time to put my foot on the step, I was on the top, I saw some<lb/>thing shining, glittering in his hand; it cut through my hat—I got off the car, and ran through East Street; I saw no more of the prisoner after I got the blow—I am certain he is the man who stabbed me—I met a friend, Jimmy Osborne, in the Kent Road, and he took me to Guy's Hospital—I was bleeding—at the hospital they dressed my head, and I attended as an out-patient for four weeks afterwards—on the next day, Monday, I applied to the police, and a warrant was granted on Tuesday—on 2nd November I recognised the prisoner at Kingston as the man who stabbed me, by his features—he was in Militia uniform in the guard-room; three or four others were in the guard-room at the time—he had no uniform on on the night I was stabbed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I went to Kingston I heard Smale tell one of the officers that he wanted to see Beedham, and an officer went out, and came back with the prisoner; except that I say he was there on this night—the prisoner is an absolute stranger to me—he had nothing to do with the strike—we did not say a word at this public-house—the people were in the same compartment as we were, but we did not exchange a word—I had no reason to notice the faces of any people there except those of my friends, I swear</p>

               <p>the prisoner was in that public-house—I saw the prisoner among those who followed me when I came out—Camberwell Green is about a quarter of a mile from the Fox-under-the-Hill; when we got there the other party were five or six yards behind us; I could not say exactly—it is not light there—I was not looking back at all—when I looked round I saw quite a dozen of them—I pledge my oath the prisoner was one of them—I only noticed he had a bird's-eye handkerchief; but it was. dark, and I did not notice his clothes—all his party were strangers to me; it was not because I bad ever seen them together that I say they were his companions—I don't know who struck the blow at Camberwell Green—two witnesses got off the tram-car when I was on it to look for a constable, and could not find him—I saw the prisoner among those who kicked me at Camberwell Green—I said before the Magistrate, "It was the prisoner who struck me," referring to Camberwell Green; I don't know who struck me, my young woman told me—I said, "While on the ground the prisoner and two of his companions kicked me on the back of the head"—I saw no one kick me—I spoke from what my young woman told me—I saw the prisoner sitting on the opposite side, of the car, not behind me; a militiaman was with him—I said before the Magistrate that the prisoner sat behind me—I have been floorcloth printing for two years up to six or seven weeks ago; since then I have not been doing much—I worked at Pearce and Plenty's—I am a boxer—I have not been boxing outside this Court—I believe there was a skirmish outside last Monday; I don't know anything about it—I and twenty men did not set on the prisoner, knock him down, kick him in the road, and cut his mouth—I did not see him knocked down or kicked—at four o'clock on Monday I was sitting inside the Court—I told the policeman that a militiaman was among the persons on the top of the car—Kingston barracks are where militiamen would ordinarily be—I only told Smale that the man who assaulted me was a tall thin fellow with a bit of a moustache, and on that description Smale went to Kingston—I told him at the same time that there was a militiaman amongst them—the person who stabbed me was not exactly behind me, but at my side—I swore before the Magistrate, "Just before I got to the steps I felt a blow on the back of the head from the prisoner, who was just behind me"—I have not said before to-day that I saw the knife shining—the blow on my head and my falling backwards was very quick—I swear positively the prisoner stabbed me—I saw him get between the girl and the passengers—when I picked him out at the barracks he said, "I know nothing about it."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There was a militiaman in the public-house where I first saw the party of thirteen; he was not the man who stabbed me; he was in the prisoner's company in the public-house and on the car—we were at the public-house from half-past seven or eight till ten minutes to ten—the first attack on me was ten minutes or quarter of an hour after we left the public-house—I think the militiaman got on to the tram after us—we sat on the second seat in front on the right hand aide, and the prisoner sat on the left hand side three or four seats back; he was behind us, but not on the same row of seats—the staircase winds round, and to go down you are obliged to turn sideface; I was about to step off the top when I was struck—I got to the hospital at eleven o'clock—I was born in Manchester.</p>

I am seventeen—I live in Mason Street, Old Kent Road, at a confectioner's—on Sunday night, 4th October, I was with Lynch at the Fox-under-the-Hill—Laird, Seymour, Alice Nail, and another girl were with us—I saw the prisoner and about twelve com<lb/>panions there; I knew none of them; one wore a red coat and Scotch cap—nothing passed between that party and ours—we came out about five minutes to ten, and walked to Camber well Green, a quarter of an hour's walk—the other people followed immediately after us—at Camberwell Green Lynch stopped to speak to a companion, and I heard someone at the back of us say, "That is Patsy Lynch, the blackleg," and when we turned round we saw the prisoner's companion's kicking Lynch on the ground—the prisoner and two of his companions were near him and kicking him—that went on for about five minutes—some of the prisoner's companions knocked me down—I saw the prisoner kick Lynch—we got Lynch up and sat him on the top of a tram-car which was starting—the prisoner and his companions, including the man in militia uniform, came on the roof of the car—they were garden seats; Lynch sat on the right side, and of the others some sat and some stood—Lynch went to get a light, and some of the prisoner's companions knocked him down—I went to pick him up, and I got knocked across the head with a heavy instrument, like a bit of lead, that cut my head open—we picked Lynch up, and we were going off together, when the prisoner hit Lynch on the head with something that glittered, I saw it in his hand; the best I could make of it was that it was a knife—it descended on Lynch's head; I am sure the prisoner did it—that was by the Horse and Groom, after we had passed Carter Street—I could see by the street lamps—all the time the prisoner and his companions were on top of the car—Lynch and I got down to look for a policeman, but could not find one, and Lynch, I found, had gone to the hospital—the prisoner was about a yard from me when the knife was used—I afterwards picked the prisoner out at Lambeth Police-court—I saw him outside the Court with his com<lb/>panions round him; I recognised one as being one of his companions at the Fox-under-the-Hill—I bad not seen the prisoner between 4th October and 3rd November—he had on a black coat and waistcoat, and pair of cord trousers; I identify him by his clothes and by his face.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manageress to Mr. Sturdy, of the Rising Sun public-house, York Road, Waterloo—about twenty minutes to one a.m., on 21st November, I examined the premises, and they were quite secure; the doors were locked—there is a safe in the middle of the bar—just after three I was aroused by the police ringing a bell; I came down and saw the safe had been taken from its stand and laid on its front, and the back of it was cut out and was lying by the side; the cement was taken from it, and then there was a layer of sheet-iron, and in that was a hole about as big as my hand—one cord of the fanlight was cut from the bottom; a person could have come through the fanlight if they had climbed up.</p>

At ten minutes to three a.m., on 21st November, I passed the Rising Sun, and I was about to try the door<lb/>way, when I heard a slight noise—I went to the first glass door, which has glass at the top and wood at the bottom, took off my helmet, and looked in over the glass—it is in the front of the premises—after waiting about five minutes I heard three distinct cracks, and then saw a man's head move about three inches above the counter—the light of the coffee urn on the counter gave a very good light—I heard a noise at the other end of the bar—I went to the corner, and after waiting for about ten or fifteen minutes another constable came over, and looked through another glass door at the corner of York Road; he went for further assistance—after about twenty minutes we got two other constables—one went to the back; Cadwallader went to the York Road, where there are two doors, and Sibley and I went into Vine Street, and then I rang the bell—</p>

               <p>Powell looked over the glass where it is frosted, and where I had been looking through; then he rushed towards another door, and I turned my light on and kept it on him, and then I saw Butler—I recognise Powell—I rang the bell again and then ran to the corner, and both pri<lb/>soners ran out at the end door in the York Road—Powell ran to the left—I and Constable 238 pursued Butler, blowing our whistles, and he was arrested—we found on him a bottle of oil, a knife, two chisels, a wooden wedge, 3 1/2 d., and a watch and chain—he was charged.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The two men ran to the door at which I was when I rang the bell—they both rushed to the other door—their movements were pretty quick—they ran between us and the light in coming to the door; Powell was looking at me over the frosted glass—I never said that be<lb/>fore to-day—Butler turned towards Westminster Road, and Powell to<lb/>wards Waterloo station—the Rising Sun is one of two houses with a turning on each side—I was dodging along from the bell to the door; I was standing on the corner when they rushed by me, they were not near enough for me to catch hold of them; I was seven or eight yards from them—Powell did not deny it to me at all—when the inspector charged them Butler mode no reply, Powell said he knew nothing about it—Powell said he was coming down York Road and was seized by a constable.</p>
