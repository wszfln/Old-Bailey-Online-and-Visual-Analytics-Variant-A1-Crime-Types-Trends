I saw these rings safe about ten o'clock on Friday evening, the 23rd of July; I put them into a tray about nine that night - the tray was in the window; the window had not been opened after that till eleven o'clock in the morning, when the prisoner came in to look at them - I was not in the shop when he came in, but before he left, Etheridge, my young man, was in the shop, and called me in on account of another person coming into the shop; the prisoner was still there, and Etheridge had shown him some rings; the second person asked to look at some gold chains, but bought none; when I came into the shop Etheridge told me to attend to the prisoner with the rings, and he would show the chains - Etheridge then put the rings the prisoner had been looking at into the glass case; the prisoner desired to look at other rings - I showed him a separate tray of diamond rings; he bought nothing - the other party made several equivocal remarks about the chains; we had none to suit him - that drew my attention from the rings to him; they both went away nearly together, but went separate ways, to the best of my recollection; the prisoner bought nothing; immediately that he left I missed a diamond ring, value fifteen guineas - I did not miss the other till the prisoner was brought back; I immediately sent Etheridge to follow him - he was brought back in less than half a minute; I accused him of robbing me of a diamond ring - he denied it, and while an officer was sent for he tried to escape out of the door; Etheridge threw the door too, and the prisoner's shoulder went through the glass - he was not able to get out of the shop; the officer came, searched him, and found 18d. in silver, three duplicates, and 5d. in copper on him - there was no money to pay for valuable rings; before the officer came I saw him take his handkerchief out of his coat pocket, and saw one ring fall from it - I am certain it fell from him; I would not pick it up - it was picked up, and was mine; that had not been in the tray I showed him, but in the former one - the other ring was picked up afterwards in the street, but not in my presence, nor on the same day; I claimed it at Hatton-garden - it had been offered in pledge; the party was detained, and it was advertised - that was the 15l. one; the ring he dropped was worth 4l. 8s. - I have not seen the person who wanted the gold chains since.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I suppose people often come to your shop who do not return? A. Frequently; I do not know what passed before Etheridge called me - I found the prisoner looking at the rings, and the other person asked to see chains as I came into the shop; I had sorted the rings on the Friday evening, between nine and ten o'clock - I was in the shop all the evening; I had no customers after that, nor in the morning till the prisoner came - I think the prisoner went out first, but they left so near together I cannot say; the prisoner went down Ludgate-hill, towards Fleet-market - he desired to see another tray; I cannot say whether he asked for my card, or whether he had one; I do not recollect giving him one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not give him a card, and press him to come again, saying you would get such a ring as he required? A. I cannot say - it is very possible; whether the tray of valuable rings was on the counter when he returned I do not recollect - I had missed the valuable one before he returned, but not the other; the tray that was in was put into the glass case before the expensive rings were shown him, and had not been taken out - I missed the diamond ring on replacing them in the tray; that was the last tray - I had no idea the other was stolen till it dropped from him; I know that the prisoner went down Ludgate-hill - I looked particularly at him, he being the one I attended to; I do not recollect having any conversation with my shopman about the prisoner's conduct - I do not recollect his saying it was impossible the prisoner could have taken the low priced ring, as he looked particularly at him from the time he came in; I will not swear that he did or did not say so - I was asked about this at Guildhall, and said I was not aware of it; my shopman was not before the Magistrate - the prisoner complained about that, and I said we could not both leave the shop at the same time; the prisoner did not desire the examination to be postponed till he could hear the shopman's evidence - he was remanded from Saturday till Tuesday, to bring evidence of his respectability, and have Counsel; I heard nothing of the shopman being wanted till Tuesday - he went before the Grand Jury.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Lamb's employ. On Saturday morning, the 24th of July, I saw the prisoner come into the shop - I was alone; he asked to look at some rings - I showed him some; he wanted sporting rings that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160005"/>would spring open to have hair in it - I showed him what rings we had, but we had not one that would exactly suit him; the common ring was in the tray at the time I showed it him; that tray was not in order, or I should have missed it, but the tray Mr. Lamb showed him was perfectly in order - I saw his right hand go to his handkerchief, which was in his hand; he then passed it from one hand to the other, then put his hand into his pocket very quick, but I did not at that time miss any thing; he then asked to look at other rings - I put the first rings into the glass case on the counter, and took out another tray; another person came in, pointed to the window, and asked me to show him some chains - I called Mr. Lamb; the other was very anxious for me to show him the chains while I was attending to the prisoner, but I could not; I called Mr. Lamb, and put the tray of rings down before Mr. Lamb for him to serve the prisoner - it was on the counter, within the prisoner's reach; the other person bought nothing - while I was serving him Mr. Lamb got out the tray of best rings, so that there were two trays on the counter; he turned round to me to ask what priced chains the person wanted and on turning back he missed the valuable ring - they both left the shop almost together; the other one said he wanted a chain at about 10s. - Mr. Lamb said, "You cannot have one at 10s.," and he went out, and the prisoner followed him; Mr. Lamb immediately said "There is a diamond ring gone;" I followed after the prisoner; he was four or five doors off - I tapped him on the shoulder, and told him to step back, for Mr. Lamb wanted to speak to him; he seemed very much confused, but came back, and I kept close to him - I thought he wanted to get his hand into his pocket, but I was so close to him he could not, and when we got to the door he said, "What, into the door, Sir?" I then took hold of him, and pushed him in; Mr. Lamb accused him of stealing a diamond ring - he tried to rush out of the shop; I slammed the door too, and broke the glass with his shoulder - Mr. Lamb seized hold of him then, and said, "Etheridge, there, he has just thrown one down," and I saw the ring on the floor, close to his heels; it could not have dropped from the tray - it had been in the tray I showed him before Mr. Lamb came into the shop- he must have put it into his pocket when he got hold of his handkerchief; when Mr. Lamb said he had thrown one down, I saw his handkerchief in his hand, but had not seen him pull it out; a man at the door asked if I wanted an officer - I said Yes, and he fetched one; I saw him searched - nothing was found on him to purchase a ring with.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Does Mr. Lamb keep any other shopman? A. No; I am not aware of having told him it was impossible for the prisoner to have stolen a ring - I may have said I looked very sharp after him, for I was rather suspicious of him; I do not think I told Mr. Lamb any thing of the sort - it was stated at Guildhall that I said so; if I did, I must be very much mistaken; I swear the ring which dropped from his pocket was in the tray when I took it out to show him - there were but two of the sort in the tray; to the best of my belief I never said I was quite sure he could not have concealed a ring - I will not swear it - when I went out I found the prisoner two or three doors below; he was walking very fast - I hardly lost sight of him; I was not confused - Mr. Lamb has no partner; the dwelling-house is over the shop, and he lives there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever see the most valuable ring at Hatton-garden? A. It was first brought to our shop - I saw it there; Mr. Lamb went to Hatton-garden, claimed it, and received it.</p>

            . This is the ring; I am certain it was in the tray I showed the prisoner - it is marked 4l. 8s.; the other was worth 15l. I believe - it was certainly worth 10l. to any one in the trade.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You cannot say whether it was found on any body who had been in your shop? A. I understand it was found in the street, nearly opposite the door - the intrinsic value of the other is three guineas or 3l. 5s.; we do not all agree in the value of a diamond - the other ring was in the tray when Mr. Lamb took it out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The two witnesses have perjured themselves in various points, and I leave myself entirely to your merciful consideration; my friends, who live in Essex, were here last night, but are obliged to attend in in the country on urgent business - as to saying the witnesses are perjured, that merely alludes to the hearing at Guildhall; I was committed for stealing a ring, value 4l. - Mr. Lamb then said his shopman said it was impossible for me to conceal the ring I was first charged with; the shopman said the other gentleman entered the shop as an accomplice - I knew nothing of him.</p>

On the 2nd of September, at four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw them together in my room - when he came in he said, "Where is the seven people that said I had the shoes?" I said I did not know that there were seven - I did not know that more than one had said he had the shoes; his wife was present, and said, "What did you come here for?" and called him a prig - I understand that to mean a dishonest person; he then sat down in the room by his wife - no violence followed in consequence of her calling him a prig - he sat down and talked to her; I do not know what about: there did not seem any anger between them then; she went out and got some binding to bind her shoes, and then bound one pair while he remained in the room - he continued to sit on the same seat; she was out about half an hour - they did not appear in anger while she was binding the shoes; when she had done them he said he had got a few halfpence with him, and would have a little gin - he sent out for gin; three half-quarterns were brought, and four of us partook of it, the prisoner, his wife, myself, and Mary Ann Short - none of us were intoxicated: we then had some tea, which was provided at our joint expence - the prisoner partook of it; there did not appear any ill will between him and his wife then: we finished tea about half-past five o'clock; the prisoner then said he should be glad if his wife would give him the price of half a pint of rum - she said she would give him no rum; there was a noise out of doors - we all locked out of window; I ran into the other room to look out - I returned; the prisoner and his wife were still in the room with Short- we then sat down a bit; he and his wife appeared joking together - the prisoner then asked me how many times Mr. Kelly had been there: I had seen Kelly three times at my room - he is a shoemaker: she used to say he was a first cousin of Mr. Hectrup's - she bound shoes for Kelly's master: I said Kelly had been there three times to my knowledge - he said he should like to know who had the shoes- there had been an inquiry about a pair of shoes before this; he said he would tell who had the shoes if his wife would give him the rum - she had lost a pair of shoes that morning.</p>

               <p>Q. When the prisoner came at four o'clock was he at all intoxicated? A. Not at all, he was very sober; he had no liquor after the gin - he got up and said to his wife,"Ayn't you sorry for the shoes you have lost to-day?" she said, "No, not at all;" I saw him take up a knife which laid on the window - it was a knife she used to cut the shoes with; he sat close to it - he took it up, and stabbed it three times into his wife's chest - he jabbed it to her breast, but the busk of her stays kept it from her body - he did not wound her then; I said, "Lord have mercy upon me! the man is going to kill the woman;" I was afraid of it at the time, and called Mrs. Morris from the next room - I ran down stairs, and saw no more of it; I heard her halloo Murder! I did not see her again till she came out of the hospital, for I ran into a neighbour's house - I left him and her struggling together in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed her do any thing to him before he attempted to stab her or after? A. Not at all; she never touched him while I was in the room - she had called him a prig, but after that they were sociable and drank together; there did not appear any animosity between them then.</p>

I produce the gown and clothes which Mrs. Hectrup had on at the time - I received them from Mrs. Short the next day; they are in the same state as I received them - here are two or three cuts in the breast, and here are three cuts about the thigh; I saw her when this happened - she was quite exhausted from the loss of blood; I paid the coach, and sent Short with her to the hospital - I visited her twice there; she was in bed the first time - the last time was the 8th of September, when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160008"/>I fetched her from the hospital before the Magistrate; I have made every search for her, but she is not here.</p>
               <p>MRS. SHORT. I delivered these clothes to the constable - they are the same she wore at the time, and are in the same state as I received them at the hospital.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been brought here quite ignorant of the case; my wife sent me word that she had been in fault, and was willing to forgive me the little accident she met with - she sent word she would not come forward for five hundred guineas; as such I have no Counsel or friends to attend to my interest - I throw myself on the mercy of the Jury; when I was put into the Compter before, it was through Kelly, who led me to give her a box, and after being in the Compter two or three days, I was told by a witness I could produce that she had been walking with Kelly in Finsbury-square; she came to the prison the day after, laughed at me through the window, and asked if any body had told me any thing about her - I said I had been told she had been walking with Kelly - she denied it, and said it was another shoemaker belonging to her master in Coleman-street; I told her her own uncle had made a remark to me about her, that they had been seen together, and if she would come home and be peaceable in future, I never would rebuke her with what had passed; I told her all that had happened from time to time, and before she should come to public scandal, I was willing to forgive her- I declare to God Almighty I was as fond of her as ever a man was of his wife: when I went to the room that day she went out for half an hour - Short was talking about her: I remarked to Short that her dress was not fit for a journeyman shoemaker's wife, and I did not know how she got the clothes; Short told me several times that Kelly had been there: she did not know it, but that worked up my feelings - I had been very affectionate to my wife; I found myself changed - there was a knife by the shoes; whether I caught it first or she I declare to the great Heavens I do not know, but in the scuffle between us, in which I was quite exhausted, for I was quite out of my mind - in the scuffle she and I fell together on the ground, and what little wound she received was at that time; the knife appears to some very awful, but it was the cut I got in my hand caused the blood to be on it - I do not deny there was a knife between us both, but I never intended to hurt a hair of her head; I could not bear myself when Short told me what she did: I do not blame her for it, as she did not know the effect it would have on me - I have no Counsel, for I did not know I could be convicted in this manner.</p>

Reading Bank notes, and from the drawer twenty silver spoons and a gold ring, which were worth about 13l. - I had four notes in the box a few days previous, and this paper, containing the numbers of them, was in the drawer, by the side of the plate; the numbers were (reads) 5831, 4103, 5464, and 5317 - they were Simmons' bank of Reading; I had paid away one of the notes a few days previous; I could not tell which: I did not see the prisoner again for a week or ten days, when he was in custody in London - he had given me not the slightest notice that he was about to quit.</p>

Straghan, the baker, and another person came to my assistance - I left Taylor in their charge; I fetched a watchman, who took charge of him - he was taken to the station-house, searched there, and a crow-bar, some skeleton-keys, and I believe one picklock-key, and a fire-box found in his pocket - I saw him searched, and saw two slices of ham found in his pocket; we returned to my house, and found on the stairs a dark-lantern, and my clothes tied up in a bundle handkerchief, which was not mine; they were about half way up the stairs which the men came down; I searched the house over, and found the box from which my clothes had been taken open, and nothing but a handkerchief in it - it was in the back room first floor; I had seen it just at dusk - it was shut then; the Policeman has my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it not rather a dark night? A. It was rather dark I believe - I have no recollection of the second man, but I got hold of Taylor in the shop before the door was open, he was never out of my shop till I took hold of him - I kept him till Straghan and Smith took hold of him; he did not escape from them.</p>

            . I am a journeyman pork-butcher. On the 12th of August, about a quarter-past eleven o'clock, I stood by my brother's shop, and heard a cry of Watch! I crossed over the way, and saw Hobson's door open, and two men inside, scuffling; I saw the prisoner Allen come out of Hobson's door, and run away - I was about five yards from him or less; I ran after him, calling Stop thief! for about a quarter of a mile to Hoxton-square, and never lost sight of him; he ran - I pursued after him, and never lost sight of him; Smith, the watchman, took him- I am quite certain of him - I had not seen him before that night; I am certain he is the man - I was present when the Policeman searched him under the lamp-post, and found three false collars, a penknife, a silk handkerchief, and a few halfpence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. It was a dark night? A. Rather darkish; when the alarm was given I went towards the door - there was nobody between me and the person who came from the shop, not that I saw; I cannot recollect - there might be persons passing on the other side of the road, but I saw him run out, and immediately called Stop thief! I was crossing the road - nobody came out of the shop but him; I saw the door opened, and a scuffle ensued - nobody was between me and the person who came out; I looked at him, and not behind me - nobody was passing on the same side as the prosecutor's house I am certain: other people ran as well as me - the watchman came ahead of me, and took him; a man, who is not here, had hold of his collar first, and the watchman took hold of him next.</p>
               <p>Q. The person who came out of the shop was not the person scuffling? A. No - I ran after him immediately - there was nobody nearer to him than me, except the young man who took him and the watchman; the young man is an oilman, and lives in Shoreditch - he was not before the Magistrate; I followed close at the prisoner's heels, within three yards of him, and never lost sight of him - there are about two turnings in the space he ran, there may be more- I will not swear there are not six; I had never seen the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You pursued within three yards of him, and never lost sight of him? A. No, and was close to him when the young man took him.</p>

            . I am a private watchman. On the night of the 12th of August I was alarmed by a cry of Stop thief! I was standing at the corner of Edward-street and saw the prisoner Allen running in a direct road from the prosecutor's house; I made a snatch at him as he came past me, but missed him, and pursued him - Smith was close behind him; he ran right up Edward-street - I might be two yards from him; a young man named Stone got before him in Hoxton-square - I saw him stop him, and received him in charge; three false-collars, a penknife, a silk handkerchief, and a few halfpence were found on him - he said the collars were his own; I went with him to the station-house, and he there said he had bought the collars that day in Petticoat-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe they sell collars there? A. I do not know - he was not out of my sight; Edward-street is about fifty yards from Hobson's - I will not swear it is not one hundred, but do not think it exceeds sixty; I ran before the last witness - I can only answer for myself: I did not lose sight of him; I swear I was not ten yards from him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is there any turning from the corner of Edward-street to where he was taken? A. Yes, one; I was not more than four yards from him all the way: I made three or four attempts to take hold of his clothes.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I was on duty in the Kingsland-road about a quarter-past eleven o'clock, and heard a cry of Watch! Police! Stop thief! I immediately ran to the corner of Edward-street - before I got to the corner I saw Allen running across Kingsland-road, and the two last witnesses pursuing him; I immediately followed him through Edward-street, and into Hoxton-square - there is a slight turning; I lost sight of him, but Smiths were before me close to the prisoner - I lost sight of him for half a minute, while I was going round the corner - I saw him again when I got round into the square; I swear he is the same man I saw running in Kingsland-road- I searched him, and found three shirt-collars, a handkerchief, a pen-knife, and a few halfpence on him; I took him to the station-house, returned to the prosecutor's, and went up stairs with him, and on the stairs found a dark-lantern and this bundle, containing a coat, waistcoat, trousers, and shirt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Does the Kingsland-road turn out of Edward-street? A. Edward-street turns out of Kingsland-road to Hoxton-square; there is a turning in the square, and a slant, which if you call it a turning makes two: I did not lose sight of him at the slant - he was taken in Hoxton-square; I ran on hearing the cry - both the Smiths were before me, but I was running a different way; I met them - they ran towards me, and passed within two or three yards of where I was, and I ran after them; Stone is not here - where he came from I cannot say.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was your sight of Allen intercepted except at the turning? A. No; I came across the road, and met him - I have shown the collars to the prosecutor.</p>

            . I am a watchman - I was on duty: the prosecutor's is on my beat. On the 12th of August, at ten o'clock, I passed his door, tried it, and found it fast - I pushed against it; I met Hobson coming home as I was calling eleven, about two minutes and a half after I had passed his door - I was afterwards alarmed by the call of Watch! and Thieves! I went to the corner of Kingsland-road, and met Hobson alone - he took me back to where Taylor was in charge of some neighbours, and gave him in charge; I saw him searched, and a phosphorus-box, five skeleton-keys, a picklock-key, and a crow-bar were found on him; the Police have them.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I took the prisoner on the 21st of August, in Millbank-row - I did not make him any promise or threaten him; I asked if he knew Mr. Lawrence, of St. John-street - he said No; I told him I had reason to suspect him of stealing eight sovereigns from Mr. Lawrence, and he must go with me - he then said he did not take so many as eight, but acknowledged taking some, and at the station-house I heard him acknowledge taking seven; no threat or promise was made to him there - he said he had changed one sovereign at Mr. Morgan's, in Oakley-street, for a pair of trousers; I inquired, and found that true - he said he had lost some at Camberwell-fair, but he could not tell how many.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I do not remember saying what the Policeman says about the sovereigns.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a very good character.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I was on duty on this Saturday night, in Hermitage-street, Wapping, about half-past eleven o'clock, and heard the cry of Robbery! Murder! Watch! and Police! I made towards the spot, and saw the prisoner running from the dock wall; he cut across, and ran down Hermitage-street - he was the first person running; he was running away very hard - when I saw him run I followed him; he met me, but turned down the street - I ran after him, overtook him, and collared him; when he found I was gaining on him, he called Watch! Watch! I collared<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160013"/>him, and he then said to me, "There is a man been robbed near the dock wall, and I am calling out Watch! for him;" I then told him I must proceed with him to where the noise first came from, and in my way I met a brother officer, and proceeded with him to the spot - there was a mob collected, and the prosecutor appeared all over blood, as if he had been knocked down; he had his senses about him perfectly - he was not at all drunk; I searched the prisoner before I got to the spot, and found only a tobacco-pouch, a knife, and handkerchief on him- the pouch was in his pocket; when we got to the spot where the man was knocked down, we took his hat off, and a lot of silver and copper fell out; we picked it up, put it into the handkerchief, and a little further there were two sovereigns picked up, near to where he had been; as I took him to the watch-house I heard something drop either from his month or sleeve - I picked it up, and found it was a sovereign; my brother officer opened his hand, and found half a crown and a halfpenny in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. It was half-past eleven o'clock? A. Yes - it was dark; there are gaslights there - Hermitage-street is a great thoroughfare; there were not many persons passing at the time - there might be one or two; I could see no more - I saw the prisoner plainly; I might be about the length of this Court from him at first; I had seen him before that night three or four times - there are three or four gas-lights, and he came running towards me; I first saw him coming from the dock wall - I took him in Hermitage-street, which may be one-eighth of a mile from the wall; I did not lose sight of him - I cannot say whether he knew me- I saw him in less than half a minute after I first heard the cry of Stop thief! it was all in a moment; there might be another person running.</p>

On the night of the 6th of August, I fastened the house up, between seven and eight o'clock, and went to bed between ten and half-past ten; two gentlemen who sleep up stairs, and lodge with me, were in the house when I fastened it - nobody came in after I fastened it up, to my knowledge; about two in the morning I was alarmed by the breaking of glass - I got up, went to the window, and looked out, but could see nothing; I concluded it might be something thrown out of the opposite house, and went to bed - in about ten minutes I was alarmed by the Police-officer, who called to me by name to get up, saying there had been thieves on the premises; I dressed myself, unlocked the doors, and came down - the prisoner had then been sent away in custody; I examined the premises, and found some glass broken in a window on the first floor up stairs - it is a sash that is always shut, and hangs on binges overhead; it pushes up, and when let go it falls too - no property was taken or disturbed; I was not the first person that examined the window.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. On the night of the 6th of August I was on duty, and heard a rattle spring; I ran up immediately, and found the prisoner in Daly's custody, in George-street, near Barron's house - he was taken to the station, but not searched in my presence; I got on the top of the prosecutor's door, and saw the window broken - outside the window I saw a crow-bar and dark lantern, which appeared warm; one part of it was in one place, and another in another, as if it had fallen out of their hands - the window was broken; it then comes back - it might be swung back, and a person get in; I found a piece of crape and a bundle handkerchief on the premises.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the morning of the 7th of August, I first saw the prisoner and two others standing against the chapel wall (the prosecutor's house is the Spanish Ambassador's chapel); as I went up, one of them pretended to be easing himself - I asked what they did there - he said he was there for a necessary<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160014"/>purpose; I said he ought to be taken to the watch-house for committing a nuisance - they said they were strangers, and would be obliged to me to overlook it; I went down King-street, turned to the left, and met my serjeant - I returned the same way, and as I passed Little George-street I looked down the street, and saw a man standing against the door; I knew him to be one of the party I had moved off ten minutes before - it was not the prisoner; I took that man into custody for loitering about the street, and asked where his companions were - he said he knew nothing of them; there is an entrance near there - I went, and could not find his companions; I came out, looked up at the window, and saw the glass broken; I called Barron, and told him there were thieves in the chapel, as I heard footsteps there - the prisoner then looked out from the broken square of glass; I sprang my rattle, and he came out at that window - there is a portico near the window; he came down that, and I laid hold of him - another man followed him out of the house; I had two in custody then, and the third man jumped on me and threw us three down, but I always kept hold of the prisoner, and am certain he is the man I saw within the window; I found a phosphorus-box, containing matches, in his pocket - the serjeant brought in a crow-bar, a piece of crape, and a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Had you seen the chapel safe before? A. Yes - this is a front window on the first floor; I had been desired to look after that house, as it had been attempted two nights before - the pane of glass is about eighteen inches by fourteen; there was no ladder to the window, but there is a portico - it was after two o'clock; there is a gas-lamp about two yards off - he opened the window and came out; I examined the window after - it was not open then, but others had been on the premises; I took him as he came down off the portico- he was never out of my custody.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see him come out? A. Yes - he came out from under the window; the hinges are at the top - he came out of the window.</p>

             re-examined. I keep the Spanish Ambassador's chapel, and live in it; there is a bed-room for me up stairs; the two gentlemen up stairs were clergymen who lodged there for a few nights.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. This is the chapel window? A. Yes - there is a door communicating from my room to the chapel; it is under the same roof - the door comes out of my bed room into the chapel; I had fastened the window the night before - the only part broken was the pane of glass; nobody could get through that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If a person broke a hole in the window, and put his hand in, could he open it, and let himself in? A. Yes, by pulling it towards him he could go in under it - the room I sleep in is attached to the chapel; it is my ordinary room - the clergymen were only sleeping there a few nights, and slept in the garret; nobody usually sleeps there but me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner made no defence.</p>

            . I live at Hornsey, near the church. I am beadle and constable. On Monday afternoon, the 16th of August, a few minutes before five o'clock, I saw the three prisoners coming in a direction from Muswell-hill, and followed them - they were near the workhouse; one of them was asking a man the way to Hornsey-wood, but which I cannot say - Gray was carrying a bundle on his head, tied in a gardener's blue apron, filled with grass; I asked him what he had got tied in his bundle - they were altogether; he said he had got a bundle of grass - I asked where he was going to take it, and told him I suspected he had something more than that, and to put it down, which he did; he untied two of the corners, threw them back, then stooped down, took up two handsfull of grass, and said, "Now I suppose you are convinced it is nothing but grass" - he put the grass down, and was going to tie the apron up, but I said untie the other; he refused - I did it, and found the time-piece in it; when I stooped to untie it the other two ran away - I gave an alarm of Stop thief! and they were taken almost immediately; I took them home, and found a letter on Shaw sealed up.</p>

            . I live on Finchley-common, within a quarter of a mile of Mr. Cooper's. On the 16th of August, a little after four o'clock, I stood at my gate, and saw the three prisoners, I believe, and two men coming along the road in company; they were coming towards Muswell-hill - Gray stooped down, and was packing something up; the others stood by the while - they then went over the fields behind a house, about one hundred yards from me; they were there about five minutes, and then went towards Highgate, and I lost them - I was not above sixty yards from them, but could not see what they were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160015"/>packing up; there was a hedge between us - next morning I found some bent glass in the ditch where I had seen Gray packing something up, and have it here; there are only three pieces of it.</p>
               <p>Tilsley. Q. Do you say I was one of them? A. I will not swear to any of them, but to the best of my knowledge they appear like the three boys.</p>
               <p>MR. COOPER. This is the time-piece I lost on the 16th of August; the window is about two feet from the ground.</p>
               <p>Gray's Defence. I was going along with three more boys fishing; I met two gentlemen, who called me and asked me to carry that bundle, and said they would give me a shilling, and being hungry and willing to earn a shilling, I took the bundle; they told me to carry it to Hornsey-house.</p>
               <p>Shaw's Defence. In the street Tilsley, lives a cart came to bring some straw to a man - we rode in the cart to Muswell-hill, and when we got out I picked up that letter.</p>
               <p>Tilsley's Defence. We asked a gentleman the nearest way to London - he sent us over Muswell-hill; we met Gray - he asked us the way to Hornsey-house; we did not know, and asked a man, who said straight on - the gentleman met Gray, and called after us; we ran away as we were heaving stones.</p>
               <p>One witness deposed to Gray and Tilsley's good character, and two deposed the same for Shaw.</p>

I have known the prisoners nine years - they lived near me, and I knew their voices well. About half-past one o'clock in the night I heard the sheep disturbed, and after that heard a hurdle crack, as if it was breaking; there were two hurdles set in a gateway, to from a gate, and I heard the voices of both the prisoners speaking to each other in the field where the sheep were disturbed - they said to each other "We will make a thorough clearance;" I had

No, that is a relation of his; he lives at Sunbury, and he has no partner; the prisoner's house is about two hundred yards from where the sheep were - I am quite certain of both their voices; I had seen them about two days before.</p>

            . I have no partner. I went to Leach's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160016"/>house, and found both the prisoners there; I saw the sheep immediately as they were taken out of the bed - they were mine, and ewes, worth from 28s. to 30s. together: I had a large quantity there, from Wilton fair the evening before - I bought four hundred and ten, and in the morning two were missing; they were marked the same way as several of the others; I have no doubt of them.</p>

               <p>Leach's Defence. I was going home from the Black Horse on Saturday night, about eleven o'clock, was very tipsy, and this man was with me, going to see if we could get some more beer, and by Jones' orchard I said, "There is something lays by the side of the road;" I went to feel it, and fell down on the two sheep, but whose sheep they were I could not say; I took them home, and when the witnesses came to my house I was in bed - I got out, looked out of window, and said, "Halloo! who is there?" Mr. Corby said he wanted to speak to me; I went down stairs, opened the door, and Corby I believe came in - I could not find the matches to strike a light; Hill went home and brought one - he came in doors: I said, "I do not think you have any great right to search my premises at this time of night;" Hill said, "Come on," and when they had got six or seven yards Barnes said, "There is no doubt but what the sheep are here;" Hill said, "Then stop here all night;" this man was in my house at the time dead asleep, as he went home drunk - I did not know what to do with the sheep; whether they were his or any body else's I knew I was wrong in having them there.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer, and live at No. 9, Portpool-lane, Gray's Inn-lane. On Monday, the 16th of August, I had been to Cromer-street, and was returning home a few minutes before twelve o'clock at night - I passed the corner of Well-street, leading into Gray's Inn-road; there are houses on one side of that street, and the brick wall of St. Andrew's burial-ground on the other - the wall turns again down at Gray's Inn-road, towards Battle-bridge, and in the centre of the wall is the gate leading into the burial-ground; at the opposite corner of Well-street is the Calthorpe Arms public-house - on arriving at the angle of the wall in Gray's Inn-road, I just pulled out my watch to see the time, and saw three men come up Well-street into <placeName id="t18300916-15-crimeloc92">Gray's Inn-road</placeName>

               <p>Q. Then when you say you saw him strike his left arm, it must be a mistake? A. I cannot positively say which arm it was, but I saw his arm go very plain to the Policeman's left side - it was a very sharp blow, very quick; the Policeman instantly fell down on his right knee, and said, "Good God! I am a dead man;" I heard that very plain - the two men on his left ran down Gray's Inn-lane, towards Battle-bridge; the prisoner was one of those two- the other man turned short, and went down Well-street, the same way as they had come up: I am certain of the prisoner, for I followed him down, and never lost sight of him till he was stopped by Mr. Cubit's private watchman, Prindwill - I found him in his custody about one hundred yards from where the blow was given, or it might be more but I followed him; it was near Cubit's premises - I never lost sight of him: while I was following him I saw him throw something to the right and something to the left - I pointed out the spot to

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The spot where the Policeman met his death was not so well lighted as some other places? A. There is a light right opposite the spot, so that I could see very plain, and there is a lamp on that side - the light was so strong I could see any thing - my watch wanted about twenty minutes to twelve o'clock- I could see that; I never saw the prisoner before - people very soon came up to pursne, but I saw the prisoner very distinctly all the way till he was taken, as plain as I do you; I should think twenty or thirty yards the greatest distance he was from me - he crossed the road - I do not know that I should know the features of any of them, but I followed Smith; I should think not half a minute elapsed from the time the Policeman spoke to them till he fell - they were very quick about it; a young man named Dennis was running with me, and there were two or three running behind me - nobody was between me and the prisoner- he was the only person before me, I am quite sure; I lost the man who ran with the prisoner in a dark corner, when he had run about forty yards, before I saw the prisoner throw something to the right and left - I came up directly the watchman had caught hold of him; I saw no mark of blood on any part of him - I went with him to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160017"/>the station, and was examined at the Police-office; I never saw the deceased before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Of the two men you saw on the Policeman's left hand side, was the prisoner nearest to him or not? A. He was nearest - I cannot say whether it was him that struck; I saw the arm go very plain, and it certainly was the arm of the man who was nearest to him - the two stood very close together; I am sure the prisoner is the person who stood nearest to him.</p>

            . I am an unfortunate girl. On the 16th of August I lived in Pheasant-buildings, Gray's Inn-lane - I knew Long the Policeman by sight; I never spoke to him but three times - I saw him, and spoke to him on the night in question, about a quarter to eleven o'clock, in Gray's Inn-road; he was coming with his face towards Battle-bridge, and he gave me 1d. - I wished him good night, and went towards Victoria-street, Battle-bridge; I came back from there about twenty minutes or a quarter to twelve o'clock, and came down Gray's Inn-road, with my face towards Holborn - I there met a gentleman, and went with him to the Calthorpe Arms, but did not set down there - I had a glass of rum, and he a glass of ale; we left immediately - he came out of the house with me, and had hold of my right hand; he was next to the wall - we came on as far as the burial-ground gate, and stopped - he held my hand, and I was looking towards Well-street - I saw three men, and a man rather behind them; they were coming towards me - two of the three immediately surrounded the man; I cannot say whether the other surrounded him - they were more towards my left side, near the kennel; they surrounded the man who was coming behind; I did not see what became of the third man - I saw one of the two men run away; he had one a blue coat with very large capes, and was rather broad in the shoulders - his coat was buttoned straight down with gilt buttons; he seemed to me rather in a state of intoxication - he came first towards where I stood, then reeled across the road, and the instant he ran away (the one in brown had his great coat open, and his close coat appeared to me more of a brown than the great coat; I was so close under the lamp I could see the inner coat was more brown than the top coat - there was sufficient light to distinguish colours) the one in the brown coat struck the Policeman in this way(backhanded) - I did not see that man's face till I saw him turn towards me, which he did immediately after he had struck - I then observed his features; he ran across the road, in a direction towards Battle-bridge - I was still standing under the lamp when he passed me, and saw his face - the instant he ran away the Policeman placed his hand out and said, "Stop him! I am a dead man;" there are two gas-lamps at the gate of the burial-ground - I attended to the deceased, and did not pursue the man: I did not lose sight of him from the time I saw him strike the blow till he passed me near the lamp - he passed within five yards of me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see that person again? A. I saw him about five or six minutes after - I was then at the surgeon's door; the prisoner is that man, but he had a brown coat on when I saw him - he was between two men; I do not know whether they were Policemen - I did not know he was in custody; he was quite close to me, and I said, "Good God! that is the man that struck the blow;" I did not observe whether he made any answer - he must have heard me; it was him I applied the observation to - I had not the least doubt of his being the man who struck the blow, nor have I now;

Yes; I had a glass of rum - I had not drank with any body else that day, and was perfectly sober; I had drank nothing else- three persons went up to the Policeman; they first had their faces towards Battle-bridge; they instantly surrounded him - the two that were on my left side, nearest the road, surrounded him first; I do not know what the other did - the prisoner was nearer to the Policeman than the man in blue, but they were all three close; the prisoner and the man in blue were the closest; the other seemed more distant from him - the one in blue started first, and the prisoner next; it was all done in an instant- I saw the man in blue as far as the riding-school, about the length of this Court; as I went to assist the deceased my back was towards the persons running - there was another man examined at the office, but I was not examined about any body but the prisoner; there were a great many taken up whom I could not speak to - I was asked about them, but knew nothing about them whether they were the men or not; I never saw the prisoner before - I saw Millican there; he seemed coming in the same direction as the Policeman, and was nearer to him than me; Dennis came to my assistance - the prisoner ran as fast as he could.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see the blow actually given, or only the hand lifted up? A. I saw the hand lifted up towards some part of the Policeman's bosom - I saw him in the act of striking against his bosom; the man in blue had run away before the man in brown struck.</p>

            . My father is a milkman, and lives in James-street, Wellington-square, near Gray's Inn-road. On the 16th of August, about ten minutes or a quarter to twelve o'clock, I was in Gray's Inn-road, going towards Battle-bridge, and just as I passed the corner of the burial-ground, I saw four persons before me: as I came nearer I saw the one rather behind the other three was a Policeman - he appeared to be driving these men on before him; two of them were on his left hand, and one on his right - I was ten or twelve yards from them; there are three gas-lights, one nearly opposite the burial-ground, which gave a strong light, and one on each side the burial-ground - I am positively sure the prisoner was one of the three; he was the nearest one to the Policeman on the left side - I saw his hand go towards the Policeman backhanded; it seemed to go very sharp - the Policeman instantly fell on his right knee, with his left leg out; the man on the right hand then turned short round to the right, and passed me - he went into Well-street, for I looked round almost immediately, and missed him - the prisoner and the other man went off at first towards a wall, and as soon as they got a little distance into the dark I observed them set off at full run; I went and took hold of the Policeman, who was on his right knee, with his left<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160018"/>leg out - I took him round the waist; he said, "I am stabbed, I am stabbed!" Code was then close behind me, and came to my assistance - I found a rattle in the Policeman's right hand; I left him in Code's hands, and directly followed the two men, springing the rattle all the way: they were never out of my sight till I pursued; I cried Stop thief! and Murder! - just at the moment I began to halloo I observed them set off running - they were lurking along the wall till I began to spring the rattle; one of them kept straight down, and the other, I suppose, turned to the left, as I missed him; the prisoner is the man that kept straight down - I followed him till I saw him in the hands of Cubit's watchman; he had his left arm close to his chest; I only saw him swinging his right arm along, but did not see him throw any thing away - I did not hear any thing strike against the farrier's gate by the barracks; I went up when I saw him in the watchman's hands, and was sure he was the man I saw strike the Policeman - I returned, and assisted in taking the Policeman to Mr. Holmes'; he was dead before he got there - I saw him undressed there, and a knife without a handle sticking in his left side; Clements and Martin have since pointed out two spots to me - the prisoner ran over that ground I am certain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You was coming from Well-street? A. No, down from Holborn way - I passed the end of Well-street, and saw Millican; I can positively undertake to say the prisoner was one of them - he was the nearest to him; the wound was on the left side, towards the front, between the fourth and fifth rib.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were behind, and the blow struck on that part, could you see which of four arms struck that blow? A. Yes, because his back was towards me, and at the time the prisoner struck he turned his side face towards me; the Policeman was very close to the prisoner, but the other man on the left stood farther off - there was a small space between the two on the left; I could see between them - I am certain it was the prisoner, and not the other man who struck the blow; I pursued, and Millican stopped behind, I believe - I did not see him; he might be behind me: I noticed a man standing just as I got up to the Welsh school, but saw nobody standing or moving between me and the prisoner - I had a better opportunity of seeing what any body did than any body else who was pursuing; I did not see any action of the prisoner throwing any thing away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The Policeman did not strike either of the men, did he? A. I did not see him - he appeared to be driving them along - I did not hear him say or do any thing; I ran as fast as I could - Millican was not before me; he might be behind or nearly by my side, but I did not see any thing of him.</p>

            . I am watchman to Mr. Cubit, of Gray's Inn-road, between St. Andrew's burial-ground and Battle-bridge. On the night of the 16th of August I was on the premises, and heard a cry of Stop thief! Murder! and a rattle spring - I immediately went out of the gate on the pavement, and saw a man running towards me, in a direction from the burial-ground; he was on one side of the road, which is a dark side, and the opposite side to where I was; I crossed over to stop him - he ran across to the other side, to avoid my taking him; I secured him: several people were running after him, giving the alarm - I did not notice Dennis; a Policeman came and took him out of my hands, and one person told me to stop that man at the time he was running - I should not know that man again; I hardly know what passed when the Policeman came up, for as soon as he took him from me I went over to master's premises - when I took hold of him I asked the man who told me to stop him what he had done; he said he had stabbed a man down the road, or lower down, I am not certain which - the prisoner said he knew nothing about it; he was the first man I saw when I came into the road - there was nobody between me and him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You came out of Cubit's premises on hearing a cry, and at that time the first man you saw was the prisoner? A. Yes - I stood a few moments till I heard the cry, and a man told me to stop him before I did so; I did not notice whether his hands were bloody.</p>

             about thirteen minutes before twelve o'clock that night, and a few minutes before twelve I heard an alarm, but saw nothing of the transaction; I first saw the prisoner about ten yards from Prindwill, and saw him stop him - I went up, and found him in custody; as I ran after the prisoner I kicked a coat, but did not pick it up - it was afterwards picked up by Fuller; I was about five yards from him, but did not see him pick it up: I kicked against it in the direction the prisoner had run.</p>

            . I am in the employ of the Police, and was on duty, but did not see the prisoner till he was in custody; Johnson was there, and said, in his hearing, "I am sure I saw him throw something like a coat up in youder corner," pointing to it; the prisoner said nothing to that - he was near enough to hear it; Johnson also said, "I am sure that is the man:" the prisoner made no reply at all - I searched the spot pointed out by Johnson, and picked up a brown great coat, which I produce; I have had it ever since: on the other side of the way I found a crow-bar - this was about ten minutes to twelve o'clock, almost immediately after the man had been stabbed.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Guildford-street. The deceased was brought to my house about twelve o'clock on the night of the 16th - he was dead then; I saw the body immediately - it had a Police dress on; Dennis and a number of people brought it in; on examining the body, I discovered a knife which had penetrated between the fourth and fifth ribs on the left side; I tried to draw it out, but could not, and while I went to get an instrument, it was drawn out by Mr. Shipman, a surgeon; when I returned, I found the wound without the knife in it - the knife produced was given to me as the same; I gave it to Wilson; I cannot say who handed it to me - it was handed about; I afterwards opened the body, and found the knife had penetrated the heart, and there cannot be a doubt that caused his death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was a young man in apparent health? A. Yes; a great deal of blood had not effused from the wound externally, it was more internal; I suppose that arose from the knife remaining in the wound; I think it probable such a wound might be inflicted without blood coming on the person who did it, the knife remaining in the wound and the clothes on the body.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would not the flowing of the blood be obstructed in some degree by the knife remaining in? A. Yes; and the clothes would prevent it flowing on the person's hand - the clothes were saturated with blood - the knife had penetrated about four inches; considerable force had been used to send it that depth.</p>

A "Staymakers' Benefit Society" was formed and held at my house; the prisoner was a member, and he lodged at my house for two months before the 10th of September - the society's cash-box was kept in the club-room, and was left there on the Thursday evening, and about a quarter past five o'clock next morning the Police alarmed me; I looked out of window, and saw the prisoner standing by the Policeman - a coach was there; the Policeman said, "Here is a man with a box and great coat," and that he said he was a lodger of mine - I asked who it was; the prisoner looked up and said, "It is Windsor," which is a nick-name he went by, as he had resided there - I said it was all right, and shut the window down, but on recollection I was not certain whether he had brought a box to the house; I immediately went to the club-room and missed the society's box - I dressed, went down, and gave notice to the Police; I saw the box again the same morning, about seven o'clock, at St. James' watch-house - it was then broken open; it was under my care.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The club was held at your house? A.

Altogether about fifteen years, and contributed to the funds during that time; he has made claims which the club have resisted - he was excluded for breaking the articles; he was on full pay and had no right to be out of his house, but two men went down to Windsor, and found him, after nine o'clock on a rainy night, shutting up his shop - he contributed 4s. 6d. quarterly.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 10th of September, at five o'clock in the morning, I was near the North Pole with my serjeant, and saw the prisoner coming from there with a coat and box; I alarmed the landlord, who said it was all right - I let him go into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160020"/>coach and go away; in about half an hour, in consequence of information, I went to No. 36, Brill-row, Somers'-town, and saw the same coach stopping there, and from what I learned from a lady and gentleman there, I went into the kitchen, and found the box which I had seen him with, broken open, and one of the smaller ones in it also broken open - I went and found the prisoner the same night, about eight o'clock, in the same row; he was pointed cut to me by one of the society - he told me to take him and do as I liked with him, for he knew he had done wrong; he said he did not expect to get away with the box, for he thought Hill would have given him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He never denied taking it? A. Never, he said he had been to Mr. Harmer's to inquire if he had acted legally in taking it, and found he had done wrong; there was 25l. 18s. 11d. in the box which was not broken open - any body shaking it could tell there was money in it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARRSON. Q. Did he state he had consulted Mr. Harmer before he did it? A. No - he took it and then went to consult Mr. Harmer; here is the box - I found a poker laying by the side of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in his defence stated, that he had been expelled from the society for not leaving his employment, but was reinstated - that he was afterwards on the books on account of illness, and had been expelled for putting up his shutters, his wife being unable to do it; he had produced to the society a certificate from his surgeon, but they refused to attend to it, which irritated him, and he took the box, not from dishonest motives, but that they should reinstate him.</p>

Smith brought Brown to our shop; I found a wound extending from the angle of the mouth in a straight direction to, under, and behind the ear - it appeared to have been done with a sharp instrument - the cheek was not entirely divided, but the integuments were divided right through the facial artery; I could see the extent without probing it - the deepest part was about half an inch; he has been under my care till this time; the wound is doing well, but he is incapable of attending here.</p>

I was on duty, and in consequence of the alarm I went up to assist Cocking; I assisted in taking the prisoner to the watch-house- he was under my observation about three quarters of an hour: I considered him in a sober state - I afterwards took him to the Police-office, and on the road he asked what had become of his knife - I told him it was safe, and asked if he should know it again if he saw it; he said Yes - I showed him one which I got from Fagan, our inspector, and he said it was his; I did not make him either threat or promise; I asked if that was the knife he cut the gentleman's face with - he said it was: I asked what motive he had for it - he said he had no particular reason for doing it; I asked how long he had been from Ireland - he said twelve months last May, and that he lived in some court in Barbican.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came to London about Christmas, and got very good success sometimes, and poor at other times. I was in a lunatic asylum at Liverpool for about four weeks - it is called St. John's college; not being well encouraged here I was obliged to pledge my pipes for 12s., and to pay 4s. or 5s. out of it which I owed- I was a week without them, and being subject to fits of madness I threw myself into the river, which the turnkey of the Compter can certify, for I was there three days: what happened about this I cannot say; if any thing happens to me I wish to know what has happened to the Union pipes, which are the cause of my getting my bread.</p>

            , No. 22, John-street, Leicester; that he had left there about a fortnight before - I asked from whom he received the note? for what? and when? he said he had received it on the Saturday previous, which must have been the 3rd of July, (this was Wednesday) - I am quite certain he said so; I asked the hour of the day - he said ten o'clock; that he received it at Pershore from a person he did not know, in a public-house - I asked him the sign; he could not tell - he said he sold goods to the gentleman he had it from; I asked what goods - he said silk handkerchiefs, and other silks; I asked to what amount - he said to the amount of 45l.; I asked what change he gave - he said five sovereigns, and that he had never seen the person before; I asked where he had been every day from the time he left Leicester till he arrived in London - he could not tell where he had been on any one day, nor any one house he had put up at; he said he came to London as a hawker to buy goods, and remained till after the King's funeral - after he was in custody I desired him to be taken to Mr. B. Lewis,' Wych-street; I asked where he was the day previous to his coming to London - he said on that day he was at Coventry; I asked where there - he said he could not tell, he did not know the house; I asked him if he could point out the house of Lewis, in Wych-street - he said in the shop that he could point it out, and when we got to St. Clement's church, I requested Led better to stop, and let him point it out; we both asked him to point out the house - he said he could not; he said other persons were in the room at the time he received the note at Pershore; he was asked the names of the persons - he said they were all strangers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you go into Wych-street with him? A. I did, and found a person named Lewis kept the house; I asked, in his presence, if he knew him - he had not referred me there, but I understood he had desired the parcel to be sent there; I desired him when we got to St. Clement's church to point out the house - it could be seen from there; it was not thirty yards off, for it is at the end of the street, three or four houses up - I cannot say when this note was issued.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What passed between Lewis and you in the prisoner's presence? A. I asked Lewis if he knew the prisoner - he said he did not, he had never seen him before; the prisoner made no answer to that - I asked if he had breakfasted there; he said he had not - Mrs. Lewis came afterwards, and said he had been at the house that morning, but neither eat nor drank there; I delivered the note to the chief cashier, and am certain this is the same note.</p>

Make way! I looked round, and saw three respectable people, like merchants' clerks, following me, and when I got to the bottom of the steps there was a crowd of women, who would not let me pass up the stairs - an altercation took place; I felt a pressure, and an attempt to take my watch - I turned round to ask what that meant, and they were gone; I got through the crowd into the hotel, and in a few minutes missed the whole 800l.; I wrote to the Bank to have the notes stopped that night, and some time after, in consequence of a communication from the Bank, I came to town, and this case was investigated.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not identify this particular note? A. No - I placed the notes into my pocket on the 3rd; they remained there till the 5th, and were never out of my possession - I took them out of my pocket in the coach, to look at them, on the 4th, on the road from Newcastle to Leeds, and put a 30l. promissory note which I had in the same parcel; I wrapped it round the 800l.: they were just rolled together - I swear none of them fell from the bundle, it was impossible; when at Manchester I felt a catch at my watch, and I was prossed round the body - I had some sovereigns in the same breeches pocket, but had no occasion to take them out, as I had money in my other pocket, and paid my fare out of that; I am certain I took nothing from the pocket the notes were in - I slept at Leeds on the 4th, and left my notes in my pocket; I felt them there - it is impossible one could be lost.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. About what hour on the 3rd did you receive them? A. Between four and five o'clock, at Newcastle - I arrived at Manchester about twelve, on the 5th, and felt this pressure between one and two; I have no recollection of the prisoner being one who surrounded me.</p>

            . I live in Coleman-street-buildings. On the 29th of July, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I was in <placeName id="t18300916-20-crimeloc117">Bartholomew-lane</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What became of his hand, did you lose sight of that? A. I cannot say I saw his hand all the time - he was alone after I saw him; the box was small - there was a crowd about the Auctionmart door, where it occurred; if I had seized him at the moment perhaps I should have been floored, for that happened once before - he threw nothing away; I have no doubt the other man received the box - whether the prisoner had any thing in his hand when I saw it come from my pocket I cannot say: I did not follow him above twenty yards - he did not say if I went with him it should be explained, but that it should be settled; he said that three or four times.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I solemnly declare my innocence - instead of positive proof you have only the prosecutor's statement, and that consisting only of suspicion that he lost his property, but nothing whatever occurred to implicate me; I was passing through the City, and on arriving at Angel-court, was most roughly laid hold of by the prosecutor and charged with stealing a snuff-box - I offered him every satisfaction in my power, but when I was roughly treated I certainly offered resistance as any body would; he swore he saw me at the Auction-mart, and saw me take away his property, but quietly pursued me for the purpose of giving me into custody - I presume had any of you been robbed you would have seized the thief in the act; but what does his conduct argue but that he was uncertain where and when he lost his property; he has varied in his description of the box, and if mistaken in one thing he may be in another - a gentleman inquired what was the matter; he exclaimed that he had lost a gold snuff-box - at the Mansion-house he said it was silver, and worth 8l. or 10l., at the last examination he said 5l.; I have ascertained that just previous to the robbery he had a serious fit of illness, which may have impaired his mind.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you live at Leicester-square at all? A. Yes; I saw the box at your shop broken open when I went with the officer - I never went by any other name, but that has nothing to do with it; I get my living by dress-making, and had a highly respectable connection before this seizure - I never was charged with attempting to extort money from a gentleman; I never was at this bar in my life.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the Police. In the latter end of last year the prisoner was brought to our office - I went with the prosecutrix, and found the muff, which she claims; the prisoner was taken to the Magistrate, who thought there was not sufficient grounds against him; but he said she might go and get a bill, but the prisoner was out of the way till he was taken - the prisoner owned the things were left there, but said they were not paid for; he did not deny that it was her muff.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been reduced to the last stage of poverty by the prosecutrix: in 1829 I was arraigned on this same charge, for a large quantity of wearing-apparel and other things, and his Lordship directed the Jury to acquit me - the transaction on which this prosecution is founded, is as follows: - In the latter end of August, 1829, I was called on by King, who requested me to call in Leicester-street, not Leicester-square, to purchase some goods; I called there in the course of the afternoon, and it was stated that a quantity of goods had been seized under distress for rent, and they were worth more than they were distrained for - if I would purchase them, and pay so much more money, I should have them- I applied to the broker for the bill, which was given me; I requested to see the goods, but was told I could not, as they were blocked up with some other furniture - I told the prosecutrix I could not see the goods, but understanding they were worth the money, I would advance the rent, and give her as much more as I could; I then paid 3l. 3s. 3d., and took a receipt, which has been denied me, together with the inventory of the goods.</p>

            . I tendered him the 3l. 3s. 3d., and he refused it, unless I gave him the amount of the bill, which was 7l., and as I had made no agreement, I considered myself exempt from any other charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I applied to the gentleman who had moved the goods, for which 2l. 5s. 6d. was charged, which, with what I had paid before, was fully equal to the value of them, and when she called to pay the money, I presented her the bill - some demur arose; I said if she would give me that money she should have them - she said she could not at that time, but if I would keep them three or four days she would redeem them; understanding that I was to be paid for the advance of my money and trouble, I drew up an agreement to that effect on the back of the inventory, which she signed, and as she did not come for them, I made use of the goods; that muff I did send to be made into a tippet - I need not direct your attention to my having been tried before, with Mr. Scate, in August, 1829, when I was acquitted, and not satisfied with that, the prosecutrix, whose malice would drive her to any means to effect my ruin, one Sunday evening brought a Policeman just as I was going to bed, and I was taken to the watch-house; the Magistrate said there was nothing against me, and I was discharged - some time after my affairs became deranged, and I went to Liverpool; I returned to London six months ago, and had five hundred circulars issued, and all my friends knew where I lived- I went to Marlborough-street office on business repeatedly, and every one knew me about the neighbourhood; though I may be acquitted, I shall be ruined for ever.</p>

I was at No. 4, Leicester-street, when the agreement was made between the prosecutrix and the prisoner; the prosecutrix sent me to get some person to purchase the things which had been seized - the prisoner, who is a broker, came with me; the prosecutrix said the things which had been seized were in a warehouse in Bear-street, and she wished him to purchase them - the prisoner went to Hodgkiss, who had seized them; he said he had such goods, and they were worth the money.</p>

            .

               <p>COURT. Q. Had he the key of this trunk? A. It was in one of the drawers, and the next day I was sent for by Sir George Farrant - the prisoner was then there to lay a complaint against me; a pawnbroker's lad was there - the Magistrate said, "Is this the man that took the rings out of pawn?" he said Yes, and some time after I was told there was a warrant against me; I surrendered, was tried, and acquitted last September.</p>

            . I was coming down Jermyn-street - I saw King snatch the reticule from the prosecutrix; there were two persons with him - one was a tall man; as soon as he snatched it I ran down to the place, and for a second or two I lost sight of him; he went behind a coach, and the officer caught him - I got up and assisted; Ellis said he knew the other by the name of Dick, the tailor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. You were with Ellis? A.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Were there three persons together? A. Yes - I am a constable of St. Ann, Westminster; I did not see it taken - it was dark; King ran between the coaches, and was putting this under his coat - I met him on the pavement; he was then walking - he had the reticule when I took hold of his collar; he threw it down - I took it up, and kept it till I got assistance; I took it to the watch-house, where the lady claimed it - it has been in my possession ever since; I took Price in Bartholomew-fair - I knew him before.</p>

            . On the 12th of August I lost a ball of twist from a drawer - when I took the drawer down it was at the top of the drawer, and no one was there but the prisoner; he came to get some twist to match a bit of cloth - he had matched his cloth, and I was cutting off the twist he wanted, when he ran out of the shop; I pursued him, and he was taken before I lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is the man who stopped him here? A. No; the prisoner did turn a corner- I might lose sight of him; I was but three or four yards from him - I ran pretty fast - I was on the opposite side of the way; I could see round the corner; the ball of twist was given up to me - he begged me to let him go, as he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160029"/>was a poor fellow; I put the ball into a drawer, with forty or fifty others - it was black, and there was no other black ball in the drawer but that.</p>

            . On the 12th of August I was coming home, and heard there was a thief in Broad-street; I took off my cocked hat, and went up - there were forty or fifty people; they pointed to a public house, in which the prisoner was - a woman said, "Don't take him, poor fellow;" I gave him 2d. to get a pint of beer - he begged me to let him go; I found 1 1/2d. on him, this skeleton-key, this bit of cloth, and the twist which I gave the prosecutrix.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went for a yard of twist - I felt for an article I had purchased before - I missed it, and said I would go and look for that; when I got near the corner of the street I heard some one cry "Stop him!" - I went on, and turned another corner; I saw several persons run- I got near two hundred yards down the turning, when a man stopped me; the prosecutrix came in about a minute and a half - I said I had no twist; a number of persons collected, and some one said, "Here is a ball of twist, is this your's?" - she took it; I went on to have a pint of of porter - a man came and took me; some person said,"Let the man go, it is not worth 1 1/2d."</p>

I sell needles, and employ the prosecutor to make needles for me; I expected a parcel from him about the 1st or 2nd of June - it did not come; it should have contained about 2800 needles - I had ordered them about a month before; on the 12th of July one Levy called at my shop with a sample of needles - he went out, and brought the prisoner with the parcel; I said I had heard that the coach-office had been robbed and my parcel was missing, and I detained them both; Levy offered them at 1s. 9d. per hundred in the prisoner's presence, that is about a fair price; the prisoner said he had received them of a hackney-coachman at the west end of the town - I gave them in charge on suspicion of their being my needles - there are 2800 of them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How did the prisoner go with you? A. He was handcuffed; he asked me not to handcuff him, as no man would acknowledge that he had bought any thing of him, but I did not consider it was safe to take him without; I told the Magistrate I found 12l. 10s. on the coachman - I believe that was on the second examination - it was not till I had been cross-examined by the solicitor; the coachman was not then present.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Is it possible I could have them under my waistcoat? A. Yes, I saw you do it.</p>

The boy came after me, and said I must go back - the witness was standing at the bottom of the stairs; he went to put on his clothes, and these things were in the parlour - the landlord came down, and said this blanket was worth 10s., and the sheet was fellow to one I had stolen before.</p>

            . I did not - I was out at my daughter's; she came and demanded the key of my street door, and took the plated one and this silver one; I never allowed her to take my spoons - I never received any thing from her; her husband paid the rent.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I admit pledging the spoon for 5s., but I did it with the consent of the prosecutrix, who gave me two spoons to pledge - one was silver. which I pledged for 5s., the other one being only metal the pawnbroker would not take it in; I, therefore, returned it to the prosecutrix, and also gave her 2s. 6d. of the money I procured for the silver one, in part of payment, and I was to redeem the spoon the first opportunity. I conceive it to be nothing but a vindictiveness on her part towards me, because she is aware that I am fully acquainted with her character. She admitted, before the Magistrate, that she broke my box open, and stole therefrom a cap, a steel buckle, and a coral necklace.</p>
               <p>MARY CULF re-examined. Q. Did you ever receive 2s. 6d., or the duplicate, from her? A. I never did - the two spoons laid in the cupboard together, and she took them both; there were no other spoons there, only some linen; this is all the silver I have - the Policeman unlocked the door with a key the prisoner had in her pocket; she got drunk five times the first week - she beat me, and broke all my things.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Where did you get the metal spoon? A. After she had pawned the other, she took that up stairs, and put it behind a tea-board.</p>

About eleven o'clock; I came into your company at the White Horse, to the best of my knowledge; I do not recollect seeing you before, and telling you I was a Hertfordshire-man - I did not go drinking in the evening; I cannot tell why the Magistrate would not take my evidence at seven o'clock at night - if I had been examined I should have known what to say; he did not turn me out in consequence of my being in liquor.</p>

On the 5th of August I was serjeant of the barrack-guard; between twelve and one o'clock the prisoner came in - I suspected he had been drinking; I took him into the guard-room and faced him - I found he was not drunk, but I told him he must<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160037"/>stop in the whole of the day; he stopped about a quarter of an hour, and then said he wanted to go out very particularly - he put on a clean shirt and pair of shoes, but I refused to let him out; the prosecutor and the Policeman then came; the prosecutor said a soldier had a 5l. note, and he wanted it - I searched him, and found four sovereigns in his boots.</p>

            . I am Woodley's grandson. On the 10th of July I saw all the prisoners at the house, and old Beason also - they slept there that night, and next morning (Sunday), about eleven o'clock, I found the box, but about six that morning I heard the two Beasons call Puddifoot - I got up, and went down; Puddifoot was then lying on the bed with his clothes on; on the next bed to that I and my grandfather slept on, and in the same room - I do not know whether he had undressed at night; I went down stairs - Thomas Beason, who was coming along the passage, called to me, and said, "Come along old mates, we have got the back cellar door open;" I saw Samuel Beason coming out of the cellar with some scy the handles, which had been left there; the cellar door is inside the house - they called again for Puddifoot, and when he came down, they went away together up the road with the scythes and handles; the window of Beason's room looks on the orchard, and is large enough for the box to be put through - the street door was open when I came down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When you went down, the street-door was open? A. Yes; that leads to the road, not to the orchard - the room my grandfather slept in has a door into Beason's room - we go through that room to get to ours; I had not seen the box since the 26th of June; they did not know I was getting up till I came down - they were in my view till they went out, which was in less than a quarter of an hour; they had not got the box - the orchard is at the back of the house; old Beason was left behind - the window is on the first floor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You did not go into the room where the box was after the men had gone? A. No; I went to breakfast - I did not see either of them return to the house; they told me they lived at Bovington.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was it standing on its side, or how? A. On its bottom; the hole was not in it then, for I lifted it up to dust it, and the papers would have fallen out if there had been a hole in it - I lifted it up at one end to wipe the side; I did not tell the Magistrate so because I was not asked - I was not up when they went away; old Beason was at our house the whole day; I do not know where he is now - he was taken up; the box might be got down from the window without my hearing it, while we were busy in the evening.</p>

On the 28th of July, between three and four o'clock in the the afternoon, I saw the prisoner in the shop - he asked to see some stockings; I was alone - I showed him three or four parcels; he did not fix on any, and while I turned to reach down some others, I heard the glass-case of the window slide - I turned round, and saw it open; he was close to it, with a piece of handkerchiefs in his hand - he had not asked for handkerchiefs; I put down the parcels, and went round the counter - he ran out with the handkerchiefs; I raised an alarm at the door - I saw him drop them about two yards from the door; he got out of my sight, and was taken in about five minutes - he was a stranger; when brought back he said he did not take them, but afterwards did not deny it; they were delivered to Grant - I am certain they are the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. At first he said he was not the person, but said nothing afterwards? A. Not as to the charge, but he begged, entreated, cried, and said, if I would let him go, he would never do the like again - I was rather flurried, but had complete possession of my mind; I was more collected than I am now.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going through Fox-court, and met the prosecutor very much intoxicated - he reeled against me, and asked me to take him home; I went on talking with him - he said he was very tipsy; that he had been with a lady, and spent all his money except a 5l. note - as we came along he met a girl who had been with him; she called him by name - he stood talking to her, and told her to come next night at eleven o'clock, and bring another young woman with her; I was going to wish him good night - he buttoned up his coat, and said he had lost his watch; I knew nothing of it - it was not on Snow-hill, but Fox and Knot-court; a boy saw me standing talking to him - the watchman was to have brought him.</p>
               <p>MR. RICARDS. It happened at the corner of the court; I did not go into the court till she ran up it - I did not say I had been with another woman, or any thing of the sort; I did not speak two words to her - there is no truth in her statement.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How long before did you know you had the watch in your possession? A. I had it at the Gloucester coffee-house, Oxford-street - I stopped no where after that, and firmly believe I spoke to nobody; I swear I saw my watch drawn out of my pocket plainly.</p>

On the 18th of August I left the warehouse, a few minutes before seven o'clock, leaving nobody there - I saw the warehouse secured, and Mr. Frost's son took the keys home; it could not be opened except by force - I returned a few minutes after nine o'clock in the morning; Mr. Frost's son had opened the warehouse before that - I had left locked in my desk a snuff-box, five half-crowns, and a sixpence; also a black coat hanging on the rail; I found the desk forced open - my coat was also gone; I saw the coat and snuff-box at the Mansion-house that day, when Flinn was in custody - he had my coat on when taken; the five half-crowns and sixpence were produced - I had no mark on them; I found the warehouse in great confusion, every thing thrown in a heap into the middle - I missed an end of cloth, which I saw at the Mansion-house that day; I am certain it was safe in the warehouse overnight - a pane of glass, thirteen inches square, had been cut entirely out of the warehouse window; several ends of cloth were piled near the window - the cloth appeared to have been drawn through the pane; it was worth about 15l. - I did not notice the window overnight; a person could get through the pane into the warehouse - Lanagan was in the employ of a person who had an office on out premises; Mr. Frost lost a pair of boots, which I saw at the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Did you say Flinn had the coat on? A. I did not see him in it; the opening in the window was quite large enough for Flinn to have got through.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long before had you noticed the window? A. I cannot say - it might have been broken two or three days for what I know.</p>

             - he has no partner. On the 18th I was at the warehouse till Strachan left - it was quite safe, and the window was secure I am certain, for I always look at it; I returned at nine o'clock in the morning, before Strachan; I was the first person there - I unlocked the door with the greatest difficulty, for the cloths were so piled against it; they were in their proper places overnight - I missed one end; Strachan's desk was forced open, and his coat gone - Lanagan was in the habit of passing the door, but I never saw him in the warehouse; a cupboard was broken open, and two bottles of wine drank on the premises - several things were left behind.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Basinghall-street. On the 19th of August, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I saw Flinn coming down Basinghall-street from Cateaton-street, with a roll of cloth on his shoulder; I made up to him, and asked where he was going - he said to Goswell-street, but he did not know where there; I asked if he had an invoice of the cloth - he said, "What is that to you? what have you to do with it?" I took him to the Compter, searched him, and found a snuff-box, five half-crowns, and a sixpence on him, and some steel buttons; he had a dark coat on, and boots - I took the coat off at the Mansion-house, and Strachan claimed it; the boots were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160040"/>brought to me from the Compter, and claimed by Mr. Frost - Strachan claimed the money and cloth as his master's; Flinn gave no account how he came by them.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Coleman-street: Mr. Frost's premises are on my beat. On the 19th of August, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I was walking through Coleman-street, and saw a person in the passage which leads to Mr. Frost's warehouse - I believe it to be Flinn; he had three parcels on his shoulder - it appeared to be cloth; I did not stop him, as I saw Lanagan standing at the door of the warehouse at the same time, and believing him to belong to the premises, I had no suspicion; the door was open - I am certain of Lanagan's person; I took him into custody on the morning of the 20th, and asked if he was at Flinn's house the night before, or on the morning of the robbery - he said No; I asked if he was not in the court at all - he said he was not: Flinn lived in Blue Heart-court, Little Bell-alley - I took him to Flinn's house, and saw Flinn's sister; I said in his hearing,"Did any body call on your brother the evening before the robbery?" she said Yes; I said, "Is this the lad that called?" she said Yes; I asked if he had called on the morning of the 19th - she said he had; Flinn was not present.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you specify what day of the week you meant? A. I asked if he knew Flinn; he said he did not - that he had not been to his house the night before the robbery, nor in Blue Heart-court; I did not mention on what night the robbery was committed, but he was aware of it - I believe I have seen him before about the premises, but will not positively swear it; I think I have seen him a great many times going to and fro - his features are well known to me somewhere; I pass the place twelve or fourteen times a-day - I have been on duty in that street three or four months; I think I have seen him at evening and morning - I cannot say how often or how long before this; I never spoke to him - he had on a blue coat, and, I think, a light handkerchief; he had nothing with him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you quite certain he is the person you saw between seven and eight o'clock at the door of Frost's warehouse, which was open? A. The entrance door was open, and he stood at it.</p>

            . This is my coat; I had had it about a month - this snuff-box I am certain of, it is tortoiseshell; my cousin's initials are on it - he had left it in my care; five half-crowns and 6d. were produced at the Mansion-house - they were the exact coins I lost; this cloth is Mr. Frost's, and is worth about 15l. - I am certain it was in the warehouse over night when I left; Mr. Frost's name is on the boots - a strange pair of boots, and a strange old coat were left behind in the warehouse; they were not so good as those taken away - two broken chisels and two old keys were left in the warehouse; the flap of my desk was forced from the lock - the chisels appeared to have been used to force the cupboard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. By what mark do you know the cloth? A. By the number, 15,025, and mark; I saw the boots there in the course of the 18th - I know the coat by a rent in the button, which I made in sitting down; Lanagan worked for Mr. Taylor, the City printer, who has premises over ours.</p>

               <p>Flinn's Defence. I am employed by my father to deliver newspapers to the morning coaches, to go into the country - I went on the morning of this unfortunate affair, and when the newspapers are got rid of, the coachmen expect the venders to treat them with drink, which I did, and drank rather too freely; at the corner of Coleman-street I met a young man, previously known to me - he said, "I have got a roll of cloth - can you take it as far as Goswell-street for me?" I said I could - he took me up a gateway: he had the cloth, the boots, and coat, and three small bundles of paper - he said, "If you will take this cloth I will meet you in Old-street;" I said I could not, as I was obliged to go out, and had got a bad pair of boots on, as such I could not go - he said, "Well, here is a pair of boots, you can put them on, and you can put the coat on - and here is a snuff-box which I will give you to take the cloth;" I went on, staggered about, being rather in liquor, and the patrol stopped me - I answered him rather sharply, and told him I had brought it from Coleman-street; he said, "From any warehouse?" I said No, and wished him to come back, thinking the person would not be gone.</p>

On the 5th of July last I was in Manchester, between one and two o'clock in the afternoon; the street was crowded - I went through the crowd on my way to the Albion hotel; I heard several persons cry "Make way! make way!" I looked round, and saw three gentlemen following me, whom I took for clerks in some warehouse; in attempting to go up the steps of the hotel, there was a large assembly, chiefly women, who opposed my passage, and after some confusion I felt a pressure on my body, and an attempt to take my watch, but it was not taken - I got into the hotel, and found, after some time, on putting my hand into my pocket, that my notes were gone- I had had 800l. in Bank notes in my pocket, and a 30l. promissory note; the largest was a 500l. Bank note - I had felt the notes safe when I got to Manchester, about twelve o'clock in the day; I had received the 500l. note in my own parlour at Newcastle, from Mr. Young, on the 3rd of July - I afterwards saw the two prisoners and another person named Weston before the Magistrate, in London.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You thought a snatch had been made at your watch? A. Yes - the persons were about me, but at my watch particularly; I was congratulating myself that they had not taken it; I never suspected I had lost any thing else - I had had the notes two days in my possession; they were wrapped up, and were in my left-hand breeches pocket, not in any case - I had thirty or forty sovereigns in the same pocket, and they were not taken; I slept at home on the first night after I received the notes, and on going to bed I left them in my trousers, which laid in my bed-room, with all the money in them - I examined them the next morning, in the coach, as I was going to Leeds; they were all right then, and I put the 30l. note with them - I counted them, and noticed the sum; I think you did not ask me last night whether I had counted or examined the notes. - (see page 678.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell me that you did not count or examine them, but put the note or bill round them? A. I do not recollect hearing the question or giving the answer - I believe I said I did not take the notes from my pocket, from the 3rd to the 5th, when you first asked me the question, but on the second answer I said I did take them out; I considered the question to mean whether the notes were out of my possession - I did look at the notes and examine them; there was no person that morning in the coach but myself, so that they could not have been taken from my pocket in the coach - I do not recollect seeing them when I got out of the coach, but I felt them in my pocket.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you sleep at Leeds? A. Yes - no one slept in the same room; I found the notes were there in the morning, and at Manchester I felt them in my pocket, but did not take them out.</p>

            . I keep the Two Bells, in Whitechapel-road. A man named Schooling came to my house on the 17th of July, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon - in consequence of what he said I afterwards saw Weston, and between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I saw the two prisoners, and Weston with them, in a room up stairs in my house; a 500l. note was offered to me in the prisoners' presence - I saw something in Weston's hand; I went down and fetched a bottle of wine, and when I came up again the note laid on the table for me to look at; I do not know who laid it there - I said it did not look very nice, it being in two halves; Weston said, "If you will call for some paper and paste I will paste it togethere" - I said it did not signify; I put on my spectacles, looked at it, and put the two halves together in my left hand - I then rang the bell and called my wife to come in; I told her I wanted the cash-box - she brought it me; the men asked what notes I had got, and said they hoped I had not any big notes - I said I had four 20l. notes, about one hundred and forty sovereigns, and some 5l. notes, and they must take 10l. in silver or give me credit; I was to pay 350l. for the note - I had some officers in a back room, who then came in; the prisoners all rose up and were alarmed - I cried out, "Mistress, take the cash-box down stairs," and I cried out, "Come up all of you, I have got thirty men below;" the officers then handcuffed the men, and told me to put a signature on the note, which was then in my left hand - I laid it on the table; the officer called for a pen and ink - the prisoners then made a scramble at the note, and got the half of it, and I got the other; Smith said, "D-n my eyes, no man shall put a signature on that note" - they were at that time handcuffed; I do not recollect that I said any thing to them, but I looked at them, and they were all gulping together - Schooling and some others came into the room, but they did not say any thing; the prisoners were then taken away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. And you would give us to understand that a note of this kind was brought to you for improper purposes? A. Yes - the officers were not in the room when the note was given to me, but they were behind; Weston came first, between five and six o'clock, but I did not see the prisoners till between eight and nine - Weston went out and brought them in; I do not know whether he saw them go by or not - what passed about selling the note was in the absence of the prisoners;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160042"/>I was to give 350l. for it - I did not then know that there 100l. reward offered for it, but I know it now.</p>
               <p>was Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you at any time see any note in the possession of Price? A. No; I have stated all the circumstances - I told the officers there was something trying on to pass a bad note, or a forged note.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you known a word about this hand-bill at that time? A. No - the prisoners were there when I was asked not to give large notes in exchange, and when I enumerated the notes, silver and gold - I did not know whether the note was stolen or forged, or why it was offered to me; I told the officer - Norris and Shields were sent for afterwards.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. At the time the three men were with you was the name of Schooling mentioned? A. No - he first came and said he knew a man who had a note to sell, and then the other came.</p>
               <p>Smith. Q. Did not you say at Lambeth-street that it was Smith snatched the note and ate it? A. I said I thought so, but I would not swear it - I did go and touch you.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were the whole three affecting to swallow at the same time? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. Broadbelt made a communication to me on Saturday, the 17th of July, and I went to his house about eight o'clock in the evening; I was put into a room on the first floor - I had made an agreement to go into the other room when he called for his spectacles; Stocker, who is not an officer, was with me - when we went into the front room I found Smith, Weston, Price, and the landlord; the prisoners were sitting in chairs round the table - there was a bottle of wine and some glasses on the table; Broadbelt said, "I have the note, and Weston is the person who gave it me" - I said, "What note?" and he said, "A 500l. note;" I sent my companion for an officer - Shields came to me: we handcuffed the prisoners together - Schooling and some other persons came up; I put the prisoners up in a corner of the room, and told Broadbelt to put his initials on the note that I might see what it was - he sat down at the table and pulled out a note from his pocket, first one half and then the other; he put them on the table, and there was a sudden rush made on me by the prisoners - they all appeared to rush on me, and before I could recover myself they were all at a distance from me; I looked at their mouths, and they all appeared to be gulping - I will swear the two prisoners appeared so; one half of the note was missing from the table - it could never be found.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Then you never saw it at all? A. No; they appeared to me to be halfnotes - I had not time to look at them; I have smacked my lips after a glass of wine.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did they appear as if swallowing? A. Yes; they had drank some wine before I got there - I did not hear any thing said about the signature on the note.</p>

I went to the house on the 17th of July, and up to the first floor; the two prisoners, and several persons were there - Price and another were tied together with a handkerchief; smith and Schooling were handcuffed; I saw two pieces of paper put on the table, but I had not time to look at them - I saw the one that was left; it was half of a 500l. note - when the papers were put on the table, the four men were placed at the further end of the room; Smith and Schooling complained that their handcuffs were too tight - I examined them, and found they were; I took out the key to loosen them, and they made a rush - I saw three of them scrambling over the table; their hands were off the table, and up to their mouths - they appeared to be chewing something; they afterwards complained of being thirsty, and a pot of half-and-half was given them; Norris took a letter from Price.</p>
               <p>Smith. Q. Did you say that I, this man, and another, were reaching over the table? was I not handcuffed at the time to Schooling? A. I did not see him, but I saw you.</p>

I went to Bartholomew-fair, and from there to the Waterloo Arms; I drank freely - I called at a booking-office in Oxford-street, and drank with a friend; as I came out I stood looking at a scuffle, and a very respectable young man said to me, "This is something like Bartholomew-fair" - I got into conversation, and asked if he knew of any situation; he said, "I am going to No. 3, Cumberland-place to night, the servants will have a few friends, the butler is a good sort of a man, he will, perhaps, do something for you" - we went on to the corner of Cumberland-place, and the witness was going with some beer to the door; he said, "We wont go in without something, go and order some spirits" - I gave the order, and when it came, he said, "If you will go up, here is the sovereign;" and he put that piece into my hand - I gave it to the witness, and, I believe, I put the change in my hand; several people came up, and there was a cry of Stop thief! one of the bottles dropped from me.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I met him at a wine-merchant's. Witness. No, I met him in the street, and went into three public houses; there was a young woman who went off with another man - I did not tell him to take my watch to Mr. Martin, and get a few shillings for drink; I did not say if he had redeemed it like a man on the Tuesday night this would not have happened.</p>

            . On Sunday morning, the 8th of August, the prisoner and three or four more came to my house in Berwick-street; I had known him before - they called for two pots of half-and-half; I took them in, and they called for two more - I carried them in, and said I should like my reckoning settled; they looked at one another, and the prisoner said, "You need not make much noise about it, I will leave my watch with you, for my master did not pay me on Saturday night - you must let me have 10s. more on it, and take the 2s. for your reckoning" - I heard of the prosecutor's loss on the Monday morning; I sent for him, and he described the watch, and offered to pay 6s. if I would lose the other 6s.; I said I would not - he then went to Marlborough-street - he stated that he did not know whether he had given the prisoner the watch, or whether he had stolen it.</p>

No; I saw Baker and Langdale - they did not turn the corner with Mendos; I had seen Baker pass that turning, whether Langdale had or not I do not know - I should think Sexton lives a mile and a half or two miles from where I took Mendos.</p>
               <p>Langdale' Defence. I went with Baker, but did not know he had any thing; I missed Baker, but saw him again at the other end of the church-yard - I then went and asked Mendos the way to Shoreditch church.</p>
               <p>Baker's Defence. I went and bought a handkerchief; how Mendos came in possession of these I cannot say - I never saw him before.</p>

The prisoner came there on the 20th of July, between four and five o'clock - he said he wanted some needles; I said we had none, but could get them from Birmingham for him - he then asked to look at some pistols; he remained some time, and looked out several parcels of goods - I was making a memorandum of the goods he had looked out, and while doing that I saw him put something into his pocket - Mr. Johnson then came in; the prisoner asked for some other articles - I went to get them, went to Mr. Johnson's desk, and wrote on a bit of paper that I suspected the prisoner had got something in his pocket - he then looked at some things, and said he would call in half an hour and pay for them, and we were to make out the account in the mean time - he walked out, Mr. Johnson followed him into the street; he returned, and said if I was not long in making the account he would stop and take them - I made out the account; he looked at it, handed it to Mr. Johnson, and said he had not the money, but he knew what Mr. Johnson wanted, he wanted a deposit, and he would leave it - Mr. Johnson said, "No, you have been robbing me;" the prisoner had been taking the parcels out of his pocket while I made the account.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What did I say? A. You said you wanted some needles - I do not recollect your saying if I would show you some samples, you would go to another place; this parcel of tweezers is not part of what you looked out - what you looked at laid on the counter.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see him take any of the parcels from his pocket? A. I saw one parcel, and Mr. Johnson put them aside.</p>

            . This is my property. I saw the prisoner in the warehouse, and the witness serving him - he wrote on a piece of paper, and I watched the prisoner very closely, expecting he would take more goods, and I intended, while he was doing so, to charge him with it - I afterwards saw him take from his pocket a parcel of plated spoons, one of tweezers, and some cutting nippers; he had in the meantime walked to the door as if intending to quit the warehouse - he had not said any thing to me before that about these parcels; he was quite a stranger.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were there not more spoons than these? A. No, not where you were putting these down - the rest were all open; it was from ten minutes to a quarter of an hour after you returned back that you put them down, and you staid about ten minutes longer - you had looked out the greater part of the things before I came into the warehouse - I refused to show you any goods.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he dealt there before? A. I did not know him, he might have been there.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any lodgers? A. No: I have apprentices who were in bed and asleep; we have a woman who comes to assist us; I have three floors in my house - I have two little sons, but I do not know whether they were at home at the time; they are sometimes at their aunt's, and sometimes at school - one of them was at home that night, if not both - I sleep with them; I was sober - I am positive one of them slept with me that night; it being three weeks or a month ago, I do not recollect; one of them was at home, because I told him I had lost my money - I have two apprentices, who are sixteen or seventeen years of age - the prisoner drank something in my house; but I did not; she had a little gin out of a decanter; I had not known her before - I was neither drunk nor sober; I had taken no liquor but brandy that night, and very likely half a pint of porter at dinner - a person might have called and taken a little gin or a little wine, and I might have some with them - I was in no house drinking, except my own - I dined at home; I had drank the brandy and water from a quarter before ten till a little after twelve o'clock, at the King's Arms, Holborn-bridge - I paid three sixpences for it, and I went home from there, and was at no other house - I had been at home before I went to the tavern, I was not so tipsy that I did not know whether I gave this to the prisoner or not; I have heard she was taken the next morning and discharged - she was at liberty for a week, she went to demand 17l. which she had in her pocket, and was taken again; I told the inspector of my loss that night, but told him not to take any notice of it, as I had had a female in my house, which I know is not a proper thing; I told him to see if he could find her, and get my money.</p>

               <p>While smarting under this mortifying condition last summer, I composed a work allied to the honour and interest of H. R. H., the Duke of Cumberland, and I refused from the booksellers one hundred guineas for the work. I confided the work to the hands of H. R. H., on the strict condition that he should return it to me, or explain to me the motives of its detention. H. R. H., has detained it in his possession ever since last summer, and has resolutely refused to give me any explanation whatever on the subject. I have wrote to every person attached to the honour and interest of H. R. H.; many remain silent, while others assert that they have been enjoined by H. R. H. by no means to enter into any explanation with me about the work in question. I begged of Mr. Conant, the Magistrate, to apply to H. R. H.; his interposition is interdicted. I caused Messrs. Mounsey and Grey, the Solicitors, to institute legal proceedings against H. R. H.; for the recovery of my work; they wrote to the private secretary of H. R. H.; he made no reply, and they refused to proceed further without I advanced the cost of proceeding by action of trover. I have not, Sir, wherewith to meet the exigencies of the day, much less to go to law with a Prince of the Blood Royal? What am I to do? Am I submissively to lose the subject and fruit of my labour, or am I to recover them, and to repel cruelty and contumely by such means as Fenton and Bellingham were driven to employ? I am doomed, and determined to recover them, or to perish in the attempt, and I now swear by the faith and honour of a man, and by that God who witnesses my distress, arising out of the Duke of Cumberland's conduct towards me, that if H. R. H. persists in detaining my property without explanation, that I will proceed up to London, and make the matter a personal question between us. This must make the question a question of Police, one that must fall within your jurisdiction, but as "prevention of crime" is said to be a marked feature of the New Police, I would implore you, Sir, to communicate with H. R. H., and to see that I recover my property from him without having recourse to measures that appal and horrify the mind. Bellingham wrote a letter of this nature to the late Sir

H. but my work; my property which he detains in his hands, and in proof that I wish to recover my work through legal agency, I invoke your interposition; If you refuse me that interposition, and regard this letter as an idle menace, you will act after the manner of Sir N. Conant, and invite the commission, in place of preventing crime.* I have the honour to be. Sir, your obedient Servant,

            . I am an officer of the Police. On the 17th of July I was stationed at Kensington, and at seven o'clock that morning I saw the prisoner come out of a house, No. 17, King-street, Kensington-square; I followed him to Kew-green, and there saw him accost a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160052"/>man who had the appearance of a servant, dressed in morning, with a white apron on; this was about two hundred yards from the Duke of Cumberland's gate, the servant went in a direction for the Duke's gate; I did not see him enter, as a carriage drove up and hid him from view - I saw the prisoner looking very earnestly into that carriage - I afterwards saw the servant come back, and speak to him; the prisoner walked backwards and forwards in front of the Duke's house for an hour and a half, and then walked away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Who instructed you to follow my steps? A. My superintendent (Mr. Williams) directed me closely to observe you, and follow you wherever you went; he did not tell me for what purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you informed my object was assassination? A. Not directly; I had no directions whatever in that respect - I had no instructions to hinder you from committing mischief.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you have prevented me from murdering the person I addressed that day, or any other person? A. Most certainly I would - it did not appear to me that you and the person you spoke to were strangers to each other by any means; I did not see him smile at you; but from the affability of manners, I thought the prisoner and him were acquainted; there was a report of a marriage taking place that morning; I observed a few people going in a direction for the chapel, but not many; there was no public assemblage - I did not know that the Rev. Mr. Jelf, the tutor to Prince George, was going to be married that morning to a lady in waiting.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You did not know that any body belonging to His Royal Highness' household was to be married that day? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were there not several carriages rolling by the residence of the illustrious personage in question? A. I observed two, one stopped at His Royal Highness' gate; two or three people got out and entered His Royal Highness' residence; two of them were ladies; I cannot swear whether there was a third person or not; I do not know whether you were reading the motto on the carriage, nor whether the motto was"Felix in Felix" - I cannot tell whether you were armed; I saw no arms - he kept his right hand in his coat pocket; the pocket was in the pleat - I could not judge whether any arms were there, as it was a large surtout coat; I saw nobody but the servant hold any conversation with you - I had no instructions to prevent you assassinating any person, but on my own responsibility I would have done it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was Saturday, the 17th, the first day you called at my lodging? A. No; I believe I first called on Thursday, the 15th, or on Friday, it mght have been Wednesday - I will not be positive whether it was Wednesday or Thursday; I spoke to the landlady of the house- I was in private clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the object of your visit to debauch her mind, or set her as a spy on my actions? A. No; I did not tell her I was an officer, or desire her to conceal from you that I had called; I know I could have apprehended you before I did; I took you exactly at a quarter before ten o'clock in the evening - I believe you were either in bed or getting in; the door was locked or bolted - you had come home about ten minutes before I arrived; I had no opportunity of taking you earlier on that night: you stated you had taken physic, but did not appear unwell; you said you were the writer of that letter: there were no arms in your room; there was nothing suspicious in your appearance or demeanor.</p>

I do not know - the broker refused to take it; Wilson then looked at henson, told him to go up stairs, and he would find two half-sovereigns under a pot - he went and brought down a purse, (not mine) and was going to take the money out; I did not see the money, for I entreated the brokers not to take it, as it was my money, and I had been robbed of it - the broker did not take it; King went out with him to give the money - I asked the broker if he was an officer to protect me; he said he was not, and went out, promising to send me an officer - I went to Gibbons' house, right opposite, to wash myself: my face was at this time bleeding profusely, and my ear, my neck, and back were bleeding - while I was washing King came to the window, and when she saw the door open she came in, and said, "Now, Miss Elliss, do you say I gave you that black eye?" I said," You and the rest of them" - my eye and ear were bleeding then; she then came in and struck me in the mouth, and my mouth burst out bleeding - Mrs. Gibbons and every body saw her do that; three officers came, and I was taken in a coach to the station.</p>

                  </persName>
             Ellis is your real name? A. That is my real name - I never went by any other names in my life; I never went by the name of Rebecca French - I was never called or known by that name, or any other than I have given; I am a housekeeper, and am partly under the protection of a gentleman who was in Switzerland at the time - he wrote to me from there on the 21st of June; he left town sixteen or eighteen days before this - I occasionally see other gentlemen; I had never been to this house before - I went there to see Wilson, having heard she was ill, and I had previously known her- I did not find it to be a "company house;" I was on good terms with Wilson - I left home about a quarter or half-past ten o'clock; I called on Mr. Buchanan, my doctor, and on Mrs. Buckmaster, a dress-maker, to know where Wilson lived; I called no where else, and drank nothing before I got to Wilson's - I usually drink wine, but sometimes take none all day; Wilson asked if I would take any thing - I said I did not care, and asked what she would have - she said gin, and gin was sent for; I took part of a glass - three quarterns were sent for while I was there; a dirty little girl was sent for it.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you swear eleven quarterns were not sent for before you went into the yard? A. I swear it was not so, and that I was sober - I felt a sensation after taking the coffee which I never felt before - it was not through the gin; two hours nearly elapsed between my taking the coffee and the gin - I did not go to sleep on the sofa; I felt faint after taking the coffee, for eight or ten minutes; they were all in the room then - I had seen Murray several times before; she is a woman of the town.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you join the party she was in? A. The truth is, I was ashamed she should see me there, and turned my head when she entered, and she wished to avoid me - we were obliged to recognize each other; before I sat on the sofa, some triffling dispute arose about the French polish on my table - Wilson was speaking of her table being polished; I told her I had spoiled mine with French polish, and should not have been out, but I was going to my cabinet-maker's to send to do it again; we had a little dispute about it, but not a quarrel - I was not sick at all there; I went into the yard, complaining of faintness - when I left home I had four half-sovereigns, two sovereigns, and 5s. 6d.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160054"/>which my servant put into my purse; I paid 6d. for an omnibus to Mr. Buchanan's, in Finsbury-terrace, and 5s. I paid away - I swear I was perfectly sober - the chains and eye-glass were taken from me after I was struck; when I entered the house again, Murray told me King had taken a pair of ear-rings and handed them to somebody - they hung in my ears in two holes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned to the room, and charged the persons with stealing your money, did they not one and all become indignant at it? A. Only Wilson - King said nothing till she offered to be searched, but she had been out of the room several hours; we all nearly stripped - they did not say any of the money had fallen from me when on the sofa - it might have gone down some cracks; the carpet was taken up after the table was thrown over, but no money found; I took up one sovereign before the carpet was taken up - it was not taken up till after I returned to the room; it was kicked along the edges, but not taken up and folded - I observed no hole in the yard; when I returned to the room I found a pipe with a piece broken off it; I did not fight with King - I defended myself as well as I could; she was dreadfully abusive, but I could not contend with her - my ear-rings were not torn out in the scuffle; I was upon my feet when they were torn from me - they were then trying to eject me from the house; the officer has my ear-rings and chains - I still miss a brooch; a comb which was in my hair has been found since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not state at the Police-office, that you believed they did not intend to rob you? A. I said I was extremely ill-used - I was cross-examined, and Mr. Platt all but urged it on me; he told me to remember the prisoners, and said, "Don't you think it possible they tore the things from you with a view to disfigure you and injure you?" and at last I said (by his persuasion) possibly it might be so, but that was not the statement I gave before Mr. Broughton - I said I thought it very impossible, and next to impossible that my purse could have fallen out of my bosom; I had a high neck dress on, fastened behind - I put my purse inside.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you at any time tell

                  </persName>
            , that you did not believe Henson had robbed you? A. Never - she is my washerwoman; I never told her so - she begged me to be merciful to Henson, and to spare him, but she wished the women might be punished; I said I would not more than I could help, but I must speak the truth, and I believed it was him received the money from King - I never asked Murray if Henson had any property, or that I had inquired and found he had- I never inquired about it; I do not know Howarth - I was fainting in the street, and had a glass of water, but from whom I do not know - I was never in Howarth's house; I swear I was sober - the child only fetched three half-quarterns of liquor while I was in the house.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How often do you think King left the room before she offered to be searched? A. I think three times, but will swear to two - I did not find either of my half-sovereigns; I only went there to see Wilson - she had previously told me how very badly she was off, and had neither money nor clothes; when I got there she told me she was ill, she had not been out for a week, and had no clothes to come out in; I went to relieve her - my ears are now so sore, the rings are fastened to them with loops.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said at the examination you did not think the chains and ear-rings were taken to rob, but to injure you? A. Yes - I am perfectly satisfied if they could have taken them they would.</p>

On the 7th of August I was at Wilson's house in Francis-street; I found the prosecutrix, Henson, and Wilson there when I entered - King came in in about a quarter of an hour: Elliss was sitting down in a chair when I went in; after having some gin she took some coffee, and sat on the sofa - King sat on the foot of the sofa: about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after taking the coffee she said she felt rather faint; (she was not sick) - Wilson and I accompanied her into the yard; a pipe of tobacco was thrown down, and Wilson said, "You have dropped your purse, mind your purse, for there are holes in the yard;" she missed her purse - we returned to the room, and she found her purse on the sofa, opened it, and accused them of robbing her of three half-sovereigns; she took off the best part of her things, because they supposed she had the money about her - no half-sovereigns were found: she then opened her purse, and put out two sovereigns and some silver on the table - the table was upset; I do not know how - Elliss did not do it; the three prisoners were in the room - Elliss picked up a sovereign, and some silver was found; Elliss said one of the sovereigns she had put on the table was gone - King said, "You may think yourself lucky you have got that, for there are cracks in the boards;" the carpet was moved to search - I remember King pulling off her clothes; nothing was found on her.</p>
               <p>Q. We understand there was an outrage, and the brokers came in - in what state was Elliss' face and ears at that time? A. Bleeding, and she was without her chains and ear-rings - she complained that her property was in the house; the brokers demand 22s. - some money was offered them; Elliss said, "Don't take it, it is my money - I am robbed;" some officers came; I went with her to the station-house: she was very faint then - she had washed before that; Wilson said to Henson, "Go up stairs, and you will find the money to pay the brokers;" I got the chains and things afterwards, and handed them to the constable; the half-sovereigns and sovereign were never found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You and Ellis are in the same kind of life? A. Yes, and the female prisoners also; I got to the house about half-past eleven or twelve o'clock in the morning; there was some gin in a decanter on the table - there appeared very little, and in about five minutes,

            , the little girl, came, when Wilson called her to fetch an errand, which was more gin; I think it was about a pint decanter - I will not swear it would not hold a quart; I swear Howard did not go for gin above three times - I did not notice whether she took the decanter; none of us got drunk: gin was only fetched three times, and it was only 6d. worth each time.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear the girl did not go nine times, and that there was not as many as eleven quarterns and a half of gin? A. Yes: I have had no conversation with Elliss about Henson having property, not a word; she did not ask if he had property, or say she had made inquiry, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160055"/>found he had; I did not strip. King did: Elliss charged them all with the robbery; King took off her stays and flannel petticoat - we were not all almost naked together in the room; only King and the prosecutrix stripped: when the quarrel began King fought nearly naked; Elliss' clothes were on; she did not fight: I heard Wilson say she had bit her on the ground, but I did not see her bite or fight: she tried to defend herself, not by striking, but by begging of them for mercy; she was not drunk at any part of the transaction: I was at Gibbons', she was not drunk there - I had about three glasses; I suppose we were drinking from half-past eleven or twelve to one o'clock: something was said about French polish, but the quarrel did not begin till Elliss accused them of robbing her; violence followed that, and I begged of them not to ill-use her: I cannot tell who upset the table; the carpet was over the middle of the room: no cracks were pointed out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are you in the habit of taking gin so early? A. No; I was not the least in liquor; there was no quarrel about the French polish, nor any altercation - I picked up one chain, and King the quizzing-glass, and gave it to me to give Elliss; I had not known Elliss long - when the broker came Wilson said the money was up stairs.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there any quarrel or dispute about the French polish? A. No; Elliss did not appear faint or ill till after she had had the coffee.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where you at the table all the time the gin was there? A. Yes; Elliss partook of part of what was sent for - she had about three glasses.</p>

            . I am servant to Miss Elliss. On the 2nd of August she went out about eleven o'clock in the morning - I saw two sovereigns, four half-sovereigns, and some silver on her dressing-table before she went out - I put it into her purse, in her presence; she went out immediately.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live at Eastrow. On the 2nd of August I went to this house for 22s. - I waited for the door to be opened; the warrant was signed against Wilson - Henson is not master of the house; I saw the prisoners there, and saw Elliss in the act of putting her petticoats on - she had a blow on one eye, which bled profusely; I did not observe her ears - she seemed particularly agitated, and said she had been robbed - all the prisoners were there; Henson offered me 11s., which I refused - some person said, "Go up stairs and fetch the money;" I cannot swear which it was, but I think it was Wilson - some money was brought down, which Henson offered me; I did not see whether it was gold or silver, for Elliss immediately caught hold of my hands to prevent my taking it, saying she had been robbed of it; she certainly knew what she was doing, though agitated; Henson said if she had been robbed to seek her redress - I afterwards went into the next house, which was empty; King came in after me, and I received from her two half-sovereigns and 2s. - she said if the prosecutrix had been robbed it served her right, for she had robbed hundreds.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. This is a house where girls of the town live? A. I presume so; I certainly took the prosecutrix to be the worse for liquor, but still to know what she was about; Murray seemed the most collected - I did not notice any being the worse for liquor but the prosecutrix; I did not know this house before, nor the prosecutrix, though it seems she had seen me; the landlord-had informed me he wished to get rid of the party because it was a had house; Henson did not offer to send for a Policeman in my hearing; I was not above ten minutes settling my business - Elliss said, "For God's sake, if you are an officer, protect me, for I have been ill-used and robbed."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You found you had seen Elliss before? A. She bought an article at my shop two months before, and I took it home; her name is on the door, on a brass plate.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did Murray appear perfectly capable of observing what occurred, and understanding it? A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you say whether Elliss' appearance arose from agitation or intoxication? A. No; I cannot say that she appeared particularly agitated.</p>

            , of East-row, coal-merchant. I was at work next door to Wilson's house, heard a disturbance, and saw Elliss; she complained of being robbed - I know Henson very well; I saw him go up stairs in the house and fetch a purse down - I saw him take two sovereigns out of it and offer to King - she took it, and went into the next house with Mr. Pickford; Elliss said, "It is my money, I have been robbed, do not take it."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was Elliss drunk or sober? A. She was not tipsy; I cannot say she was right, because she had three glasses of gin, for I saw it fetched - I was at work, painting, next door; I do not know how many houses of ill-fame there are in the street; I do not live in the neighbourhood - I went into the house to assist the broker; I did not see Elliss drink the gin, but speak from what she said at Worship-street; I saw the little girl go out with a basket, but only once - I was there from ten o'clock to five; I heard a noise in the house between two and three, and between three and four I went with the broker to distrain - it was about four; I saw the little girl go out with a basket - I did not see the bottle; I saw the bottle on the table when the door was open - it was a green bottle, not a decanter; I did not go in then, for the warrant was not signed - the bottle held about half a pint - it was not so large as a wine or porter bottle; it was a green bottle - I do not know whether it was a decanter; I saw no gin in it; it was just as I passed the door to go to work - the door opens directly into the room; when I heard Elliss say, "I have lost my money," they instantly shut the door - the broker had not come; I went to look for him; he came down with me, and we waited outside about a quarter of an hour till Henson opened the door; it was not open when we got there - I cannot say Elliss was tipsy, she was not right down sober; Murray was, and so was Henson.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Murray was able to attend to what was going on, and to give a correct account? A. She was.</p>

            , a watch spring-maker, and live at No. 16, Francis-street. Wilson's house is No. 7. On the 2nd of August I heard a screaming there, and a voice exclaiming, "You have robbed me; give me my money, I will have my money;" about a quarter of an hour after that, I saw King come out and go to No. 18, next door but one to me, where she lodged - when she got into the street I heard her say, "I have done her, and I am the one that can do her; I will give her a b-y good hiding, and b-r her" - she came out of that house in about ten minutes, and went into Wilson's house again; after that I heard several voices, but my attention was most particularly drawn to the voice, saying, "Give me my money," which I heard repeatedly - King came out of the house again in the same bouncing manner as before, using much the same expressions; she went back again, and every time she went back the noise was greater - I saw the door open, Henson was on the side of the prosecutrix, and Wilson with her hands up, as if she had hold of the prosecutrix; Henson was in a stooping position, and so was the prosecutrix, with her leg turned up behind - I only saw the back part of her leg; I did not see Henson do any thing then; I afterwards saw him strike the prosecutrix; I was then standing opposite their door - the door was shut too; after that I heard screams of Murder! and saw the prosecutrix violently shoved out of the house; she knocked for admittance, and her bonnet was thrown out to her - her face was bleeding; she said, "I have been robbed in that house, and cruelly beat," and desired me to send for a Policeman, which I did - I took her into my house to wash her, and she was in a dreadful state; the blood poured from both her ears, and she had a dreadful black eye - her senses were quite correct when she spoke to me, but she had not been many minutes in my house before she fainted; she fainted three times; after this King came into my house - the prosecutrix was bleeding at the time; King said to her, "Do you say I robbed you, do you say I gave you that black eye," and immediately struck her in the face, and made her mouth bleed - it had not bled before; the prosecutirx could not answer her - she had just recovered from a fainting fit; one of her ears was torn right through the flesh - she did not appear to me to be intoxicated, she spoke so collected; she was very much exhausted indeed - I had no doubt she had been drinking.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Why have you no doubt of that? A. Because I saw liquor go into the house once or twice; I did not think her intoxicated, I swear; I thought her sober, quite so - my son and husband came in and saw her; there are a great many had houses in that street - this is one, and No. 18 also, which

            . I am a Policeman. I went to Mrs. Gibbons' house about five o'clock, and saw Elliss all over blood, bleeding profusely from her eyes and ears; the blood was running down profusely - she appeared agitated and very weak from the loss of blood; in consequence of what I heard I went to No. 7. Francis-street, tried to open the door, and found it locked - I heard either a lock or window fastened while I was attempting to get in; I staid there a quarter of an hour - other constables came, and it was opened; I had required that it should be opened when I first went but it was not - I found the prisoners there, and took them into custody; they said they were innocent.</p>
               <p>Henson's Defence. I called at Wilson's that morning, and had not been there long before Ellis came in; I did not know her before, and went into the kitchen - she persuaded me to come into the parlour, and sent for half a pint of gin- Murray came in, and she sent for another half pint; there were four half pints sent for - that is all I know.</p>
               <p>MARY GIBBS. I live in Shepherd's-walk, City-road, and am a laundress. I have known Elliss about eight months, and wash for her; she told me she was very sorry for Henson, and she hoped it would be favourable with him - she did not say who robbed her; I once asked if it was Henson had robbed her; she certainly said she thought he never did rob her - I have seen Murray twice since this- she asked me if Henson had property, and said she had made inquiry, and was told he had; I said he was a hardworking man, and what he got was by industry; I have known him sixteen years - his father is a gingerbread baker, next door to me; he always bore an honest character.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ever know he was master of the house in Francis-street? A. No, he was not - he lived at his father's; I heard of his being taken on the Wednesday or Thursday as this happened on Monday - I went to Elliss, and begged her to be as favourable as she could to him, and she said she did not wish to hurt him, but she must tell the truth - she said she had been robbed, but could not tell where the money went, or which of them had robbed her; I saw a mark on her face, and she had a black eye.</p>
               <p>ELIZA HOWARD. I am ten years old, and live at No. 3, Francis-street. I remember the disturbance at No. 7 - Miss Elliss sent me to fetch the best gin that day about ten o'clock - I got sixpenny worth at a time, that is a quartern and a half - she gave Wilson the money for it, and Wilson gave it to me with a decanter to get it in, not a green bottle; I got it from Shepherd's public-house, in Old-street-road - I went for gin ten or eleven times for her; I received the money from Wilson, and once from King - Elliss gave it to King to give me; I am almost sure it was eleven times - it was ten or eleven; I changed half a sovereign in the morning the first time, and paid 6d. each time - Elliss gave the money for it each time; I got the same quantity each time - the last was about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How did you happen to go to the house? A. Wilson called me - I did not know her before- she did not pay me for going; when she wanted gin she called me from her mother's, from her own door - we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160057"/>live four houses from Wilson's - my mother was next door- I could hear Wilson call me; she said, "Betsey, will you fetch me an errand?" she said so each time - she called loud enough for my mother to hear; I had spoken to Wilson before - Wilson called me, and Elliss gave me the half-sovereign - the solicitor has been talking to me about the evidence I was to give; he was not half an hour talking to me - he did not tell me I must have gone ten or eleven times for the gin; he said, "Well, my little maid, how much gin did you fetch?" I told him eleven times - he did not ask me any thing more; my mother and Mr. Howarth were present - he gave me 1s. with a piece of paper; I never saw Ellis at the house before - a girl at the public-house gave me change for the half-sovereign - she has gone away not; the public-house is about ten minutes' walk from Francis-street; I never changed half a sovereign before, only for my mother - I had 9s. 6d. out of I - if 1s. was taken out of the half-sovereign, there would be 8s. 6d. left; if I had had 2s. worth of gin I should have had 7s. change - if 3s. were taken from a half-sovereign there would be 6s. left.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How many shillings does half a sovereign amount to? A. Ten - if I take 3s. from 10s. there would be 6s. left; if I took 6d. from half a sovereign there would be 8s. 6d. left - I got 8s. 6d. change out of the half-sovereign, not 9s. 6d.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you ever been to the public-house before for the people at No. 7? A. Three or four times - I went eleven times that day for Elliss; my mother knew I went once or twice; she scolded me once for it, when I had been about nine times.</p>
               <p>ELIZA HOWARD. I am this child's mother. On the day in question I was washing next door but one, round the corner; I left my daughter at home - I went about seven o'clock, and returned about twelve; I scolded my daughter for fetching gin for Miss Wilson, King, and the rest - I knew she had fetched it, because I saw her pass the house I was working at - I saw her pass I should think eight or nine times before twelve o'clock - I chided her for going so often, and said she should not go there so much; she did not tell me how often she had been, but I could see every time she went - I called her in once, and told her if she went again I should be very angry, and after that I saw her go again - I should think the last time I saw her go must have been between three and four o'clock - I should think she went ten or twelve times in all.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Of course you never knew of her taking gin to a brothel before? A. Yes; children were in the habit of running on errands for the neighbours - I never knew of her fetching gin for that house before; she passed at least eight or nine times before twelve o'clock - she might have fetched gin for Wilson before Elliss arrived - Elliss was there before twelve o'clock; I am sure the child fetched gin at least eight or nine times before twelve - the public-house is not more than two minutes' walk; I should think it is about one hundred yards - I have sent her out to change as much as half a crown at times, but never sent her with any gold - she never had any gold to my knowledge, till she changed this half-sovereign for Wilson; it was about half-past eleven or twelve o'clock when I called her in, and scolded her - she had gone eight or mine times then; she went backwards and forwards as fast as she could - I saw her every time she went; I chastised her three or four different times - being a poor woman, if a child can earn a halfpenny I am glad of it, and I suppose in the course of this day she might have received 3d. or 4d. for going for the gin.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did she show you any thing she had for going? A. Yes. 3d. or 4d.; when she had the money, she gave it to me to keep.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Your saw 3d. or 4d. which she had? A. Yes. Wilson keeps the house; I have seen Henson passing several times - his father keeps a shop in the City-road - every time my child had a half-penny she brought it to me, and it amounted to 3d. or 4d.; a halfpenny at a time.</p>

On the 26th of August the prisoner came into the coffee-room, and sat there from two o'clock till atter three - he then asked if I could spare our porter to go to Fore-street; I said No, but would send for one - Brede was fetched; I saw the prisoner deliver him a letter, telling him to go to Morrison's, and bring a parcel back; the prisoner asked me if he could have a bed there - I said he could; he told me if any body inquired for him (Mr. Clayton) he should be in in half an hour - the porter brought the parcel back, and inquired if he was in; he was not - he staid nearly two hours, and then left the parcel; I had it sent up to the bed-room intended for the prisoner - he came in at eight o'clock that night, and asked if a parcel had come which he had sent for; I said Yes, and it was in his bed-room - I had it brought down, and asked if that was it; he said Yes, it was all right - I wished him to look at it; he said he had no doubt of its being correct, but he had not an opportunity of looking at it then, and desired me to send it up to his room again; I did so, and an officer came and took him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you had seen the officer before? A. No - I did not know he was coming; I had seen a person from Morrison's, and suspected something was wrong; it was at another person's suggestion I showed him the parcel.</p>

            , JUN. I am a draper, and live at Chelmsford - my father's name is also Hollis. I am one of the Society of Friends - this letter is not the hand-writing of myself, or any one connected with me; no order was given for these goods - I had no occasion for them; I never employed the prisoner to negotiate any business for me - he occasionally resided at Chelmsford, but did not reside there lately.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons do your firm consist of? A. Only myself - there is nobody else of my name at Chelmsford to my knowledge; I do not positively afirm that there is one at lngatestone, but his name is not Hollis - I have two regular assistants, and occasionally my brother assists me; the 26th of August was not a busy time - I invariably write my own orders, except except about two years ago my brother wrote one - his name is Charles.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Mills, stay-maker, of Holywell-street. On the 9th of September I was sent to Smith's for 15 lbs. of cane, and had two half-crowns given me to pay for it - I saw the prisoner, and told him I wanted 15 lbs. of cane; he went up stairs, fetched an armfull down, and weighed it in the scale - I did not notice what weight was in the scale; he did not tell me the weight, or what I was to pay, but I paid him the two half-crowns; the cane was in long sticks, tied up in two strings - I took it to my master.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is your master here? A. No; I do not know the weight, nor whether I got more or less than I asked for - I am sure there was more than half the quantity, because I was fetched down next day and asked about it; I had taken the came up stairs - there was no more in the house, as we had used it all up the day before; there was not a stick uncut - four other persons were in the room I placed it in.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. You are sure there was more than 7 1/2 lbs.? A. Yes, I am certain - I paid 5s. for it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was any body near enough to see what you paid for it? A. There was a man near enough, but whether he was looking that way I cannot tell; I have seen him about the Court - master never complained that he received less than he paid for; it was not weighed after I brought it home - it was taken from the persons word whether it was weight or not.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He accounted to you almost immediately after? A. Yes - I was not present when it was weighed; I saw the prisoner searched about four hours after the transaction, but he had been out - one shilling and a halfpenny were found on him; his lodgings were searched about eight hours after, but none of our property found there.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Could any person, used to cane, be deceived in the appearance between 7 1/2 lbs. and 15 lbs.? A. Not if they were used to it; very few stay-makers use cane.</p>

He did; he has accounted to me when my son was out of the way, and there were others to whom he might occasionally account - I was not present when this cane was weighed; there is a wide difference in the appearance of 7 1/2 lbs. and 15 lbs. - some cane is stouter than others.</p>

I saw Stollard with the prisoner, about half-past ten o'clock, at the end of Cooper's-row - she was on the steps of Allhallows workhouse; he charged her with robbing him - she declared she had not seen him, and knew nothing of his property; when she got up to go with me I found a sovereign on the step, directly under where she had been sitting; the officer of the night searched her at the watch-house, I was not present - after returning to my beat I found an old leather purse or bag, empty, ten or twelve yards from the steps where she had sat; she said she had an infant five months old - it was not with her; I searched further, and on the window-cill of the workhouse, about as high as I could reach, I found 12s. 6d. - the window was three or four yards from the steps - she must have put it there before I came up, if she did at all; there were two half-crowns, seven shillings, and a sixpence.</p>

            . I live in London-field, Hackney. On the 21st of August, in the afternoon, I got on the Paddington-coach, in the City-road; I sat on the hind part of the coach - the prisoner is the young man who calls the passengers - I was rather drowsy; I had a gold ring on my finger - I felt some one touch my finger - I was astonished; I opened my eyes, and saw the prisoner's hand - I did not say any thing, but when we got near the public-house he took the ring off; I did not take any notice, as I thought he would throw it away, but when the coach stopped he got down - I jumped down and seized him by the throat; he threw the ring down, and a boy picked it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What had you taken that day? A. I had taken something, as I often do when I am thirsty; I was not drunk at all, the officer will answer that question; there were no other passengers; I felt something touch my finger - I shut my eyes almost (but not quite) so as to see; I have four or five other names; but I only use Mark La Riviere; I always write my name so; I have been four years in this country.</p>

I live in Wilson-street, and am time-keeper to the coaches - I was attending my duty on the 21st of August, about twenty minutes past four o'clock - this coach drove up, and the prisoner jumped from the side of this gentleman, and before he assisted any one down he drew something off the foot-board; he ran to his master, and said, "Here master, see what I have found;" before he could give an answer the gentleman came and throttled him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long have you been in that capacity? A. Four years. I never would see a person cry halves; I heard the gentleman accuse him of taking the ring, but not till after he had shewn it to his master - I think the distance was so very short, he could not have taken the ring from his finger.</p>

Yes, decidedly; neither of them are on the 9th of July: he has a great many accounts to keep; on the 7th of July he states in the books that he received 5l. 5s. from different customers - there was no money owing to him for empty casks, for about this time last year the money for empty casks was taken from him - it was a perquisite, but it was taken off by order of the proprietor; Mr. Braithwait appeared before the Magistrate, and said he expected the prisoner was receiving money for empty casks; he said he believed he had been paid, and he found he had not: I cannot say whether he said it was due to him or not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was any thing said about it? A. Yes - he said he expected he had received the money for the casks, but I said he had not.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Then, in point of fact, was it not due to him? A. That I leave to my Lord; I do not know whether any charge was made against him of this kind before - he has received money, and has apologized; I believe it has happened that he has received money in one name, and it has been booked in another name; I do not think that has happened now, when my witnesses have the receipts - I do not know that he ever paid me money in the street - he has occasionally in the yard.</p>

            . I am carman to Mr. Weston. This bill is my account for the week, ending the 28th of August last, and ought to have been paid to me that day; the prisoner was in the habit of calling on me on Saturday night to settle, but if I was out or engaged I used to go to him on the wharf on Monday morning, and get it; he did not pay this bill that Saturday - I went on the Monday to the factory, and asked him for it; he said he had unfortunately lost the money in coming home, but he would make it up in the course of the day; I said I wanted the money to make up a bill, I was a man with a family as well as he was, and I made up my accounts on Saturday; I went to him again on the Tuesday, and he said he would go out and get the money, for he had lent it to a friend - he was then sober; when I first asked him, I said I must be under the necessity of going down to Earl-street - he went out, as he said, to get the money, and came back drunk without it.</p>

            . He used to bring his money, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160065"/>enter it in a book - he came home, and said Mr. Wright would have paid him if he could have staid, but he was fearful I should be offended had he waited; I do not recollect his saying any thing about Mr. Paterson - it was evening when he returned.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. What was his duty? A. To do what was wanted - I have not brought the book; I generally use it in business, and I did not know it was necessary - Mrs. Jenkins is not here; he has sometimes brought home sums that have not been entered - he may have paid me money in the street; he has paid Mrs. Jenkins money in my absence - I do not recollect his being charged with having received money, and not entering it when he had paid it to her; he did not state at the office that he had paid these sums of money, nor any sum of money; he brought an account from Mr. Fountain that evening, but said nothing of these - I do not know whether he was at home the greater part of the day, when 7l. were paid; he had been one year and three-quarters in my service - I was not told by the Magistrate it would be necessary to produce my book.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect a day you went to a dog fight, charging the prisoner with having not paid a sum of money which he had received, and finding the week after that Mrs. Jenkins had had it? A. No; I went to a dog fight once, but cannot tell when.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you recollect that very day you received a sum of money of the prisoner? A. I think not; if I had I think I must have recollected it; I will not swear I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not receive it of Mr. Tidcomb, of Knightsbridge? A. I have no recollection of it; I know Tidcomb, he has brought money from him: my only reason for this prosecution was not because I found five sovereigns in possession of his wife; I know Morgan Rawlinson - I did not say I had any doubts as to these sums of money; the prisoner did leave me some time ago, and returned at my solicitation - he was useful to me, but I had not a high opinion of him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did he leave you? A. I think somewhere near about Christmas; I gave him in charge on the 23rd of July - he absconded, and went into the country - I pursued, and took him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you recollect any conversation about five sovereigns found on the prisoner's wife? A. No; there was something said about five sovereigns; he said he had taken five sovereigns from him when he apprehended him, that is all I heard said - that was the only money he found on him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Are there many persons in the shop? A. Three besides myself - I had never seen the prisoner before; I lost sight of him before I overtook him with the bag, for perhaps two minutes, and after that for about half a minute - I was in the back of the shop, both the doors were open, and no one in the shop; I saw nothing on him when he went out - he had got about three or four hundred yards before he was taken; he is the man I took the silk from, but I cannot say he is the man who came out of the shop - I only saw his back in the shop, which may be thirty yards long; here is the mark on this roller - I never saw any silk like this till it came to our shop.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not be at liberty after you charged him with this? A. No: he was taken on the 17th of July; he remained in custody, but I do not know that he was not at liberty; I saw him again on the Monday week after he was apprehended, at Hatton-garden; there was a man came and asked if there was work for him; but I do not know that the prisoner sent him, but the man said he had; he came to my house - he said he had been dishonest to me; he was sorry for what he had done, and wished me to take him again; I had not got a warrant against him, but I had spoken of it, and said I was about to get a warrant; he certainly had an opportunity of absconding if he liked, and he came back of his own accord.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Let us have the dates - he left you on the 4th of July, that was on a Sunday? A. Yes, and he came again the Friday following; he said he was sorry, and wished me to take him again - I told him what I had heard, as I had sent my son out on Monday with the bills, and found he had received some - I did not detain him then; it was near eleven o'clock at night - he walked quietly away.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you find nothing else? A. No; he said he was a jeweller - the prosecutor knew that he fell on his knees; I saw them part company, but do not recollect their shaking hands, there were so many men in the room - I could not attend to every one.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH ALDRIDGE re-examined. I caught him by the collar; he tried to get away, and found he could not, and

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not you take the book off the ground? A. I had hold of him, but I took it off the ground - there might he four persons in the room; I did not appear on the Monday against him - my business lies so that I could not; I did not understand the law at all - the officer did not tell me that I was to go on the Monday.</p>

On Saturday, the 4th of September, at four o'clock, I locked the counting-house door, and when I went back on the Monday I missed a piece of cloth, containing twelve yards, worth 20s.; it did not appear that the counting-house had been broken - it had been entered with a key: I know nothing of the prisoner - I saw the cloth at the Mansion-house, and knew it to be Mr. Brooke's, and it was there that Saturday evening; it has a number in my figures on it, which I can swear to; it had been on the table for the last six years - it is an old thing, and has been lying by.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What number of rooms are there in the counting-house? A. Two rooms in one; there are two doors - I am certain both doors were locked when I went away; I suppose the entrance was made from the second door - the Peruvian Mining Company belong to those premises; Mr. Brooke is their managing director: I do not know who pays the rent - this cloth was Mr. Brooke's private property.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 4th of September I was coming through Little Bell-alley, and saw the prisoner with this bag under his arm; he walked into the Shepherd and Flock public-house - I went in after him; he walked through into the water-closet - I opened the door, and said, "What are you doing here?" he said,"Nothing particular;" I said, "This is a piece of cloth;" he said, "It is a piece I bought;" it was then between four and five o'clock in the afternoon - I took him, and found two keys on him, but they do not fit the doors.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you consider them picklock-keys? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. One of them is the key of my door, and the other a latch-key. I lodged at Mr. Hinton's, in Gray-street - on the 3rd of August, when I went home at night, I found an execution in my house; the broker said my goods were the best, and he did not choose to take rubbish - I was compelled to pay 2l. 5s. 6d.: here is the warrant and the receipt - I thought it better to get out of the house, and he agreed to let me retain a part of his furniture, to indemnify me; I have been in the habit of buying many duplicates, having formerly been a pawnbroker- I bought this coat of him which I have on my back; on Saturday, the 4th of September, he came to me, and wanted me to buy a duplicate of cloth - I went to Mr. Purse's, and looked at it, but did not like it; he told me to go to this public-house, and he would fetch a piece of cloth; I waited there till ten minutes or a quarter-past four o'clock - he then came and brought it; I did not like it, but I bought it at last for 2s. 6d. a yard; I have persons to prove where Hinton did live, but he has removed, and I cannot produce him - I am actually paying 7s. 6d. in the pound for debts contracted twenty years ago, and I shall have a considerable balance in the hands of the Accountant General.</p>
               <p>JAMES MACKLAUGHLIN re-examined. Q. How lately before you locked the door had you seen the parcel? A. Perhaps half an hour; it was on a table by the fire-place; it was in Mr. Brooke's own counting-house.</p>

            . I live at No. 12, Back Church-lane, Whitechapel. On the 5th of August a man and his wife, named Hinton, came to lodge at my house, and staid till the 7th of September; on that day a woman named Stevens, and another man and woman, came and inquired for Hinton;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160069"/>they saw him, and had a great many words - I heard Hinton say, "I tell you I have a bill and receipt for it, which I can fetch;" he then came out, went through the house, and I never saw him since - he was frequently let in at very unseasonable hours, on which account I begged him to remove; his wife left the day after.</p>
               <p>JOHN FORRESTER re-examined. Q. What did the prisoner say? A. He said he bought it of a person, and he would explain it before the Lord Mayor, but I did not hear him do so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was not allowed; the Lord Mayor would not hear the case - on the second examination I attempted to speak, and the Lord Mayor said, "You can tell that another time - it must go before a Jury."</p>

            . I am a City officer. I took the prisoner - I heard Mrs. Swile tell him he had left the bags; he at first denied it - she said she was positive he was the person; he still denied it, and said, "You had better walk with me to Mr. Deacon's" - he then offered the 1d. for the pie; he said before the Alderman that he bought them, and paid his brother for them - the parcels were in his presence at that time.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose all the tea you send out is in paper of this sort? A. Yes, mostly - this mark is on almost all the tea and coffee that goes out; perhaps in the last six months I have sent out fifty such parcels; the only thing which I can distinguish these by, is, that they are an old weight; his brother was allowed to sell that night - the prisoner had been six months in my employ, but he was not so then.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I paid my brother for them, which he is here to witness now; my brother has been imprisoned all the while, though the bill was thrown out against him.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean to swear you paid him the money? A. Yes; he did find me kicking a parcel and a canister under the counter - I had the canister and bag on the floor to practise tying up tea; I was sitting on a stool - I was going to put it on the counter when I had got it into the bag; I did not find it more difficult there than on the counter - I do not know whether it was darker or not; I took the tea out of two canisters to practise mixing tea - I took the full value of it from my brother, and gave it to Mr. Deacon before he went out, but did not tell him what it was for; it was not entered in the book - it is not usual to enter articles which are paid for; I was taken up the next day - I did not tell Mr. Deacon this, because he would not believe me; I mentioned it before the Lord Mayor.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, declaring his innocence and stating, that he had left in consequence of receiving brutal treatment from his master, because he paid more respect to the prosecutor's wife than to the housekeeper, with whom he cohabited.</p>

            . I am a pupil at the London-hospital. Simmonds was brought in between seven and eight o'clock on Saturday evening; I found a fracture high up in the thigh - he lived ten days - I did not consider him in danger till about nine o'clock on the Monday night before he died, which was on Tuesday morning, between twelve and one; I opened his body, but not the head, not thinking that would at all assist me in judging the cause of his death - I found him in a very unhealthy state; if no accident had happened I do not think he could have lived long: in my judgment, his death was caused by dysentry - I cannot tell what caused that - it appears he was labouring under it previous to this accident; I have reason to suppose so; I think it had very likely been aggravated by the accident - his death might possibly have been accelerated by the accident.</p>
               <p>Q. In your judgment, was it? A. Dysentry being an inflammatory disease, I think it likely to increase it; I should say his death was accelerated by the accident; more than one person of greater experience than myself inspected the body - none of them are here; I have been a pupil there twelve months next October - I have seen some few cases of dysentry, and some have recovered; I do not recollect any that have died; I am twenty-four years old - he never expressed to me any apprehension of danger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you ever examined the body of a person who died of dysentry? A. I have been present at the examination of more than one, and noticed the appearances, which corresponded with those in this case - the appearances were sufficient to account for his death, independent of any external violence he might have received; I should think his death was accelerated by the accident - he was a man of full habit, and drank a great deal; he was attended in the hospital for dysentry - I have been articled to a gentleman in the country for five years, but did not see many subjects there.</p>
               <p>Q. Your belief of death being accelerated rests solely in the knowledge that an accident would increase inflammatory action in the stomach generally? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In forming your judgment do you take into consideration that death did not ensue till ten days; if the accident contributed to his death, should you not expect it to have been earlier? A. No.</p>

I saw him in the hospital on the Sunday morning; he said he thought he should never come out of the hospital alive- he continued of that opinion till he died; he told me on the Sunday morning that he was letting a job into a coach about half-past eight o'clock, and a man came on the pavement with a barrow, gave him a shove, shoved him into the road, and used very bad words; I asked who it was - he said the cat's meat man - that he knew the man by his wife coming by the Butcher-row, and then he said"That is the woman's husband that has done my death;" he said, so help him God, no other man touched him but him - I had seen the prisoner's wife come by the Butcher-row, and he had often seen her there before the accident; we had both seen the husband and wife go by together - he said he had no words with the man, but the man made use of bad words, and told him he ought to have laid there many years ago; he did not know the man's name - I have known him twenty or thirty years, but did not learn his name till after this.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He told you he met with the accident from the husband of a woman in the habit of coming down Butcher-row? A. Yes, the cat's meat man; I recollected the woman and the man also - there are several people in the neigh bourhood who go about with cat's meat - some of them are married; my husband drank at times - I cannot say whether he had been drinking at the time of the accident; he was sober when he left me at half-past six o'clock.</p>

            , of East-lane, Walworth, in the parish of St. Mary, Newington, Surrey, coal-merchant;" I also wrote the jurat, except the date - I then delivered to him the power of attorney and affidavit annexed; I have seen Wormersley write - I cannot say that the signature, 
               <persName id="t18300916-155-person1354">H. </persName>
            Lowry, to the power, is Wormersley's handwriting; there is a similarity of style - I should be very loath to say I believed it to be his; if asked whether I believed it to be his. I should say, to satisfy myself, I do not; here is "6th August" in the jurat of the affidavit - I believe that to be his hand-writing; I never saw the papers after he took them away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If asked distinctly whether you could form a belief of the hand-writing, and you were forced to say, you would say you did not believe it to be Wormersley's? A. Yes, I do not undertake to say that is the power he took away - the affidavit is only pinned to it, and could be transferred to any other power; a person having the affidavit could easily fill up the power the same as this, if they obtained the form from the office - I had known Wormersley a few months, and knew his residence; he was not taken up for two years after the transcation; I continued to know him down to the latter end of 1829, and did business for him - I could have read the order on which the affidavit was made if I had chosen, out did not; he was about publicly, and I understand was apprehended at his own factory - I knew him at his own house, which is a short distance from the factory; he was accessible to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Wormersley's father was in some manner concerned in the suit in Chancery? A. I understood so, but we were not engaged in that suit in any way; I have been sixteen years with Mr. Kiss, but never saw Willis till he was at Bow-street on this charge - I never inquired whether Wormersley had given me a true description of Willis, the attesting witness; I have frequently attested deeds - nothing is more common than for a person to be called in to witness the signature to a paper by the party purporting to be the person signing it; I have had letters from persons stating themselves to be the parties, and have then witnessed their signatures - I should certainly ask them if they knew the nature of the business.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Should you, in such a case, take care to ascertain whether the party was the person he represented himself to be? A. Certainly - I delivered the same affidavit and paper to Wormersley as were delivered to me at the Accountant-General's office, by Mr. Giles, the clerk.</p>
               <p>MR. KISS re-examined. On the 15th of August the prisoner Wormersley called on me again; he said he called<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160076"/>to request me to accompany him to the Accountant-General's office to identify him, and to receive the cheques - I was to identify him as the attorney named in the power of attorney, which he said he had had from my office, and which he told me was then in the Accountant-General's office; I accompanied him to the Accountant-General's office, in Chancery-lane, Middlesex - he inquired of Mr. Parkinson, the clerk, for the cheques, in the matter of Lowry and Gatland, in the cause Detillin and Gale; he appeared perfectly acquainted with the business of the office - I said, "This is Mr. Wormersley, he is the person named in the power of attorney;" the cheques were then given to him or to me, in his presence, and for his use - one cheque was for 103l. 5s. 1d.; he signed his name in the book, and I attested his signature - (looking at the book). I saw him sign this; it is his hand-writing, and here is my attestation (receipt read) - the power of attorney was on Mr. Parkinson's desk at the time; the prisoner signed the receipt, and received the cheques - perhaps I should be more correct if I said a power of attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. A. power of attorney, under which he professed to receive? A. Yes - we then went to another office, and had the cheque entered; it is payable at the Bank of England - he and I separated at the door; he took the cheque away - I did not accompany him to the Bank.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Nothing is more usual than that part of the transaction you performed? A. Certainly, it was perfectly regular; it is very common for creditors in the country to transmit a power of attorney to receive money, when a decree is made, but the papers must be obtained from the office - the Accountant-General has the profit, not the solicitor; it is stated in the order that Mr. Lowry was dead - at the time I identified the prisoner at the office I knew nothing of Mr. Lowry, whether he was dead or alive, or I should have known the power to be forged; if the clerk, who prepared the power, had referred to the decree, he must necessarily have discovered that he was doing wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. And the prisoner, if acting criminally, must have known he was going to the very place of all others where he must necessarily have been discovered? A. He must- the order is dated the 7th of August, 1827, twelve months before the occurrence in question; he must have known the very instrument which would discover this would he laid on their table; I must state that he only turned to that part of the order which does not describe Lowry as deceased - the clerks knew where to look for both parts of the order.</p>

            . Esq. is the Accountant-General. On the 16th of July, 1828, application was made to Mr. Giles, who is next to me in the office, for a power of attorney, in the cause of Detillin and Gale- Mr. Giles prepared this power (looking at it) - it is Mr. Giles' hand-writing; I had nothing to do with preparing the power or affidavit - they were after wards produced to me personally, by the prisoner Wormersley, both the power and affidavit annexed; I cannot say when they were brought - I examined the power as to the execution of it- it appeared duly executed, and the affidavit duly sworn - I marked the affidavit at the back R. B. Fo. C. L. O., it being the outside, and I have marked the power with my initials, so that I know them to be the same; to the best of my recollection Wormersley was alone when he produced the order for the purpose of getting the cheques prepared; on the 15th of August he came for the cheque - Mr. Kiss came with him to identify him as the person to whom the power of attorney belonged; I had it in my possession at that time, in my drawer in the office, it having been previously examined; after I had numbered it, and filled up the receipt. I put the number of the power in the margin of the receipt; Wormersley signed the receipt in Mr. Kiss' presence, who added his name and address there to- the cheque was for 103l. 5s. 1d. on the Bank of England; he took the order of Court, directing the payment, and the cheque away - (cheque produced) this is the cheque in question (read); I put his name to the back of it, to give the Bank knowledge that he was attorney - the first "Wormersley" on the cheque is written by me, and here is another, which is his signature, written at the Bank, acknowledging the receipt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You have seen this order, I suppose? A. It was an office copy of the order under which I acted; I had examined the power and affidavit - I had examined the order carefully: I beg pardon for saying so much, but it is my business to look at the ordering part of the order, and if you will read that part you will perceive that where persons are dead it says "To the representatives" of those persons, and here the order says,"Pay to 
               <persName id="t18300916-155-person1357">H. </persName>
            Lowry;" my duty is only to read that part - if I was to read all the recitals no man could do the business of the office; there was nothing to prevent my reading the whole - whether Wormersley omitted to read that part I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. If he was conversant with the business of the office, would he know that according to the course of business, you never read the whole order? A. Certainly - the power of attorney satisfied the ordering part.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the Accountant General's office. In July, 1828, I received instructions for a power of attorney, in the cause Detillin and Gale; I believe I received them by, or on behalf of Mr. Kiss - I have them here.</p>
               <p>MR. KISS. These instructions are in Wormersly's handwriting. (read.)</p>
               <p>The order was for two powers of attorney, one from Henry Lowry, of Brentwood, auctioneer, for 103l. 5s. 1d., in the cause of Detillin and Gale, to John Wormersley, as before described.</p>
               <p>MR. GILES. In consequence of these instructions, I prepared that power, it was a printed form; I filled in all the manuscript part except the date and the names of the executing party and witnesses - I inserted the name of the attorney in the body, and prepared the affidavit affixed, except the names of the deponent and witnesses- they were prepared in the office according to the usual course of business - I cannot say to whom I delivered them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. For the purpose of complying with the instructions, I suppose you referred to the order in Court? A. Either to that or the office copy, which would contain the whole order - but I should not look at the recital; that would contain the name of Lowry as deceased - I might refer to it if I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160077"/>chosen; I do not know that I ever saw the power after I issued it.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL WELLSDON. I am a clerk in the Bank of England. I paid this cheque on the 15th of August, 1828 - the person signed his name on the back as John Wormesley; he appeared to act as attorney for some person.</p>

               <p>Wormersley's Defence(written). - My Lord and Gentleman of the Jury - My father was a creditor of the estate of a person named Detillan, the effects of which were administered under the anspices of the Court of Chancery; the debt due to him was large, and deeply interested on his account, I called very frequently upon the solicitors to the estate - this produced a degree of intimacy between myself and the parties in the office, and when, after a great length of time, it was ascertained there was a probability that the debts would be paid in full, it was suggested to me by a clerk in the office that I might derive some advantage from purchasing up such of the debts as were still outstanding as claims upon the estate: I never read the order, and if those whose immediate business it was, did not read it, I could hardly be expected to do so: the first I purchased was a trifling one from a Mr. New, of Aldgate, and finding that the business would occupy more of my time than I could spare from my own pursuits, I employed an acquaintance, a supposed friend, namely, Henry Campbell, to negociate for the sum due to a Mr. Lowry, of Brentwood - the amount of his debt was 103l. 5s. 1d.; Campbell undertook the business of arranging for my purchase of it, and went, as he said, to Brentwood, for that purpose - this is proved by the evidence of Mrs. Wallace, who says that some person (but neither myself nor Mr. Willis was that person) came to inquire whether she would sell the debt due to her father, but that she refused to listen to any such proposition; this refusal Campbell did not communicate to me, on the contrary, he returned to town, and stated that he had concluded the negotiation; and on the faith of his representation being correct, I gave him 60l. for the purpose of purchasing this debt of 103l. 5s. 1d., and furnished him with the blank warrant of attorney to get it properly executed, and conclude the business in the ordinary way; Campbell took the money and the blank warrant of attorney, and soon afterwards returned with it, apparently executed by Henry Lowry, but the office at which the money was to be paid, requiring a further attestation of the signature, Mr. Campbell proposed to introduce Mr. Lowry to affix his signature, in order to obtain the attestation of Mr. Willis to the signature - this was done; Campbell introduced a person to me as Mr. Lowry; I appointed a time, when Lowry, as I supposed, was to attend to affix his signature with that of the attesting witness, besides Willis. The persons representing Lowry, and the witness Deering came to my house, and Mr. Willis met them there; they affixed the signatures, and Mr. Willis made the affidavit of attestation in consequence. I had no suspicion that Campbell was dealing falsely with me; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160078"/>had known him for years, and would almost have trusted him with my life, for that as well as my character has been on the verge of sacrifice through his duplicity, and the ungenerous stratagem by which he has reduced me to the situation in which I stand. The business being completed, and as I thought in a correct way, I obtained the money, and as it appears, entered in my cash book, as an ordinary occurrence. My housekeeper was present when I paid the money to Campbell, which she believes was about 60l., and that I had some conversation with her on the business, from which she gathered that it was for the purchase of a debt, on the execution of a warrant of attorney; but the time that has elapsed, nearly two years, and the improbability that her attention would ever he recalled to the circumstances, has tended to destroy that distinctness of recollection which I could wish had been preserved. Another person was present when I paid the 60l. to Campbell, but I have not been able to produce him as a witness from certain embarrassments of his own, but I have a memorandum in Campbell's own hand-writing of the receipt of the 60l., and this hand-writing will be produced and proved, which is all I can now do, Campbell not being able to be found, for had I the power of producing Campbell, his own life would be the forfeit of his appearance in this Court; he has, as the Court may well suppose, consulted his own safety; for nearly two years he has not been seen by any of his old acquaintances, or in the places of his previous resort - in fact, soon after the date of this transaction he absconded, and has not since been seen in London.</p>

               <p>Willis' Defence (written.) Being prevented by an impediment in my speech from addressing you, I beg leave to submit to writing the following facts: - In the latter end of July, 1828, John Womersley called on me at my lodgings, in East-lane, Old Kent-road, and said that he had purchased a debt, and wished me to call the next morning at his house in Lant-street, Borough, to witness a power of attorney, authorising him to receive the money; I called the next morning at his house, and was there introduced by him, for the first time in my life, to a person who he represented as a Mr. Lowry; the power of attorney was then placed on the table, and I saw Mr. Lowry write his name, "Henry Lowry" on the power of attorney, which I witnessed, as also did another gentleman then present, and afterwards made an affidavit of the same, at an office in Southampton-buildings, for doing which I never received any remuneration, either directly or indirectly, but did it to oblige him, having known him for some time, and being a distant relation - after that I never saw

             until I was apprehended, at Bow-street. Gentlemen, I have now stated to you the simple facts of the case, so far as I am innocently concerned, and which might have happened to any of yourselves; and I appeal to you, as men of business and of the world, whether it is likely I should have witnessed, put my own name and address where I then resided, and continued to do so for eighteen months afterwards, and at which place Mr. Taunton, the officer, found me, without the slightest difficulty, if I had had any idea of the power of attorney being a forgery; to convince you that it is impossible I could have participated in the produce of the power of attorney, I shall be able to prove to you that at that very time I was in very distressed circumstances, and obliged to pledge my wearing-apparel to procure the necessaries of life for myself and family, consisting of a wife and three children - within a week after the money is said to have been received I went to work in the London-docks as a laboarer.</p>

            . I live in Rochester-terrace, Vauxhall-road. In 1828, I was housekeeper to the prisoner Wormersley, and have seen Campbell several times at his house; about the latter end of July, 1828, I remember Wormersley paying him 60l. - Wormersley then gave him a power of attorney, as I understood; it was a paper - I think it was like the one produced; I understood Campbell was to pay the 60l. to purchase the debt - he was to get the paper properly affixed and filled up as a power of attorney; I saw Campbell again a few days after, and then two or three weeks after, but have never seen him since.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. How often had you seen him before? A. Three or four times; I never saw him any where but at my master's - he left his name once as Campbell; I am positive this happened in July - I cannot give any reason; I cannot say when I was first asked if I remembered this; it was not till after my master was taken up - I have been with him down to the time of his being taken up; he is not married.</p>

I know Wormersley, and I knew Campbell, an acquaintance of his; I remember his visiting at Wormersley's house, when he lived in the New Kent-road, about 1823 and 1824, for about a year and a half - the last time I saw him was in the early part of 1828 in Cranbourn-alley.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. You knew him about 1824 and till 1828? A. No - he was generally at Wormersley's on a Sunday, up to 1824; I was not in the habit of being there after that - I did not see him between 1824 and 1828; I always heard him called Major Campbell.</p>

I have known Birt some time; I applied to him to assist me in detecting the prisoner, what he did was by my direction; I applied to him about a fortnight or three weeks before this transaction; on Tuesday, the 6th of July, I was at the Two Angels and Crown at the corner of Upper St. Martin's-lane, about a quarter-past eleven o'clock - Myers and Birt were present; I satisfied myself that Birt had no coin about him - I then gave him seven shillings and two sixpences to make a purchase; he left<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160081"/>me, and remained in the parlour of the public-house, but I saw him and the prisoner meet about twenty minutes before twelve o'clock; I saw the prisoner come and wait till Birt came to him - I saw some paper pass from the prisoner to Birt, and something pass from Birt to the prisoner; they remained together about five minutes, or not so long - they then went away to the right; Birt returned in about half an hour - they went out of my sight, but I had directed Myers to follow them; they went in a direction towards Compton-street - when Birt returned, I received sixteen half-crowns from him, these are them; I believe the prisoner was taken on Saturday last - we met on the next day at the public-house to make another purchase, and to endeavour to take the prisoner, but he did not come - Limbrick afterwards took him.</p>

            . On the 10th of June I met Goff, Myers, and a man of the name of Jem, at the Plough, about three o'clock in the afternoon - Goff searched me, Myers was by, and I think the other man: Goff then gave me eight shillings (I am a labourer, and live at No. 6, Vickery-street, Vauxhall) - I went into King-street, which leads to St. Martin's-lane; Jem, who had gone with me, left me there, and went to the prisoner Burk, and in about ten minutes the prisoner Burk, and Jem came to me - I was waiting by myself till they returned; I asked Burk if he could let me have a dozen of half-bulls, by which I meant half-crowns; he said he would let me have them in an hour, when he was to meet me at the Bank public-house; I then went to the Plough, and about four o'clock I went to the Bank - Burk was there; he said he had got them, and called me out of the tap-room into the passage; I saw Clancey at the back of the passage, about five yards from Burk; he said to her, "Give me them out;" she put her hand into her bosom and gave him a paper parcel, which he gave me; I put it into my pocket, and gave him the eight shillings - we then went and had something to drink; Jem was in the tap-room, but he did not go into the passage - we all four drank together; Burk said, "Well, I wish you luck, when will you be this way again?" I said, "In a day or two;" I went back again on the 8th - I had seen Burk before, and made an arrangement on the 2nd of June; this transaction took place on the 10th of June - I had seen him on the 8th, I then arranged to meet him on the 10th; I met him there, and promised to meet him in a day or two - I went to the Plough, and gave the parcel to Goff in presence of Myers; they were marked, and I went away.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You gave the parcel to Goff and Myers? A. Yes; Jem did not go before the Magistrate - he introduced me to the prisoner; I think I became acquainted with Jem in the middle of May - I had never seen him but once; Jem was in the taproom when I received this from the prisoner in the passage - I do not know whether he is here; that is not my business: I did not hear that said by a gentleman at the table - I did not notice it; I work at Mr. Law's, at Peckham - I am still employed by him, when he has it to do; I worked for Mr. Kilsby on Saturday last: Goff has known me for fifteen years - I was not to be paid any thing for this, that I know of; I expect to be paid as other witnesses - if this had not come to trial I could not expect any thing - there was no agreement; if there is any present I will take it - I shall be very well satisfied if I am paid for my loss of time; I expect something, but I have not formed any expectation what - I should be satisfied with two guineas; I do not expect to be paid for swearing - I went to this man twelve or thirteen times; Jem always went with me: the first time I saw the prisoner was on the 31st of May - I have only given evidence in a Court of Justice once before this; that was in a Mint case, four or five months ago, against Parr - a man of the name of Bill introduced me to the Mint; I did not get a halfpenny from the Mint then - I did not apply for my expences; I lost two or three days on that occasion - I cannot get my money; I suppose it does not suit - I have not applied for it; Goff employed me, and I suppose he will pay me - I have heard it is not suitable; I do not know the name of the person who told me so - I expect to be paid when other witnesses are; those twelve or thirteen days I lost were not altogether, perhaps one day in a week - this morning is the first time I attended this Court: Bill said the other job would not be paid yet a while - I had no conversation with Jem about being paid; I did work for a Mr. Hunt without making<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160082"/>an agreement as to what I was to have - I sometimes get 3s. 6d. or 4s. a day: I live at No. 6, Vickery-street - I have never been in any Court except as a witness; I left Sanders-street, where I lived before, because the rent was too much.</p>
               <p>MR. ELLIS. Q. The first time you met the prisoner was on the 31st of May? A. Yes - Jem was with me then, and I made a purchase of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>A JUROR. Q. Am I to understand that you mean to swear that you did not hear Mr. Scarlett say that something in reference to Jem you had no business to answer? A. I did hear it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. The expression he made use of was, that he did not notice it.</p>

            . I am acquainted with Simmons - he is a respectable young man, and works at a wharf, at loading barges; he lives some where at Lambeth - I do not know where; Goff and I applied to him for the purpose of detecting the prisoner. On the 10th of June I was at the Plough, in Carey-street; Goff and Simmons were there, and another person, who was at another part of the room when we performed the operation on Simmons, that we might satisfy the Jury that he had nothing about him more than we gave him; Goff then gave him 8s. to purchase half-crowns - he left us; I followed him, and kept sight of him till he got to King-street - he went to the door of the Bank public-house; Burk shortly after came up to him - they went into the house together, and went into the tap-room on the left hand; when they had been in some time, I went through the house; there is a passage which goes into Charles-steeet - I went into Charles-street, and waited at the corner of Lincoln's Inn-fields, which is close by, till Simmons came to me, which was in about half an hour: he said, "I have got them" - he went to the Plough, and I followed him; when he got to the Plough he produced a parcel, and Goff opened it - it contained twelve half-crowns; Simmons marked them, and Goff took them into his possession - I saw the prisoner when he was taken; it was on Thursday three weeks - I think it was on a market day in Smithfield; information was given to the Mint a fortnight or three weeks before - the warrant was obtained after this.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had you known Simmons? A. About ten months, but never to be intimate with him: I know he was employed in Parr's case three or four months before - Parr was transported; he was convicted on the charge on which Simmons gave evidence against him - he was tried more than once: I have known Jem six or seven months - Goff introduced me to Simmons; I thought Simmons an honest man, but he was searched to satisfy the Jury - he was certainly out of my sight; I do not know that Jem was in that public-house - I did not see him; Simmons did not tell me he was there - if he had said he was there, I would have believed him: Parr was tried here and acquitted, and then taken to Horsemonger-lane and convicted - Simmons was a witness here, and on the trial on which he was convicted; I did not know where the prisoner lived - we did not take him at first, as we knew he was an extensive maker, and we wanted to go to his house and find the moulds and things, but we had lost all chance of finding his house, and so we took him; Simmons was employed by the Mint for I suppose four or five months; not in constant employ; he never received any thing to my knowledge, but in the shape of purchasing - I know he is a day-labourer; I believe he was employed but very few days - it might be eight, or ten, or twenty, for what I know, off and on, not regularly; sometimes for a few hours - I do not think he has had a farthing for his expences; I did not apply for my expences - I have not had a farthing, and do not want to have it: I have asked for my expences in these cases, but if I were to ask my Lord for my expences in these cases, I am satisfied he would not grant it - I never received any thing in my life for Mint cases; the Mint pay me - the largest sum I ever received of them for one job was 5l. or 6l., but that was a very large job; I never made a minute of it - 3s. 6d. a day is paid here, but I never know what I am to have for the Mint; it is not half enough for my trouble - the last time I gave evidence was at Horsemonger-lane: the money I have got was about 5l., that is about the outside, for my loss of time - I did not take Jem before the Magistrate; I cannot tell why - I did not know he was a notorious smasher nor that Bill was; I do not think Jem got a farthing from the Mint - I suppose they all expect to be paid.</p>
               <p>MR. SCARLETT. Q. When you attend in Mint cases, you are paid by the Mint? A. Yes, not by the County.</p>

               <p>RICHARD MYERS. Simmons was bound over at Horsemonger-lane, but he was convicted on Rose's evidence, and Simmons was not called up.</p>
               <p>GEORGE GOFF. On the 10th of June, I met Myers, Simmons, and another, at the Plough in Carey-street - I searched Simmons, and gave him 8s.; he went away towards the Bank public-house in King-street, Drury-lane- I saw him go part of the way; I then turned back to the Plough - he returned there to me in half an hour or better, and brought me a paper parcel containing twelve half-crowns; he told me what had taken place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who did you give the money to? A. To Simmons - he is not a particular friend of mine; my brother was an officer at Union-hall - I had known Jem three or four years; I have not seen him for a week - I am no relation of Myers, nor connected with him; I suppose I have been connected with the Mint fifteen years - I have been paid for my time as other witnesses; I remember receiving 35s. in one case - that was a small case; I cannot tell what has been the largest sum I ever received, without I were at home to look at my book - I swear I never got 5l. without it was money laid out of my pocket; perhaps 4l. or 4l. 1s. was the largest - I do not know exactly; I was engaged a great many days, and was very much dissatisfied.</p>

On the 4th of December the prisoner, in company with his brother, called at my house to look at a chaise - he left his card for me to call on him; I went to a public-house, which he then kept, and saw him, and his brother - I wanted 28l. for the chaise; his brother said 25l. was as fair price he offered - a 20l. bill, at two months, and 5l. in spirits or wines - I agreed to take it, and it was to be ready on the second day following - he called at my house then with a saddle horse, but the chaise was not ready-he brought me a 22l. bill, which was accepted, and said he thought it better to give me three sovereigns instead of my taking spirits or wines - I said I must inquire about the bill, unless his brother would endorse it - he was very angry at that, and said he would give me a bill of his own - it was at last agreed that I was to have the three sovereigns - I was to inquire about the bill, and if it was good I was to leave the chaise with him at four o'clock; I went to Westminster to inquire about the bill; he watched me out, and before I had been gone half an hour he took the chaise out - I went to Westminster and inquired of a person who knew the parties; he said the bill was good for nothing - the prisoner said I was to take the chaise home at four o'clock, as he was going to Barnet to look at some corn for his father.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Where is the bill? A. Here it is - it is on a person named Lane; I went to two respectable tradesmen who knew the parties well - I passed the bill to the hands of a Mr. Clark, with whom I do business - Mr. Clark is dead, but his wife gave me the bill up; when I wanted money, I was in the habit of borrowing of Mr. Clark; I owned him 100l. once; I passed the bill into his hands for the purpose of presenting it - I went before the Magistrate at Queen-square; the case was not dismissed as a charge of felony; the prisoner brought the acceptor of the bill, and the Magistrate said it must stand over till the bill became due- I went again when the bill became due - the prisoner was then in the King's Bench, and the Magistrate said I must consider it as a bad debt - the officer told him it was a case that had been heard before - the acceptor of the bill was brought there on the first hearing, to say it was a good bill, and would be paid when due - I told he Magistrate I considered it no debt at all - it was fraud and felony - the Magistrate afterwards advised me to bring him up by Habeas, which being expensive, I would not do - I put it into the hands of Clark; after I was told I must consider it as a bad debt I received a notice under the Insolvent Debtor's Act - I opposed him for fraud and felony - he was not remanded at my suit - he gave a fale notice to come on the 24th of May, and his notice was dated the 28th of May - I appeared on teh second examination, and told the Commissioners I had taken proceedings - I was not sworn as a witness - I entered in the book my intention of opposing his discharge - I heard the judgment of the Court against the prisoner - I did not hear that he was remanded for eight calendar months at the suit of John Evans, for a debt of 22l. - I have been to him in prison - I found him in custody for debt - I did not ask him then for payment - I did not say, "Will you pay me now?" nor did he reply, "I cannot pay you now, as it would be giving you an undue preference" - I did not speak to him - I did not tell his brother that if the bill was paid I would not take any step at all - his brother came and offered a bill of 15l. - I know Mr. Lane lives where the bill was payable - no action has been commenced against him - I could have arrested him, but I did not consider it a debt - I owed Mr. Clark money, and I told him the nature of the case - if he had got the money he would have paid himself - he was to take his account out - he did not sue Lane - it was not considered a debt - there was a cushion taken from another chaise.</p>

            . I went to Mr. Evan's shop one Monday morning; the prisoner said, "I am glad you are come, there are some jobs to do to the chaise" - he then said, "Never mind, it can be done at home," and while I was up stairs he pushed it out, or it was taken out, and the cushion of another chaise was taken at the same time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you swear you did not say that the cushion belonging to the gig was repairing, and it should be sent home? A. I cannot recollect - I might have said so; I do not know whether we have the proper cushion now.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. The cushion belonging to this chaise wanted fresh covering, and the prisoner said he could take the cushion of a phaeton - I said he must not have that, very likely it would be wanted - while I was on the stairs he took it, put it into the chaise, and said I might have it in the morning.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY to MR. EVANS. Q. Did not you see the prisoner after this? A. Yes, at his own house; he told me to leave his house, and I went to Queen-square.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What became of the chaise? A. I saw it standing at Westminster for sale; the prisoner sold it the day before he went to prison - I was told he went on the 18th of January.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. That was six weeks after? A. Yes - the bill was never presented for payment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor came to my house on the 5th of December, and said he had a second-hand gig for sale - he waited two hours, and urged me; I agreed to give him a 22l. bill on Mr. Lane, and 3l. in money - I was to go on the 7th of December, and it was to be delivered to me at ten o'clock in the morning; he took the bill - I endorsed it, and gave him 3l.; I lost an action in the King's Bench, and not having means to pay, I was forced to go through the Insolvent Court - the prosecutor came to me and said, "The bill is due, do you intend to pay it;" I said, "Mr. Lane owes the money" - he said, "I will oppose you, and you shall have twelve months;" he met me going in, and said, "If you will pay the bill, I will not go in, I will put off the indictment I have against you, and if you don't, I will oppose you now, and at the Old Bailey;" I said, "it is not in my power to pay you, if my friends like to do any thing with you, it is their concern" - he went in, and I was remanded for eight months; the man who says he was up stairs, was there at the time, and I asked if he would have something to drink, and gave him 1s. for half a pint of gin - he said, "You can have that cushion till the evening, and I will bring yours down."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Are you a master tailor? A. No, a journeyman - I had never seen the prisoner before; I did speak to her about going to America - I did not promise her marriage; I asked her to take me to her lodging; she said she could not - we went to a house and had some brandy and water; I said, "I came from America" - she said, "I should like to go there;" I said, "I shall go there soon" - I had drank nearly a pint of ale after four o'clock, before I met her; I do not recollect having any thing else - I was not intoxicated; I was at home till about half-past eight; I then went to a public-house at the corner of Marylebone lane - there I and another drank two pints of ale: she had told me her address - she did not say, "I want some paper to curl my hair, and I will take this note;" when we went to her lodging she did not say, "I have your money, but I won't give it you yet" - I said, "Where is my money?" meaning the 5l. note and the money; she said, "I have not got your money, I have not taken it, and will go and bring my pocket to show I have not taken it;" she was not paying me the money when the officer came.</p>
               <p>LOT COX. I heard the prosecutor call Police! about six o'clock that morning - he said he had been robbed by a young woman he had been sleeping with all night in Dean-street, but he did not know the number; he said she was at No. 43, Upper York-street, Marylebone - I went and demanded admittance; Mr. Whitehead said there was such a person in his house, and he went and brought her down - she came within one or two steps of the bottom; the prosecutor asked her for his money - she said, "I have no money belonging to you, and took none;" she then told him to come up stairs - the landlord said, "No man should go up but the officer;" she then brought down a dark reticule, and handed me a 5l. note and a sovereign - she said she took it through a lark, and she had told the prosecutor where she lived; the prosecutor did say he believed she did not mean to steal it - he said had Mr. Whitehead let him in, he would not have called the officer.</p>

It is my duty, in the absence of Mr. Billing, to walk in front of the counter, and see that the customers are attended to; on the Saturday previous to the 24th of August, the prisoner was missing; I called him, and he did not answer, but presently he came out of a window, where there are a quantity of woollen goods, where he had no business to go - I saw him putting something into his pocket, and from the confused manner in which he appeared, when I told him to serve a customer, I had some suspicion, but I let it pass on till the next Tuesday, when I wanted a particular handkerchief, bearing the representation of His present Majesty; I inquired and they were not to be found; there had been two of them - all the young men denied having seen them; I then named it to Mr. Billing, and likewise the circumstance of the prisoner coming out of the window; in the evening he went to search all the boxes - the prisoner unlocked his box, took out his linen, and opened it, to show that there was nothing there; he went on till he came to a bundle; I asked what was in that - he said nothing particular; I told the Policeman to take it, and there were two handkerchiefs, with the shopmark on them; here is a length of silk which was found, but I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where did you see him come from? A. From the woollen-drapery window; there are silks there sometimes, but I am not sure there were that day - I am sure the prisoner's box was locked; it was a common box, in the room to which others have access; I had not suggested to the prosecutor the propriety of searching the boxes - we have not been on bad terms, but, from my filling the principal situation, perhaps some words might pass; I never said I would do for him the next day.</p>

No - there was no bundle that he opend; when I took it out he said he did not care at all about it, were it not for his mother - he gave no acount of them; this third hadkerchief was on them - he asked what I thought he should be done to.</p>

            . I live in Finch-lane. I was sitting in my shop, and saw the prisoner go by with the four desks; a gentleman was pursuing him; he was about twelve yards from the prosecutor - I followed the gentleman, who stopped the prisoner in my presence; the desks were on the pavement then, but I had seen them in the prisoner's arms.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Is that gentleman here? A. No; it was between seven and eight o'clock in the evening - there are many lights there; the desks were by the side of the prisoner - I asked how he came by them: he said a man gave him 6d. to take them to Whitechapel; he had not run more than ten yards.</p>

It is a large cupboard - I was nearer the prisoner than the prosecutor was - I was about two yards from him, and he was, perhaps, three yards further - there was some glass between him and the prisoner - I suppose the shop is five feet wide; it is very well stocked - I do not remember any stockings falling into a basket by accident - there is only a boy named

            . I am a ticket-porter of the City, and live in Star-alley, Fenchurch-street - I usually stand at the door of the Elephant public-house, Fenchurch-street. On Monday, the 26th of July, I was standing there, and about twenty minutes or a quarter before four o'clock (as near as possible) a person came to me with a cheque; I swore to the person next day - the prisoner is that person; this is the cheque I received from him, it has my initials on the back - he came and touched me, drew me aside a few paces, gave me the cheque, and desired me to go to Messrs. Jones and Lloyd's, the bankers, and get five 10l. notes, forty sovereigns and a half, and bring them to him at Mr. Walker's, Mark-lane. and if he was not there, he should be at the Cornexchange; I took the cheque folded in my pocket, and went to the bankers as quick as I could - I stopped in my way, in Ball-alley, opened it, and saw who it was payable to; I went to Jones and Co., and payment was refused - I was asked who I received if from, and stated; when I saw there was doubt about the cheque, I immediately cast my eyes at the dial, and saw it was ten minutes to four o'clock; a person was sent out with me to to Howard, late Walker and Sons, No. 24. Mark-lane, I found no Walker living there - I did not find the person who gave me the cheque there; I went into several coffee-houses and taverns in Mark-lane, and then to the Corn-exchange, but did not find the person at any of those places - the person from the bankers then left me, and I returned to my stand; I had given Jones and Co. one of my cards - I heard no more of the matter that day; I went to the bankers next morning, and complained of it being hard upon me not being paid my porterage, and they gave me 1s. - I returned to my stand, and found a card at the public-house, referring me to Mr. Gates' office; I went there directly; I waited nearly two hours, and Mr. Gates came in - I was ordered into a private room, were Mr. Gates and several gentlemen were - Mr. Gates questioned me; I said a gentleman gave me the cheque, that he was about five feet four inches high, or five feet six, as near as I could tell, that he had a very remarkable nose, and was very quick in speech. that I belived I should know him again if I saw him; I went with Mr. Gates in a coach to Shoolbred and Cook's, in Tottenham-corut-road, but did not she the person there - I returned, went to dinner, and returned to Mr. Gates' office about four o'clock; I waited there some time - seven or eight gentlemen then came into the office, and I recognized the prisoner as the person who gave me the cheque: I noticed him directly he came in, but nothing passed between us - three or four persons might have come in before I recognized the prisoner; one man came in with him - I had not the least doubt whatever of his being the person; I am positive the prisoner is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you in the habit of going to bankers to receive cheques? A. At times, as gentlemen employ me who have counting-houses, but very seldom for gentlemen in the street; I went as quick as I could - I was at least twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour at the bankers'; I left there I think at a quarter or twenty minutes past four o'clock - I have at times been kept waiting while others are served, but there was nobody else there; I felt awkward at first at being the bearer of a suspicious cheque - I was, of course, anxious to find the person I received it from; I was once trusted with a cheque on Esdaile's, for 120l., nearly two years ago, by a person I never saw before - he gave it to me in the street, but I was to carry the money to a counting-house, which I did; I had been employed at that counting-house before, but never saw that person. I will not say whether I told Mr. Gates I believed I should know the person again; when I was waiting in his office the last time I knew it was for the purpose of recognizing the person from whom I received the cheque, if I saw him - I have not seen any of the other persons here who came in, but Mr. Gates and the man who came in last - that was the marshalman; I did not know him to be a marshalman - he was not tall: I have since heard his name is Forrester; I have seen several of the other gentlemen who came in - I do not know their names; they went before the Grand Jury - I did not notice whether they came into the room singly or not; I notice the prisoner coming in with Forrester - they came in together, apparently in company; I did not notice whether the other gentlemen came in singly or together.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Had you, on the day in question, uttered a cheque for any body but this one? A. I had not - I had my porter's badge on; Forrester was dressed in ordinary clothes, not in uniform: I have heard he is an officer - I did not know he was a marshalman; when I was called into Mr. Gates' private room, I told him I recognized the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was that in his hearing? A. No, he was not present; I was told nothing about the order in which the persons would be brought in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the people who came in, remain in the office, or pass through into another room? A. Some remained, and some went into another room; the prisoner remained in the office a while, and Forrester with him - he was called in afterwards: they might remain there a quarter of an hour or ten minutes - I told Mr. Gates I had seen the person before they went into the inner room; I believe there were two or three besides in the office - they did not appear to be clerks.</p>

            . I am in partnership with Gregory<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160091"/>Cook - we are linen-drapers, and live in Tottenham-court-road. The prisoner was in our employ in July, and for about a month before this transaction, as a temporary clerk, having two ill - he was in our service on the 26th of July, and left that morning, about ten o'clock, on the business of the firm, but I am not certain to half an hour; he went out to collect statements of account, debts owing by us, which we wished to pay; the persons he was sent to resided in the City - he had been employed in our service in filling up cheques on Messrs, Jones, Lloyd, and Co., and had opportunities of seeing me and my partner sign those cheques; our cheques are bound and numbered, consequently we should miss one if it was removed; the signature to this cheque is not my hand-writing - it purports to be my partner's; I should say it is not his - we had no occasion to draw such a cheque at that time; I believe the hand-writing in the body of the cheque to be the prisoner's- the cheque was first shown to me on Tuesday, the 27th, about three o'clock, by Mr. Gates; I recognized the handwriting in the body of it then, and an officer was left at our house to apprehend the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the prisoner left about ten o'clock on Monday morning - did he return that day? A. He did not - he should have done so in the course of his duty; he did not return till about four o'clock on the Tuesday; he was then taken up stairs by the officer, accompanied by myself - when I took him up he said, "What is this for?" I said a forged cheque had been presented at our bankers, and that he was suspected to have something to do with it, or was concerned in it; he said, "Do you miss a cheque from your cheque-book?" I told him I had not any thing to say about what was missed - that he must go with the officer; I had looked at my cheque-book, and did not miss a cheque; I then asked why he did not return home the evening before, as he knew the importance of bringing the statements, and our anxiety to balance up all our accounts - he replied that he had more to do then he could manage, and continued at it so late in the evening, and was so fatigued, that he slept in the City, to be there early in the morning; he did not name the City, but his business was in the City - he inquired at what hour the cheque was presented; I replied that he must go with the officer, and did not answer him - I afterwards went with him in custody to Mr. Gates' office: he there made a statement how he had been employed the day before - that he had been at a friend's (named Capes) house, in Panton-square, from about two o'clock. I think, till about four - I am not sure whether he said four or five.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe you have a clerk named Powell? A. Yes; I never heard that my mother or sister ever mistook the prisoner for Powell, or Powell for the prisoner; there is certainly no resemblance - my mother is very aged, and might perhaps have done so; other clerks have also filled up cheques - I have heard that His Majesty reviewed some troops on the day in question; I should certainly have been very angry if he had gone there instead of attending to business - I do not know that I should have dismissed him: it is possible: he was about a month in our service - I did not know him before.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Did the prisoner always fill up the cheques? A. Yes; I or my partner are always in the way, and the cheques are generally brought to us to sign, by one of the junior clerks, or any body who happened to be in the way - I never remember their remaining a day or two without being signed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you ever remember their being an hour or two without being signed? A. No, my Lord; I sometimes sent him verbal instructions to fill them up, and sometimes gave them personally; we have two other clerks - the prisoner was there in Powell's absence, as he was ill; Baker and Anderson were the other two - if either of them had told him they came from us for a draft, he would fill it up - the cheque-book was in his keeping; there was no occasion for a cheque of this amount to be drawn.</p>

Certainly; there were about five gentlemen in the office - Mr. Shoolbred, Powell, and two or three of Mr. Gates' clerks; I went in along with the prisoner - he walked a little way before me; I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160092"/>not hold of him - he went in first, about half a yard before me.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Were you dressed like other persons? A. Yes; there was nothing to show that I was an officer, or that he was in custody.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long have you been an officer of the City? A. About fourteen years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 26th, on arriving at the prosecutors', I did not consider myself in their employ, as their clerk had returned nearly a fortnight - I had given up all the accounts and cheque-book, which book was always on the desk, and any body had access to it; I merely went that morning out of compliment and to thank them, more than any thing else - it was known by every one in the establishment that I went to the review in the park; I there met my brother-in-law, my sister, and my wife's sister - after the review I called at a public-house for refreshment, and went to Mr. Capes', Panton-square; I there lunched, and as their dinner hour was three they pressed me to stop - I was there till the bellman rang, which was after five o'clock; on the Tuesday morning I went about the business which I should have done on the Monday, collecting the statements, and was accompanied by my brother-in-law - after going to sixty or seventy houses I returned to the prosecutors', after five.</p>
               <p>MR. SHOOLBRED re-examined. Q. Had he discontinued his service on the 26th of July? A. Nothing had passed, except a few days before, he had said, "I suppose you will not require me any longer?" I said we had little occasion for him, but it would be a recommendation for him to stop, that he could say he had been stopping with us till he could get a situation, and he remained.</p>

            . I am a bootmaker, and live in Great Charlotte-street, Blackfriars-road. I have known the prisoner about three years - we were in partnership for two years; I had frequent opportunities of seeing him write, on an average two or three times every week; our partnership dissolved on the 25th of February last - I have seen this cheque before, and do not believe it to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. It is not like it, is it? A. I do not think it bears the character of his handwriting either generally or particularly; if I was asked, without knowing any thing of the circumstance, I should say I did not know any thing of the hand-writing - I do not think it like his writing, I think he writes bolder than this: the general character of his writing is a bold free hand - this is not like his hand-writing; I can only say it is so unlike his, I should not take it to be his - I saw the cheque in Mr. Gates' office; I went there by request of the prisoner's friends - I stated so to Mr. Gates; Mr. Gates said he did not know why he should not ask my opinion at the time - I said I had no objection, and told him my opinion; I am not in business now - I have not seen him write since the 25th of February.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. How long ago is it since you were fellow clerks? A. About six years; I have frequently seen him write since - I saw him write about twelve mouths ago; I do not think it resembles his hand - the cheque is a much stronger bolder hand.</p>

I have known the prisoner about six years, and frequently seen him write; he was my clerk for four months, and left me three months ago; I had frequent opportunities of seeing him write for the last three years - I saw this cheque at Mr. Gates' office; my opinion is, that it is not the prisoner's writing.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. In what respect do you think it different? A. I think the formation of all the letters different, except the letter P, which occurs only once - that certainly bears a slight resemblance to his writing; I think he writes an uncertain hand, sometimes bold and at other times weaker - I do not think him a skilful penman.</p>

             re-examined. On Monday, the 26th of July. I was at the review in Hyde-park - I saw the prisoner there about half-past twelve o'clock; I did not speak to him, as we were not on friendly terms - he was near the Foot Guards' barracks; the park was very crowded, and I should think it would take him about an hour to get to Panton-square.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would it take three-quarters of an hour to get out of the park? A. I should think it would, it was so crowded - the roads and avenues were crowded.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live in Panton-square - I have known the prisoner about two years. On Wednesday, the 26th of July, he came to my house between one and two o'clock - he told me where he had been, and that he had seen a person who is here; he staid at my house, in my presence, till half-past four - I then went to my shop, leaving him in the drawing-room with my wife; he dined with us about half-past three - I attended at the Mansion-house to give evidence if the Lord Mayor had thought proper.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you answer the door yourself when the prisoner came? A. No; the servant who did is here; it was her duty to ring the bell for me, which she did, and I found him there; I did not look at my watch - I cannot say whether it was nearer one than two o'clock - he also lunched with us about two; I am certain I left him with Mrs. Capes long after four, and that it was on the day of the review, the 26th of July; our nurse, Hannah Stowe, saw him there.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. How long did the prisoner occupy the house? A. From the latter end of May till the 1st of March; all I got for rent was four guineas - the value of these things was from six to eight pounds; he asked me if I should have any objection to his making improvements - I said I could have no objection to that; he said he was going to make a place to put scaffolding boards in - I never saw him making alterations; I did not say he might make what alterations he pleased - he said he was going to make a shed in the yard; he let the house out in lodgings.</p>

            . I am a basket-maker. I lodged in that house - I saw the prisoner pull up the grating over the area, pull the partition down, and take the bricks away; I did not see him take down the shutters, but he made a show-board for his son with the partition, to put out in the street - it was taken from the premises, but I do not know who took it; the bricks were taken away by the prisoner, in a basket, and lifted on a labourer's shoulder - I do not know when the shutters went, but I think they were gone before; the prisoner lived there till March, and the things might have gone a month or two before - in my judgment the removal of these things could not have been any improvement.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It might be a month or two before he left? A. Yes - the bricks were removed between seven and eight o'clock in the morning; the partition was pulled down in the middle of the day.</p>

When I took the house the King's tax-gatherer came to me for 8l. 6s. 8d., which Mrs. Stevens said had been paid; I laid out 3l. or 4l. for repairs - I took nothing away; when I took up the cesspool I took up the floor and covered it - I took the house of young Mr. Stevens, and said, "It is in a very bad state, and the water stands a foot in it - I must have the privy emptied;" he said, "You must be half the expence;" I said, "Very well. I will dig a cesspool," and I took out two loads of rubbish; I began to white-wash and colour the premises; I had not been at work above a day when a gentleman said he should put a broker in for King's taxes; I went to Mrs. Stevens, and she said it was paid, but could not find the receipt - they said they would send in the course of the day; I was going to repair the tiles, but was annoyed by these things, and I left the premises.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mrs. Showler - I believe her name is Elizabeth, but I never heard her mention it. On the 10th of August I went into the cellar at half-past seven o'clock in the morning - I saw the prisoner, who was in her service, come down, there was no light but what came down the stairs; I saw him draw two ingots of brass from his pocket and place them under the stairs - he went up again; I then looked at them, but did not take any notice; at nine o'clock, which is breakfast time, I saw him go down stairs, wait a few minutes, and then come up and go out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160098"/>at the foundry door; I ran down and missed the ingots; I went out into the street, and brought the prisoner back to my employer - we sent for a Policeman, who found them on him; they are from 11d. to 11 1/2d. per lb. - there are 15 lbs. of them; the prisoner had been there two months.</p>

               <p>MATTHEW MURPHY. On the 29th of August this property was in my left-hand pocket; at two o'clock that morning I met two men in Rosemary-lane, who asked me if I knew where they could get something to drink - I said No; I then went on, and met Lyddiard, who was a <rs id="t18300916-218-deflabel1114" type="occupation">Policeman</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. How many public-house had you been into? A. I believe one or two before this - I swear I had not been to three; I cannot say what I had drank - I did not take account of it; it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160099"/>might be four or five pints of beer - I cannot say whether I had had any gin; I will swear I had not had six glasses of gin - I had not taken twelve glasses; I was not drunk - I was quite sensible; it was not because I was drunk that the landlord told the Policeman to take care of me, but there were some persons making a disturbance outside the door; to the best of my belief it was for that, and nothing else - I was sober enough to know what happened, or I should not have acted as I did; Lyddiard counted the money before the landlord, and I returned to the house - I had not been back two minutese before Lyddiard came back to the same house; I should think I left it a little after two o'clock - I had not begun drinking till about eight o'clock.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you written down the account? A. No - I considered the prosecutor drunk; the persons he first came in with were at the door - I do not think they were sober; from what I have seen and heard here I think the prosecutor has said what was as near right as possible; but I did not think him capable of taking care of himself - Lyddiard returned to the same house, and when he was accused, he said, "Come along, it is all right;" I shut the door, and heard no more.</p>

On the 18th of July I went into the Jolly Sailors public-house, Ratcliffe-highway, about five minutes after twelve o'clock at night; I met the prisoner on leaving the bar; she asked me to go with her; I said I had no money - she said never mind; I went home with her; I had my watch then - she pulled off her bonnet and shawl, with an intention of going to bed; and as I was taking off my clothes, she took my watch, which I was going to put under the pillow, and looked at it at the candle, then put it in her bosom, and said, "I will take care of it;" she asked me to give her 6d. to get a pot of beer at the public-house next door; she went out, and in a minute a young man came in; he pretended to be drunk, asked where his wife was, and turned me out - I asked him to excuse the light - I went to look at the number, and it was covered with soot and grease - I went to the Policeman, who saw a young man go over to the prisoner, and he called out that was the girl; I crossed to her, but she covered her face with her gown, and ran away - I saw her, and took her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He was very much in liquor - I persuaded him to leave his watch with the publican, but he would not; he hesitated some time, then went down to Shadwell church, and came to me in a quarter of an hour - he then went with me, and said he had no money.</p>

            . On the 18th of July, about one o'clock in the morning, the prosecutor came to me, and said he had been robbed of a silver watch and two gold keys; he took me to the door of the house - after wiping the soot and grease off. I found it was No. 22 - he described the person, who I believed was the prisoner; I went in pursuit of her - I told him to stop at the door, and I went to the bottom of the court; a man, who is always with her, came up North-east-passage - he went up the court and saw the prosecutor; he returned, and went and spoke to the prisoner - I called the prosecutor and told him I had suspicion that that was the person: he came to me and went across - the man ran away, but we came up to the prisoner; she pulled the tail of her gown over her head - the prosecutor said, "This is the woman;" she said, "I have not got it" - I said, "No doubt you know who has got it;" in going along, she said, "O my God! this man will swear my life away, I never saw him before," but before the Magistrate, she said she had been with him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor came to me yesterday, and said if he had known it, I should not have been imprisoned, as I was falsely accused.</p>

            . I am the wife of Charles Trenholm. I have known the prisoner twenty-one years. On the 16th of August, he came into my shop, which is a toy-shop; I was packing up a trunk, and I put the articles stated into it - he asked if I had my former husband's snuff-box; I said, Yes - he said, "Let me look at it;" he looked at it, gave it me back again, and I put it into the trunk - a person then came in, and I went away on business; I returned in about ten minutes - the prisoner still stood there; he said,"Your trunk is too full," and he pressed his hands upon it - it was then locked and taken to the Commercial-road, where I was then moving; on the 18th I missed this property from my trunk - I went to the prisoner; he said he had not taken it nor seen it - I sent for Mr. Bird, and for the Policeman; he still denied it, but in going out he said he had robbed me and pawned the things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where is your husband? A. I do not know - I have not seen him for seven months; I never lived in the house with the prisoner in my life - we were not very good friends; he has said some very disrespectful things of me - I was going to Mr. Shelley's, in the Commercial-road; I did not make any arrangement for the prisoner to come there to see me- I went there on the 16th, and had the prisoner taken on the 19th; he had never pawned any thing of mine by my permission - no one was present when he said he had robbed me; he called me into the parlour, and told me he had robbed me - he then told me again in the presence of Mr. Bird and the Policeman; I did not tell him to say he had taken these things as it would save my character, and I would not hurt him - my husband has not parted with me from jealousy of this man; his affairs were embarrassed - the families were unhappy, and we parted; there was no jealousy - we never thought of such a thing.</p>

One Saturday, a little before three o'clock, one of my neighbours next door, called me out, and said he suspected something was going on; I went, and saw the prisoner, who had just left one of the witnesses; I asked what he had been selling, he said a black coat; I took him back, and the witness showed me these things; I said, "I suspect you did not get them honestly, I shall take you to your father;" he said, "Don't do that, I will tell you where I got them;" he pulled out this pillow-case, and said,"Martin was with me;" but I went and brought them face to face, and proved that Martin had not been near the place.</p>

               <p>- I am a Policeman. I was on duty at past six o'clock in the evening; a gentleman said a little boy had offered him a watch for 1s. - I went down, and saw the prisoner with the watch in his hand; he put it inside the rails of Mr. Gray's garden, and sat down by the side; I asked him if he would sell me the watch - he said he had no watch; I said, "yes, I saw you put it away" - he then said he found it on the road; he began crying - I said if he would tell me who the gentleman was, and give it back to him, I would let him go; he would not, and I took him to the station-house - the prosecutor's wife came, and said it was her husband's; he then said he got it from Mr. Eden's.</p>

            . I was at the review - I saw the prosecutor; the two prisoners were together behind him- Williams turned from him with a yellow handkerchief in his hand; I seized him - he threw himself on the ground, and endeavoured to put it between the feet of the people; Quick covered him while he took it - I took him and the handkerchief; another man took Quick.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . The prisoner came to my house on the 12th of July, with a load of goods, and inquired for a lodger named Smith - I said they were both out, and I could not give him leave to bring those goods into another person's apartments, but most likely he could get a room in the neighbourhood; he said it was not many persons who would like to take him in at that time of night - it was then between eight and nine o'clock; he said he had a van of goods in May's-buildings, and he had authorized Mr. Smith to take a room to put the goods in.</p>
               <p>REBECCA FAWCETT re-examined. The prisoner had been in my husband's employ - he took him in out of charity; I had given him my key to take these articles to my apartment - he brought me the key, and said he had put every thing in correct; on the Sunday morning before the 12th of July, he told me a gentleman had been on business, and I had better go and state the business to him - I went, and while I was gone, he took every thing away from the room; he went in with false keys, which were taken from him by the officer - it was household furniture and my own wearing-apparel; I was out at the time - I came home, and slept there, but did not miss the things till the next morning; they had been in a back garret - I did not part with the property; the witness does not live in the same house - I never authorized the prisoner to take any of the goods; I lost more goods than these.</p>
               <p>JANE WILLIAMS re-examined. I would not let him put them into my place, but I went out, and he brought them in in my absence - when I came home, part of the goods were in the room, and part at the door; on the 13th the prisoner offered some of these things for sale, and I bought a bed, a looking-glass, and fire-irons - he said they were his, and he got his living by buying and selling goods.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the 12th of July I heard the prosecutrix had been robbed of some furniture - I went to the lodgings, and found these articles; I took up Smith, who lodged at Williams' - on the 13th the prisoner made a sale of some of them, and on the 14th he removed some to Luke-street, Tabernacle-walk; I found on him these keys - they open the prosecutrix's door; I took from him 4l. 11s. 5d.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutrix knew I had two keys.</p>
               <p>REBECCA FAWCETT. It is no such thing - I lost 27l. or 28l. worth of goods.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About Christmas last the prosecutor took me into his employ; he was arrested, and confined in the Marshalsea-prison, and the house in Hampstead-road was entrusted to my care - he gave orders for his property to be sold off, as it was his intention to take the benefit of the Act; his wife took a place in my name, and some goods were removed there for sale - part was deposited with Captain Orton, to be made away with; the prosecutor then made oath that he was not worth 10l., that he might get at liberty without taking the benefit of the Act, but being informed his intentions were not so good as his promises, I was determined to take possession of the property for which I now stand indicted; I had legal power to enter, as the house was taken in my name, and as I had a key, and had access to the property; I went to the prosecutor in prison - he desired me to get rid of the best part of the property, and not to let more than 10l. worth be in the shop; the goods appropriated to my use in the Hampstead-road were said to be mine, to reduce the property under 10l.; I therefore leave it to your consideration whether I had not a right to pay myself.</p>

            . There is no truth in this - my husband never employed him or authorized him to take away goods to reduce the property under 10l.; he has not taken the benefit of the Act, nor compounded with his creditors - it is all false - two boxes of this was my wearing-apparel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. For what purpose was this lodging taken? A. For the purpose of living there; my husband was arrested for 40l., and I could not keep on the house - I never could go out but I lost something, and my husband said I had better remove; he is now in the Marshalsea - no portion of the goods were sold.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you authorize him to sell it? A. No- I do not know how he came by the key; I never allowed him one - I had but one.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was not the room taken in my name? A. No, in my own - he wished me to take it in his name, but I would not; he came to us in the cold weather, and we took him in out of charity.</p>

could he but find her he would kill her; when my mother awoke I told her what I had heard - she said something to me, and groans directly came into her throat, and she immediately died; she only said one word, which was asking me if my father said it loud - she had not been in liquor at all on Saturday, not before she died; she did not at any time lift her hand against the prisoner, to strike him - she died at three o'clock, exactly.</p>

               <p>Q. Has she gone by the name of Robinson ever since the death of your father, till she lived with the prisoner? A. Yes - she was married to Rowberry at Islington church, but I cannot find any thing for it; when she lived with the prisoner she went by the name of Ellen McCarthy.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you mean that your mother's name was Ellen or Eleanor? A. Eleanor; when any body used to call her Ellen she would say her name was Eleanor.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How came you to tell me her name was Ellen? A. I thought you asked me whether her name was Robinson - she used always to say her name was Eleanor; I have been ill since last March - the prisoner provided for us all; he worked at the West Indiadocks - he had only 12s. in his tobacco-box; there had been no liquor in the room that day - my mother was in her own room all day, cleaning up; it might be between seven and eight, or nine o'clock when she went out - I do not know where she went; she was gone about half an hour each time - it was on Sunday that she told his son not to look at him, &amp;c.: he got up, and said, "What is that you say?" she made him no answer, but went down, and he after her - Ralph and Lachmere came down directly they heard her scream; we had only a few beef bones boiling for broth, for dinner on Sunday - she had nothing else, no beer of any kind, nor spirits; she had no supper - she walked out both times on Saturday, but when she came in she complained of her breast - she got up as usual on Sunday.</p>

I keep the house in which the deceased lived; it is in the parish of All Saints, Poplar - the prisoner came home on the Saturday, between five and six o'clock; I was down in the kitchen, and heard words between them, but could not distinguish what passed; I looked up stairs and heard the deceased say,"Three shillings of this is owing for rent, and what am I to do with the remainder?" the prisoner said, "Give it me, I know what to do with it;" she said "No, it is owing elsewhere, it is not yours;" I looked up to the room, saw her coming out of their room door, and the prisoner struck her - I ran up stairs, and asked her to come down; he struck her on the left side of the head with his double fist; that was the first blow I saw - I was at the foot of the stairs, and could not see whether it was violent; I ran to her assistance, and saw it swell directly; she said to him, "Oh! you rogue; Oh! you villian, here is an eye you have given me;" she then gave me half a crown, went into her own room, and shut the door - I had some conversation with her about the half-crown, and am sure she knew perfectly well what she was doing - I went into my own apartment, and had not been long down stairs before words occurred between them again, and she came down to me - the prisoner came after her, and struck her two or three times; I screamed murder - I was so terrified - I cannot say where he struck her, but it appeared to me about her head, for I stood between them to part them, as well as I could - she and I both screamed Murder! they appeared to be violent blows - he appeared in great anger - I did not notice that he said any thing; Mrs. Lachmere, came down - she took hold of the prisoner, and asked if he knew what he was about - upon that he struck her over her shoulder - it struck his wife, and knocked her down; Mrs. Lachmere fell with her - she fell against the kitchen-table, and upset it; he then kicked his wife as she lay on the ground<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160110"/>- he kicked her on the stomach, between the two breasts; that was done purposely, for I saw him look at her, lift his foot, and kick her with violence; Mr. Lachmere came down and persuaded him to go up to his own room - he went up with him - he said the quarrel had been about money - I heard him call Mr. Lachmere into his own room, and say, "Look her Lash., I have got half a sovereign, but that is owing elsewhere;" I heard no more that night - the deceased had not been into my room all Saturday, till this happened - I had seen her pass on the stairs - she had no appearance of being in liquor - she appeared in good health; I did not see or hear the prisoner again till between one and two o'clock on Sunday afternoon, when I was taking up my dinner; I heard words again, and the deceased ran down to my room, screaming violently; McCarthy followed her into the room - he struck her with his double fist; it appeared to me to be on the head or shoulder - I screamed for my husband, who came down directly - Mr. and Mrs. Lachmere came down after him - my husband took him by the collar, pulled him out of our room, and he challenged my husband to go to fight - he appeared in liquour; the poor woman afterwards got down some rags - I gave her two chairs to sit or in the empty kitchen, and there she died - I got up at half-past five o'clock; a medical gentleman was sent for, and examined her.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Was it a kick or a stamp he gave her? A. A kick.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know the deceased before she lived with the prisoner? A. yes; she had lived with me in her first husband's time - he died at St. Kitt's; her name was Eleanor; I have heard her called Ellen - she answered to both names; she passed as the prisoner's wife - she always kept to her own room; she did not sit with me - she dined on Sunday about three o'clock, in the empty kitchen which I had lent her; I do not know whether she had been out that morning - she seemed to me to get the most blows about the head and shoulder, except the kick; the prisoner had offered to pay his rent and go directly - my husband said he should have the receipt tomorrow; Mr. Natorff was the first doctor that saw her, and he said she was not dead.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did Mr. Natorff do any thing to her? A. Yes, he bled her - not above two drops came from her; he then had hot water put to her feet, and then he said she was dead - he was not present at the opening of her body.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did he not examine the whole of her person? A. he turned her round and examined her.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and a native of France. I was called in at a quarter past six o'clock on Monday morning, and found the deceased's thorax and abdomen warm - I opened a vein, and got, I suppose, half an ounce of blood; I at first did not suppose life was extinct, but put her feet into warm water, and found she was dead - I examined her minutely outside, but was not present when the body was opened: I detected no appearance of bruises whatever - I could discern no cause of death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Finding her still warm, life could not have been extinct long? A. No, but it is impossible to say how long; it might have been half an hour - I examined the chest between the breasts; there was no bruise of any kind to be seen.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing a violent kick to have been given between the breasts about noon, do not you think there must be some external mark? A. There would be a rupture of some small vessels, and an extravasation of blood, which would make its appearance at some time, but when, no medical man could tell - if the vessels are deep-seated the appearance would not be so quick; if she had been beat on the temple and swelling followed, there would have been some appearance of it - my examination did not lead me to form the least idea that she had died from personal violence: I have said, that to my judgment she died of apoplexy - I asked the beadle if I should open the body; he said he had a medical man of his own - it is usual when two medical men see a body, for both to be present at the opening.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What are you? A. A surgeon; I keep an apothecary's shop at Limehouse, about ten minutes walk from where the woman died - I never saw her before.</p>

            . I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and am surgeon of Poplar parish for this year; the beadle requested I would go immediately and examine the deceased - he pointed the body out to me, laying on a bed-tick; several people were there - I observed a few slight contusions on the anterior part of the head, a little on one side, I think on the right, and about the fourth rib was another contusion; I cannot say on which said - I did not think it would be material, as I did not conceive any external appearance could be of any consequence; I examined the abdomen externally, and on the lower part of it was a discoloration on each side a little below the navel - perhaps a little more to the right than the left; I then opened the head, the dura mater was in a perfect uninflamed healthy state - the next two membraues were also uninflamed and healthy; the lobes of the cerebrum, both anterior and posterior, were perfectly healthy- it was the most healthy brain I ever saw; I found a slight degree of inflammation in the lungs commencing, but not sufficient, in my opinion, to cause death - I then examined the abdomen, and on laying bare the intestines, I found, a little below the smaller portion of the last intestine, which covers the ilium, in the highest degree of inflammatian, and a considerable quantity of serum and some portion of coagulum lymph in the cavity of the abdomen, which was the consequence of the inflammation - the uterus was also inflamed; these are the principal appearances I observed - I have every reason to conclude that the immediate cause of death was the inflammation of the intestines; the other causes had nothing whatever to do with the death, neither the signs about the head nor the inflammation of the lungs - I had frequently seen the woman before, having attended her child on the parish ac<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160111"/>count; she was Mrs. McCarthy, and lived in Sophia-street, when I attended her - I never saw the prisoner till to-day.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the appearances of inflammation, to which you ascribe her death, have been occasioned by a blow or kick in the stomach within twenty-four hours? A. There is no doubt of it; violence occasions inflammation, and there was every mark of inflammation and the result of violence - if it had been internal inflammation the appearance would have been very different; it was external inflammation - the Coroner and Jury viewed the body as I examined.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your opinion is, that the inflammation of the ilium was the cause of her death? A. Certainly, that and no other - that intestine passes backwards and forwards in the lower part of the abdomen; it is principally below the navel; the jejunum begins where the ilium ends, but there is no fixed point of division, it is arbitrary - they are separated by an imaginary line.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not the upper part of the ilium called the jejunum? A. Decidedly not; the intestine is five times the length of the body - the next intestine to the jejunum is the duodenum, that is the upper one of all next the stomach; that was in a perfectly healthy state, and was full.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, would not a kick given between the breasts rather have inflamed the duodenum and jejunum than the ilium? A. But I observed no kick between the breasts that could not have produced the inflammation; if I had found the ilium as I did, and had not heard of what had happened, I should say it arose from external injury received in some way or other - I could come to no other conclusion; I dissected with care to ascertain if there was any hernia.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not the same appearances of inflammation have arisen from other causes than violence? A. You make me something beyond human to decide what may be, but from the appearance of the body, I judge it arose from external violence; I examined the body between eleven and twelve o'clock - I was told by a person, whom I had never seen before that, some one had attempted to bleed her some hours after death - but I proceeded to examine the body as surgeon of the parish; the marks on the abdomen were sufficiently plain to see there had been contusions - they were only slight, but the woman dying so early, the appearances would not be so plain as they might be a few days after - they would not be quite so visible at six o'clock; nobody was present but my pupil.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you informed of the name or address of any medical man who had been there? A. Not at all - if I had I should not have objected to his being present at the opening.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You confine the cause of death to the inflammation of the ilium? A. Decidedly so; blows, where the contusion was, might have caused the injury on that part - it corresponded with the commencing part of it, but spread both lower and higher; it was certainly connected with the contusion below the navel.</p>
               <p>Q. Would inflammation of that sort produce sudden death? A. That depends on the constitution; inflammation increases much quicker with some than others; the appearances I saw might have arisen in four or six hours; inflammatory action proceeds at times very rapidly; dissolution from inflammation is generally sudden; I should have thought she must have felt considerable pain in the abdomen for some hours - death from inflammation sometimes takes place previous to mortification.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not the prisoner behave in the most savage manner possible? A. Yes, he was more mad than drunk; he never gave the man that was knocked down the slightest assistance - I was quite sober; the man was taken home before the number of the cart was given; the prisoner was not one of the persons who helped him home - he went to the man's house after his cart was let go; I was at the Inquest, but I did not see him there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How do you know he did not go home with the man? A. Because I stood with the cart till the man went home; he was taken home before the prisoner jumped out of the cart.</p>

            . I am ostler at Mrs. Snow's, Manor-street. I was at the stable door, heard a cart coming round the corner, and then a person call once or twice, after it got round, but I was fifty or sixty yards off, and did not see what happened; I almost instantly heard the poor man groaning dreadfully, by which I suppose the wheel must have been nearly on him at the time I heard the calling out - I went to his assistance; the cart was stopped, and Bennett held the horse's head; I cannot say whether the prisoner had stopped the horse - I and a pot-boy assisted in getting the man off the ground, and in a minute or so a person, who I believe on my oath was the prisoner, came to him and said, "I hope you are not hurt, my friend, (or) you are not hurt" - Love was taken home; I went for a light to take the number of the cart, and did not see who went home with him - I should think the cart was not going at a much less rate than nine miles an hour, which is very fast.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was rather a dark night? A. Yes, it was half-past eight or a quarter to nine o'clock - I did not see the cart, but heard it; there were several empty casks in it - the prisoner asked the man in rather a kind manner, if he was hurt; I was behind the cart a considerable distance at the time the witness says he was knocked down.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Queen-street, King's-road. I was going up Manor-street, and heard a horse and cart coming down the King's-road from Sloane-square. I should judge after the rate of eight or nine miles an hour, and all in an instant there was a cry that a man was run over, but I did not see him at all - I went up to the cart - the prisoner then stood alongside the horse; he appeared to me to be drunk - I told him so, and he said, "I always am;" I told him he had better keep a civil tongue in his head - a Policeman came up - I asked him to take the number of the cart, which he at first seemed unwilling to do; I said if he did not I would take his number and letter - he then took it; he was not present at the accident - I told the prisoner it was a serious accident, it was more than probable the man would die, if he was not dead; he said, "What is that to you?" or something of that sort - I never saw the deceased.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose he was taken away while you were talking to the prisoner? A. He was removed a short distance; I have not offered a bet about this trial - I have not offered to bet a bottle of wine, or a sovereign - not to my knowledge; I should not like to swear I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not offer to Mr. Morrison to bet a bottle of wine that a true bill would be found, and a sovereign that the prisoner would be found guilty? A. I am sure I do not know it to my recollection - I will not swear that I did not; if Mr. Morrison proffered such a bet to me, I might give him an answer, but I was not the offerer of it - I know Morrison, an oilman; I do not think he was summoned in the Coroner's Jury - if I proposed such a bet to him, he first proposed it to me, but I really cannot say any thing about it; I do not recollect any thing of the kind - I believe I saw Morrison at Clerkenwell, and he first proposed it to me I believe; I remember it now - he offered to bet me a bottle, or I never should have offered it; I do not remember that he proposed it - he said something respecting filing the bill; I think be proposed the bet, but should not like to swear it, or that I did not.</p>

            . I am not in business - I live in New Manor-street, immediately opposite the spot where the accident occurred. Between eight and nine o'clock I heard the noise of the cart, which was very loud, as if the horse was going very fast - there were a quantity of empty barrels in it, which made a great noise; I was in-doors - I ran out immediately without my hat, as I thought a horse had broken loose; when I got out the man had been run over, and the cart stopped - I saw two or three persons raising the deceased from the ground; I sent for a doctor- the deceased was on the right side of the road, and the right hand of the cart, which was rather on the left of the road, not quite out of its proper side; it is a wide road - it had passed the man a few yards; my impression was, that the cart was going eight or nine miles an hour, but it was stopped before I got out - I went to the deceased's house within a quarter of an hour of the accident, and saw him in bed, in Wellington-street; he expressed himself in great pain - the surgeon was bleeding him, and fomenting his stomach; I saw the prisoner there, and told him his servant had conducted himself in a detrimental way to him as a man of business - when I left the house I pointed the servant out to him; the prisoner then put himself into a pugilistic attitude, and challenged me to fight - he was decidedly in liquor; he told me he was a <rs id="t18300916-252-deflabel1293" type="occupation">coal-heaver's mate</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he not in the room while the man was being bled? A. Yes; he did nothing expressive of any kindness while I was there, on the contrary - I was there about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you begin to abuse the prisoner yourself in such a manner that the widow was obliged to remonstrate with you? A. I did not, on my oath; the surgeon said it was not a proper place for such a conversation, and I withdrew.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was that when the prisoner challenged you to fight? A. No; I was telling him of his servant's conduct.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I attended the deceased between eight and nine o'clock that evening; his left hip was considerably bruised, which was the only external mark on his body - I did not examine any other part, as he complained of that part only; the injury extended five or six inches - he was suffering a great deal of depression, which is the usual effect of internal injury; I bled him, and applied fermentations - he lived till the Wednesday; the Coroner would not allow me to open the body - I asked permission to do so by the beadle of the parish; it was never opened - there was external injury, but it was impossible to say what caused the death without opening the body; I should say the injury was caused by the cart going over him.</p>
               <p>Q. Would that occasion death? A. I should say Yes, but it is impossible to say the extent of the injury without opening the body - as the man was in tolerable health before, and died so soon after, I should say the injury was the cause of his death - it must have been internal injury<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160113"/>caused by the external, no doubt; in my judgment his death was caused by the wheel going over him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you, as a medical man, venture to swear what was the cause of death without opening the body? A. I have said I could not - I can only speculate on the extent of the internal injury; I have known the spleen ruptured from the blow without any external marks- Mr. Stirling was the Coroner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not state this to the Coroner? A. He asked if it was absolutely necessary to open the body - I said it was necessary, to examine the exact nature of the accident, but not absolutely necessary to enable me to say he died in consequence of the accident; I have seen one person who burst a blood vessel, without any previous appearance of disease, and which occasioned death, but that was not the case in this instance; I have read and heard of such instances - I once saw a case in which the spleen was ruptured, without any visible external appearance; there are some internal injuries which produce no external marks.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When had you attended this man before? A. Upwards of twelve months since; he had taken no medicine since as I am told - he was suffering from asthma- that would not cause sudden dissolution.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in his Defence, stated, that seeing the deceased near the wheel he had called out to him, and pulled up immediately, but not in time to prevent the accident, and that he had paid him every attention in his power, and carried him home - that Vernon had abused him very much at the deceased's house, and had taken great pains to injure him.</p>

            . I shall be fourteen years old at Christmas. I knew Charles Wells, (who was convicted here) when in Mr. Toth's service; I saw him on Monday morning, the 7th of June, between nine and ten o'clock; he came to my mother's, in St. John's-square-passage, about five minutes' walk from Toth's - he asked me to sell a gold watch for him; I saw it - it had two seals, a key, a guard, a ring, and a green ribbon to it; he carried them in his own pocket - he showed them to me when he came into Benjamin-street; I went with him to Field-lane, and saw the prisoner at his lodgings there - I knew him before; he got his living by buying stolen property, but sold pies up and down Holborn - I took Wells there, and asked the prisoner to buy a gold watch; he asked us to let him see it - Wells showed it to him; he said he did not think it was gold, but he would go and see if it was - he took the watch with him; I followed him to the shop of Mr. Reeves, a pawnbroker - he was asked 3l. for it before he took it there; Wells had said he would ask 2l. - I said, "Don't ask 2l., ask 3l.;" I believed it was gold from what Wells said - I saw the prisoner go into Reeves'; Wells was with me - neither of us went in; he came out and met us at the top of old Fleet-market, gave us 1s., and asked if we were not going to stand something to drink; I never saw the watch after it went into his hands - we went to the first public-house on the righthand side of old Fleet-market from Holborn, and had a quartern of liquor, and a 2d. cake, which came to 6d. - Wells paid for it out of the shilling; the prisoner then went away - Wells and I called in about two hours; he was at home, and gave Wells 8s. 6d. - we asked if he could not give us some more; he said nothing to that, and we came away - we both called again in the evening, and he gave 30s. into Wells' hand; I called alone two days after, and told him that

             was caught - he said, "Never mind, he is sure to get off;" I asked if he could not give me something to take to Wells, and he gave me 7s. 6d. - we went up to where his stall stood, and I tossed him for pies; I won twelve pies for 8d., and then I stood a pint of ale in Fetter-lane - that took 1s. out of the 7s. 6d.; I bought some more things, and took them to Wells - I did not see the prisoner again.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first tell any body of this? was it before or after Wells was tried? A. After Wells told of the prisoner, and I told Sir Peter Laurie at Guildhall - it was about eleven weeks after he bought the watch; I had been taken up then.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You cannot state on what day you received them from him? A. No, whether it was June or July exactly; I once pawned my watch at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160115"/>Reeves' before, but nothing else; that had common seals to it, not worth 6d. each.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time in August did you take him? A. I think it was on the 3rd; I believe he was allowed a day or two to see if he could find bail.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I found six 2lbs. loaves in the bag; I showed them to the prosecutrix at the watch-house, and she said they were hers - I went to her house, and she gave me charge of Adam Marshall; he went on his knees, and begged forgiveness - he said he had committed an error, and robbed a good mistress.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Did you state this before the Magistrate? A. Yes; Adam handed me 2s.; I did not go into the shop; I went into the bake-house - the prosecutrix said, "John Marshall has taken out six loaves, and this man gave them to him;" I said he had better put on his things and come with me - he said,"I am very sorry, I have taken 2s. of the other man for them; here is the 2s. which the soldier has given me - I know I have committed myself;" he did not say he took the 2s. for the bread.</p>
               <p>MRS. FITTOCK. I saw some loaves at the watch-house, but I could not swear they were mine; the price of them was 2s. 0 1/2d., and Adam Marshall laid that money down to pay for them - the Policeman took up the 2s., and said, "Never mind the 1/2d.;" he said he was very sorry he had committed himself that morning; he said he had served the soldier with six 2lbs. loaves, and he had paid him for them - he begged me to forgive him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then the value of them was 2s. 1/2d.? A. Yes; it was taken from the dough-trough, and the soldier was a customer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the soldier tell you what he had in the bag? A. Yes; he said bread, but he had paid for it.</p>
               <p>Adam Marshall's Defence. The soldier was taken in charge before I knew any thing about it; if the woman had come down I should have given her the money - he used to come and have the bread out of the bake-house; I said, "Here is the money for the bread."</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty in Church-way, St. Pancras, at a quarter past five o'clock in the evening, and saw the prisoner coming along with a piece of lead on his shoulder - I followed him perhaps three hundred yards; I then spoke to him - he said he had found the lead; I said it was false, as it had been evidently cut from some other piece; after some few words, he acknowledged he had got a piece more at home, and if I would go with him he would give it me; I went to take him home, but returned, and took him to our station-house, as he had once behaved rather rough to one of our officers - our superintendent directed me to go to his lodging, where I found his wife and children - I got the key of a little girl who was nursing one of his children: I there found this other piece of lead, and these tools by it, which I presume he cut the lead with.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are there any lodgers in the house? A. Yes; I have seen him go into the house, and seen his head out at that window; I was behind him as he came out of his own court with the property - any one might have seen it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

At Battle-bridge, in the public road - they had not been using lead from the time I saw it till I went to dinner; they did not begin to use lead till two o'clock - a person named Duggin was left in care of the things, and he gave me the information - he might have had his back towards the lead while he was walking about to take care of the tools - I swear positively this is the lead that was missing, by the marks, and there was no other lead there that day; I sent three pigs that morning, and one was taken while we were at dinner.</p>

            . I was sent for to take the prisoner - he said, if we would allow him an hour or an hour and a half, he would go to his brother-in-law's, and make the money good - he asked the prosecutor what he missed - he said, about 30s. he thought - I took him to the station-house, and searched him very strictly, but found nothing on him - I searched the room, but the money has not been found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had to get up early that morning, being one of the guard of honour - I went down, and saw the bar-door open - I was astonished; I looked in, and saw no one; I ventured in, thinking some person had broken in - I had not been there a minute before the prosecutor came and saw me - I told him I had seen the door open - I had gone down to wash.</p>
               <p>JURY to JANE HONIBALL. Q. Did you lock the bar? A. Yes; and took the key up with me.</p>
               <p>ROBERT HONIBALL. There is a partition on the top of the door, which can be easily opened, but the bottom part was not opened - I afterwards found a knife would open it - he had got over the half door; the till was not locked - I think it was necessary for him to go down to wash, but not to the bar; he seemed to go down softly - I think he had no shoes on.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's employ. On the 21st of August, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the geese were all safe; there is no fastening to either of the doors of the kitchen where they were; I went out about five or half-past five o'clock in the morning; I found the pond had been dragged for fish, and I saw blood on four separate places at the end of the pond; I have seen the two white geese - one of them has a particular claw, which I had marked, as being one of the two small ones which I had kept back - I had twenty-five of them, and sent them up as they were wanted - they were dead when I saw them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is the mark? A. A hole in the claw - the Magistrate asked how I knew them; I said one had a topping on it; I said so at the watch-house, that I could swear to one of them; I do not know that I was asked about the feet - I went to prove the property; I do not suppose the Magistrate asked me how I knew them - one of the gentlemen asked me some questions - I do not know that I was asked to swear to the geese - I will not swear to the colour.</p>

            . I am a law-writer. I was walking by the shop of Mote and Appleford, and saw Ward walking away with these trousers - the two prisoners were together; Ward first put them under his coat, and then handed them to Wheeler - they were both near the door when Ward took them; they were hanging rather inside the door, and fastened by a string - I did not see them cut down; I told Mr. Pyatt of it, and the prisoners were stopped in Exmouth-street - Wheeler threw the trousers and a pair of scissars away from him; Ward was taken in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour - there was no cry of Stop thief! they ran when the officer was in pursuit.</p>
               <p>Wheeler. I was coming from Covent-garden, where I had been to buy some walnuts - he cannot say he saw me at the door. Witness. Yes; I saw him go, and ask the price of a handkerchief - I swear Ward gave you the trousers as you turned the corner.</p>
               <p>Ward. He never saw me near the place. Witness. Yes - I am sure he is the person I saw walk away from the shop with the trousers.</p>

I had known Nathan before - he had lived up the court; the reply was 40l.: I heard him say he would give 10l. for it - I came out, and met the coachman, who asked me where the lad had gone; I showed him, and then went to my own shop - I then saw Farrell join Collis; they stood opposite my shop, and looked at me - they then went together down Playhouse yard, and the coach went away; I afterwards saw the prisoners return in half an hour or three quarters of an hour, with each of them a bundle in their hands, and new hats on their heads - they went down the court, and came out again, with each a new suit of clothes on.</p>

             and his son were with me; I saw a person laying drunk - I cannot say that it was Tilson - I hired the boat of Peck, and was to pay half a crown for it; he asked for security for it, and I gave him four sovereigns - he said his name was Cook; I said the boat had the name of Sawyer on it - he said it was his, and he had bought it of Sawyer a few days before, and that he would be there to meet us when we came back; I went out, and the boat began to leak - to save myself I took hold of one of the barges, and the boat went off; a waterman came and took me in - my two friends caught another barge, and they were brought back; when we came to the stairs I did not see Peck - I came again at eight o'clock, and staid till nine; he did not come: I gave the boat to the Thames Police, and mentioned the circumstance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was Peck intoxicated? A. I cannot say - I am positive I was sober- there was a lad named Watts; I do not know whether he was sober - I do not know that I saw Tilson then; Peck was sober enough to stand, and to take my money - he did not deny having taken the sovereigns; I did not nearly upset the boat - we had had a pot of stout and two pots of ale, at Vauxhall, among four of us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was Tilson the man laying asleep in the boat? A. No; I cannot say whether he was the man laying on the stairs - the man had his face down on his knees; I have not been trying to make any money of any friend of Tilson's - I have received 8l., but I hope I shall be allowed to explain it; since the prisoners were indicted a gentleman called in my neighbourhood, and made inquiries of my neighbours as to my circumstances, and left a card, inviting me to an inn in the City - his name was Waters; I went and saw him, and we got into conversation on this affair, how near I was being drowned - he said he supposed if he were to make me some recompence I should not be above receiving it; I said No, and he said, "Here are 8l.;" since then it has been said it was intended that I should not appear.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you receive the 8l. for? A. I took it to be from some charitable fund - he did not tell me where it came from.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What were they to give it you for? A. It might be partly for my fright - I did not take it for what I said I had lost, and in lieu of my loss of time. Mr. Mellows was with me.</p>

            . I was with the witness, and not in the boat; Peck is the man we had it of - he gave his name Cook; I was on the top of the stairs: my son came up, and said, "This man wants 4l. as security for the boat;" I said, "It is as much as the boat is worth;" I said to Peck, "What is your name?" he said Henry Cook - I said, "How comes the name of Sawyer to be on the boat?" he said, "It is all right - I bought it a few days ago;" when we got to Waterloo-bridge it began to fill with water - we got back; I waited from eight o'clock till twelve, but Peck did not come.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did Peck appear drunk or sober? A. He did not appear drunk - I was not drunk; upon my oath we did not run the boat against a barge, and capsize it - we had been to Vauxhall - as we came over the bridge we had a pot of stout, and some beef and ham in the garden; I cannot swear to Til<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160121"/>son's person - there was a young man named Watts on the top of the stairs; I could not tell whether he was drunk or sober - I did not hear Peck say he would rather accompany us than let us have the boat, unless we returned in an hour; I never received 1s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you with the prosecutor when he received the eight sovereigns? A. Yes - I do not know what possessed him to think that a charitable fund gave him the money; I understood it was for what he had lost, and the danger he had run.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do not watermen lend their boats to one another? A. I believe they do allow others to take fares in them; the damage to the boat had been done in launching, not on the water.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. So a sovereign was offered you? A. Yes; I was not sober - Peck was drunk, but not so much as I and Tilson were; I was on the top of the stairs at Westminster-bridge, lacing up my boots; I never was in trouble myself - my master was taken before the Magistrate about some coals, the sweepings of some barges; I went with him - my master had a month at Kingston; I was sent home - I never was in prison; I was taken on this charge by Mr. Little - he said, "Watts, you must step into our boat;" I was examined before the Magistrate - I told the truth.</p>

On the evening of the 7th of August a Police-officer called, and produced three lengths of ribbon which had my mark on them - I knew them, but I cannot say exactly how lately I had seen them - I went to Mrs. Collier's, where Brown lived; we found Brown, and asked him who he had received them from; he said from Wesley, but did not say when or where - we then found on Brown five silk handkerchiefs, which he said he got from Wesley to take care of for him; we took Brown to the Police station; I went home - Wesley was out; we broke open his box, and found gloves and other things which are mine; when he returned we showed him the things, and asked when he stole them - he gave no answer; the officer searched him, and found 1s. 6d. in his waistcoat pocket - and fastened to his braces was a kid purse of mine, in which was the 10l. note, two sovereigns, and a crown-piece - I gave him into custody; the note is one I had received on the 29th of July, and marked it - it had been in a cash-box in the desk, but the key was left in it; we left him in the shop, making up grosses of buttons, when we went to dinner, and he said he went through the room, saw the key in the desk, and took it out.</p>

I am the mother of Humpheys, and I will be on my oath that he was very ill in bed on Thursday, the whole day; it was in July - I cannot say the day of the month; I went to work on the Friday, and when I came home, I heard he was taken - my husband is a porter at Mr. Bousfield's; Baker saw my son in bed, and he was remanded to bring witnesses, but I did not consider it would come to any thing - Baker had been out of work, and owes me 9s.; I told him nothing would come of it.</p>

I said "No - but where did you buy it?" he said, "Of a man named Blake, at Barnet;" I said, "Buy it of who you would, it was stolen from Mr. Smith, and it is mine;" I went to a Policeman, and asked if he knew the man, he said No - but did not notice the name on the cart - I said No, I did not.</p>

No, never - I did not describe one which did not turn out to be mine - I described it as a small, genteel black ass - and one was produced which had a white face, and mine was a black one - I have never seen mine since - the one produced was not like mine.</p>

             brought in this copper for sale - Mr. Benham refused to buy it, and said he had better take it to Mr. Grainge; instead of which he made the best of his way down Page's-lane - a gentleman told me I had better go after him; I went and saw the prisoner with it on his shoulder, and Lane with him - they ran off; the prisoner threw down the copper and ran through a river - I pursued the other, but lost him in a bean-field; this was about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's - I fitted this copper to the place; it matches exactly; the prisoner is a native of Uxbridge.</p>

The prisoner had worked for me at different times about two months previous to the 26th of August; when he was gone, I missed a great many tools - he had been a labourer; I found him at work for a neighbour, where he had to find his own tools - I found him going from one garden to another, with a pair of barrow straps of mine; he turned round, and tried to escape - I followed him, and took the straps from him; he was locked up - I went to where he had been at work, and found this fork and dibber.</p>

The prisoner took a lodging of me on the 19th of April as a single man; on Saturday, the 24th of July, I went out about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, returned after eleven, and found my little boy waiting at the door - I had left my wife at home in care of the house, and all this property secure - I occupy one room below, and work in the prisoner's room; this property was chiefly in the bottom room; I have four children by my wife - the eldest is seventeen years old - he was out at the time - my youngest is two years old; I inquired for my wife, and found she was gone, and the prisoner also - the prisoner's week was up on the Monday - he would have been indebted to me about 18s.; I found my place quite deserted, the drawers and every thing stripped; I went up stairs and all my things were gone - my working tools were taken off my bench up stairs; a great deal of the property is my wife's dress; but there was table-linen, pillow-cases, and five or six shoemaker's tools, which were all safe when I left, and the prisoner was then in the workroom - he had not said he was going; I could have placed my life in his hands - my wife had taken two of the children away, I could not find them; I got information from a coachman, and found her at No. 17, Penny's-fields, Poplar, on the 17th with the prisoner and children, and all the property except the bed-tick, which was in pawn - my wife came home that evening, and we have been living together ever since; she had 3l. when she went away.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You and she had some disagreement had not you? A. We had a few words through the prisoner poisoning her mind that I was cohabiting with a woman.</p>
               <p>Q. I am told you went to France and left her pennyless? A. I went, with her consent, for three months, to see if I could do better than here - that was sixteen years ago; the prisoner has poisoned her mind under the cloak of Religion - the apparel belonged to her and the two children: he had tools of his own, but these were mine.</p>

            . I am a hackney-coachman. On the 24th of July, at ten o'clock at night, the prisoner came and asked what I would charge him to go to Poplar, near Limehouse-road - I said 5s.; he said if I was not gone off the stand in a quarter of an hour, he would take me - he brought a woman and two children; they got into the coach, he got on the box, and drove to Philip-lane, close by; several bundles were put into the coach there - I drove them to Poplar, and put them down at Penny's-field; the prisoner paid me 5s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was quite dark? A. Yes - I never saw the prisoner before; I am sure he is the man - I saw him take the goods out of the coach; I did not see him use any compulsion to the woman; the goods were not taken from the prosecutor's house.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

Not till ten o'clock in the morning; I had left the room locked, and the window shut; the carriage would not allow the coach-house doors to close - nothing of yours was gone but a pair of boots; the Policeman had told me he had seen some suspicious persons about there, a few days before.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. Last Friday evening, at half-past six o'clock, I was on duty at Mill-wall, and saw the prosecutor; in consequence of his statement I apprehended the prisoners in the neighbourhood - I went to Puttick with his friends, and asked him how he had come by a boat; he said Chittell gave him the money to purchase it - I took Chittell at his mother's, asked what he knew of the robbery, and how he got the money he had given to Puttick for the boat; he said he knew nothing of the robbery, and had not given Puttick any money - I took him to Puttick, and asked if that was the boy who gave him the money to purchase the boat; he said, Yes, it was - I then asked Chittell how he got the money, but did not hold out threat or promise to him; he burst into tears, and said he got it from Mr. Wood's house - I asked him who was concerned; he said Bulmer and Ward - Chittell said he got over the back wall, broke the kitchen window, put his hand through, unboited the door, got in and broke the chest open with a mallet and chisel, and took the money; I asked what the money was - he said eight sovereigns, two half-sovereign, and 20s.; he said he had given Bulmer and Puttick 4l. to purchase the boat, and Bulmer, Ward and Puttick 1l. each beside, and spent the rest - Puttick denied having more than the 4l.; Bulmer and Ward also said they had no more than the 4l. for the boat - that Chittell had told them he found the money, and they knew nothing of the robbery; and he said that nobody but himself knew of the robbery till after he committed it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure you neither threatened nor promised Chittell any thing; did you not tell him he would be hung? A. No, I did not; he told me himself how the robbery was done.</p>

I sold Puttick a boat on the 25th of August for 4l.; he first came about it on the Sunday - when he knocked at my door Ward and Bulmer were with him, but did not interfere: he paid me for it on the Thursday - the boat laid at Rotherhithe; Ward was with him when I delivered it to him, and got into it.</p>

               <p>Chittell's Defence. I found 5l. against the tavern at Blackwall, and gave 4l. for the boat; old Wood came to me, and said if I had taken the money I had better say so, or I should be hung.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Will you swear you had seen them within three hours? A. I will not swear to the time - I put an ink mark on them afterwards - they are common brushes; I only had four of that kind - I can swear to them without the ink mark, but was persuaded by the serjeant of Police to ink them, to know they were what I gave him - I swear positively to them.</p>

               <p>Q. What makes you know it was the 7th of June? A. Because I heard the people coming after this man, and heard it was the 7th of June - the prisoner lived in Cartwright-street; he went to harvest work a few days after this - he had employed me to this job, and paid me my wages; the captain was to pay him - it was the 7th of June that he paid me, as the job was finished at eight o'clock on the 7th.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your reason for saying it was the 7th? A. Because I kept it in my head; I did not hear he was accused of this till a fortnight or three weeks ago - I knew it was the 7th of June, because we never worked together since - the Mentor has sailed; I do not know whether I went to Mass on Trinity-Sunday - I kept the 7th of June in my mind, seeing these people were after the man that night; I saw two officers looking for him about ten o'clock that night - they came to his apartment; he was not at home - I know I had been working with him that day, and thinking there might be something serious, I kept it in mind; I did not make a memorandum of it - I can neither read nor write; the Mentor sailed that night - I lived in the same house as the prisoner.</p>

               <p>HENRY DAVIS. That man was standing at the corner when I gave the Policeman information, and he said that was his jacket - that is my reason for saying I thought he was his brother.</p>

No; a pot of porter was sent for while the order was made out, for Morgan to send to King, the agent of the Melville, to ascertain if money was due to Morgan, and on receiving the answer I gave him credit; I have the note here - no more porter was drank, to my knowledge; I sent for no more: I do not know Pesman and Quicksey- I have heard of them, and went to school with them; I know where one of them lives, but was never at either of their houses; William Smith's debt was between 5l. and 6l. - Lewis signed the order on the first floor, in the room where he received the clothing; it was in an open room, not in a corner - Smith stood over him, and saw him do it; Solomons wrote the name of Morgan, and Lewis put his mark to it; William Smith and the prisoner Smith were both in the room during the transaction, but whether

             calling to either of the defendants after going down? A. Not going down, but in the room; he told Lewis not to take any clothing, as he did not want any - he did not call him by any name; he did not call them when he was down stairs - he did not call out, "Smith, are you coming," to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. And was not the answer "Yes, directly I can get Lewis?" A. Never; the name Lewis was not mentioned, or I should not have transacted the business: nor did Smith afterwards say, "Lewis, are you ready;" no such words passed - I have made loans to perhaps twenty or twenty-five of the Melville crew; I cannot say exactly - I am sure there were not fifty; I had no dinner that day - I never mind dinner if I can get money - they all three went up stairs together, to be supplied with clothes; Lewis was sober, he put his clothing on when I gave it him - he had the same jacket, shirt, and trousers on when before the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Lewis did not appear as he does now, almost naked? A. He had a frock on; Solomons saw him sign the paper as Morgan - the advances made to you came to 5l. exactly.</p>
               <p>Lewis. Q. Was I ever in your house before this occurrence? A. Not to my knowledge, but I have so many seamen; I never sent an agent on board the Melville, who advanced you 10s.; I did not authorise King to advance 10s. to him on my account.</p>

No, I never did; I never saw any Thomas Morgan at Jones' but yourself - Price was at the house on the 19th, but I cannot say whether it was at the same time as you, if any thing, it was a few minutes before - I was there when you first came in; I do not remember Jones being at dinner - I think he was at home when they first came, but I cannot speak with certainly.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you known Smith? A. Six or seven years; I know nothing against him; I knew him in the Princess Charlotte and another vessel - I know Emanuel; I cannot tell whether he was agent to Jones - neither he nor Jones received any part of Lewis' wages.</p>
               <p>Lewis. Q. Was not Emanuel on board the vessel before it came up to Gravesend, with Jones' direction on pieces of paper? A. Emanuel was sent on board the ship by me, and advanced Lewis 10s. to pay his expences ashore - he came to me subsequently, and received the balance; Jones had nothing to do with it - Emanuel was there as my servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Was I put to bed drunk in your house? A. No; you were perfectly sober, and the moment you had the money you left, and said you were going to take the Bristol coach to go to Ireland - I met him a few days after; he said he had lost his wages, and I gave him half a crown.</p>
               <p>Lewis. I was put to bed drunk at his house, and can prove it; I was robbed of every farthing of my wages in the house - King and Jones are partners - Jones' notes mention his name and address; he said his practice was, that part of what he advanced should be spent in his house. Witness. I keep a public-house at No.55, St. Mary-axe; he never complained of losing money there; he left directly he was paid - when I met him afterwards, he did not say he was robbed in my house.</p>

               <p>HENRY SOLOMONS. I wrote this inquiry note about the wages - I did not take it to King (read)</p>

               <p>MR. KING.

On the 26th of August, I saw Windred opposite the prosecutor's door, at the corner of the street, at half-past ten o'clock - he said he had a watch, and asked me if I knew where to sell it - I said No - I went with him down Petticoat-lane, where we met a man, who told us where Myers lived; we went to her house and saw her - he asked her if she would buy it - she said Yes; he asked her 1l. for it, and she gave him 8s., - she gave us each 4s.; we left the watch and came away - when he came out he saw his mother, and ran away; at night the officer came for me, but I was not at home - Mr. Brown came to me, and I took him to Myers.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean to say that Mrs. Myers ever gave one farthing for the watch? A. Yes - she did not ask him where he got it, nor did he say his father gave it to him - I did not take it to Myers; I am sure we were together - she did not stop the watch for him to bring his father; she bought it as soon as we took it - I carried the money about me, and chucked it away; there was no other woman in the room; but there was when I went back with my mother to the house; I would not have done any thing in this business for the world, if I had thought it was wrong - I forget how often I have been taken up; I was kept to hard labour in the House of Correction - it is about six months ago; I was there three months - I am now twelve years old; I was sent there because I went to a chandler's shop to buy some liquorice, and the man swore I went to steal his till - I was never committed for stealing a watch; Mr. Cobley accused me of stealing one; there were two other boys with me - we were not taken up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Mr. Cobley get his watch? A. Yes, and then he said we did not steal it.</p>
               <p>Windred. He took the watch himself, put it into his sidepocket, sold it himself, and gave me 4s. Witness. I could not take it - two boys came and called me down from my work; I then met him, and he told me of it.</p>
               <p>Windred. Mrs. Snell's girl had the watch in her hand, playing with it, putting it to her ear; he watched where she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160137"/>put it down - they went and took it. Witness. I did not.</p>

            . On the 30th of August I went and saw Mrs. Snell, and got the watch; I went to Myers', she was sitting in Harrow-alley; I told her what I wanted, and asked if she knew any thing of the watch or the boy - she said he left it at her house; but she had at first denied it; when she saw Windred she said he left it on the window, but she gave him no money - I found 1s. 9 1/2d. on Windred.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not she deny having bought it? A. She denied all knowledge of it at first; she had given up the watch two days before - I understand she gave it to Windred's mother.</p>

               <p>MRS. SNELL. It was brought by Mrs. Windred and Mrs. Nelson; my little girl is six years of age - there was a large table in front of the drawers, which I am convinced she could not move.</p>
               <p>Myers put in a written Defence stating, that Windred had brought her the watch, saying that his father sent him to sell it, and she had detained it till his father should come himself, she had given him no money, and that he was alone.</p>
               <p>MRS. JACOBS. My husband deals in glass. On the 26th of August I was in Myers' shop - I saw Nelson pass; he turned round and said to her."Will you buy a watch?" she looked at it and said," How came you by it?" he said, "My Father is in trouble, and desired me to sell it;" she said," I will detain the watch till your father or mother comes;" it was a silver watch.</p>

            . I keep an oyster-shop, in Holborn. I know Tinson, a tailor, who lives at No. 131, High Holborn - he is the son of the landlord of the Old Bailey public-house. On the 9th of September I saw the prisoner at the King's Head; we staid there about an hour, and then went to the Adam and Eve - he left my company about a quarter-past eleven o'clock; he was drunk, and no one who saw him could avoid seeing that he was so - Tinson was with us; we had a great deal of brandy and water - it was a wet night; we were all nearly drunk - I went to get a coach, and when I came back the prisoner was gone; I have kept my present shop five years, and lived seven years eight doors farther on - I have known the prisoner fourteen or fifteen years; he is a hackney-master, and has had a very good character.</p>
               <p>THOMAS TINSON. My father is landlord of the Old Bailey public-house. I was with the witness and the prisoner at two or three public-house; we parted from the prisoner a little past eleven o'clock - the house was about shutting up; the prisoner was drunk.</p>

I had a blue purse, two sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and some silver in it, to what amount I cannot tell; there was a great crowd - I stopped about ten minutes, and ten or twelve persons came behind me; when the doors were opened, I was forced against the side of the theatre - I took some silver from my purse, and intended to pay to go into the pit, but being such a crowd, I changed my mind, and thought I would go into the 2s. gallery; I was stopped - the purse was taken from my pocket; Shaw said he could not say he saw me rob any one - I said I would go, but it was my purse; I went to a public-house with Groom, and then to the watchhouse, till Shaw and Groom came to fetch me; I said,"Where am I to go?" they said to the Magistrate, as there was a gentleman had lost his purse; but Shaw said, "I am not going to swear that I saw you take it, or that it is his property;" the purse and money are mine.</p>

            . I am a Police-serjeant. I took the prisoner on the 10th of September; I said it was for a brooch and ring - he said he knew nothing about them, but in the lobby at the office, he said he could tell me all about it; I cautioned him not to say any thing to me - he then said he should not have done it but for his brother, and he had pawned them with the witness; I went and found them there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am guilty, but it was through my brother - I beg for mercy.</p>
               <p>GUILTY. Aged 19.</p>

On the 4th of September I was called by the prosecutrix to take the prisoner, as she was going to Camberwell fair - I said to the prisoner, "How came you to steal the shawl?" she made no reply - I said,"What have you done with it?" she said she had pawned it in Tottenham-court-road, at the second shop on the left hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She lent me the shawl to put on my neck.</p>
               <p>SARAH COWARD. No, she asked me, and I refused - she then snatched it off my arm, and ran away; I heard no more of her for a fortnight.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. What was the mark on them? A. The ship's name was the Latona; we did not have the entire cargo, but several pieces; the rest would have the same ship's name on it, but the number would be different - there might be some others of the same contents; I did not see it from the 1st to the 5th of July - the dock they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160142"/>were in is secured by a boom, which goes across; the timber generally floats at high water - it can be removed without loosing the boom.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Did you find the locks of it broken? A. One was a little damaged - the same feet of timber may be in one stick as another, but the number would not agree.</p>

            . I am an officer. I heard the prosecutor cry Watch! the prisoner ran from him - I stopped him with this hat on his head; I wished him to return with me, but he refused - he took the hat from his head, and said, "This is the hat I have taken from the gentleman; it is my first offence, pray have mercy upon me."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you tell the Magistrate that he said it was his first offence? A. He asked for mercy;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160143"/>I will not swear I did not say that he owned it was his first offence, but to the best of my knowledge I did not - it had slipped my memory; the prisoner had no other hat- the gentleman was not sober.</p>

I met the prosecutor with a young man, who asked me to go with him; I got on to Milbank, and he was so very obstinate I was forced to leave him - I went on and found the hat; I took off my cap, and put it on; I met the officer, who said he must detain me - the gentleman then came up without his hat, and said he had no knowledge of me, and I had not robbed him.</p>

            . I deal in iron, and live in Church-lane, Commercial-road. Last Friday week I saw the two prisoners between four and five o'clock - they brought two iron gratings and one iron curb in a truck; Sullivan offered it for sale - I asked where they got it; he said he came from Mr. Robertson, the builder, at the back of the hospital - I said, "Why does not Mr. Robertson send a note that I might know who it came from?" Sullivan said I had no occasion to be afraid - I said I would know whose it was before I bought it; Kirby then said, "To tell you the truth, we picked it up in the Commercial-road to sell for some beer;" I said they might put it into the scale, and while they did that I saw the officer, and gave charge of them.</p>

            . I am superintendent of the new works on the Commercial-road; Christopher Richardson, the elder, and a great many others are Commissioners; I know these to be ours, by the exact similarity; they are from a pattern made specially for the use of our road; Sullivan was employed on the road, but had left about a fortnight; he had been employed several months in pitching the road; he knew the road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there any private-mark on the property of the Commercial-road? A. Not on the grating- Messrs. Hunter and English, of Bow, are the manufacturers; it would be a breach of trust in the manufacturers to send the same sort of grating to other people; the pattern is not common.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Do you know of any road near the Commercial-road that has such articles on it? A. No; there is no other road undergoing any improvement.</p>
               <p>Sullivan's Defence. A man came and asked if we wanted a job - we said Yes, and we went down to where this grating laid.</p>

            . The last witness left me four sovereigns and a friend of mine wrote this paper; I gave it to the prosecutor - the prisoner brought it next morning, and said he came for the money, which I gave him; there were three sovereigns and 16s. 6d. - he had had 3s. 6d. of me the night before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He got drunk the day before, and I took him from this lady's house - he would have a cab, and sent me back for 3s. 6d. to pay for it; he then sent me back for 1l., but I could not get that - he told me to call on him the next morning, which I did; he got out of bed, and told me to sit down - he sent for some gin, and we had four half-pints one after the other; he had promised me some time before, that when he got this money he would assist me - I asked him then to do it; he gave me this paper, and told me to go and get it, and to pay him so much a week.</p>

               <p>W. L. THORNBORROW. There is not a word of truth in it - I had not seen him for nine months before; I wrote a petition for him to get re-established in the Police, where he had been before, but lost his situation; he showed me some names of characters - he had an unfavourable answer sent back; I was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>ANN CROUCH re-examined. Q. Did the prisoner come back for 3s. 6d. the same night? A. Yes; he returned in ten minutes, said the man must have a cab, and requested me to let him have 3s. 6d., which I did - he wanted a sovereign, but I would not let him have that.</p>

            . I keep the public-house. I remember seeing Sullivan in the tap-room; I remember seeing Nichols there - I do not know Corcoran: he might be there - I saw no part of the transaction inside the house: I was in the yard - Sullivan passed me, and went out at a very quick pace, with a great coat like this on; another man followed him out quickly, but I did not see his face.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Sullivan's Defence. His coat was not wet at all - he took it off, and offered it for sale to another man, and then to me; I had not enough to purchase it, and he said if I would sell it he would stand something to drink.</p>
               <p>Corcoran's Defence. He put the coat on Sullivan's back, and he went out with it - I went in about ten minutes, and met Sullivan very much intoxicated.</p>
