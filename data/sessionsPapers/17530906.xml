I turned in again and missed my drawer, with a 27 s. piece, a guinea, half guinea, and upwards of 30 s. in it, on which I ran to the prisoner's house, and afterwards to an acquaintance of her's, but could not find her: then I returned and found her at her own house. I asked her what she wanted at my house; she said she had not been at my house since breakfast time. I said I would swear she was, and that I had lost my drawer and such pieces of money. I took her up on the Thursday following, she would not confess any thing.</p>

            . I was standing just by the prosecutor at the time his pocket was picked, as soon as he said his pocket was picked, I saw the handkerchief fall, and I believe from the prisoner's hand, it fell just by his foot. The prisoner desired we'd let him go.</p>

               <p>I was going through the fair, and pushing through the mob, a gentleman said he had lost his handkerchief, the handkerchief was dropped just by me, he took me and carried me up the George yard, and throwed me into a pond, I had not a dry thread about me; then after that charged a constable with me.</p>

               <p>Ratcliff Littler. I am a comrade in the same regiment with the prisoner. On the 3d of Sept. I and the prisoner were together; he said his master had lost a punch ladle, and said he talk'd of going to the cunning man, and he suspects me: I said if he goes to the cunning devil, I'll go with him. We went to drink, he pull'd out some money, and with it the socket of this ladle; I kept that, and took him before justice Fielding, and then went for his landlord, (he looks at it, and says this is the bit I took from him.) He own'd he sold the other part for 9 s. and that he took it out of his landlord's cupboard.</p>
               <p>The prisoner had nothing to say for himself.</p>

This was at the great garden gate; the child cry'd in the road. Then I went home after that. I saw her again and observ'd her; this was about half an hour after nine in the morning; the child was sitting her crying, I said, child, do you know that woman? the child said no: I said where do you live? she said at a baker's shop: I asked the child if she'd go with me, a woman coming by said it was Mrs. Tottey's child. I took it by the hand, then the child cry'd for its skirt, saying, O! my skirt, my skirt; then I took it from under the prisoner's arm.</p>

I looked out, and said what is the matter, (I thought I saw two horsemen on the right hand wheel, but could not discern any face of any sort.) Upon my saying these words, one advanced, and said, Money, Sir! I took out what money I had in silver and gold, to the value of 40 s. and threw it into the hat of the man that held it; while I was doing this, I heard a ratling on the other side of the coach, and the gentleman that sat on the other side, said, I will let it down, meaning the coach window: the next words I heard, was watches too ; I had a silver watch, which I threw into the hat of the same person that had my money; I cannot take upon me to say these were the men.</p>

While I was taking this money, the prisoner was on the other side of the coach, and the window not being down he struck at it either with the butt end of his pistol or his whip, and demanded them to let it down.

He could not sell it, so I went and fetch'd it from him; then we discovered the thing to Rowland at the Two Brewers, and told him we had such a thing to put off, (for he had told us before, that he could put off such a thing and nobody be ne'er the wiser.) We gave it Southerland and he pawned it with one Mr. Nicolls for a guinea and half; but he gave us but 30 s. he put the 30 s. down upon the table, and we took it up between us, but I don't know which had most.</p>

I waked at three o'clock and missed my watch, I suspected the prisoner, and pursued her, and on enquiry found her in the Round-house, where I charg'd her with some keys, which I thought she had taken, but she denied them. I then asked her af the watch, and found she had endeavoured to sell it to Mr. Fitz. Henry, who look'd it up, and sent her to the Round-house.

I keep a publick-house; the prisoner came to my house on the 23d of July last, and called for liquors, she seemed much fuddled; after she had drank what she first called for she called for more, on which I asked her if she had got money to pay me; she said if she had not got money she had that which would pay me; then she called me into the back room and shewed me a watch, which I asked her how she came by; she said a gentleman's servant gave it her to pawn, I then took her to the High Constable, who ordered me to keep the watch. We advertised it, and the next day the prosecutor came and owned it, where she said that the girl that was with the prosecutor that night gave it her to pawn; then she was committed.</p>

We went and he brought out a bottle of rasberry gin and a bottle of cherry brandy, we drank out the bottle of gin, and he said he would give her a guinea to get some cloaths to make her look tight and clean: afterwards he took the watch out, and said, take this till I give you the guinea: then I went home, and she came home<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175309060013"/> about seven or eight o'clock, and asked me to go and pawn it, and I having seen him offer it to her while I was in the room, thought it was no harm to take it to Fitz-Henry's house, where to be sure I told a story, in saying I had it from a gentleman's servant.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you sit down?</p>
               <p>Joel . We did, one sat on one side me, and the other on the other, and we staid some considerable time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay?</p>
               <p>Joel. I can't tell how long.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your watch in your pocket when you was there?</p>
               <p>Joel. I am sure I had it when we went in. We went all out together, and after we were standing in the street this woman at the bar invited me to do that thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What thing?</p>
               <p>Joel. Called carnal conversation, so we went into an alley, I believe I had not carnal conversation with her, but I don't swear that; as she, with one hand was getting things in order, at the same time she with the other snatch'd my watch, I felt her lug it out, then she let go her hold with the other hand, and ran away directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you catch her again?</p>
               <p>Joel. No, I did not; the watch was stopped by a pawnbroker, and is here in court.</p>

            . This watch ( holding one in his hand ) was brought to me on the 15th of August, by the prisoner at the bar; she told me her husband was in trouble in a spunging-house, and she wanted to borrow twenty shillings upon his watch, I told her if that was the case I'd go along with her to him, and lend him as much as I could upon it; but before we were got for she began to cry, and said, if I would be easy she would tell me the truth. Then she told me, that the night before she had conversation with a man, and the watch dropped out of his breeches upon her petticoat, and she took it. I advertised the watch three times, and in about a fortnight after, the prosecutor came and swore to the watch, and that the prisoner pick'd it out of his pocket.</p>

             was my father, he is since dead; I live at Limehouse, the prisoner came to my father's house the 21st of May was a twelve month; he pretended he wanted a hat, he pitch'd upon one, and then begged the favour of my father to oblige him in changing a Queen Ann's half guinea, which was for a gentleman on board a ship, my father had some money in his pocket that he had just sum'd up: he pulled it out in his hand, and the prisoner immediately put his hand into my father's, and said here is one, my father drawed his hand back, and when he put it forwards, the prisoner did so again three times, I was not by at the time, this is what my father told me of afterwards *: I came into the room just after, and my father asked me if I had ever a half guinea; I said I'd go up and look, I did, and came down with a Queen Ann's guinea, but the prisoner said that would not do, it was much desac'd : there was nothing missed while the prisoner was there, when he was gone my father missed three guineas, he did not then miss the 18 s piece, he sent our servant and I to see for the prisoner, he was brought back, my father accused him with it directly; he asked my father whether he could take his oath on it, he said he could, then the prisoner put his hand in his pocket, and pulled out some half pence and three guineas, and another piece of gold which was not a guinea, but I did not look so strict as to observe what it was; then he said if I have robbed you of three guineas, then here they are for you, and gave them to my father, then he said I hope you are satisfied, I hope I may go; my father answer'd he was satisfied, and that he might go like what he was; after this, the neighbours insisted upon my father charging an officer with him, so he was committed for a fraud.</p>
               <p>* This here-say is not evidence, and should not have been printed; but only as it is introductory, it could not be avoided.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he acknowledge he had taken the money?</p>
               <p>E. Poulter. He did not deny it, after this he was bail'd out, and has been on bail ever since.</p>

            . I was servant to Mr. Smith at the time, and was at home, my master called me from my work, and describ'd the prisoner, and sent me and another person after him, we overtook him, and brought him back; my master charged him with robbing him of three guineas, he asked my master whether he could sware it, my master said he would, then the prisoner pulled out some half-pence and three guineas and delivered the three guineas to my master, and said, there is your three guineas again.</p>

               <p>Maxwell. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him.</p>
               <p>Maxwell. No, my lord; my master missed the 18 s. piece after he was gone, and went with me to Newgate to him; he charged him there with that, then the prisoner said, if my master would admit him to bad he'd make it all good.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I happen'd to go to this house to buy a hat, and said to Mr. Smith, Let me see one of the best hats you have, and I'll give you a good price for it, I said I'll take one upon your word; so he chose one. I said, line and loop it, and I'll call tomorrow morning for it; I said, could you oblige me with a Queen ANN's half guinea, or a guinea; he went to his chest, and pull'd out about three or four 36 s. pieces, and some guineas in gold, and said you are very welcome if there are any here, your eyes are better than mine, you may look and see; there were none; the daughter went up stairs and said, I'll go and see if I have any. She brought down a Queen ANN's guinea, I said that would not do; then Mr. Smith wrapp'd his money up in a rag as before, and lock'd it in his chest. I went away, and when I was got a good way, a boy came running after me, and said, Sir, was not you at master's shop, I said, Yes; he said, master desires to speak with you; I went back with him; I said, do you know what he wants, the boy said I don't know. When I came there I saw a great many people running backwards and forwards; Mr. Smith said, there is a little mistake between you and I; I have been looking over my money, and I miss three guineas ; I said if you miss twenty, is that a reason that I must have them. I pull'd out all my halfpence and some gold, and laid it on the counter, and said if here is any money which you can swear to, I'll be willing to be punish'd according to law, he catch'd hold of three guineas of mine; I said, what do you mean by this, he said go about your business, you have got my money; then he charg'd an officer with me, and I was committed upon suspicion. He could not rightly swear he had lost any thing. This is all the work of a person now in court, that informs against the bawdy-houses and my friends: when he took me up he said, if I'd give him five guineas, he'd let me go, and if you are trie d you'l be hang'd, I said I shall give you no money. I had no trouble about it till now, nor should have now, had I gave him the five guineas.</p>

I got them again; there was a quart silver tankard and two spoons at a pawnbroker's, and the rest sold to a silversmith; they are here to give evidence.</p>

He describ'd them to be two pale-fac'd men in blue jackets: I said I had reason to think they were neighbours of mine. There were printed bills given out of the goods lost from Goldsmith's Hall, and at the bottom of the bill was mention'd, Two pair of silver buckles shoe and knee.

Wood wanted to be admitted an evidence against Benson and this woman, and mentioned their being concerned in robberies together in the streets, and at Deptford. As we went in the street with him, he was known to be a person that had return'd from transportation before his time, so we gave no attention to his being an evidence in the year 1749. We went by his direction to Cock-Hill, where we found Benson and the prisoner, they had taken a room, and had bought some household goods, and she was putting them to rights in the house. Benson had got intelligence of us, and he was taken in the streets. We search'd the prisoner's pockets, and found four or five penny-worth of halfpence, a 4 s. 6 d. piece of gold, two tea-spoons, and a strainer, which Mr. Anderton swore to, which we took and her rings, and we took the buckles out of her shoes. When they all three went to gaol, I return'd the money, and gave them 2 s. each; she told me I knew the pawnbroker, one Mrs. Richley, and said she had pawn'd a quart silver tankard, and two large spoons there for five guineas.

            , being called on, the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor quitted the Chair, and retired out of Court. - But in order to remove the Indictments into the Court of King's-Bench, and to supersede the Jurisdiction of this Court, three Parchment Writings, said to be Writs of Certiorari, were presented to the Court, whereupon Mr. Davy, of Council for the Defendants, inform'd the Court, that he was greatly surpris'd at this Attempt, not only as the Court of King's-Bench had, on the last Day of last Term, absolutely refused to grant these Writs, although applied for by the Prosecutors, but as the Defendants had acted so very fairly as to have given them (what they were not obliged to give) Eight Days Notice of Trial, and had now near on Hundred Witnesses attending, many of them brought from great Distances, and at a vast Expence, to manifest the Innocence of the Defendants to the World. - Upon which the Person, who attended with those Writs, being asked by the Court, Who he was? How he came by them? And how those Writs had been obtained? He informed the Court, that he was Clerk to Mr. Miles, who was out of Town; that he had the Writs delivered him by Mr. Miles's Brother, the Distiller; and that he himself knew nothing further of the Matter. - Which Answer not being satisfactory to the Court, the Court was pleased to order him to take the Writs back again, to recommend an Enquiry how those Writs had been obtained, and the Trials to be called on.</p>

             was unjustly accused; but it was her's, and their Misfortune, that it then obtained no Credit. -</p>
               <p>They were Strangers, unknown to every body at the Trial. - Canning was positive, and being by unfair Means confirmed in her Evidence, Squires was convicted.</p>
               <p>Upon this Charge of Perjury great Care hath been taken, attended with great Expence, on either Side, to search this Matter to the Bottom; every Circumstance hath been scrutiniz'd, and nothing omitted to investigate the Question thoroughly.</p>
               <p>It hath a long while been the general Subject of Conversation, and hath engaged the Attention of the Public, more, perhaps, than any private Transaction ever did before.</p>
               <p>Here are the Names of no less than fifty Witnesses indorsed upon each of their Indictments; yet only one of them, a poor Woman, whose Evidence is immaterial, appears to prosecute!</p>
               <p>This Desertion may occasion various Conjectures, and many false Reasons will probably he suggested for not prosecuting these Indictments.</p>
               <p>It may perhaps be attributed to a Compromise - It may be said, that these Defendants are to be acquitted by Consent, and that the Indictment against Canning is to be dropped. One cannot easily imagine what Rumours Malice may raise.</p>
               <p>For this Reason, and to prevent any Imputation upon those who are concerned for the Defendants, I beg Leave to assure Your Lordship, and all who hear me, that the Defendants now come prepared for Trial; that their Witnesses attend Your Lordship, ready to give their Testimony with such clear, ample, convincing Circumstances, as would demand universal Assent; and fully prove, the Innocence of the three Defendants, and the Falsity of

            's Story in every particular.</p>
               <p>Here are Witnesses, more in Number than perhaps ever appeared in any one Cause, collected together at a vast Expence, and from different remote Places.</p>
               <p>Here is other Evidence also ready to be produced, such as, in its Nature, cannot deceive.</p>
               <p>The Prosecutors have been invited to meet them here before Your Lordship and the Jury; and so desirous were the Friends of the Defendants that this Matter should be fairly tried, that they have offered to bear Part of the Charges of this Prosecution.</p>
               <p>The Public hath been a long while amused with Promises, that, in the Trials of these Indictments, the Guilt of the present Defendants should be clearly manifested; and the whole of this mysterious Transaction unravelled.</p>
               <p>The Time is come to perform these Promises, and Thousands expect it.</p>
               <p>Why do all these Boaster now hide their Faces? because they are covered with Confusion.</p>
               <p>They are aware how dangerous it is to pursue a Prosecution, founded in the foulest and most daring Perjury; and wisely withdraw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175309060027"/> themselves from a Trial which would involve them in Ruin.</p>
               <p>Had I considered the Case of the Defendants alone, without Regard to any other Person, I should have thought it needless to give the Court any Trouble upon this Occasion.</p>
               <p>They are private Countrymen, without any Connections in this Part of the World, and totally unconcerned at any Reports which may prevail here : - Within the narrow Circle of their Acquaintance, their Characters will remain unblemished, let Fame do its worst; because the Charge against them is the Attestation of a Fact, which all their Acquaintance, all their Parish, and their whole Country, know to be true.</p>
               <p>But there is ONE, whose near Relation to this great City, makes it necessary for me to say thus much.</p>
               <p>It is impossible for Him to be unsollicitous for public Approbation, after having done so much to deserve it.</p>
               <p>Yet all the Reproaches which Malice could suggest to little, dark, designing Men, have been levelled at the Chief Magistrate of this City, only for doing what the Love of Justice and Humanity inspired Him to.</p>
               <p>For His Sake therefore, I have thus trespassed upon Your Lordship's Patience, and only beg Leave to add a few Words more, to shew how unmerited those Reflections were.</p>
               <p>As His Lordship was at the Head of the Commission at the Trial of 
               <persName id="t17530906-45-person421">
                  Mary

            , and was totally uninfluenced by the infamous Endeavours which at that Time had been us'd to give Credit to a most improbable Narrative; he was directed, merely by a Regard for Truth, to make further Enquiry into a Story, pregnant with Absurdities, and unlike any Transaction that ever went before it.</p>
               <p>And the Evidence of Elizabeth Canning depending intirely upon this Question, Whether the Account which these three Men had given was true, where could His Lordship so properly direct His Enquiry, as to those Places, where they swore they had seen her?</p>
               <p>The Success of that Enquiry answered the Wishes of His Humanity; and the most indubitable Proofs of the Convict's Innocence warmed the Royal Heart to Mercy.</p>
               <p>One should have thought, that this Conduct of a Magistrate, whose sole Motive to it was a Desire of rescuing a wretched, friendless, Convict, from the Miseries into which Perjury, and popular Prejudice, had thrown her, should, at least, exempt Him from Censure.</p>
               <p>But His Enemies could never forgive Him the Merit of this Action: As it raised Him still higher in the Esteem of good Men, he became more the Object of Envy; and no Arts were uneslay'd to diminish the Reputation He had so justly acquired.</p>
               <p>Had My Lord-Mayor been present, I should not have said so much; but I have been the more encouraged to it from observing, that His Lordship withdrew Himself as soon as these Causes were called, because He was pleased to think it improper for Him to preside, where any thing that might be thought to concern Himself should come before the Court.</p>
               <p>I have an Apology to make for giving Your Lordship any Trouble, where there is no Prosecution; but as the Court waits for the Return of a Messenger, and no Business is now proceeding upon, I hope I have given no Offence.</p>

               <p>Burchel. He was taken up by a watchman, on suspicion of robbing another house, and to the constable and the watchman he had confessed the robbing of mine; so they brought him to me, and he told me before them, that he and two others had got over the wall into my garden, that they found the door only fastened with a string, which they cut with a knife.</p>

I opened the door, got a candle lighted, then shut the door and double lock'd it, and we went to bed. I took the key in my hand. After I was in bed and asleep I was awaked with a sort of a noise that I thought to be the creaking of the hatch at the door; I was in a very great fright, having heard it several times, and once I determined if I heard it any more to get up; but presently I saw a light come into the room, and a man with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that man ?</p>
               <p>Cole. I can't swear to the prisoner's face, he had a whitish coat on such as the prisoner has on now,</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was this ?</p>
               <p>Cole. This was between two and three in the morning. I made a motion to arise, but my sear overcame me, so I lay in a violent fright till I saw that the man was going to reach a dish off the table in the room, upon that I jumped out of bed, the man ran down stairs immediately, and I after him; I had an opportunity to have taken him, but I did not care for that, fearing he had got a knife, so I let him get out of the house; he ran down Tower-hill way, and I call'd out, Stop thief! stop thief in a white coat! I went near the ern, where the watchman was, who told me he saw him, so he and another watchman followed him; they secured and brought the prisoner to the watchhouse. I had word brought me they had got him there, so I went, and to the best of my memory he is the man that was in the room, for I lay in bed and look'd at him some time ; he had a blue apron on, which he said belong'd to his wife, and upon observing it, it appeared to be double and was a bag. (produc'd in court. )</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing about the house?</p>
               <p>Cole. I missed three silver spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them last?</p>

There was a tea kettle and saucepan before standing on the cistern, which I afterwards found at the street door, in the inside the house. I carried the prisoner the next day before justice Richards, and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any voilence done to the key hole or lock of the door?</p>

               <p>Cole. No, there were none, the door was opened either by a key or picklock.</p>

            . I am a watchman, it was my hour to stand at Postern Row, till three o'clock; while I was there in my stand I heard the cry, Stop thief! I went out of my stand without my lanthorn, and heard a foot come padding in the dark quick towards me, I said, Stop, whoever you be. Then I took the lanthorn out of my box, after which I heard the cry, Stop thief! a man in a white coat. I said I saw such a man running. so I run round the hill after him, he turn'd towards my box again, and I took him near it and secur'd him; he put his hands in his pockets: I said keep your hands out of your pockets, or I'll knock you down, perhaps you have a knife. I call'd to another watchman, there came two, so we carried him to the warehouse. I went to Mr. Cole's house to bring him to give charge of the prisoner to the officer of the night; he told me at his house that the man which was in his room had a white cape coat on. When he saw him in the watch-house he said, that is the man, I'll swear to his coat. He looks on the blue bag, this was found on the prisoner, and a knife we took out of his pocket. Note, the knife was ground at the point, like that of a glazier's, fit to take out a pane of glass. We carried him before justice Ricards, and he committed him. As Mr. Cole said he had had a light, we went to look about where the prisoner had ran for a dark lanthorn, my partner found a bunch of picklock keys, and a wrenching iron, near Mr. Cole's house.</p>

When the clock went twelve I went my round, and knock'd at the door, which was fast as usual; a little after two I heard the cry, Stop thief! I went out of my box with my lanthorn and staff, and said, Where! Mr. Cole said, he is just gone out of my house, and gone down the hill in a white coat and coloured handkerchief, I ran directly that way; said another watchman, here he is coming this way: then I saw the glimpse of him running towards the watchman ; I run, and we got him between the watchman and I, with his back towards me. I saw him putting his hand towards his pocket; the other watchman said, if you have got a knife, or offer to draw it, I'll knock you down: then we both secured him, and carried him to the round-house. The watchman said to me, where is the gentleman that call'd out, I said it was Mr. Cole; we went for him, there was a kettle and things standing on the inside the door, he came to the watch-house and said the prisoner at the bar was the man that had been in his room, and said he could swear to his coat.</p>
