This Midwife whether to satisfie her Husband (as she now alleadges) who was very Impatient to have a child, or whether it were to preserve her credit in her imploy which she thought somwhat prejudiced by the imputation of barrenness, I cannot say, but so it was she resolved to pretend to have a Child, in order hereunto by wearing a small Pillow, &amp;c. she had perswaded many of her neigh<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16770601006"/>bors that she was great, and about a week before her pretended Labour enquired very earnestly of a poor Woman if she could not help her to a young Child as soon almost as born, either alive or dead, For says she there is a Lady whose husband will not live with her because she never had a Child, and he is now in the Country and if I could get a Child, I should do a good office in rendering love between them, and get something my self, but this Woman as she now swore, refused not knowing how to assist her; whereupon it seems she applied her self to the two searchers of Whitechappel, who having gratified her extravagant  desires, on the <rs id="t16770601-6-cd25" type="crimeDate">18. of April</rs>

Murder! Which raising a further suspicion in the woman, she did at last take out of the Bed a cold naked dead Child, which had, as appeared, been wrapt up in a Cloth, and seemed to have been a day or two old; whereupon she told the Prisoner this could be none of her child, who wickedly replyed with a horrid Curse and Imprecation on her self, if it were not her own child, born of her own body: However, Neighbours being called, several sober Matrons now deposed, that having searched her, they were confident she had no child at all, and that this was some other persons child, &amp;c. The Prisoner being demanded where she had the child, declared of the <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16770601007"/>two Searchers, which they being called to the Bar acknowledged, and that they brought it to her the same day, and had 20s. being promised 9l. more: That they had it on Saltpeter Bank.
