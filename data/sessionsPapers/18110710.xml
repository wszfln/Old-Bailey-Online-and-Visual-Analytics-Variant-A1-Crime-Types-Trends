            Did you at any time miss any articles or your property - A. Several times. On the 12th of June I returned home about six o'clock in the afternoon, and in consequence of information I received. I waited till the prisoner returned home; I then him I had been informed that he had got two pocket books and desired him to produce them. He told me that he had returned them from whence he took them. I knew that to be the case, I had taken them from the drawer into the accompting-house prior to my speaking to him. I said, these are the two pocket books that you took, he said, well master I returned them from where I took them from, and I hope you will think no more about it. As I had frequently missed things, I thought it right to have the business investigated; I sent for an officer, he came, and the prisoner was taken into custody. I sent another officer to his lodgings.</p>
               <p>- SHERRARD. I am warehouse man to Mr. Openheim. On the 12th of June, I sent some goods out of my master's warehouse. As the prisoner was loading the truck, he stooped forward to speak to me, two pocket books sell out of his bosom; I asked him how he came by them, he answered that they were given him by Mr. Foudriner, our stationer. He took them up and replaced them in his bosom; I informed my master I knew they were Mr. Openheims property as they lay upon the ground, they are a particular make.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them pocket books afterwards - A. Yes, I saw them in the drawer afterwards, and I saw Mr. Openheim take them out of the drawer.</p>
               <p>- WOODROW I am extra officer for the City. I am a warehouseman to Mr. Openheim. On the 12th of June, in the evening, I was sent to the prisoner's lodging, in Hun Alley East Smithfied.</p>

            Do you know Mr. Openheim's warehouse - A. Yes, it is in the County. When Mr. Openheim told me that he had been robbed by the prisoner, I apprehended him. The prisoner acknowledged that he had taken these two bill cases for a friend, he was sorry for it, he did not mean to make a property of them I then whispered to Mr. Openheim to dispatch some body to his lodgings before the wife went to his lodgings. I had these two pocket books at the time, I had received them of Mr. Openheim; when I had lodged the prisoner in the Whitechapel watchouse; I returned to Mr. Openheim's house; he said he had dispatched some body to the prisoner's lodgings, and as we were going to East Smithfield, we met Woodrow, with these thread cases and the sponge He delivered then, to me; they have been in my custody ever since.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether the door of that bed room was fastened or locked - A. There were two doors to the bed room, one door was in constant use, the other door was always kept locked, both the doors were locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoners, had you seen them before - A. I saw Ibbotson and Symons, about three o'clock that day, and I saw Michell with them, about seven o'clock in the evening, they were all three together then when I saw them, they were in the ground belonging to the house, playing at bumblepuppy.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that - A. A game that they play with balls.</p>

               <p>Q. What were the two others doing from three o'clock - A. I do not know, they had a pot and a pint of beer, and a pint of gin; I saw Mitchell in the tap room once, I did not see him after the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mitchell do in the tap room - A. He was smoaking a pipe and had a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the others at that time - A. I do not know.

I shall know the things when they are produced. Ibbotson and Symons were at my house the day before; they came there together.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH HALL. I am a servant to Mrs. Cooper. On the afternoon on 28th of June, about five o'clock, I saw the prisoners, they were playing at bumblepuppy.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time did they go away - A. About nine o'clock, it was just duck.</p>
               <p>Q Did you hear any conversation among them - A Yes, about four o'clock, in the yard, they were all together; Ibbotson said he would lay any thing that the old woman was worth money, it was said when I was cleaning the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember one of the lodgers coming down that evening - A. Yes, about a quarter after nine, I went up immediately, and saw my mistress's door was open, and the drawers; I went down and told her directly.</p>

               <p>Q. There were two doors to that bed chamber - A. Yes, and the one that was never used was the door that was forced open, that door was always kept locked, and the other door was always locked except when we wanted to use it; when I went up stairs the door was open and all the drawers were open.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before you went up had you seen the door - A. About three hours before I had been up. The door that was always used was locked, I had locked it before, and I gave the key to my mistress; I had not had the key after that, and before I locked the door, the drawers were all shut.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went up afterwards and found the door open, could you distinguish in what manner it had been opened - A. It had been forced open, and the door was open, and the bolt of the lock was shot out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what had been in these drawers in that room - A. Yes, I know what I put in the drawers in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the drawers when you went up - A. I ran and got a candle, I examined the drawers, and there were several things gone.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are sure you saw all the three prisoners playing together at this game at the back part of the premises - A. Yes, I saw them altogether in the yard, about five o'clock.</p>

            , I am one of the Bow-Street, patrols. On the morning of the 29th of June. I saw Ibbotson, about twenty yards before me, in Drury Lane, with this bundle under his arm; I ran after him, and till I got within three or four yards of him, then I slackened my pace and watched him; I followed him to the Cock and Magpie, in Drury Lane, I followed him into that public house, he went in alone, the other two men, and a woman were at a table and seemed to be casting up something with chalk figures, the figures were chiefly 6 and 8, it did not in all exceed a pound. Ibbotson shoved the bundle up in the corner of the bench.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the others sitting upon the same bench - A. Yes, they got up and endeavoured to conceal it. Mitchell and Symons got up; they put their back towards it and their faces towards me. I then told Ibbotson, I must see what that bundle contained. One thing I omitted, Ibbotson had a leather apron on, he took it off, and gave it to Mitchell as soon as he came into the room, and Mitchell tied it round him. When I asked Ibbotson for the bundle, he said it does not belong to me it belongs to that man, pointing to Mitchell; Mitchell then jumped up and began to shuffle about the room and wanted to go out; I then told him he must not go out, I will shoot the first man that went out of the room; he then said he wanted to go to the privy, he said I might go with him; I replied you shall not go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181107100005"/>cut at all. I am going to take you to Bow-street; he then said, d - n my eyes if I will go to Bow-street, and jumped out of the window. Stanley, was with me; I said to Stanley, fetch him back again. Stanley fetched him back again. Before he got out of the window I took this stick off the seat where he sat; I stood it up against the edge of the door, and when he came in again he moved it to another bench on the right-hand side of the room. I searched Mitchell, and found on him, two keys, and a room door key a knife, three one pound notes and a watch. I returned him the notes and the watch. I searched Ibbotson, and found a pawnbroker's ticket on him, and a knife On Symons, I found a knife that is used in house breaking, a hunting watch, a dollar and a pair of earrings; I kept nothing of his but the knife. I looked round the bench were the stick was put, these three keys were laying on the stick as though they were all layed down together. They are two skeleton keys and one parlour door key. I examined the bundle, and then sent to Mrs. Cooper; she came and owned the things. I had received information the night be fore that her house had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing produced by the landlord of the house - A. Yes, another picklock made on purpose for opening room doors was produced by the landlord, his name is Day.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about the persons of the prisoners - A. None at all, I knew them before. The bundle has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You know there are three forty pounds reward in this case - A. I think if there is any reward, I am entitled to it.</p>

About twenty minutes before ten, in the evening, my wife and servant were in the shop, I was in the kitchen; I heard the breaking of a window, I ran up stairs directly; I observed both my wife and servant out side of the door, and as I passed the window I observed it broken, and my servant said the window was broken and some handkerchiefs were stolen out of the window; I saw the broken glass in the street. I pursed, but I did not see the prisoner untill he was stopped; he was taken to the watchhouse, I returned home to see what I had lost. I found I had lost two silk handkerchiefs. I took my servant Adamson to the watchhouse; she identified the prisoner. The handkerchiefs have never been found.</p>

I was in the shop talking to my mistress when the window was broken, the candles were lighted, it was not quite dark when I heard the glass break; I ran out of door and saw the prisoner draw the handkerchiefs out of the broken square; I cannot say how many, nor what he did with them; I called out to my mistress, the man ran away, and I ran after him; he had the handkerchief in his right hand, behind him; I could not see what he did with the handkerchiefs; I called stop thief; he ran down Chandois Street, and I went home; in about half an hour afterwards I saw the prisoner in the watchhouse, he is the same man that I saw drawing the handkerchiefs out of the window, they were silk handkerchiefs.</p>

I asked the prisoner and the other man if they knew where there were any public houses open; they said they did; they took me to two public house, I drank at both of them; I am a stranger here, I cannot say what streets I was in, and from the last public house I went into a shoemaker's shop to buy a pair of shoes; the prisoner and his companion went with me; I bought the shoes, and pulled out the notes that I had in my pocket. I got them from the Commissioners yacht the day before that, I had two five pound Bank notes, and the rest in one and two pound notes; they were all wrapped up together.

            . I am foreman to Mr. Fennell, 38, Shoreditch; he is a shoe-maker; in the Parish of St. Leonards, Shoreditch; he keeps a shop there, the shop is part of the house; he is the house keeper. On Thursday, the 20th of June, about a quarter to nine o'clock the prosecutor and two persons with him came into the shop, the prisoner was one of them; the prosecutor asked for a pair of shoes, I served him, they came to eight shillings and six-pence; he sat upon the edge of the counter; he pulled out a piece of rag from his fob pocket, and in his rag was a liberty ticket, two five pound Bank of England notes; I saw them at the time. He said give me change of a five pound note; the prisoner said, what do you want change for a five pound note when you have got a two. The prosecutor said what his that to you, what do you follow me about for, I think you are a thief, I do not want any of your company, and go about your business. And the prisoner made himself so intimate that I thought the was his shipmate. I took the five pound note as he insisted he would have change. I went to my employer and asked him for change; I gave the prosecutor a two pound notes two ones, and eleven shillings and sixpence in silver. The other notes laid on the counter under his guard, as if he was protecting them to fold them up again. When I brought him the change there was one of our curriers in the shop; I gave him a look, to mind what I did; I said, here is your change; he said how much have I got now; I said there was eight pound eleven and sixpence; A five pound note was gone; he said I told him there were fourteen pounds, I said I did; he said he was robbed; I said to the prisoner, where is your partner; he had ran away, he said he knew nothing about him; I said to the prisoner, you d - nd rascal you have robbed this man; he said, me; do you think that I would do such a thing. He put his hand over the counter; I catched hold of his wrist, and turned it up; there was the five pound note clinched in his hand; I opened his hand and took it from him; it was folded up then very small; I opened it; it was the five pound note; I said before I opened it; it was a five pound note, my suspection it was as he had it in his hand that it was that note, and it was a five pound note. Two City officers were coming past; I gave the five pound note to one of them and the prisoner to the other. The prosecutor was intoxicated; the prisoner was quite sober.</p>

I looked in the window and saw the last witness give the sailor change for a five pound note. The prisoner came out and stood along side of me at the window; the sailor was in the shop; the prisoner went in again, and the other man that was with him came out and went away. I heard the sailor make a noise about the notes. I saw the prisoner coming out of the shop with Smith, the officer. Mr. Trotter gave me this five pound note, I have had it in custody ever since.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Thursday, the 20th of June, about four o'clock in the morning, I was in company with a young man, we were going to Billingsgate, to seek employ; in Bishopsgate Street we met the prosecutor; he alighted from a post chaise, and enquireed of me to take him to a house, to get some drink. We all went to a public house in Leadenhall Market, and continued drinking there upwards of an hour and a half; the Prosecutor being the worse for liquor, prevailed upon us to stay with him, and when he found himself refreshed; he went with us to the Four Swans, to book his place, leaving at the office his new clothes; we afterwards went to another public house, drank four pots of ale, and four pots of porter; he gave me a shilling to buy some chops, he want into a hoster shop, to purchase stocking, from there to a shoe warehouse in Shoreditch, and bought a pair of shoes, for eight shillings and sixpence; he took from his pocket the Bank notes, holding the notes in his hand; he exclaimed he had been done; the other young man went out, and upon looking about the counter, he found the note in question among some papers; some altercation taking place, two officers came in, whereupon I was taken in custody, and fully committed to trial. I most solemnly declare myself innocent.</p>

            . I live in Pell-street, Ratcliffe Highway. The prisoner came with a man that passed as man and wife to take a lodging at my house about six weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember her sleeping from her lodging any night - A. Yes, on Friday night, the 7th, the night that they mentioned; she came home on the Saturday, the next day, and had something for dinner, and went out again, she said she had business to do. About nine or ten in the evening she came home again, the first time that she came she brought change of a one pound note, she said she had no pockets on, she asked leave to lay it on my table.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see whether she had any more at that time - A. No, not at that time; when she came home in the evening, between nine and ten o'clock at night, she brought in change for another pound note, she brought a person in with her, she called her Betcy; they sat down in my room, and talked about some notes that the prisoner had in her pocket, and Betcy asked the prisoner if she had not got a five pound note; she said, what is that to you; afterwards I saw her bring out three or four notes, but I did not see a five pound note; she took them out of her bosom to look at them, and put them into her bosom again.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she sleep that night - A. Her husband would not let her in the room to sleep with him, and I let her stay in my room all the night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of her having been taken ill on the Friday - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. While she was in your house was there no complaint of illness - A. A little too much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the husband the first night that she slept out - A. He slept at home in his own lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the husband - A. He is a day-watchman in the New London docks.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you ever seen any money or notes in the possession of the prisoner before that - A. No, never. On the Friday morning before she went out she asked me to lend her sixpence; I lent her sixpenny-worth of halfpence. On Sunday she told me that she had paid all her debts in the neighbourhood.</p>

             I am a police officer. I apprehended the prisoner on Monday the 10th of June, on searching her I found this box in her pocket, a one pound note was in it, and eighteen shillings in silver. Under the bed, in this pocket, I found two one pound notes, and a two pound note, and laying upon the table in the room I found to the amount of one pound, and two shillings in halfpence, all in papers. There were a pair of old pockets which Mrs. Gregg's servant found, the prisoner claimed them; in the pockets there were fourteen-pence.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Should you know the notes if you looked at them - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The first thing I have to say if it meets with your lordships approbation, I ask for the money that was taken from me, and the next thing is, I am indicted by Mrs. Johnson, which I presume to be her name, her husband is a Dutchman I believe, he is master of the Alexander. She requested me to go down to the Docks to see her, and at the time I called upon Mrs. Rusk, where I had before seen Mrs. Johnson. I found she had removed; I went to her lodgings, I was not very well, Mrs. Johnson behaved in a very discreet manner, and I staid there for the evening, and this young woman came in, and agreed to be her servant for her board, and so much a week till Mr. Johnson came home. In the morning I got out of bed, Mrs. Johnson gave me a shilling, and asked me to get something to drink. I went down to Cannon-street, the wine-vaults was not open. I went to three different places before I found a wine vaults open; I went home; she said, you take a little, and I will, and we will lay down again. That was done. In the morning Mrs. Johnson asked me to come down and take a cup of coffee; I did. I then said, as I have been out all night, which I ought not, I will go home. I went home in the course of the afternoon, Arnott would not let me come in, this lady said I was welcome to sit in her room all night. I am in the habit of receiving every year thirteen pounds four shillings and eight pence; I was asked from where I got it; I said I would rather stand by the consequence than send for the person that allows it me</p>

            . On the 28th of June I was sent for to Mr. Carter's house, and there the prisoner was in the parlour. He was porter and warehouseman to Mr. Carter Mr. Carter asked the prisoner how much he had robbed him off; Mr. Carter said he supposed he had stolen a hundred pounds worth of property; the prisoner said he had not robbed him to that amount. He asked him to what amount he had robbed him; the prisoner replied, he supposed about fifty pounds. Why, said Mr. Carter, what have you done with the money. He said that part of it was in the drawer at home, in his house; Mr. Carter asked him what he took out yesterday, he replied two pair of breeches, and he carried them out in the crown of his hat, and that they were then at his house. He then begged for mercy, and said his house was in Merman-street, Commercial-road, and if Mr. Carter would forgive him he would sell all his property, and make restoration. I went to Merman-street, and there I found the other prisoner, his wife I asked her for the breeches that her husband brought home, she denied any knowledge of it. I asked her where the money was that she sold the last lot of things for to the jew Phillips, she denied any knowledge of that. I told her I must search the premises, and began to do so; she then said to Mr. Carter, she hoped he would be merciful, the things were in the other room; she went with us into the other room, and opened a box, and said the breeches were in the box, in that box I found the two pair of breeches, and in the third drawer of a chest of drawers she said I should find the money that the goods were sold for, and in a small box in that drawer I found fifteen pound in notes, and in the bottom drawer I found another pair of breeches.</p>

I hardly had time to speak when he had got my pocket book out of my inside breast coat pocket. I held him for a time, he scuffled and got away from me. I cried stop thief, he ran across the street, a man catched him by the collar; I was close to him all the time, and never lost sight of him. I saw the pocket book in his hand just as he got from me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with your pocket book - A. That I do not know, I have never recovered it. I thought the first man that catched him got the pocket book, he did not like to come forward to prosecute; he came with us to the watchhouse but refused to come forward to prosecute.</p>

               <p>Q. What were his words - A. Damn you, what did you strike me for.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you struck any body - A. No, I was going peaceably along. He put himself in an attitude to strike me; I turned my hands in a sort of defence, and told him to go along; he went, and I expected I had got rid of him. In a minute afterwards he came up again, turned me round, and made a snatch at my seals; the chain broke, and the seals came off.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. I had two small glasses of whiskey with a friend, I knew what I was about. When he snatched at my seals I prevented the watch from going by putting my hand upon it. He took the seals, I pursued him immediately, and of course he was taken in about a minute afterwards. I did not lose sight of him, he turned down Old Bethlem; he was taken before he got to Sun-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find your seals - A. No; I fancy he throwed them away in the pursuit. I looked for the seals afterward, I did not find them. I can swear positively to his person that he is the man that snatched the seals.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Saturday evening was Bow-fair - A. It was. I had been spending the evening with a friend at Walbrook.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 9th of June, between twelve and one, I was coming into Bishopgate street, the prisoner was standing with his back towards the road, and his face towards Bishopsgate church-yard; the moon shone very bright, I could discover him two or three yards off. The prisoner ran up against the prosecutor, and said, d - n you, how dare you strike<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181107100011"/>me, I am one of his Majesty's subjects.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he strike him - A. No, there were a great many words: I crossed over and said to the prisoner, how could you think of taking advantage of this-man, he is rather in liquor. The prisoner put himself in a fighting attitude, he did not strike him; the prosecutor said, my good fellow, I have nothing at all to do with you, he pushed him away, and went on. The prisoner came along with me, I tried to make up the matter, I did not know either of them, and just as I got from Bishopsgate church-yard there were two women standing, then the prisoner left me. He ran up to me a few minutes afterwards; he said he thought to take one of them bloody bitches home with him, but there was a man with them. Then I was afraid of him; he viewed me all over, he darted away from me, and ran towards Mr. Bolton; when he came up to him he gave him a turn round, he snatched the bunch of seals, I do not know how many there were, only there was a bunch, which he got from him, and ran away; Mr. Bolton called out immediately. I was in the road. The prisoner was stopped before he got to Sun-street, I am sure the prisoner is the man, he walked with me several steps before he came up to the woman; he was taken to the watch-house; Mr. Bolton catched hold of me by the arm, and insisted upon my going into the watchhouse. I left the prisoner then, and Mr. Bolton, and I never saw him or the prisoner until last night, Mr. Bolton called on me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. You said it was not right the prisoner should take advantage of a man that was in liquor - A. I certainly did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you think the seals were gone before he put his hand there - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. The snatch was made before he put his hand there - A. Of course it must.</p>

            . Q. Do you remember the prisoner at the bar coming to your house on Saturday the 8th of June - A. Perfectly well, about seven o'clock in the evening; the prisoner Blott came in first, the old lady followed her, and then King followed the next: they came in company together. Blott called for a pint of ale, they drank the best part of the ale down. Blott asked leave to sit down in the bar till such times that Mrs. Lloyd came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mr. Lloyd - A. Yes. I knew him some time; I permitted them all three to sit down in the bar, they sat two or three minutes, then Blott, and her mother Walton said they would go and see where Mr. Lloyd was, as he stopped longer than they expected; they went out, leaving King behind; they returned in about three or four minutes; in the course of that time I was called into the parlour to receive some reckoning; I let the bar, and left King in the bar only. They returned with Mr. Lloyd, and then the prisoner King immediately left the bar and went out into the tap-room, into the street. The prisoner, Mrs. Blott, and her mother, Mrs. Walton, informed Mr. Lloyd that they had a pint of ale; he said he would pay for it; they said they could not wait, they were both in a hurry; they both immediately quitted the bar. Mr. Lloyd paid for the ale; he followed them. I did not see any thing more of them till the next morning I sent for Mr. Lloyd.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you miss your money - A. The same night, between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How much property did you miss - A. Thirty-six guineas in gold.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it - A. In my coat pocket hanging over a chair in the bar, it was in two bags, the inside bag was a silk bag, and the outside a brown canvas. On the Sunday morning I sent for Mr. Lloyd, I told him I had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mr. Lloyd - A. He is clerk to a coal merchant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your money again - A. No, I have not found it again.</p>
               <p>Q. While Blott and Walton were there you were in the room - A. No, not the whole time; they were in the room, because I served some customers in this parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. They went out leaving King alone - A. They did.</p>
               <p>- DICKENS. I am an officer. I apprehended King in Red Lion street on Sunday the 9th of June, I took her to Covent Garden watchhouse. She had nothing about her but a few halfpence. She told me she threw the two purses away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make her any promises - A. No. I asked her where the guineas were, she said thirty guineas were at the Blue Last public house, Ludgate<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181107100012"/>Hill, she had got notes for them, and the notes were given to one Mr. Slyfield, that keeps a wine vaults in Brook's Market there I went I found two tens, eight one's, three guineas, and three half crowns.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say what she had done with the other six - A. She said she had bought a bonnet out of the other and spent it; I went to Mr. Barker the publican, he told me he had changed, the guineas, Mr. Slyfield has got the notes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. Did not Blott desire you to come - A. No. Mr. Harding sent for me.</p>
               <p>Q. That was at the instigation of Blott - A. I believe it was, because Blott went down with me to Mr. Coombes.</p>

               <p>MR. BARKER. Q. You live at the Blue Last - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner King coming to your house - A. I do not; she was a total stranger to me, I never saw her before.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you give them notes to the person that brought you some money change - A. I can swear to them notes in particular, I always put my name on the notes I receive.</p>
               <p>King's Defence. On Saturday as I was taken on the Sunday I met this lady, I had not seen her some time before; she invited me to dine with her, she said she was going to meet her husband on the Saturday evening we went into Mr. Coombe's house, which I never saw before, we went into the tap-room, Mrs. Blott objected to sitting in the tap-room, and we went into the bar, and when Mrs. Blott and Walton went out of the bar I was left in; I never took it out of the bar, it was laying on the floor, by the bar door; when they returned Mrs. Blott said, as I did not wish to see Mr.

             I had better go, I picked it up on the threshold, when I went away I went to look at them, thinking they were halfpence, but they proved to be guineas. I at first thought they were counterfeits. As for stealing them I never did in my life. The old lady has no concern in it, she is perfectly innocent, and so is the other.</p>

            . I am a fishmonger, I live about twenty yards from Lord Uxbridge. On the 7th of June, between twelve and one o'clock, I was standing at my own door, I saw the prisoner, I observed him picking up a spoon, and I heard it fall, Mr. Goodman, who was with me, seized him. We went to Lord Uxbridge's, and asked the porter whose spoon it was; I cannot say whether the prisoner heard me or not; I looked round and saw the prisoner was gone; I cannot say how he got away. This is the spoon that I heard drop from him and which I saw him pick up.</p>

On the 8th of June, about half past eight in the evening, I saw the prisoner lurking about the shop a long time before he came in and exactly at hall past eight he came in, and took this spoon out of his pocket, and wanted five shillings on it; seeing the crest upon it, I asked him how he came by it; he informed me that he found it upon a dust heap. I detained him, and sent for an officer.</p>

             Sturt, I have lived with her six years, in Upper Seymour Street.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name of her husband - A. Charles Sturt.</p>
               <p>Q Do you know the prisoner, did he ever live in her family - A. Yes, a year and ten months, as footman; he left her service on the 20th of June. I was with the officer when these things were found; I looked at them all; the whole of the lace is hers; I had it under my care; I am not at ail a judge of the value of the lace. The tablecloths are the lady's property, and the cabinet; the tablecloth may be worth two or three shillings each, and the napkins a shilling each; I am a judge of the value of the cabinet, some of the things were missed before the prisoner left the service, and many of them afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q You cannot speak of any particular thing to any particular time - A. No, these silk handkerchiefs and muslin handkerchiefs, muslin aprons, a muslin gown and many other things, are mine; they have been all worn, they may be worth a shilling each.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they missed at any particular time - A. No, I cannot speak to any particular time when these acre taken away.</p>
               <p>

            There is no single article of the value of one guinea perhaps - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. He lived in the family near two years, and if he had been evil minded enough, he might have taken them away one one day, and another another - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence so his counsel, and called no witnesses to character.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 17th of June, I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody, about half past eight in the morning I apprehended him. I found him in the custody of Mrs. Clark, she accused him of taking the watch; he struck her on the breast, and jumped out of the window; I brought him back to the prosecutor's house, and while I was searching him, the wife came in, and said, here is the duplicate and the money, let my husband go. In taking him to Tothill Fields, I told him, I thought he had made a foolish job of it; he said he was drunk, or else he should not have done it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called two witnesses who have him a good character.</p>

On the 7th of June I went out to work, about half after four in the morning; I had left my things safe in my box, and the box locked; I locked my room door, and put my key of the room door under the landlord's door where he slept. They sent for me home between eight and nine in the morning, I found my room door unlocked, and my box broken open; I missed out of my box, a blue coat, two pair of breeches, two shirts, three pair of stockings, five towels, and six handkerchiefs. I found one shirt on the prisoners back the same morning he was at Bow-street.</p>

On the 6th of June, in the morning, I met the prisoner with my mare, on the Kentish Town Road; he was leading the mare towards Town. I had the mare before that at a field at grass, facing St. Giles's burying ground. I met him upon the road, leading the mare away. The prisoner let go the mare before I came to him I looked at the mare to be sure it was mine. He left the mare in the road; he said it was a moon light morning; he was leading the mare with an alter; as soon as he saw me he ran away across the road; we took him to the watchhouse. I am sure it was my mare. After we had taken him to the watchhouse, we put the mare into a field.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the field whether the gate was open - A. There was a gap in the fence that a horse might escape through. The prisoner denied taking the mare out of the field but it was a man with a brown coat on.</p>

            . I keep the Weavers Arms public-house in Hay's-court, St. Ann's parish.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember receiving a quantity of silver at any time of Edwards - A. Yes, on Friday the 6th of June, about half after nine o'clock in the evening; the silver was tied up in a cloth; he counted out the silver on the table before he tied it up; there were eleven pounds worth of silver; there were a good many dollars, I do not know how many. I was to keep it, and his brother was to call for it the next morning; I put it in the till in my bar; at twelve o'clock I told my wife to take it out of the till to take it up stairs; I saw my wife take it out of the till ten minutes after twelve, I looked at the clock at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she do with it when she took it out of the till - A. She put it on a small box by the side of the fire place, then she went to get some warm water, and forgot the money; I went up before her, and she came up stairs after me; the last time I saw it was in my wife's hands before she put it on the box. Then she and me went to bed about a quarter after twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner Macdonald - A. Yes, the prisoner was my servant in the house at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether she was gone to bed before you went to bed - A. Yes, she was.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get up in the morning - A. About five minutes before seven.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether or no she was up before you - A. Yes, she was, and had the tap-room and parlour cleaned out, and the door wide open; my wife did not get up till eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went up to bed at a quarter after twelve was the house shut up - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the house besides yourselves and the servant maid - A. There were two or three butchers that lodged in the house, they were in bed some time before that, there were nobody else in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss the money when you got up - A. No, I did not until Edwards's brother called for it nigh ten o'clock, and then I found it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any enquiry about it - 
               <persName id="t18110710-22-person225">A. </persName>
            Yes, my wife said she had left it there; I spoke to the prisoner about it at ten o'clock, I asked her whether she had seen it when she was cleaning out the tap-room, she denied it. She had seen the silver counted out the night before, and given to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards find out where the money was - A. Yes, the day after I found it out part of it at least; there was a washerwoman that the prisoner recommended; that washerwoman left the house about eight o'clock in the evening, before the money was brought into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where the washerwoman lived - A. No, I did not. On the next day I took the prisoner and all the butchers that lodged in the house to Bow-street to be examined; I asked the prisoner where the washerwoman lived, she said she did not know; then she said she lived at Chelsea; two officers went up to Chelsea, they could not find any such person. After they came back she would not tell where she lived. On Saturday morning I found out the washerwoman at 34, Rupert-street; she lived there, I went to Bow street office, got a search warrant, and took two officers with me; we found in a box in the washerwoman's room, a cloth, and six pounds one shilling tied upin the cloth, all silver, and we found twelve shillings and six pence in the washerwoman's pocket. Limbrick the officer has the cloth and the money.</p>
               <p>MARGERET CAMERON. Q. You are the wife of the last witness - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard the account that he gave, do you recollect taking this cloth with the silver out of the till for the purpose of carrying it up stairs - A I did, and I put it on the box by the fire place intending to take it up stairs; I went to get some hot water out of the boiler, and forgot it and went up stairs without it.</p>
               <p>Q. The next morning you did not get up till after your husband - A. No, I did not get up till after eight o'clock, it was not discovered till near ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the washerwoman being at your house that day - A. Yes, she went away about eight o'clock in the evening, before the man brought the money. She was not there afterwards.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the Friday the prosecutor brought the prisoner down to the office; I searched her and found nothing on her. She denied having any knowledge of the money. On Saturday I went up to 34, Rupert-street, I asked the woman of the house whether she had any box belonging to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What woman - A. Mrs. Molaney. She told me she had no box there of hers; I found a box belonging to Mrs. Molaney; I shook the box and found a rattling of silver; the box was locked; I went for a smith and had the lock picked; Mrs. Molaney was present at the time; she was bad in bed; in her box I found six pounds one shilling in silver, tied up in this cloth. After I had found the money I went to the prisoner I asked her where this washerwoman lived; before I told her I had got the money; she said she did not know where she lived; I took the towell out of my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181107100016"/>pocket, then she began to cry, and begged for mercy; I told her where I had found it, she then said she would tell me all about it; she said the washerman came there very soon that morning, and she told her that she had found some money; she was going to take it up stairs, but the washerwoman called her back, and said it was better for her to keep it, and with that she did; they both went out together, and she gave it to the washerwoman tied up as it was; then when she got to 34. Rupert-street she took the money from the washerwoman, and carried it up stairs, and put it in the box, and locked it, and left the key on the mantle shelf. There was no key to be found.</p>

            's house. No. 9, South street, Finsbury square. On Sunday the 16th of June Roberts brought the prisoner into Mr. Stokes's kitchen, and called me; I was in the water closet; I came down stairs, I saw the prisoner with the things belonging to me under his arm, I had left on the table in the kitchen two minutes before; I looked on the table and saw the money gone as well as the clothes; four shillings was wanting. I examined the bundle that he had under his arm, he had a coat, waistcoat, and breeches, and four shillings in his hand. I took care of the clothes, and gave them to the officer. I asked the prisoner what he did it for; he said he did it for want. We marked the shillings when we found them.</p>

               <p>Q. Were these things laying on the table so that people passing along in the street could see them - A. No; the table was at the further end of the kitchen.</p>

            . I live in service with Mr. Gappards, No. 8, South-street, Finsbury-square, next door to Mr. Stokes. On the 16th of June, between twelve and one, I saw the prisoner coming down the area-steps of Mr. Gappard's house, he came towards the kitchen door and begged charity; he said he was a very poor man, he wanted a few halfpence to bear his expences that night; I gave him sixpence, with which he was seemingly thankful. One of my masters sons were in the kitchen, he said, Robert, I think he is an imposter, you had better look after him. I went up our area steps, and looked after him; I saw him going down Mr. Stokes's are a steps, he advanced towards the kitchen door, he went into the kitchen; in a minute and a half after I saw him coming out with a bundle under his left arm. I met him on the area steps and stopped him; I took him into Mr. Stokes's kitchen; I called Golding who was in the care of the house; I asked him it that was his property; he said, yes, it was his property; the prisoner had his coat, waistcoat, and breeches; Golding looked on the table where he had left the things; he said, I suppose my money is gone also. The prisoner said here is your money, he had four shillings in his left hand. I then went for an officer.</p>

I told the porter to go for a constable, and before the constable came she confessed that she had taken it. I had noticed the print on the counter just before the prisoner came in. The print was five yards, it was worth fifteen shillings.</p>

I am a porter to Mr. Marshall, I saw the prisoner come into the shop, I saw the print on the counter before the prisoner came in; I did not see the prisoner take any print off the counter. Mrs. Payne told me she saw the prisoner take the piece of print and put it in her handkerchief; I went up to the prisoner, I said, what is your pleasure; she said, I want a yard of print like this; part was in her handkerchief and part on the counter. I told Mr. Grisbrook he went to her; she said, cut me off a yard off this, and immediately he was going to tear it, she said you are tearing my print; he said it was not; I was sent for a constable.</p>

I being fatigued got up, and instantly he shoved me down stairs; I waited in the Alley near three quarters of an hour by the door; finding nobody come, I thought it was dangerous waiting there any longer. I went towards Bishopsgate; there I saw the five prisoners coming up the court; I fancy the prisoners saw me, they returned back again, and went into a gin shop, near Sun-street. I saw the watchman, and requested that he would take the whole of them; he informed me he was off his duty; I told him I had been robbed and ill used. He then took them all up to the watchhouse; they were searched, and about seven shillings and odd were found upon them in copper.</p>

On Saturday, the 1st of June, about half after three, the tea-pot was sent to me, by Mr. Stroud in Burleigh-Street, Exeter Change, The boy left it, and desired it might be done on Monday, I promissed it should; the boy went away. About five o'clock the same day the prisoner came to me in a violent prespiration, and said he came from Mr. Stroud; I asked him what he came for, he said a silver tea-pot; I asked him who brought the pot, he said a boy; I asked him what kind of a boy, he said a boy that was commonly called cribbage faced; I asked him why he called him cribbage face, he said because he was pitted with the small-pox.</p>

            Was the boy pitted with the small-pox - A. Yes, he is. I asked him then, what dress the boy had on, he said a brown jacket; I asked him to describe the nature of the tea-pot; he said certainly he could, for a shopmate of his which stood by gave it the boy. He described it as hear upon the interogations for me to suppose that he had a knowledge of the pot and that he was sent. I asked the prisoner why he came in so short a time after it was left, when it was promised on Monday, he observed that the pot came from Mr. Ellis, in Oxford-street, and Mr. Ellis finding that it would not be done till Monday, he had sent for the pot. Then I delivered him the pot. My wife looked out of the two pair of stairs window, she asked me whether the prisoner had the tea-pot; I said yes, she said that man spoke to the boy at the door before the pot was delivered. I immediately went to Mr. Stroud, he said he had not sent for the tea-pot.</p>

               <p>FRANCES NALDER. Q. You are a marshall - A. I am. On the 18th of June, a very serious fire took place in Bury-street, St. Mary Axe; I was called to it in the situation I hold; I observed the prisoner very active in and out of several houses. I observed him coming from the house which I understood was occupied by Mr. Samuda, he had then on a similar jacket to what he has on now, perhaps the very same jacket. I observed his pockets to be very bulky; I went up to him and asked him what he had in his pockets; his answer was what was that to me, he had nothing belonging to me; I shewed him my staff of office, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181107100019"/>told him who I was, and insisted on searching him, he resisted me immediately; with great difficulty and with the assistance of four or five people I searched him, I found several articles, three pair of stockings, braces, a hat brush, and a pair of shoes. Upon looking into the shoes I observed the makers name in Shoemaker row, I went to the shoemaker, he told me they were Mr. Samuda's shoes; I found where Mr. Samuda was, at a house, No. 5, Coopers row, Tower Hill; I went to him, and asked him if he had lost any thing; he said he did not know that he had; I produced the shoes to Mr. Samuda, he laid they were his; I searched the prisoner, I found a watch and eleven guineas in gold; however I could not get an owner to anything but the shoes; I understand the prisoner up to this time has borne an exceeding good character.</p>
               <p>MR. SAMUDA. Q Are these your shoes - A. Yes. When I last saw then they we in the back room of our house in Bury-street next door to the fire.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>

               <p>Q. In the course of last month was the prisoner in your father's employ - A. He was. On Saturday the 22nd of June we lost the carcase of a pig, we missed it between eight and nine in the morning, and within half an hour after the pig was missed the prisoner came and said to me, sir, I understand there is a pig lost again, I can throw some light upon it; I said I should be glad if he could; he said he was going in with some meat, and he heard some words. He took me up to Middlesex hospital, and from there to the Haymarket, we found no tidings of the pig, about half past four that afternoon I received some information which led me to Paskin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your pig again - A No. We took the prisoner up the same afternoon about six o'clock, I told him what we took him for; he said he knew nothing about the pig.</p>

            . I am a farmer at Cowby. The prisoner worked for me in the hay season. On the 24th of June, between two and three o'clock the prisoner went up stairs into his bed-room, he staid about ten or twelve minutes. In about twenty minutes afterwards Talbot came down and said he had lost all. He had lost some before. On the Sunday I found the prisoner at the Red Lion, Uxbridge, I charged him with stealing the half crown, he abused me, and denied having the money; I charged the constable with him. I saw the half crown taken from him and delivered to me; this is the half crown.</p>

             I am a waterman and lighterman by business; I have known the prisoner six or seven years. Last September I was standing on Tower Hill, he asked me if I wanted a watch for my own wear; I told him I did not; he said he had a very good one that he had made for a gentleman in the country, it was in pledge for two guineas, he wanted money, and he had pawned it; he said if I did not want it myself there was room for me to get a guinea by it; it was a capped watch; he produced a duplicate in the name of Smith, a silver watch, two guineas; he said he always pawned his things in that name: I had the duplicate, and got the watch out at Mr. Christie's, Butcher-row, East Smithfield; he charged me five shillings; he said he would see me the next day; he did, he took the watch and opened it; he said that was the watch, he asked me if I would buy it out, I said, yes: he asked me what I was going to give him for it. It stood me in two pounds seven shillings. I think I gave him fourteen shillings. I wore it a month. Last February the main spring broke, the prisoner put another in; he lodged at my house then. I wanted money, I pledged the watch the sessions before last, at Mr. Windsor's, the corner of Essex-street, Whitechapel, for two guineas.</p>
               <p>COURT. How came you to know any thing about the prosecutor - A. Some conversation came out at the time a cause was tried at the Sheriff's Court, six or seven weeks ago; I was in company with the prosecutor at the Elephant and Castle, Moorgate. I his is the same watch there is Camarthen upon it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Mr. Lill have you had any quarrel with the prisoner - A. No, he lodged in my house. I never had any dispute with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor is there any account between you that is not settled - A. Yes, there is. When that cause was tried he went away with ten weeks rent, at seven shillings a week, which was not paid.</p>
               <p>Q. There were no words, was there - A. Yes, there were some words.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you - A. I am an officer in the impress service.</p>
               <p>Q. This excepting your appearance at Clerkenwell Sessions, was the first time that you were in a court of Justice - A. No, my lord knows better than that; I was here last winter as a witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in custody - A. No, I was not.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the only time that you have been in custody - A. It is not. I was in custody at the Thames Police office.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what charge - A Upon my life I do not know. I was taken in custody, and sent to the house of Correction, and in my younger years I have been in custody several times.</p>
               <p>COURT. Were you ever tried - A. At the Guildford aflizes I was; I was at the galley, a man asked me to give him a lift up with some cotton some officer was there, I was taken up. I have been accused but never tried.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes, he came to lodge with my mother in law on the 15th of August, 1808, the lives at 28, Sidney-street, Goswell-street road, he came with the name of Mr. Cook when he took the lodgings, he was to pay twelve shillings a week.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181107100022"/>Q. Do you remember, on the 9th of September, 1808 the prisoner making any application to you - A. On the 9th of September, 1808, he called me up into his apartment, and asked me if I thought I could get a draft changed for twelve pounds; I told him I did not know, I would try. I went and tried. He wrote the draft in my presence. This is not the first draft.</p>
               <p>Q. He wrote a draft in your presence for twelve pounds, you saw that - A. Yes, that was upon the banker, Mr. Praed, he gave it me, I went to try to get change at a publican in the same street, I could not get change, I returned and my mother gave me some information that she had got a fifteen pound bank note; I went up to the prisoner's apartment, I told him my mother had a note of fifteen pound, if he would give me the difference: he said, yes; he then asked me if it would make any difference if he gave me a draft of fifteen pounds instead of that; I gave him the first note, he tore it, and then he wrote another, he gave me the other, I took it to my mother, and gave it to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at that draft - A. Yes, that was also a draft of Praed's.</p>
               <p>Q. You took it to your mother - A. Yes, she had occasion to put it away that afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of that draft so as to be able to say it is the same - A. Yes, I did. This is the same draft that he wrote, and it is the same that I gave to my mother, and she paid it away in my presence to Mr. Haynes, he brought it back again.</p>

               <p>COURT. When the prisoner gave you the other draft that he drew did he receive from your mother the fifteen pound bank note - A. He received from me the fifteen pound bank note which my mother had given me to give to him; she paid the draft in my presence to Mr. Haynes, he had it about an hour and an half; he brought back the draft, saying that he had no money there. I took the draft up to the prisoner, I told him that we had occasion to pay it away to a tradesman, the tradesman had been, and the answer was, that there was no money there; he took it out of my hand and read it over; after he read it he said he saw his mistake; for his father formerly had money at that house, but had not now; he had forgot to put the word junior; he took it out of my hand, and wrote the word junior to the name of Cook; he told me then that I should find that it would be right. I carried it down stairs and gave it to Mr. Haynes again; he went back the next morning with it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go with him - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Haynes after he had been there come to you the next morning - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Between that night that you had so given it Mr. Haynes, and when Mr. Haynes came to you the next morning what became of the prisoner - A. While Mr. Haynes remained in the house Cook left the house saying that he should return again to tea.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner know that Mr. Haynes was in the house - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. But during the time that he was in the house giving the draft to you so altered the prisoner went out of the house saying that he should return to tea - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him afterwards - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. After the prisoner had altered the bill you gave the bill to Mr. Haynes after it had been so altered, and you had so given it to Mr. Haynes the prisoner went out of the house, while the prisoner was there did he ever return - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you say that Mr. Haynes returned the next morning, and returned you the draft - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give it to you - A. I do not remember whether he gave it to me or to my mother; we were both present.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the draft that was brought back the second time by Mr. Haynes the same draft you had given Mr. Haynes with the name of Cook, without the alteration - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18110710-36-person343">Q. </persName>
            Your mother had the draft - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you hear of the prisoner again - A When he was taken I saw him at Hatton Garden. I do not know the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. When you did see him at Hatton Garden had you any doubt that he was the same person that had been your mothers lodger, and who wrote the draft of which you have been speaking of - A. I had no doubt he was the same person. It was in June, the last month, that he was apprehended, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. That draft that you have now produced is the same draft - A. It is my draft, having my own name, which I put at the back of it before it ever went out of the house, and before I delivered it to Mr. Haynes by his desire; he is a very particular man. I have no doubt of the draft.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The witness says that the money was paid on receiving the second draft I understand.</p>

               <p>COURT, to witness. Was the fifteen pound paid at the time when you received the first draft without the word, junior - A. He had the money then.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I mean to say that the money was paid for the draft that was destroyed.</p>
               <p>Witness. He gave me that for the fifteen pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You did not give the fifteen pounds for the twelve pounds draft - A. I gave him the note, saying if he would give me the difference. I thought he would give me the change of the difference.</p>

               <p>Q. You remember the prisoner coming to lodge with you upon the terms you have described - A. Yes, exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 9th of September, 1808, had you an application from your daughter, at the instance of the prisoner for change of a draft for twelve pounds - A. Yes, sir, I had, upon that I gave her a fifteen pound bank note to take to him, then she brought down a check for fifteen pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the check for twelve pound - A. I heard it was broke to pieces, I never saw it again.</p>
               <p>Q. You had brought back a draft upon Praed and Co for fifteen pound - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181107100023"/>Q. Did you look at that draft - A. No, not particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any other draft than that of fifteen pounds as coming from the prisoner or any body else on that day - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When your daughter brought back this draft of fifteen pound what did you do with the draft - A. I gave it Mr. Haynes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see the draft again - A. In about half an hour after it was produced by Mr. Haynes he said it was not a good one, and it had not been paid; I gave it to my daughter again, then when she brought it back to me again it had the word junior wrote upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the draft that was brought back to you was the same as the first, except the alteration of that word, junior - A. Yes, Mr. Haynes was waiting I paid it to him again.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the draft again - A. The next morning, in the forepart of the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same draft that you had given him in the two instances - A. The very same.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that draft that was so returned - A. My daughter took it in her care. We are all as one.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had any draft of the same value from any other person, had you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner - A. He left the house while Mr. Haynes was in the house the second time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he saw Mr. Haynes - A. I do not know that he did; he left word that he would come home to tea, he never returned any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that draft and tell me whether that is the draft that you saw in the first state without the word junior to it - A. I never observed it at first, I afterwards did; I have no doubt it is the same draft. I saw my daughter write her name on it in the presence of Mr. Haynes and myself.</p>
               <p>RICHARD HAYNES. Q. I believe you live in Union-street, Whitechapel - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 9th of September, 1808, did you receive a check of Mrs. Ware - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the check if you were to see it again - A. I should. This is the same I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the back of it, and see whether there is a name written - do you remember the daughter putting her name - A. The daughter, by my desire, put A. W. upon the check.</p>

               <p>Q. Therefore have you the least doubt upon earth that that is the draft - A. None in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. When it was produced to you first did you look upon the draft - A. I did, it was given to me in part of payment of a bill; it was first

On the 4th of May, the prisoner pawned a tablecloth with me for five shillings, in the name of Elizabeth Weller. She said she was a lodger at the King's Arms, Leadenhall-street, that the tablecloth was her own. On the Monday following, a man came with the ticket of the tablecloth to my shop, which I had given to her the Saturday before; he said he had purchased it of a woman, in Shoreditch, for a shilling; I told the man my suspicion, he did not take the tablecloth out in June the 5th, following, the prisoner came to pledge a sheet; I examined the sheet, and found it corresponded with the mark of the cloth; I sent for an officer and she was taken in custody.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence, nor called any witness to her character.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street-office. On the 13th of June, about two o'clock I, in company with Mr. Gabriel, went to the prisoner's Judge's house, my son and Wilson were with me, Mr. Judge was behind the counter, I asked him if his name was Judge; he said yes; I told him I had a search warrant; I read it, I asked him if he had any sackings; he said yes; I went with him into the warehouse; he said there is two; these are the two, they were laying on the ground. I then asked him if he had any more; he said, yes. We went up stairs over that place, and found five sackings, and a pair of bennets; he said he had no more; Mr. Gabriel asked Mr. Judge if he had sold any in the course of that week; he said six to a bedstead maker in that neighbourhood; I asked Mr. Judge of whom he had bought them; he said he had once bought them of a fresh-coloured woman, but these were brought by a little girl, he gave three shillings and sixpence for them, and he supposed the parties would come again. We secured the goods, and Mr. Judge was taken to the office. All the women that worked for Mr. Gabriel were ordered down to the office that night, but no one was held in custody. On Friday the 14th I went to Mr. Gabriels house, there was this girl with the prisoner Arnott, they, with several of the women that worked there, were ordered to go to the magistrate; from the prisoner Arnott's house I fetched this basket; after that examination had taken place I had a search warrant to search Mr. Barrett's house, Silver-street, Golden-square, when I came there I found Catherine in the shop, I read my warrant to Mr. Barrett, Mr. Gabriel saw some sackings on bedsteads that he knew. Directly afterwards we were led by Catherine and Mr. Barret to a shed next door, I found there one hundred and fifty sackings, they are all here in a cart.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181107100028"/>They have been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at the two first - A. They are my property, we are the only persons supplied in town with cloth of this description from a manufactory in Plymouth; I never saw any like them in my life before. The holes are worked with thrums of sailcloth. I can swear to the property. They sell for six shillings and sixpence wholesale</p>

               <p>Arnott's Defence. I lived servant with the prosecutor's brother four years, and since that I have been employed five years by the prosecutor constantly, and had the care of their house when out of town, and gave the greatest satisfaction, as such I solemnly declare I am innocent.</p>
               <p>Judge's Defence. I had no knowledge whatever of the articles being stolen, nor any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Arnott called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Judge called eight witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

Yes, upon my return in the house I found the prisoner on the stairs, I called him down and asked him what he wanted; he said that he had mistaken the house, and when he passed me I perceived he had a bundle under his arm; I then called for assistance; he walked leisurely down the court; I begged a gentleman standing at a door to stop him, or send somebody; he sent somebody. The prisoner was out of my sight before he was stopped.</p>

Yes, and the bundle was brought back with him; after the man was brought back; I went up into the room, I perceived four shirts, five handkerchiefs, and a shift body had been removed, and the bundle that the man was brought back with, contained them articles. The prisoner then asked for forgiveness.</p>

               <p>Q. For what purpose were they to take it away, were Messrs. Leech and Dallimore to be allowed for it. - A. Yes, I gave it to them for that purpose only.

            . I am a constable. On the 4th of June I was standing in Ludgate Street about four yards from Messrs. Leech's and Dallimore's, I saw the prisoners bring the truck to the door, the truck was outside of the coffee-house, they both assisted in putting the lead upon the truck, they went the second time to fetch some more. When they put the second parcel on Leverett went round to the front of the truck and Wright behind, Leverett leaned his right shoulder towards the truck and Wright put the lead upon him, then Wright went into the coffee-house and Leverett went away with the lead on his shoulder and left the truck there. Leverett went on to the top of the Old Bailey and turned the right hand of Newgate Street, I followed him all the way, after he had got into Warwick Lane about an hundred yards I stopped him, I told him that he had taken the lead from Mr. Leech's out of the truck, that he should take it back, he said very well, I asked him where he meaned to take it, he said he was going to take it to his master's in Shoe Lane, I told him that was the wrong way to Shoe Lane, he must take it back again. The lead weighs exactly ninety four pounds. I brought him back and took him before Mr. Dallimore, he ordered me to take him before the Alderman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take Wright into custody. - A. I did, Wright said he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. Do you happen to know where Wright's wife lodged. - A. In Warwick Lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Leverett tell you that Wright desired him to call on his wife in his way home. - A. No.</p>

We came together from the London Dock in a coach, the coachman drove us to Bishopgate Street, I paid the fare and discharged the coachman. The women went into a house and called me up to have tea. We all three were in one room, I staid there a quarter of an hour, my watch was on a chair, I had a reason for it, I was very warm, I pulled off my coat and put it on the chair, over the watch. There was a bed in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I need not ask you what reason there was for it. - A. When I took up the coat my watch was not there, and both the women went out of the room, my pocket book was in my coat pocket, that also was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were on the bed which of the women were with you. -

               <p>"my property is gone and I would mark the house if they did not let me have the property. I saw no more of them afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given them any thing before they left the room. - A. I gave a crown piece to Fogg to get tea.</p>
               <p>Q. After they quitted the room how long was it before you saw them again. - A. I believe it was the third day that I saw them in custody. I am quite certain to their persons, and that they were the two women that were with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your pocket book again, or your watch. - A. I have seen the watch, it is pawned. The watch was produced before the Lord Mayor.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you possessed of a watch on the 12th of June. - A. Yes, about a twelvemonth I had the watch. The watch was taken from the kitchen of the public-house, I had left it on the shelf about two o'clock in the morning. It is a market-house, we generally open about two o'clock in the morning. I opened the house at that time. The prisoner came into my house, as I opened it, he asked if he could have any coffee.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the kitchen - A. Yes, he said he would take a quartern of brandy, we drawed him the brandy. I asked him for the money, he said he had nothing less than a ten pound note, we immediately ordered him out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he produce a ten-pound note. - A. No, he left the house upon being ordered out, about three minutes after he left the house, I missed the watch, I gave an alarm, and went out of doors to look for him, and while I was out, the prisoner was brought back, when I returned he was in the house, he was taken to the watchhouse, I saw the watch found upon him by Kimber; I knew it to be mine.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prisoner was brought to the watchhouse, I took the watch from him, I have kept it ever since.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The matter is this: I am a person that was upwards of twenty years well-doing in this metropolis; I have had upwards of five years sickness in the north, my friends were kind to me. On this morning, through great distress I stood in need of something, they were early open in the market, I thought perhaps I might get a cup of coffee, the young man brought me brandy, what I called for; as I could not produce the money, I said nothing less than a ten pound note, I had not the note; I was ordered out, I went to the upper part of the market, told my distress, they gave me coffee, I was not apprehensive there was any alarm given, I took a walk round the market. They over-hauled me, and found the watch upon me.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the person of the prisoner before. A. I never saw him to my knowledge. The prisoner said that his handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket, that he meaned to tell him that he thought he would lose it. I have kept the handkerchief ever since.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the handkerchief I found in the prisoner's hand, it cost me eight shillings, it is worth a shilling.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not intend to rob him. I was going down to Tower Hill, being out of work. I saw this gentleman's handkerchiefs part out of his pocket, I said, you will lose your handkerchief, and when he saw the handkerchief, part in my hand, and the other part in his pocket, he said, you rascal, you intended to take it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He had the handkerchief completely in his hand when I turned round to him.</p>

I, from information run down Tudor Street, into Water Street, I could not see or hear anything of him; on my return I met the prisoner with my basket on his back in Crown Court, leading into Tudor Street. I knew my basket. it contained fifteen half quartern loaves, and a three-penny one, and there was that quantity when I found the prisoner with it. The prisoner said he was sorry for it, and he hoped I would forgive him. This is the basket I took from the prisoner's back, the bread was my master's property.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did Mr. Oppenheim keep cash at your house. - A. He did, I then shewed it to another clerk whose name is Sells, in consequence of what he said I took the notes back from the boy</p>
               <p>Court. Had the boy taken up the notes or were they lying on the counter. - A. He took them up and I took them from him. I told the boy to wait a moment.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell him upon what charge you took him. - A. He asked me what was the matter, I told him he would know when I took him into the Manson House. I took him into the Mansion House before the Lord Mayor, the Lord Mayor asked him if he had heard the charge what the boy stated against him, he said he had not distinctly heard, the boy was asked some questions again, I do not recollect the words, and the Lord Mayor asked him if he had any thing to say in his defence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he asked by the Lord Mayor how he came by the note. - A. The prisoner said he found them, that is all he said in his defence, he said he had found them papers.</p>

I asked her then where she had removed to, she said into Theobald's Road, she had been gone about a fortnight from Drury Lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she mention any number. - A. No, I believe she said the corner of Old North Street, and that she kept a cloaths shop, and that if I would go with her to Theobald's Road she would give me another for it, she did not know it was a bad one. Her husband would make a fine piece of work with her if he knew it to be a bad one, that she had taken it for two shirts that had been sold in the shop, I told her that I would take her to No. 4, to see if she had lived there, she then complained that she was not able to walk, that she was unwell, I still persisted in going down to Drury Lane, and took her by the arm and crossed over and took her to Bow Street, there she was examined.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner at the bar being brought to the office in Bow Street. - A. Yes, on the 13th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go for the purpose of searching the lodgings of the prisoner. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you learn them to be the lodging of the prisoner. - A. From her own account, she delivered the key of her room to me herself, she said that her lodgings was situated in Theobalds Road, I took her with me, Lack and Vickrey were with me, two other officers. In going there she was asked what property she had in the house and what description, she said she believed there was nine pound in bank notes in a pocket book, which were in a drawer, she was asked if she had any more, she said there were not that she knew off.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that room situated that you went with her to, of which you had the key to open the door. - A. On the ground floor of the house, at the corner of North Street. We then proceeded to search, we found the nine pounds that she described, and on making a further search we found this bag.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the nine notes in the pocket-book in the drawer. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found them in the pocket-book were good. - A. They were so, we proceeded to search further, in this bag we found a five a two, and a one, that work bag hung up at the side of the fire place.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they in a bag. - A. They were to to the best of my recollection in some paper, but I delivered the bag to Lack, and he will tell you.</p>
               <p>Q. These notes you so found, you would know them again if you were to see them. - A. Yes, this is the one pound note I found, I endorsed it at the time; this is the five pound note, I marked it in the same manner; and this is the two, I endorsed it likewise, I have no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181107100034"/>doubt of them. In returning from the room to the office she then said they were notes that she had taken in the shop, and she had put them there as a private purse of her own, and that she had put them there unknown to her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appear desirous of preventing you from suspecting her husband. - A. I should imagine that she did.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you imagine that only from the expression that she made. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. She is indicted as a single woman. The husband, as he is called, was apprehended for a different offence than that which the woman at the bar now is indicted for. - A. Truely so.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I mean to speak the truth. Them notes that were in my work bag, my husband gave me the day before, to purchase some articles that I wanted in the house; he said, if I did not go that day, I might keep them by me, and he would go with me, I considered that I should like my husband to go with me, I put the notes in the work-bag, until he could go. Respecting the other note, that I uttered for the stays, I am positive that I took that note in the shop at Drury lane, and I put the name on at the name. The reason that I denied these notes being in the work bag. I did not know what to say, being in the hands of officers, I imagined my husband might know something of them, I knew I was in the hands of officers, I said, I knew nothing about it; my husband was at the door when I went in for the stays, and when I came out he was gone.</p>

Yes, I did, he kicked him in his privates, I jumped out of the ship for assistance, I got to them while the fight was, a little while after the kick, the deceased went to the wall, and unbuttoned his trowsers, his privates were swelled, and blood came out of his mouth, the prisoner ran away, I pursued him, and brought him back.</p>
               <p>- I am a surgeon, I examined the body of the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find an injury done by such an act as described. - A. I did, I found a rupture near the part on opening the abdomen, there was about a quart of blood, the artery had been ruptured by violence, and such a kick as I have heard described might occasion it, I firmly believe he died of that injury.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was going down the dock with intention to look for a ship, I spoke to myself that cannot be a running ship, the deceased was behind me, he said she is a running ship, I said how is that she is without rails, he said what does she want with rails boy, I tapped him on the shoulder and said go away, he struck me and I struck him, we did not make any agreement to fight, this young man came to help him, he told him he had no occasion, he said he would not fight any more, after fighting we spoke together ten minutes. I did not know the man was dead. I ran away thinking they wanted to stop me, when I was stopped they said I had killed the man, I said my God he was not dead when I left him, he was very pale. I do not know whether it was the kick or the blows. I am very sorry for it.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had he been your journeyman - A. He came in my employ in November last, and worked with me until this affair happened.</p>
               <p>Q. When you retired from your room from work, you lived in Water-lane - A. Yes, at No. 2.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it your habit and your directions to him always to lock the door of the room - A. It was the general order.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you considerable property there, diamonds and other things to a great value - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the day on which you missed this property - A. On Saturday the 1st of June.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time did you retire from your room to go to dinner - A. A little after one; I left Hodgetts and the apprentice in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you pretty busy at that time - A. I was very busy, and chiefly in diamond work I was absent from my shop about fifteen minutes, when I returned I found my apprentice in the shop, I said, where is Hodgetts.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Hodgetts usual time to go to dinner - A. No particular time; Hodgetts was gone at that time, I sat down to work, I wanted a small file out of my bottom drawer, and I missed my diamond box out of that drawer. It was a small round box.</p>
               <p>Q. What diamonds were they of any value - A. The box was nearly of the size of a box for the impression of a seal, it contained about two carats.</p>
               <p>COURT. Small diamonds chiefly - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr Knapp. You do not know how many stones there were do you - A. No, I cannot say. I looked on the board for it, thinking it might lay on the work-board, it was not on the work-board, and I opened a larger box, in which there had been diamonds on the wax arranged for the setting of it; that was my work, the diamonds had been picked off.</p>
               <p>Q. How many carats do you think the diamonds removed from the wax might be - A. About one carat. These drawers were left open to me and my journeyman. The carat in the wax box cost eight pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the other - A. About fifteen pounds. I am quite sure that both were in the house when I left it. There were two other wax boxes from whence the diamonds were picked off; I had seen the diamonds in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Of what value were they - A. In one there were seven guineas worth, in the other about twelve pounds. There were a pair of transparent diamond drops set for the ears, in the two centers were two large stones, they were set ready for the wear; they were worth fifty pounds, they weighed five carats and a half, all fine brilliants; they were all safe in the morning, I saw them. There were two separate papers of diamond stones, unset for work, one paper contained two carats, they were on my board when I left the shop, one paper value eighteen pound, another paper worth eight pounds. On looking farther I missed three pearl rings, these I had seen in the morning, and a brilliant ring square; the pear rings are worth about four pounds, the brilliant ring worth about ten pound, the making and all. I believe that is the whole.</p>

               <p>COURT. All these had been safe before you went to dinner - A. Yes. Upon missing this I went to Hatton Garden, and left my apprentice in charge of the shop; I got a warrant to search the prisoner Hodgetts place; this was near two o'clock, he had told me that he lived over the water; I found out he lived in Fetter-lane, I went to Fetter-lane and did not find him, he had not been home all day. A Mr. Cooper and Wilkinson waited for him until he did come home, and they took him and brought him to the Royal Oak, Hatton Garden the same evening, between ten and eleven at night. I saw the prisoner the same night about eleven o'clock, at the Royal Oak, the officer sent for me. The officer searched him, but not in my presence, a gold chain was produced before me, two gold seals, thirty-seven pounds, and a sixteenth share of a lottery ticket.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him at that time - A None at all. On the Monday afternoon following I had conversation with him, I was sent for by the prisoner, I went to the lock-up-place, Hatton Garden office; when I went in he cried bitterly; there was a long pause for about five minutes; I asked him what I had done that he should injure me in this manner; he said I had injured him; I said, in what manner? he replied I was too good to him; he then said, would I forgive him; I told him he was in the hands of justice, and not in my hands. He begged of me to go the magistrate to ask forgiveness, and he would let me know where my diamonds were, or who he had sold them to. The magistrate was sitting, I went to him and related what had past. The magistrate ordered him to be brought up, and told him he must make a voluntary confession without any expectation of advantage or disadvantage from it. He then said nothing, but was sent back. He sent for me again, I went back to him, he then said he would let me know where the diamonds were if I would not see him totally destitute in a prison.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose these notes and gold seal and chain had been taken from him - A. Yes. I told him he must trust to providence, I would do what I could.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181107100038"/>Hutt was on one side, and brought in pen and ink. The prisoner Hodgetts wrote it down himself what he had sold, and told me that he had sold them to the prisoner Lawrence. I asked the prisoner Hodgetts what he had sold them for, he said fifty-four pounds; fifty pounds he had received, and four pounds he was to receive on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say on what day he had sold them - A. On the Saturday, between three and four o'clock, on the same day they were taken away.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he give you any note to shew you that they had been sold there - A. No, I took all this from his verbal declaration, he had written only the number of diamonds, and the direction of Lawrence, I think No. 16, Duke-street, Aldgate. When he said he was to have the four pounds, on the Monday following, the Saturday he said he was to have called on Monday, the 3d of June, to look at some watches, at Lawrence's. It was on the Monday evening he gave me this account. On the Monday morning I went with the officer to see where he bought these two gold seals, it was wrapped up with the name of the person that he bought it of. At Mr. Aughtie's in Cheapside, I went there; with respect to the pearl rings; we found out where Mrs. Stracey lived, I went with Hancock and found her at home; she took us to the pawnbrokers shops; Mr. Nicholls in the City-road, I found two pearl rings there, and at Mr. Crouch's in Fore-street, I found the third by her direction; I am quite sure they are my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen Mrs. Stracey at your shop - 
               <persName id="t18110710-63-person620">A. </persName>
            She had called once at the street door, to go the play with the prisoner. On Tuesday morning the 4th, we went to Mr. Lawrence's, Hutt, the officer went in first. I went in and saw Mr. Lawrence in his shirt, it was about seven o'clock in the morning, in Duke-street, Aldgate.</p>
               <p>Q. What business was Mr. Lawrence carrying on - A. I could not see any business, there was a shop; I saw no business carried on in it, he was just out of bed, speaking to Hutt, Hutt told me to go about my business, he did not want me yet. Hancock came in and shut the street door, and locked it. Lawrence dressed himself and went up stairs with Hutt; I remained down stairs; I went up in a quarter of an hour afterwards. Hutt said to Lawrence, this is the person that lost the diamonds; Lawrence said he knew nothing about the young man; I told Mr. Lawrence where they young man had lived, where he became acquainted with him; Lawrence said he did not know him; he seemed very much agitated, and said he did not know what we where talking about, we communicated to Lawrence that I had lost diamonds; I went in the passage again, and left Lawrence with Hancock and Hutt; we took Lawrence to the office in the City.</p>
               <p>COURT. At this time had any property been produced or found in Lawrence's house - A. No, Lawrence was taken to the Poultry Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Then down to this time he persisted in not knowing any thing of Hodgetts, or any thing of the transaction of the diamonds - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Challener. Q. I believe you have a partner - A. I have none.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Mr. Cooper always reside in Gough-square - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not say to Hodgetts it would be better for him to confess did you - A. No, I said I would leave it to the justice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Your shop is in the front garret - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is what is called the sky parlour; with respect to the prisoner Lawrence at the time that you and the officers went to his habitation, it was seven o'clock in the morning, you expressed a surprise at seeing no customers.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you customers calling upon you at seven o'clock in the morning - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. When you said there was no appearance of business, did you mean that were no appearance of customers, or that there were no appearance of goods - A. I saw no appearance of shop goods.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley A great quantity of jewellery goods might go into a snuff box - A. Yes</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand you that you told

I said sir you may as well pay me, I will give you a receipt for the money. When I found he would not pay me the money, I said my brother was to have a watch of you I believe. He said directly, is there any thing the matter; he was standing in his shirt, he told me to come in the room; just at that moment Mr. Romer came into the passage from the door. Mr. Lawrence said to me, who is that; I said it is another of my brothers. The moment I said that he dropped all conversation, he denied any knowledge of buying any diamonds.</p>

When Mr. Romer made his appearance, he said he knew nothing of man or the diamonds. I told him then he was my prisoner. Then he asked me if I had got a search warrant; I told him I had traced a fifty pound note to a very near neighbour of his, that was passed for the diamonds.

             was called, and not appearing in court, his recognizance was ordered to be estreated.</p>
               <p>Hodgett's Defence. Mr. Romer said that I was in his employ at the time that the property was missed, that I deny; since last Christmas I have worked for him two or three times a week, and a week previous to the transaction he told me that I was very inconstant to my business, that I must look out for another situation; I told him my situation, that I was frequently with Mrs. Stracey, that she and I were upon taking a shop and I could not determine to say whether I could keep in his employ or not. I called on the Thursday, he told me his work was in an hurry. I set myself down, I did a trifle of work; I was not above one hour in the shop, he said, Hodgetts, I have removed my apartments to No. 2. Water-lane, Fleet-street, if you go out to dinner lock the door, and bring me the key; I left the shop and took the key. On the Saturday I went and had no intention to work; he asked me as a favour to sit down and mount a pair of small top ear-rings, he said he should have no money except they were done. I sat down and nearly completed them for him to take them in his hand, he left the shop, and a little while after he was absent from the shop I went down and never said a word to any person. The door of the house is continually open, and the stairs of the house are continually subject to persons going up and down. With respect to Mrs. Stracey's evidence, she said I, in consequence of owing her two pounds, I had given her these pearl rings to pledge for the money; that part of it I deny of owing her two pounds; I gave her a four pound note to buy me linen for shirts, she returned me one pound, she said she had bought the linen, and gave it to a person to make at Stepney Green; I went frequently for the shirts, she put me off, and with respect to Mr. Romer he has frequently given me orders to go out with diamond articles: I do not say that he gave me orders to take these diamonds out on commission, and I deny that ever I told him that I had taken these diamonds or that I ever said I had sold them to Mr. Lawrence.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. He said he had disposed of them to Mr. Lawrence.</p>
               <p>Lawrence left his defence to his counsel.</p>
               <p>Hodgetts called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Lawrence called eleven witnesses, who gave him a good character</p>

When I felt the watch go out of my pocket I said I had lost my watch; up came three or four jew men, and said what is the matter; I said, why do you ask, you know well enough; Mr. Pegg that was with me followed a little way, but did not get hold of him. On the Tuesday evening afterwards I saw the prisoner in custody at Lambeth street office, he was with other persons; directly I saw him, I said I would fetch the witnesses, they said it was too late. I saw him again on the Wednesday I was quite sure then that he was the person that struck me and took my watch away. On Tuesday, when I saw him there, it was dark, and on Wednesday it was day light, I was quite sure he was the man. I saw him by himself.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was this, the 9th of June - A. It was quite moon light. I was quite sober. I have never seen my watch again. It was worth seven pounds.</p>

Yes; I sent Lines a head as he has described, me and Rice were behind walking, one on one side of the grass plat, and one on the other, that they should not hear that any body was coming; as soon as I heard Line halloa out, ho, ho, I immediately ran and came close behind them, I saw Antonio holding Line, and Line holding Antonio, King was then close by, as close as possibly could be; I catched hold of Antonio, King immediately ran away, I then said to Line go along after him, which he did; he brought him back; by that time Rice came up, I left him with Rice and went after King, who was then in the custody of Line; I searched King, in his left hand jacket pocket, I found this knife open as it is now. Line said to me, he has ding'd my thimble; I asked King what he had done with the watch; he said, I know no watch; I searched behind his hankerchief,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181107100042"/>and then took his hat off, and in his hat I found this watch in this handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose watch is that - A. Line's. In his right hand jacket pocket I found this tobacco box. Rice searched the other man.</p>

               <p>King's Defence. I had that little knife in my hand going to eat bread and meat, one man came, I do not know which it is. This man was going past, he said, ho, ho, and then the other men came after him; one cut my head with a cutlass, I began to run away; one came after me and catched me; in about two or three minutes after that they tied my hand to his, he asked me where my watch is, I saw no watch at all, he took my hat off, he said he took the watch out of my hat. I never saw the watch.</p>

The tall one stopped me, and collared me, I made what resistance I could, until the other assisted him, the tall one drew his knife out of his pocket, and stabbed me in the shoulder; all the resistance I then could make I found was of no effect. They pushed me into the ditch, where the tall one cut me in the cheek, and the neck here very much. I got out of the ditch by some means or other, and the tall one took hold of me again. The little man then put his hand into my right hand breeches pocket, and took from me the silver I had there, and also tore from the breeches the watch out of my fob, fob and all. The tall one put his hand into my side pocket, and took from thence a small memorandum book; he then took hold of the left skirt of my coat, where there was a silk handkerchief and penknife, and cut that pocket off; I then made my escape from them, and after running, being a good deal agitated, and from the loss of blood, I fell down; I got up again as fast as I could, and found they were still pursuing me; I exerted myself and ran on till I got to the houses at Mile End road, nearly, I found a watchman in the watch-box, he took me down to the watchhouse, from whence the constable of the night conducted me home; a surgeon was sent for, and my wounds were dressed.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these two persons, do you know either of their persons - A. I have no doubt of the tall man, being the person that cut me from his stature, and appearance of his visage, and what I could recollect at that time. The other I do not know nothing about, nor have I seen the little one since.</p>

Upon searching my shop I found some of the baskets were taken away, and on looking about I found four of the baskets were out under the stall board in the street. On my going into the shop I discovered another basket empty, and a basket that contained three ducks was cut, and the ducks taken out, and a clasp knife lay on the stall-board, which knife was claimed by one of the prisoners; between four and five there were two men being taken to the watch-house; I went to the watchhouse, and the prisoners were then being searched, they had then taken out of their pockets five pigeons alive, and a handkerchief I saw there containing three of my ducks, they were dead.</p>

They had got a pigeon in their hand at that time, looking at it.

               <p>ABICE FOOT. On Sunday, the 26th of May, I was at Mr. Smith's, Hamptoncourt, I generally stop and help them in the kitchen, the cook lent me her shawl to walk home with; when I got home I took the shawl off and laid it on a table in the room, and laid a silk handkerchief upon it, I had no person in the room but the maid; I missed the shawl and the silk handkerchief. On the Saturday following, I asked her what she had done with the shawl and handkerchief, she answered that she never saw them; I went away to my Parish, she went away in a little time after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the shawl - A. Yes, in her mother's house, at Essen, it was in the prisoner's box, and new things that she had bought with my money. The silk handkerchief I never found.</p>
               <p>MR. COLLEY, I am a constable, I produce the prisoner's box, in the box I found this shawl, and the other things were quite new.</p>
               <p>HARRIOT HOBBS. That is my shawl.</p>

I asked her what she was doing to my desk; she burst out a crying, and said she was not at my desk; she told me she had no money about her. I went out and got the watchman to take her in custody; my wife gave me two notes, which I gave into the possession of the watchman.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Thwaites. The two prisoners came into the shop to look at some caps. They asked for others, and while I was gone, I saw Cox take this muslin off the counter and put it in her pocket. Cox and Hegan came in together, I did not see Hegan take any thing, she pulled the things about and tried to put me into confusion.</p>

Baylis came up and said he wanted half a dozen chairs; I told him he was doing what was very wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Bayles - A. He and Winks are <rs id="t18110710-76-deflabel456" type="occupation">fellow-apprentices</rs>

From the information of my apprentice I went in my back gate, I saw Winks come up and knock at the gate, the dog barked, and he left the gates. I saw him afterwards at his own home. On searching the premises I found three chairs in the lower workshop next Tabernable Walk, they had been removed from were they had been left in the morning, about fifty yards.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you loose these things - A. On the 21st of May, the prisoner washed for me, I recommended her to Mrs. Savage, of Hatton Garden, to char for her; she came and told me that she had lost some things, and after searching I found I had lost several things more than I have found. I found a sheet of mine pledged in Baldwin's Gardens. On Monday she was washing for me. I got an officer, and accused her of the theft; I told her I had found the sheet, she begged I would not take her to Hatton Garden office, and she would get her husband to take the rest of the things out. The officer searched her, and found several duplicates that led to other things of mine.</p>

               <p>Q. When was it you lost this cotton furniture - A. On the 21st of May, about eight in the morning. The prisoner was <rs id="t18110710-82-deflabel494" type="occupation">shopman to Mr. Francis</rs>

He had got three lengths of printed cottons, and two pieces of muslin. I requested him to wait the arrival of Mr. Simmons, who superintended the concern, as Mr. Francis was gone to Margate. The prisoner refused waiting. In the course of half an hour he returned, saying he had sold two squares of muslin, for five shillings and sixpence. On our examining the prints, we found six yards and a half deficient. Previous to the prisoner going out he borrowed six-pence of me; in the day he repaid it, having plenty of silver. In the evening he went to bed in the warehouse, in the morning I found he had left the house, twenty minutes after three. Mrs. Francis mentioned it to him in the morning, he flew in a passion and left the employ, on examining with the stock book, we missed two pieces of furniture.</p>
               <p>Q. There is only one charge here - A. On the 13th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181107100047"/>of June, a woman came to our shop and ordered some goods for an artificial flower maker, saying it was for a gentleman that was poorly and could not attend.</p>
               <p>Q. I cannot go through all the things that this man has done in his life, you must confine yourself to the printed cotton and the muslin - A. On the 13th of June this woman came, I went with her to No. 50. Dover-street, Blackfriers-road, when there the gentleman she said was so ill, she could not get out of bed; I entrusted her with the muslins to go up; Mr. Vincent came down and said he should detain the muslins for his salary; I came home without them. The next day, obtaining a search warrant the officer, and I searched his apartment in Guildford-street, we found twenty yards of furniture there, and part of another; we found nothing at the house I had left them at.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did not he claim wages that was due to him - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>COURT. He is indicted for stealing furniture - A. Yes, on the 22d of May, we never found that.</p>

About a quarter before nine o'clock the prisoner came to shut up the premises, I watched him, I desired the servant to inform him, when he had shut up the shop to ring the bell. After he had shut up the premises, I saw him go to the lower part of the premises, he returned and rang the bell, the servant came down, he said to her

               <p>Fidler's Defence. It is all false what she says; she unfortunately slept in the house that night, in the morning, she asked me to go with her to the Angel, she said she left some money there; I went with her; she said go into the yard with me; I went with her; she then said, I have put a little money here, if we get it safe we will have something that is good; she took the broom and took it from behind the water-butt; I picked them up, I told her I could not read; she said, as I was going to Gravesend, and wanted a little money she would give me two pounds, I said no, lend it me, and I will pay you.</p>

            . I was going along Saffron-hill that evening, about a quarter past ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner standing in the passage 109. This is the sack, and the lead that he had with him, I asked him what he had got there; he said he knew nothing about it, he had one piece in his hand, and the other was standing by him. I afterwards compared the lead to the roof it fitted exactly. The prisoner when I took him had mistaken the receivers house, it was next door.</p>

On the 10th of June the watchman, in company with this sailor, called me, the watchman informed me that the sailor had been robbed, they shewed me the house, I knocked at the door, nobody answered; I got into the house and found nobody there. This was one o'clock in the morning, it was quite day light; we returned again to the house. The prosecutor was fatigued, I told him to lay down on the parlour bed. I sat in the parlour till a quarter before nine in the morning, about that time Parnall came and opened the door with a key: he brought this bundle in his hand; he was in the act of unlocking a chest; I then went to him, I said to him, you have been playing a pretty game; he said, what is it; I said, you remember a sailor coming in last night; he said, there was a sailor with a girl of the town that he turned out; I awaked the prosecutor, he said, that is the man that gave me liberty to sleep here. I searched Parnell, on his person I found one pound eleven shillings and sixpence, and this bundle. There is two pair of new stockings, a pair of women's shoes new, and the stockings the woman then had been wearing, they could not have been off the legs many minutes. I found the stockings were purchased at Mr. Sanders's shop; there was some tea and sugar bought at Whitechapel, there was a pound note changed there. This tippett I can swear to be the woman's, here is also a duplicate of hers I found amongst the halfpence in his pocket, of a bed-winch pledged for four-pence on the 6th of June. I found the woman in Smithfield. After the woman prisoner was indicted she never has been near the house since.</p>

In the morning, when I came into the house, Patridge said, there is a man that was robbed at your house last night, do you know the woman; I said I knew the woman personally, but I did not know her name.</p>

I weighed the leg of lamb and the beef steaks together, she told me I must make a note of it and send it to her mistress, No. 10, Banner street, and to send every day for orders, that her mistress would be a customer, and she told me to send change for a two pound note, which was to come back. I sent my own boy with the meat, a one pound note, four shillings in silver, and ten shillings in copper. She was dressed decent like a servant, with a street door key on her finger. The meat came back again, but not the change</p>

The girl accosted him, and in Clerkenwell I heard something drop out of his pocket; a little boy picked up a guinea, and gave it me; I said, Hancock have you got the money; he said no, he had lost all the money.</p>
               <p>JOHN HUTT. About half past ten, on Friday night the prisoner was given in my custody for robbing this man; I searched the girl, I found nothing upon her. Going along she said. I will look round and see whether I can find any thing; she stooped down and picked up something, I laid hold of her hand; she picked the notes up from the ground; I asked the prosecutor whether he did not pull these notes out of his pocket himself; he said he did not know.</p>

I gave him two five pound notes and the remainder in one's and two's, to the amount of twenty pounds. I wrote Mr. White's name on it, and Swan-yard. This is the note that I received of the prisoner.</p>

I searched him, on his person I found six one pound bank notes, in his box I found two five pound notes, and a one pound note. He said it all belonged to Mr. Saywer.</p>

On the 4th of June, I observed the two prisoners in Threadneedle-street, I saw Russel take something out of her apron, I was not near enough to tell what it was, it rattled like halfpence. I then walked past them, I saw Luscombe with a black purse in her hand, I saw her give something to Russell, I saw Russel wiping and wetting it, she went up Finch-lane with it, she returned again in the course of a minute or two, Luscombe was then walking further on in Threadneedle-street, she stopped near against Merchant

             hall untill Russel came up to her, they had some conversation, and walked to the end of Threadneedle-street, Russel then sat down on the church-steps, Luscombe went into Mr. Wilsons, a stationers shop opposite of Threadneedle-street; Luscombe came out with this quire of whitybrown paper, and joined Russell, I immediately went into Mr. Wilson's shop, I made enquiry, a shilling was produced to me; I took the shilling, I have it now. I looked at the shilling, and judged it to be a counterfeit; I went into Threadneedle-street and caught hold of both the prisoners, Luscombe said what did I want, if she had done any thing wrong she was very sorry. Russel instantly clapped her hand to her mouth, I endeavoured to get my fingers in her mouth, I saw her swallow something. I then observed Luscombe have something in her hand; I seized hold of that hand immediately; I then called one of the waterman in the street to assist me getting them into Mr. Wilson's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there in that hand - A. Five shillings, four bad, and one good I believe; I took them into the shop and searched Luscombe first; in her pocket I found this black purse, this appears to be the purse I saw before, and in it were twenty shillings all had; I found this little box in her pocket containing three good sixpences, and one bad, and a piece of black ball; I found loose in her pocket six shillings and two pence farthing, all good halfpence; I searched Russel, I found nothing on her.</p>

             came to my house, he said he came for a tea-pot, I asked him what tea-pot; he said a silver, tea-pot; I asked him who brought the pot, he said a boy left it, commonly called cribbage face; I asked him the reason why he called him cribbage face; he said, because he was pitted with the small pox, which the boy is certainly pitted with the small pox; I asked him the dress the boy was in, he said a brown jacket, which he certainly had on; I asked him if he could describe the nature of the pot; he said, certainly, he could a shopmate of his a polisher, gave the boy the pot, he described the pot very exact.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say whose boy had left it - A. Yes, he said Mr. Stroud's, he said he came from Mr. Stroud as Mr. Stroud's servant, and as he was able to describe the pot so accurately I believed he did come from Mr. Stroud; I asked the reason he came so early for the pot, as it was promised on Monday; he said, that the people came from Mr. Ellis in Oxford-street, and Mr. Ellis's customer would not wait untill Monday for it, and therefore he came from Mr. Stroud for the tea-pot.</p>
               <p>Q. This appeared to you to be a very probable story - A. Yes, and upon which I delivered him the tea-pot in consequence of his story, believing what he said to be true.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181107100054"/>Q. What is the worth of the tea-pot - A. Ten or twelve pounds. The prisoner took the tea-pot away with him. After I delivered their tea-pot, before the prisoner could turn the corner of Monkwell-street, my wife looked out of the window and saw the prisoner, and in consequence of what my wife said, I went up to Mr. Stroud, he lives in Burleigh-street, Exeter Change. I told him what I had done with the tea-pot.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what Mr. Stroud told you did you look after the man - A. Yes, I did not see the prisoner untill the 6th. I saw him in Featherstone Street, Bunhill Row. I had an officer with me, and took him at a chandler's shop, in Featherstone-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the pot again - A. No, when the officer called me up stairs I gave charge of him. I told the prisoner that Mr. Stroud had not given him authority to come for the tea-pot; he said he was very sorry, he had known me some years. He did not deny the charge.</p>

On Thursday morning I went up stairs first, the prisoner was in bed when I entered the room.

Going to the Compter he confessed that he had sold it; I said what have you done with the tea-pot; he said I do not want the people of the house to know. He told me coming along, that a young man had sold the pot to Mrs. Lack, in Long Lane, for five pounds; the man made him drunk and robbed him of the money.
