I live in the Cowley Road, about sixty yards from the prosecutor—there are three houses between two small ones—our garden runs not quite up to it—on 21st August, about 4.15 p.m., I was in the garden, and heard people coming up the road—I saw the prisoners drink something out of a bottle—they next walked up to the prosecutor's house, looked at it, went into the garden, and into the porch of the house—they stayed there a little time, and the man went round the back way—I saw him leave the porch—the woman remained in the porch—after a short time the man rejoined the female, and they stayed in the porch fifteen or twenty minutes—the woman was holding a sun<lb/>shade or umbrella—my suspicion was aroused, and I went to the woman (I did not see the man then) and said, "Do you wish to see anyone?"—she said she wanted the lady of the house—I said, "She is away from home"—she said, "Oh, she is away, is she?" and came away from the door—I asked her if she knew the lady's name—she did not seem to answer that, but commenced talking about the Uxbridge Cycling Sports that were on—she walked from the house and left me a few yards from our house—I went in our house the front way, and into the kitchen and stood upon a chair and looked out at the back window—I saw the woman go back into the garden—a few minutes after the man joined her and then went to the top of the road and down another road, and she came down the road and past my front garden, retraced her steps, the man came down the other road and she walked behind him about twelve yards—I went to Mr. Brian, senior's, house and informed him what I had seen—I then went to the railway station—I did not see the prisoners there—I went back to Mr. Brian's house and saw marks on the door—then I went to the Police-station—a constable came with me and I gave information—I went into Windsor Street with the constable and saw the prisoners together at the top of the street—I pointed them out to the constable—the woman recognised me, talked to the man, and they separated—I went back to—the station and the prisoners were brought in.</p>

I want you to make a note of that"—then he handed me this jemmy from his pocket and said "That is what I did it with"—he also handed me ten skeleton keys—I afterwards went to the premises and compared the jemmy with the marks on the door, and found it to correspond—the marks on the writing desk and on the drawers corresponded with this instrument—the prisoners were charged—they made no reply.</p>

Hearn said, "I have given it to Neddy"—I said "What did you want to give him a watch for?"

I said, "That is my business, and gave her a shove, and the tall prisoner came across the road and hit me on my left cheek, cutting it open, and knocking me to the ground—the short prisoner then came across and hit me and kicked me, and Bates put her hand over my mouth, and the men put their hands in my pocket and took my money; I called "Police" and "Stop thief" and followed them—I saw their faces dis<lb/>tinctly, and have no doubt about them—I did not lose sight of them—we came on them all three at a coffee-stall in Endell Street, and I gave them into custody.</p>

I am the wife of Henry Keylock, of 56, Orange Street, Bethnal Green—in the early morning of July 23rd I was in Union Street, Spitalfields, going home—the prisoners were sitting on a doorstep; they said, "Down her," and threw me down—five of them assaulted me, the prisoners are four of them—I had a scent-bottle in my pocket, and my purse in my bosom—this is my purse, it was picked up; it contained either 6d. or 5d.—I gave the prisoners in custody without losing sight of them—this is my scent-bottle.</p>

On the way back I met Fred the slaughterman and one of Cornell's carman. Fred said, 'You might go and call Darkey,' pointing to Hosier Lane. I went and knocked at the door. A woman opened the door after knock—ing several times. I asked for Darkey. At last Darkey appeared. I said. 'There is something in the van for you, and I cannot wait, I am busy.' I raised my hand to the carman. I went back to Fletcher and</p>

May, 1894, I engaged the prisoner as a clerk, to act at Ship Passage, at 30s. a week—he was to act as cashier, assisted by a boy, and look after the books—it was not then part of his duty to canvass for orders or receive money—in May or June this year his duties were altered—I said I thought he would make a better canvasser than a book-keeper, and he said he had been a canvasser before—in May I transferred him from the post of clerk to that of canvasser at a salary of 30s. a week and five per cent, commission on all the orders he could get—he had to devote the whole of his time to my service—subsequent to that he came and saw me at Kensington, and asked for some of his commission, and I gave him a note to take to the office—I think he drew something under £5 on account of commission—after he was transferred from the Ship Passage shop his duties were to canvas at 30s. a week and commission—all pay—ments for the orders he obtained should have been made through the desk in the ordinary course by the customers.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Dulwich—I am manager of Slaters, Limited, at the Ship Lane shop—I have looked through the books—the money acknowledged to have been received by these receipts on Slaters, Limited, billheads has never been paid into our office—the prisoner was employed as a canvasser since May last; his duty was to solicit orders, which ought to have been paid for once a month at our shop—I arranged that with the prisoner—the prisoner was engaged by the office—he said the customers wished to pay monthly—monthly payments are our usual practice—since the prisoner has been employed as a canvasser no money for his orders has come direct to us—on July 17th the prisoner came to work, but he has not been since—on July 18th I received this letter in his writing. (<hi rend="italic">This letter stated that the prisoner came to town the day before, but was taken ill and had to return; that his solicitor advised him to inform the prosecutors as to what accounts he had collected and placed to his own use; that it was impossible for him to have lived for the past three months on</hi> £5 10s., <hi rend="italic">the amount he had received on account of commission, the 30s. allowed for expenses being inadequate for the work he had done; that he expected the prosecutors would take extreme measures, and he could not be blamed if he had to expose certain business transactions; that he had no idea what amount he had had, but it was considerable, as latterly he had been pressed on all sides for old and new debts, besides having had the brokers in twice; and that he should not leave Sunbury, but could be found if wanted</hi>)—I also received this letter.

I am a general servant, and single—on 9th April last I was confined of a male child at the Fulham Infirmary—at that time I had two other children, a girl four years old, and a boy three—they were not in the infirmary with me—I remained in the infirmary with the baby for a month—when I left I removed to 18, Claxton Grove, with the baby and my little girl; not the boy—I remained there about a fortnight—about the 14th May I called at the prisoner's house, 10, St. Alban's Terrace, to see a woman who I thought would take care of my baby—I arranged with the prisoner that she should take charge of the baby and the little girl for 8s. a week, and on Thursday, the 16th, she came and fetched the baby and the girl, and she fetched the boy on the following Saturday—we did not come to any terms as to the boy—when she took the baby it had three sets of clothes—it was a very small child, and very delicate—I saw it several times while it was under the prisoner's care—I did not notice that it looked much the worse—the last time I saw it before death was on the Friday night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had known the prisoner all my life, but I had not seen her for about fourteen years; I knew her as a girl—when the baby was born I was told it would require very great care—after I left the infirmary I took the baby to Dr. Bridgeford—that was on the Saturday following—the doctor said it must be fed on Nestles milk and barley-water, and veal broth or chicken broth—it was always very weak and delicate from a day old; it threw up everything it took within an hour, and sometimes less—it was always sick before I gave it into the prisoner's care—I saw it six or seven times while it was in her care; it might have been more—it was always very thin, and I thought sometimes it looked worse—it did not suffer from diarrhoea while with me; not sufficient for me to notice it; it was not serious—the vomit was very bad—the prisoner very often came to see me about the baby while it was with her—she told me that Dr. Bridgeford said it was very bad, and that he did not think it would live more than a fortnight or three weeks, and that he said, "Stop the milk and give it veal and chicken broth," and that she had done so—I believe she did that on the Wednesday after Whit-Sunday—I cannot fix the date—after that, on one occasion when I went to see her, she told me she was giving it veal broth—she always seemed very fond of the child—she occupied three rooms; I could not tell how she used them at night—I think some of the children slept in her room; I know my child did, with her; I did not see that—when I saw it it was in the front room, in the daytime—the bed was untidy, but not dirty; only such as one would expect it to be with young children about it—one evening I undressed the baby at St. Alban's Terrace—the clothes did not seem dirty, nor its body—it looked as if it had been bathed during the day—I had not many clothes for it, but enough—I gave it three changes—when it was with me I washed it twice a day, on account of its being sick; that would increase the trouble of keeping it clean—the boy of three was at St. Alban's Terrace two days after the baby—his habits were very dirty, and would account for the very bad smell in the room—the prisoner's husband went to work every day from early morning, and returned about half-past six—I have been</p>

               <p>there sometimes when the prisoner was out—I then found her eldest boy of about fourteen looking after the children—Mr. Davis was also at home in the evening—I have seen him there after he came home from his work—I don't think more than once—my other children were healthy and clean—I had only once seen the prisoner the worse for drink—that was the night I went with her to the doctor—I do not remember her telling me on any occasion, while the child was with her, that she had called her lodger up to see the child, and that the lodger said she thought the child was dying.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I saw the child six or seven times between 16th May and 19th June—it may have been more—the boy who was looking after the children goes to work in the daytime—I only went once with the prisoner and the child to the doctor—she paid the doctor the first time—I gave her money twice; once I sent the money, and once I left it to go to the doctor with—the room in which the child was kept was not dirty, it was not tidy, not so cleanly as I should keep it—the child vomited while it was in the infirmary—it was fed by the bottle—it increased in weight eleven ounces while in the infirmary—I weighed it myself—I nursed it, and it also had the bottle—the prisoner had two children besides the deceased, one seven and one five.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a nurse in the Fulham Infirmary—the last witness was confined there of a male child on 9th April this year; it was full-timed child; I weighed it, it weighed about 6 lbs.—to the best of my recollection, it was fed on cow's milk, and the mother also fed it—it took its food all right—while under my care it was not suffering from constant vomit or diarrhoea—when it left it weighted 6 lbs. 11 oz.; I can't remember whether I weighed it then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have a number of babies under my observation at the infirmary; during that month I had about twenty—my attention was particularly called to this child, because I was fond of it, it seemed a child that would require a good deal of taking care of—it may have been sick, as children are, but it was not actually vomiting—it would not be correct to say that it threw up its food within an hour—I saw it every day during the month; of course I was in and out of the ward day and night—it was fed both on cow's milk and the mother's, but she had not sufficient milk to feed it—I said before the Magistrate, "So far as I can remember, it took its food all right."</p>

I am the wife of Albert Grain, of 5, St. Alban's Terrace, Fulham—I know the prisoner; she lives at No. 10 in the same terrace—I remember the child she took care of, Herbert Baxter, after it came, about 2nd or 3rd of June—the prisoner's daughter, Mary Davis, had it then; she is seven years old—the child was very dirty; its clothes were rather dirty—I saw it three times altogether, and each time it seemed to get worse with regard to dirt—I have three children, it was not kept as I keep mine—the terrace is not a thoroughfare; there is only one entrance—if the prisoner had to leave the terrace, she would have to pass my door—I was not always at the door—sometimes she would go out at ten in the morning, and return, sometimes at four, sometimes six, three or four times a week—sometimes she would be sober, sometimes the worse for drink—I could not say exactly how often; I should say about a dozen times, when she was not fit to look after children—I remember the day</p>

                  </hi>. I am single—I lodged with the prisoner for the last fourteen months—I remember Miss Baxter's child coming there on the 16th of May—her husband went to work, very often at twenty minutes past seven; he returned at all times in the evening; he was out during the day—the prisoner had three children—the boy William went to work with his father; George, the eldest, did not go to work; the other boy is a little fellow, and goes to school; the girl Mary is about seven—Mrs. Mitton was a lodger, and lived downstairs—she did not go out to work; there was no other lodger—when the prisoner went out no one was left to look after the children, as I know of—on 18th June she came to my room between half-past ten and eleven at night, the worse for drink—she sat on the bed, and asked me to go for some beer—I did so, and when I came back she was asleep on my bed—she remained there till daylight next morning—I awoke her; I was aroused by my own child—I heard the deceased baby cry and I woke her—on the 19th she was conducted home by the police the worse for drink—I don't know how long she had been out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I sometimes went into the room where the children were when I came home from work—if I went in of a morning the room might be a little out of the way; in the evening it sometimes was, and sometimes not; the children and the room were then tidy—it did not always look clean of an evening—I said before the Magistrate: "The child generally looked clean in the evening, but would be dirty the first thing in the morning"—the child looked very ill from the first—in the morning it looked as if it had been vomiting in the night—I saw it fed with veal broth, it had three or four spoonfuls, that was on the 19th, in my room; it had been washed then—the prisoner brought it in and showed it to me, and placed it on my bed—it looked very delicate the first day it came there; it looked as if it required a great deal of care and attention to keep it alive.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It was on the day of its death that the prisoner brought it into my room and gave it the veal broth, between a quarter and half-past nine in the morning; it looked very ill then—I did not see it again till it was dead—I came home to dinner at one, I did nor see it then—I don't know whether the prisoner was in at one—I should say that I went into the room three or four times during the week; the prisoner called me in—I went into the front room; there was no bed in the front room, only a sofa—I can't say whether the prisoner and her husband slept in that room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner, of Baron's Court Road—on June 13th the prisoner brought the deceased child to my surgery, and said it was suffering from vomiting and diarrhoea—I did not find any disease—I ordered her to put barley-water with the milk, and give the child some brandy—she brought it again on June 17th, it had not improved—I failed to find any organic disease—I told her to leave off giving the child milk, and to give it mutton broth, veal broth, and chicken broth mixed with barley-water. That was the last time I saw the child.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I first saw it it was very emaciated—I did not assign as a cause for the diarrhoea and vomiting improper feeding. I recollect telling the Coroner "I think I only saw it twice. The child had diarrhoea and vomiting and was very emaciated—I found no disease." I assigned the cause to be improper feeding; she said, I think, that she fed it with cow's milk—I meant to say that the milk did not agree with the child, not that she was not giving it food—the prisoner appeared anxious about the child. I told her it would die—she said something about taking it to the Children's Hospital, which I said was the best thing she could do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I judged of the effect of the food by the condition of the child—when a child does not improve under the diet it is having I alter it, and very often knock off milk altogether for a day or two—sour milk would cause vomiting and diarrhoea—it may arise from the milk or in the bottle without being aware of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I practice at 13, Wimpole Street, and am a master in surgery of the London University and F.R.C.S.—on 23rd June I, in company with Dr. Maddison, made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the child—it was a full term child and weighed 51/4 lbs.—the normal weight of a child of about 6 lbs. at birth would be between 8 and 9 lbs. at two months—they vary much according to conditions, but I am speaking of the ratio at which the child throve while in the Infirmary—there was no disease of any organ of the body—the stomach and intestines were empty—there were no signs of congestion—there was nothing to lead me to suppose the child was unable to digest its food except the extreme emaciation—it could</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189509090033"/>
               <p>not have had food in any quantity for many hours before death—I did not see the child alive—I do not think it could have taken food in any quantity—it was so exhausted that it was physically unable to swallow much—I saw no traces of diarrhoea and vomiting, which I should expect to find if persistent—if a child gains eleven ounces in weight during the first few weeks of its life it shows that it is able to digest its food and has thriven—the child was in an extremely emaciated condition, due in my opinion to the want of a proper amount and character of food—going for a long time without food would reduce it to that condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not think if diarrhoea and vomiting (though persistent) had ceased a few days before death that signs of congestion would have disappeared to the extent they had. As a medical proposition it would be correct to say that if persistent vomiting had ceased a week before death congestion might disappear; but then there would be no reason why the child should die. The meaning of the word diarrhoea is merely a flux. I think the child would probably die from collapse in twenty-four hours if it were so weak as to be unable to take food.</p>

I was on duty at the Police-station on July 20th when the prisoner and Mrs. Hacker were brought in—they both desired to make a statement—I cautioned them—the prisoner's statement was taken down and read over to him and signed by him. [Read.] "Highgate, July 20th, 1895. William Moore. I was in the front-room in bed and asleep. Mrs. Hacker and my wife were rowing and caused me to wake. When I got outside the door I saw my wife and Mrs. Hacker. I believe they were fighting. I parted them and pushed my wife indoors. She then opened the door and came out with a knife in her hand, and said she would stick it into me, or through me, or something to that effect. I don't know exactly what she did gay. I told her to go in again and shut the door. She went in and I shut the door, and then went into the front-room. I thought I heard my wife fall, and when I went into the back room she was sitting sideways on a chair as if she had fallen; her head was on the table. I went to her and lifted her head up—she looked pale and white. I went to a constable and asked him where the nearest doctor was, and the constable accompanied me to Doctor Bridgeford's at Dartmouth Park Hill. I cannot say anything more."</p>

I asked the prisoner how the black eyes came about—I don't think he said anything—he said some<lb/>thing about his pushing her, and her falling against something, and I said that would not account for the black eyes—he said nothing further—the injury at the back of the neck was undoubtedly the cause of death—she would not lire a minute.</p>

The effusion of blood in the soft tissues was streaky, such as would result from a blow rather than a fall against any hard substance—I should say the black eyes were caused in the usual way, by a direct blow.</p>

In September, 1894, I was manager of Mr. Whiteley's estate agency department—he is the owner of the house, 133, Queen's Road, Bayswater—before the end of March, Mr. Hayes, a house-agent, who I knew, introduced North to me with a view to his becoming a tenant of the house, and the female prisoner was introduced to me as Mrs. North—I saw her about twice before the house was taken—he took possession at Michaelmas under this agreement for three years at £60 a year for the first year, and £63 afterwards—the Christmas quarter's rent was paid but not the Lady Day—about the end of April I saw North and said I thought it was about time the rent was paid—he said, "Well, I must refer you to my wife for that"—she was with him, they were both coming out of the house—she said nothing—on April 28th Mr. Hayes came to my office with Greenslade; she said that she was not Mrs. North, but his lodger, Miss Greenslade, and that all the property in the house belonged to her—I reported that to Mr. Whiteley, and on April 30th he signed a distress warrant authorising me to levy for the rent—I executed the warrant the same day; and on May 3rd this notice and declaration under the Lodgers' Goods Protection Act was served on me signed A. Greenslade, 103, Queen's Road. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that North had no right or title to the goods, of which a list was enclosed, and that they were Greenslade's property.</hi>)—I refused to withdraw the distress and a summons was taken out at the Police-court—I was there on May 2nd and 29th, and saw the document she produced in search of her claim. (<hi rend="italic">Dated March</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1892)—these are the monthly receipts she produced for £2, and this is the rent-book showing the payment of her rent to North.</p>

                  </hi>. I trade with Alexander Joseph, my father, at 75, Farringdon Road, Clerkenwell, as a rag and metal merchant—we em<lb/>ployed some two hundred hands, among others Vickers, up to the time of his arrest, as a clerk at 32s. a week—he has been with us for a little over two years—up to the time of our fire we believed he was an honest man—Zimmerman, Cohen, and Harris were customers—we dealt with them in rags and metal—Zimmerman's address was 21, Tenter Street South; Cohen's business address on the invoices was 12, Little Aile Street, and Harris's address was 12, Hanbury Street, Spitalfields—Zimmerman has been a customer since November of last year—his account has con<lb/>siderably increased—Cohen has been a customer since May 1895, and Harris since April 1895—I had not the remotest idea the three defendants were connected—we have six or seven departments; the goods sent to us differing in character—they have to be sorted out on different floors according to their different qualities—we have carts, and hire about twenty horses a day—if a customer wants to send a load of goods we send a horse and cart—the three prisoners used their own—different carmen came—a delivery note conies with the goods—that note is handed to the salesman who checks the goods and signs the note with his name—it is then placed on Vickers' desk—it is his duty to enter up the note after the goods are sorted and reported on into a bought book, and that is priced by myself—Vickers makes out a copy of goods sold to A. Joseph, that is checked by the head clerk, and I draw a cheque in the customer's favour to that amount, the cheque being crossed or handed to him as he desires—the three prisoners called when cheques were not posted regularly, through pressure of business—they sent us billheads with their printed headings—on July 1st goods were sent by Zimmerman of which No. 21 is the delivery note—the weights appearing in the note—I know the writing is his—it has been ticked and signed, and the scalesman's weight put in my office, the usual place—in consequence of something I heard Mr. Glover took this copy of that note, and I checked it—it was put in the right-hand coiner of Mr. Glover's desk—this No. 22 is an accurate copy of the delivery note as I first saw it—I saw Vickers take the delivery note and a piece of blacklead out of his pocket und alter various figures and enter it up in the bought book—this is the entry at folio 404 which I saw Vickers make—it corresponds with the delivery note as it now appears, but not with the copy—1 qr. 6 lbs. has been altered to 2 cwt. 1 qr. 6 lbs.; 2 qrs. 6 lbs. of old red to 1 cwt. 2 qrs. 6 lbs; 1 qr. 1 lb. of stocking to 1 cwt. 1 qr. 1 lb; 2 qrs. 24 lbs. of</p>

               <p>white flannel to 3 qrs. 24 lbs; 1 qr. 6 lbs. of blue serge to 1 cwt. 1 qr. 6 lbs.; 1 qr. of old merino to 1 qr. 61bs.—the notes were always in pencil—in the bought book I put my prices—Vickers worked out the figures—the total of the invoice made out was £14 14s. (No. 23)—in drawing the cheque I intentionally made it £14 4s.—Zimmerman called for it—he came back some time afterwards and said I had made a mistake in his account—I said, "Have I, how much do you make it 1"—" £14 14s."—" Are you certain of it?"—"Yes, here is the note"—I said, "I beg your pardon," altered the amount, gave him the cheque for that, and crossed it—it was paid by the London Joint-Stock Bank through his bank, the Cripplegate Bank—the value of the goods, according to the original note, was £9 18s. Id.—there was an excess of £4 15s. 11d. on that one invoice—I drew the first cheque wrongly, under the solicitor's advice—I drew the cheque on the faith of the invoice produced by Vickers, believing it to be a true invoice—No. 25 is another delivery note of Zimmerman, dated July 3rd—that was checked by the scalesman, and altered by Vickers on 4th—I had taken the copy (No. 26) that morning—there are increases in the weights—the invoice (No. 27) shows a total of £12 0s. 11d. in Vickers' writing, the original note amounting to £5 14s.—I did not draw that cheque—on July 2nd a load of goods, with delivery note No. 13, purported to come from Harris—it is Zimmerman's writing—it was placed in the safe on the 3rd—Mr. Glover and I copied it in the same way as the other note—this is the copy (No. 14)—it was kept in the safe in a locked drawer—I saw Vickers alter the figures with a blacklead pencil, as before—in the bought book I find the entry at page 410—the invoice is made out for £15 2s. Id.—I made a mistake in the cheque, making it £14 2s. Id., which I gave to Harris—he went away, but came back in an hour's time, and said, "You have made a mistake"—I said, "What do you mean?"—he said, "the amount of your account is £15 2s. Id"—"Are you quite sure?"—" Yes; I wish you to give me another sovereign"—I said, "I will alter the cheque," and I altered it, initialled it, gave it him, and he took it away—the difference on that transaction was £8 7s. 5d.—on 1st July a load of goods with this delivery note (No. 17) came from Cohen—it was checked by the scalesman in the ordinary way, and put in the safe—Mr. Glover and I made this copy (No. 18 and put it away in Mr. Glover's drawer—I find Vickers' entry in the bought book at 404—the invoice (No. 19) is £13 5s. 9d.—this is my cheque for £13 5s. 9d—the proper weights show the value of £9 11s. 9d.—there is an excess of £3 15s.—Cohen called for the cheque, and I told him I would send it by post, which I did the same evening—the endorsement is "S. Cohen," in Zimmerman's writing—on 5th or 6th July I gave information to Police Inspector Leach, in consequence of which the prisoners were arrested and charged—a search was made for documents at Zimmerman's place—No. 29, with the printed heading of "S. Harris, Rag Merchant 11, Hanbury Street, Spitalfields," was found there—it shows a list of goods in Zimmerman's writing—when I started business with Harris, about April or May 1875, he called at my office and asked me for prices, and I put the prices in blue pencil in No. 29, and told him the goods must be of first-class quality at those prices—No. 28 is an invoice of rags bought by Zimmerman of Aaron's,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189509090046"/>
               <p>dated June 21st, 1885—Zimmerman was sending in goods nearly every day—in the bought book I find entries of the same kind of goods sent in tome, but much less money on June 21st, 22nd, 23rd, and 24th—these cheques are drawn on the Cripplegate Bank by Zimmerman in favour of Harris and Cohen—the first is dated April 29th, and the last July 1st—some are Zimmerman's writing—one is drawn by S. Barnett—these Cheques are mine—the one drawn to S. Cohen for £9 8s. 3d., and the one for £7 5s. 10d. payable to Harris, of June 14th, are endorsed by Zimmerman—we have a rigid rule in our establishment that clerks are not to associate in any way with customers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know Cohen's writing—nor Harris's—I have never seen them write—the only conversations I have had with Cohen was when he came and asked me to buy goods and I said "Yes," and when he has called for his accounts I have mentioned—the goods were inferior—we have no computations here of the accounts that are incorrect—before business commenced Harris brought a list of goods which I priced—I had done business with him a considerable time ago, which was broken off—I have seen the three prisoners together—I saw Harris go outside my place with cheques round to the left and up the street to Cohen and Cohen came to me and I said "We will send the cheque on"—I placed confi<lb/>dence in Vickere, and found him correct, till my suspicions were aroused—the scalesman would alter the weights, if found incorrect, and Vickers would book them accordingly—I do not deal in bones—the weighing is not rough, but correct to half a pound—the weighers are not ignorant men—the goods are collected from large dealers and Her Majesty's dockyards, and sold by auction by the cwt.—my solicitor has instructed you on my behalf—I have dealt with Zimmerman some years—I forbid him my place some time ago, when information came to me that he was in connivance with one of my managers, and I dismissed the manager—after my great trouble, with my fire and other things, I com<lb/>menced business with him again—there are unpaid accounts between us—£20 to £30 is due to him, subject to this, for goods delivered since these proceedings commenced—since I first went to the police, and whilst the prisoners were being watched I pursued the same practice—I do not believe it is to the value of from £50 to £70; £40 at the most—my books are not here—the question was put to me at the Police-court, and I answered, not wilfully, incorrectly—I speak from memory—you may be correct—I consulted my solicitor; I went to Mr. Bodkin, who told me this was conspiracy and fraud—the goods were still coming in—Vickers was still retained—I say he continued to falsify my books, in Conjunction with Zimmerman—there is one little account due to Harris, of £5 or £6, not £40 or £60, for one small load delivered a day or two before his arrest—he was arrested on the Monday—they were delivered on the Friday—Cohen has a small account for £6 or £7—for which he got £14 or £15—I owe him £6 or £7—I can send for the books—I have been served with a garnishee order, which has nothing to do with this case—Mr. Barnett (solicitor for Zim<lb/>merman) told me so—it is for money owing to Aaron—my scalesmen are not here—I can send for them—they were at the Police-court but not called.</p>

               <p>my solicitor on a Thursday—I was then in communication with the police—they knew I was seeking advice elsewhere—Harris and Cohen sent in goods very frequently—we have three scalesmen who weigh about fifty loads a day—when the delivery note is put on the shelf signed by the scalesman Vickers had no authority but to treat it as accurate—there are in one note half a dozen or more different kinds—the scalesman weighs each alleged weight of the sender in a separate bag—the scales<lb/>man ticks each weight, and it is the ticks and the signature we look at.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">a prisoner</hi>). I was a clerk employed by Mr. Joseph for about two years and five months—my duties were to enter details into the bought book for Mr. Joseph to price opposite each item—the book being handed back to me I worked out the figure and copied it in an invoice form and handed it back to Mr. Joseph—upon that form Mr. Joseph would draw cheques for the customers—I first knew Zimmerman as a customer of Mr. Joseph about November at the office—I had regular hours and met him going out to dinner—the first time I spoke to him was a week or a fortnight after a transaction with Hardeman—I met Zimmerman at the Castle public-house where I went for my meals—he would say "Is my account ready?" and I would say "Yes" if it was, or "No"—this was repeated several days, until I told him the office was the proper place to make inquiries—he complained of waiting a long time and invariably offered me a glass which I refused—one day he made a suggestion which I refused—he asked me if I would like to make a few pounds easily—I said "No, I will have nothing, to do with it"—he came the next day, and as I saw what he intended I had my dinner elsewhere, but he spoke to me at the railway station—one day he came to the public-house, and said, "Why do not you do that?"—I said, "I will have nothing to do with it"—he said, "I know you are doing it with Hardeman"—then I had no alternative but to give way to him—I said, "Who told you?"—he said, "Never mind; you do not want to know"—I said, "It is very funny"—he said, "Are you going to do it?"—I said, "Yes; I will do it," and I said, "How do you do this, affair?"—he said, "This is what we will do; we will send goods in; you alter the weights in the notes in some cases, the cwts. and in some less"—I agreed to do that—he continued to send goods in—he stopped calling personally at the office—I made alterations in the notes, sometimes a cwt. sometimes less, opposite the various items—I entered into the bought book the notes as altered—the first time I began to do that was the beginning of March this year—after some time Zimmerman said, "you can make more money; I can introduce you to a couple more-persons"—"I said I will not do it"—he introduced Harris to work the same process—"If you like," he said, "We can do a further deal"—I had no alternative—he said, "I have a relation; my brother-in-law lives in Scotland. I shall bring him all the way from Scotland, and nominally employ him as my foreman, and give him so much a week"—his name was Simon Cohen—Harris and Cohen are the two defendants—I was to</p>

                  </hi>. I am a furrier of 118, Houndsditch—in October, 1893, I went by the steamship <hi rend="italic">Holker</hi> to Philadelphia—I took my luggage on board in the Victoria Docks; I left it in charge of chief steward Morgan—I joined the steamer at Swansea—I saw my luggage all right—in consequence of my instructions my things were unpacked and placed in the empty berths—when I got near Philadelphia I gave instructions to Morgan to pack them up again—I saw the prisoner helping to pack them—I was not there the whole time—when I landed my luggage was supposed to be sent to the Custom House—when I went there a couple of days afterwards I looked at ray luggage and there were eight coats short, value £46—the trunks had been taken direct from the ship to the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I declared the goods when the Customs Officer boarded the ship at Philadelphia—I discovered the loss when I went to pay duty two days afterwards—one coat was given to me a long while after in Philadelphia—the goods were not smuggled into America—they were landed in one place and not sent to David Holker's—you did not accompany me to take some to the Second Lombard to a Jewish pawnbroker's, named Solomon—none were left at 512, King Street at a broker's, a cousin of my witness—I had not sold or given a coat to anyone—I did not cause a witness to prosecute his own son to get the coat back, because I did not claim it, as it was smuggled—the police did not inform me where to get the coat that was returned.</p>

                  </hi>. In October 1893 I was chief steward on board the steamship <hi rend="italic">Holker</hi>, and Mr. Levy left his luggage in my charge in the Victoria Docks—he joined the ship at Swansea a few days afterwards—in consequence of his instructions a day or two afterwards I laid the luggage out in the spare berths, so that moths could not get to them—when rear<lb/>ing Philadelphia he told me to pack them up again—I had to go ashore for provisions, and asked the prisoner, the second steward, to continue packing—when I came back, I said, "Have you got them all ready, all packed up?"—he said, "Yes, everyone"—we left Swansea on the 25th, and arrived at Philadelphia sixteen or seventeen days after—these are some of Mr. Levy's goods that were on board—the prisoner gave orders to put the goods in a cart—I asked him, and ho said he was going to take hem to the Custom House—I saw him go away with the luggage—we returned to London December 3rd, 1893, according to my note; I have a bad memory—we went into the Victoria Dock—I did not count the coats in the berths—I left them just as I had taken them out.</p>

That when the carman taxed Levy he confessed he had no money, and Levy asked the prisoner to buy them, which he did, and got them on board his ship to avoid their becoming American property, brought them to England, and pawned them. That he was told that Morgan's nephew had been taking some of the goods round Philadelphia to sell or pawn; that Levy caused Godfrey Levy to prosecute his own son to obtain possession of a coat back again, which he dared not do himself, having smuggled the goods into America; and that if he had stolen the good he might have been prosecuted in America, or when the ship returned to England, and he would not have renewed the interest on the tickets. Morgan had kept one coat until this year, and he (the prisoner) made no secret of having the coats, and his address was known.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am Rector of Exeter College, Oxford—a young man named Thomas Erskine Williams was an under<lb/>graduate there—he took his degree in June 1894, being then about twenty-one years of age—on November 19th last year this letter was left for me at my house in the College on the same day the prisoner called on me; I saw him twice—he said he was the person who had left the letter (<hi rend="italic">letters read</hi>: "Oxford, 19 11. '94. <hi rend="smallCaps">REV. AND DEAR SIR</hi>,—If at liberty, I should feel glad of an interview. It is in re a Mr. T. E. Williams, late Exeter College.

E. Williams; that the girl was in a village school near Mr. Williams' home; that he had seduced her, and she had become pregnant; that he brought the girl to</p>

               <p>Oxford, and had sent her to New York; that he himself became ac<lb/>quainted with the case in New York, and took it up from compassion for the girl; that he came to Liverpool with her, and took or sent her to London, and placed her in a home; that Mr. Williams got her out of the home at night, and was found by him (the prisoner) and the police with the girl later—he showed me two letters and a card—I recognised the letters as Mr. Williams' handwriting, but I was not so certain of the card—I noticed that the letters were undated—these are the letters, they are addressed, "To my Dear Kate," and signed, "T. E. Williams"—I recognised the card at Bow Street, and I recognise it now.</p>

Mr. Williams, the father—he talked a good deal about himself, more or less confidentially, also about the case—he said he had incurred great expense over it, and he thought that Mr. Williams' family should pay part of it—he showed me a copy of a letter pro<lb/>fessedly written by himself to Mr. Williams from Oxford; and also again produced the two letters to Kate Hansford, and offered to leave them with me—I declined to take them—on the 21st I had written to the Rev. Mr. Williams, and had received a reply to that and other letters—I told the prisoner if he was staying in Oxford to see me again on the evening of the 23rd, but he did not come—on the 24th I received these two letters from him; I believe they are in the same writing as the first—(<hi rend="italic">These wire headed</hi>: "The Anglo-Generale and United States Press and Enquiry Bureau, also Business, Commission and Trading Agency, 6, Staple Inn, London, W.C., England."

               <p>heard from Rev. Mr. W., senr., I should like to know what lines his reply runs on. Although I am ill and unable to be about much should be glad to see you before leaving, and by an appointed time I will call.

I now enclose you a dated letter from Mr. and Mrs. Hans<lb/>ford relative to this case. I did not tell you before that the girl is now fifteen, and it is the second child she has had by this villain, so how can her character be assured. The more you inquire the dirtier you will find. I held papers over his head till he took his degree and, understand me fully, all Mr. Williams knows is what I suggested to his son when she had the last child some few weeks ago. I put my foot into it by intervening, and I mean either to have satisfaction, or settlement in full. The case is the blackest ever known—I want ease of mind only—I will make you and Williams one offer, I will burn all the matter in his or your presence, accept all risk and stay the thing on receipt of £12, half of cost of stamps, or I will hand them over to the proper authorities and stand its merits. Kindly return by bearer the enclosed letter, and you can settle for Mr. W. if you like; easy to wire; the more investigation shows his villainy, and proceed the reference to her character is absurd; the letters are all this year's date.—Yours respectfully, <hi rend="smallCaps">G. A. PERKINS</hi>.")—I replied to that letter and made a memorandum of my reply on that document That letter enclosed a letter purporting to be from Mrs. Hansford—I returned it to the prisoner—I did not see him again till I saw him at Bow Street—I had no further correspondence with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I believe at our second interview you showed me this letter; I just glanced through it—it is addressed to the Rev. F. Williams, Bettisscombe, Dorsetshire—(<hi rend="italic">This was a long letter, refer ring in, strong terms to the misconduct of Mr. Williams' son and to the disgrace of a public exposure, concluding, "Let your son come to see me, or I will him, maybe I could do him some good</hi>")—You had two interviews with me, on the 19th and the 21st—you never lunched at my house—I gave you some refreshment on the Monday evening, because you said you had come from London to see me, and I thought you were going back by train—I made no appointment for the 23rd; I never expected to see you—I never wrote to Mr. Williams till the 21st—I saw a supposed copy letter of Mr. Williams' on the 21st; it was dated the 20th—young Mr. Williams was rusticated for a year in 1893 for bringing a young woman into the College, and giving her tea in his rooms—the girl you spoke to me about was Kate Hansford; she was evidently a different person—I cannot recall the words that were on the card I saw on the 19th—I said if I had known that young Williams had ruined Miss Hansford I should certainly not have let him come back to College—I said if that offence had been committed in Oxford it would have been brought before the Vice-Chancellor, but as it was in Hampshire he would not be concerned with it; I said bringing a girl into the College was vice, but not criminal—I knew nothing of the Hansford case till I saw you—I recognised young Williams' writing immediately on seeing the letters—you may have said that you would not go down to see Mr. Williams unless your expenses were paid; expenses incurred on behalf of Hansford, not on account of both girls—I knew</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189509090056"/>
               <p>nothing of Hansford's existence in 1894—I stated before the Magistrate that I was not aware that Williams paid the costs of her confinement—I may have said that the best thing for him to do was to go to Australia—I heard nothing about his going there until long after this case; it was some time after the whole thing was blown up—you told me you wanted to get clear of the whole transaction relating to young Williams—the letter from the Rev. Mr. Williams was received by me on the 23rd, after I had seen you, and I never saw you after—I said I thought you were entitled to be reimbursed the money you expended on behalf of Hansford—I may very likely have thanked you; I should have thanked any honest man—I could not say positively that it was young Williams' intention to be ordained—I informed you that if he were guilty he could not possibly be ordained in any English diocese, but that he might try and get ordained in the Colonies; I believed your story—I said in the case of a man expelled the University for a crime it was usual to write to the Archbishops, in order that he might never be able to seek Holy Orders—I was not on intimate terms with young Williams—I was not aware that you were in the College on Sunday, the 18th; you told me you were—the last time I saw the Rev. Mr. Williams was in the summer of 1894, I only saw him for a minute or two, I met him with his daughters; I exchanged greetings, nothing more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Two letters at the Prisoner's request were put in and ready one from the witness to the Rev. F.

I am the Rector of Bettiscombe, Dorset<lb/>shire—my son, Thomas Erskine Williams, is 22 years of age—he was at Exeter College, Oxford, and took his degree in June 1894—I did not then know the prisoner—I received this letter:—"Care of Fennells, 29, Catherine Street, Strand, London, W.C., November 26th, 1894: "Sir—I hold all the letters now, having obtained them as between your son and this girl K. M. Hansford. The Rev. Dr. Jackson has perused most of the incriminating ones. I have been called upon to hand them back but refused. As I found out a great deal of the statement of girl exaggerated, I have had abuse and also various incidental expenses <hi rend="italic">re</hi> this affair and have letters from Messrs.

I can also procure the information by girl if you want it. I will bring the letters or send them if you will defray part costs. I am out over <hi rend="italic">same.

               <p>but I should have to defray certain costs to procure the information. An interview between us anyway would not tend to misplaced object in advantage—Very respectfully yours—Geo. A.

There are several fast trains running there from Waterloo and you could return to London in the evening. I shall probably be there by the train arriving from the West at about 1.30, yours truly, F.

I held them over during my illness and absence from the country as your <hi rend="italic">son</hi> knows to allow him to take his degree, my letter to him some months since shews that I should never taken the way I have if it had not been for his <hi rend="italic">friends.</hi> Dr. Jackson is well aware that I asked (and <hi rend="italic">earnestly</hi> asked) no harm done unless <hi rend="italic">compulsory</hi> toward him.

[<hi rend="italic">Arranging to meet at Salisbury on Friday and stating "I think that you have been very much deceived as to the whole bearing of facts.</hi>"] I received this 3rd Dec, 1894, etc. "Sir—Yours again duly to hand. I beg to inform you <hi rend="italic">that</hi> I am in no<lb/>way whatever deceived, your long letter to the Rector of Exeter was all unnecessary, also yours in ignorance to Messrs.

I have been to Bridport also to your neighbourhood, and know the whole history of the <hi rend="italic">two.</hi> I am surprised at you, and deceived also by the way you address anyone in dictating terms, etc. Allow me to say further I know what to do and am going to act now according to my first instructions.

I answered that by letter of 5th December (<hi rend="italic">refusing to comply, asking for the letters the son who was responsible for them being dependent on him</hi>). Then I received this letter of 6th Dec.: "Sir,—Yours to hand, bearing date 5th inst., for which I thank you. Shall I then hand all letters over to Mr. Hugh Lee, the Ec'll. Soltr. to the Arch.

I am sure I would not receive a <hi rend="italic">cent</hi> from you if not freely in <hi rend="italic">honour</hi> of what I have done and can do further. I am well known in London, and have had many complicated affairs. But never before have I had so much unnecessary correspondence, especially after laying plain facts down which are stubborn things to remove. I am out pocket over £60—sixty pounds in hard money. But never mind, I asked £5 for my expenses, and I was low enough. I do not like to act harshly after waiting and <hi rend="italic">waiting</hi> many obstacles. But I intend, as I said, disposing of this within ten days. I can have satisfac<lb/>tion for my trouble and expense, which would, in a measure, be somewhat consoling. Unless I have a reply here Monday noon I shall call at No. 1, Sanctuary, Westminster, and leave papers, etc., which will in some measure put a stop to everything, so far as I am concerned. I am editor of a London magazine (<hi rend="italic">The Sectarian Monthly) when here</hi>. If I do not hear per return my conscience is clear, and I am free to act as I see fit. I enclose you copy of one of his letters, and also one from Mr. and Mrs. H. for your perusal, and I am very respectfully yours, Geo. A. Perkins.

(<hi rend="italic">One enclosure referred to was from</hi> "T.E.W.," Oxford College, to "My dear Kate," and the envelope was dated 8th September, it expressed sorrow for not writing, and that she was in pain and "If anything happens don't mind telling my name, I really don't mind a bit, because it is not your fault you are too good a girl to suffer for me." Then there is a postscript, "How can you in face of this letter and others, and his cards with his own writing on as to <hi rend="italic">appointments</hi>, declare <hi rend="italic">against</hi> her character <hi rend="italic">at the age.</hi> And can he enter Holy Orders or the <hi rend="italic">English Bar</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">face of</hi> it.

               <p>this occurred with Miss Hansford—the child was born in September 1891—all I know about the girl being in a home was from a letter from Seagrove and Woods, and my short reply writing for further information, they sent no further reply—they mentioned they had seen Mr. Perkins (in letters of March 16th and 19th, 1894)—I made an appointment with you because I knew you had letters from my son, and I thought you would hand them over—Dr. Jackson had told me—the letters are in and speak for themselves—I think the girl will be twenty this month—my son did not tell me of his appointment of the December 14th with you; it is the invention of your brain—he could not possibly tell me, if any arrangement was made you could produce the letters—I think my son told me the girl had written him for money in the Vacation—Bridport is about seven miles from Baddiscombe—this visiting-card and these two letters are in my son's writing—the card says "Church," I know nothing of it, but seven miles is some distance for an appointment—the suggestion would be in the letter; it is some months since I have seen any of those letters—the fare from London to Charmouth is 22s. second-class, 44s. return—to the best of my knowledge there was no block in the main roads last November and December—Chard Junction is my station—you need not have come sixty-eight miles—I did not weigh my words; my son had no money of his own; he was entirely dependent on me—he did not come into a legacy at twenty-one—I gave letters to the police early in August, very likely on Tuesday, 6th—I think the detective said he had called at Mrs. Hansford's on his way to me—you had no right to demand £5 for expenses—I had your letter to my son from March 1894 till it was in the hands of the detective—when I sent money in 1891 I was not aware my son had been wronging the girl; I simply wrote her a kind letter sending £2 or £3—my son might have sent her money for funeral, confinement, and doctor's fees in 1892; he is a kind-hearted fellow—I do not know what he did in 1891, he could only send a small sum. I am not aware of his sending her money in March 1894—my son sailed for Australia on December 15th, 1894. I am not aware that he intended visiting Oxford, he could not without my knowledge—I have not received his letters, he always had his own—I know nothing of his visit to London in the spring of 1894—the detective told me he thought they had caught a man who had been preying on the public for some time and had found letters in his possession from me and they wished me to come forward—I did not want to expose my poor boy or I should have wanted to prosecute—he had not then been exposed in the way he is now—you are the cause of it originally—I do not wish to say a word against the girl, she is not on her trial—I sent you 10s. and wrote the letter of December 11th, 1894; and I could have met you on 12th or 13th if you had wished—the fare from Waterloo to Templecombe is 9s. 10d.—your letters were sufficient to tell me what you were without the detective—they are not straightforward: by demanding money, threatening with regard to the Vigilance Association, and things of that kind I could see it was a plan to get money—I am not aware of a young man being expelled from the Church through my son in 1894—I knew nothing about the Hansford affair till May 1892.</p>

Mr. Williams by him"—he was brought before the Magistrate, the matter was gone into, and he wrote me this letter from the prison on August 7th—the other letters are the same writing. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner requested his letter from H. M. Prison Holloway, dated August</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1895, <hi rend="italic">to Sergeant Hailstone, to be read, in which he repeated in detail many of his statements, and stated that he could prove a "legal retainer"</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I had another letter from you from the prison before that (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—you did not offer to give me all the necessary information and assist in these inquiries—you say, "Come and see me"—I did not notice this, "I should take it as a favour if I can see you," and, "Anything I can say in the investigation re myself I will"—I read that letter before I went into the country—it is dated July 23rd, 1895—I believe I went to Dorset on the 5th and 6th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Mrs. Hansford gave me two letters in the same writing dated 6th and 9th, then I saw the Rev. F. Williams and got his letters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's statement before the Magistrate</hi> "Your worship, I beg to draw your attention to the fact that on my second remand I was distinctly told by the Court that on my next appearance the charge</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189509090068"/>
               <p>on the warrant should be completed. On my next appearance I was pre<lb/>pared with a complete answer to such charge, and also with a letter in the prosecutor's own handwriting, clearly removing all idea as to my ever having received any money or moneys from him, and also setting forth his motive and spite for obtaining such warrant. This, coupled with his most awful conflicting and false evidence, clearly entitles me to my dis<lb/>charge on the <hi rend="italic">one.</hi> Secondly, I beg to draw the attention of the Court to the most unfair, unjust, and irregular manner in which this second charge has been brought, and I may here state, without any reasonable cause, under cover of this said warrant, issued to one named Windom. They, the prosecution, have even irregularly and purposely misplaced the letters already in Court, so as to mislead the Court as to the issue of the charge. The letters should be in proper rotation as to the dates thereof, and also in regular form. Then I most emphatically deny ever telling the detective-sergeant that Dr. Jackson ever posted a letter, or any letter that I had written, and I say right here that I told the detective-sergeant that the letter of the 29th November was simply one in response to a letter I received on that day from the Rev. Williams making an appointment, and I desired my expenses. I desire the inspector who took the charge called, and he can then explain what took place in his presence. Then, again, I beg to draw the attention of the Court to the unfair, irregular manner in which they, the prosecution, objected to any cross-examination of Mrs. Hansford when she was at the time present in the Court, because they, the prosecution, knew that her evidence would reveal Kate M., her daughter, as a wilful and corrupt perjurer, as is now already done by the solicitor, Mr. Wood's evidence, and also by the letters lying now before the Court. Then I again beg to draw the attention of the Court to the concocted evidence of one Thomas Potts, who was present in Court, and heard the cross-examination of Rev. F. Williams—on a former occasion I saw him standing at the <hi rend="italic">door.</hi> The said witness deliberately goes into the witness—box and swears that he did not know that he had read the letters until he was told. When I asked who told him, he re<lb/>plies the detective. Is this not manufactured evidence? And I may say the same as the evidence of the girl in reference to private detective, Scot<lb/>land Yard. There were four ladies present with her at the Female Aid Society, and she was perfectly willing to go to the Home if her rent was paid. No threat or illegal means were used on my part or anyone else. Call the witnesses who were present. I merely want fairness in this matter. The detective has purposely withheld half the card, I desire each charge cleared up separately, as allowed by law and criminal procedure."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner, in a long written statement, interspersed with observations, repeated his defence alleging that the witnesses were perjured, that he ought not be convicted in the absence of the son, that he had been prevented by being incarcerated bringing forward sufficient proof of his innocence and that what he had asked for was for his expenses in carrying out his retainer, that his letters contained no threat, and he was merely determined to bring the case to a conclusion, and explain the whole matter, and to do justice to all, and that he had been advised that with the knowledge the letters con<lb/>tained he would have been criminally liable if he had not acted as he did.</hi>

I am a mason's labourer of Lordship Road, Stoke Newington—on July 13th about 5.30 I was near Highbury New Park with the prisoners, drinking together at public-houses—I tried to leave them to go home, but they asked me to come up the road and hare a drink—after we left the public-house one of them, I do not know which, threw me down—I had had fourglasses of bitter ale, and was the worse for drink—I had a half-sovereign in one pocket and this tie clip—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I identify it by the stone dust which I put in it—I missed them and got up and followed the prisoners and one of them struck me on my mouth—when I left the house I put my hand in my pocket and missed the half-sovereign and clip—I did not see them take them—one of my teeth was knocked out.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 30, Wenlock Street, New North Road, and am a law stationer—on 27th July, between 3 and 3.30, I saw the prisoner in the Apple Tree and Mitre in Cursitor Street, sitting at a table with his head down as if asleep—I stood there about a minute, when he made some remark about b—law writers, and he got up and went to the partition to get a light—I was standing with my arm on the bar; when he got in front of me he gave me a violent blow between the eyes, and followed it with one on my mouth; it knocked me out of the bar into the street—as I went out I felt a blow in the ear from another man—I became un<lb/>conscious—I next remember being picked up by my hips by the other man who said to the prisoner, "If he does not get up kick him"—I felt a violent kick on the hand—then the prisoner and the other man went away—some of my fellow-workmen came up and spoke to me, and I found the whole of my money, 9s. 2d., was gone—a con<lb/>stable came up, I described the prisoner to him, and he went to a lodging-house—after from five to ten minutes I saw the policeman and the prisoner on the ground struggling—I went up and said, "He is one of the men—I went to the station and charged him, and from there I went to King's College Hospital, where they found that my left hand was broken and permanently injured; I have lost the use of the knuckle-joint—my nose was cut, and my eyes were black for ten days, and my mouth was hurt, I could not eat properly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should say I had been to four public-houses that afternoon—I did not step back and sit on the prisoner's glass—I remem<lb/>ber everything that took place—no doubt I tried to defend myself, and hit out at the prisoner—the last time I saw my money was when I was in Cursitor Street, outside Chifferiel's, which is next door to the Apple Tree, about two minutes before I went in, or as I was going in—I felt it in my pocket—I did not look about for it in the street afterwards—I have not found it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer, of 83, St. James Road, Holloway—about nine p.m. on 16th July I went to 22, Chalfont Road for my rent—a lady opened the door, and I asked for Mr. Rattenbury, and the prisoner answered from upstairs, "What do you want?"—I said, "I am come for my rent"—he said, "I will give you rent, you b—, if I come downstairs"—he came downstairs, and slipped into me, and knocked me about; I was obliged to retaliate—we began fighting, and had eight or nine rounds, and then I found myself bleeding from the jaw—I became unconscious, and found myself in the Great Northern Hospital—I was there about eight days—I saw no weapon in the prisoner's hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been acquainted with the prisoner for five years—he owed me 22s. for arrears of rent, and found it desirable to remove—he employed me to remove his furniture to Chalfont Road—I met him on 10th July; I did not tell him I was going to take the rent out of him—on the 15th July I went to Chalfont Road, but the prisoner was not in—I was not drunk—the prisoner's wife answered the door—she did not send for a policeman; he did not remove me for my violent conduct—I was quite sober when I called at eight o'clock on 15th—I said nothing about killing the prisoner or his wife, or giving them a thrashing—I went away of my own accord—I did not see Mrs. Rose, his present landlady, that evening—I did not call between six and seven on the Tuesday night—I did not use threats towards the prisoner; I did not say I would put three inches of cold steel into him—I did not go at nine o'clock to provoke him to a fight, but for my rent—I was not told he was in bed—I did not go into the middle of the street and shout for him to come down to me, or say I would pay him out for the rent if only he would come down—I was not excited; I merely asked for my rent at the door—I did not put myself in a sparring attitude till he came at me—he struck the first blow; he hit me in the chest with his closed hand, and I put my hands up—I felt no stab during the eight or nine rounds—he must have struck me on the left cheek, because no one else was near me—I had had a glass of ale before nine o'clock, but I was not drunk—after I was struck on the jaw I made no complaint of being stabbed; I was unconscious—I was unconscious when the policeman took me to a surgeon's, and while he dressed my face—I don't know where Dr. Wight lives; I never spoke to him—I did not tell Dr. Wight that I had been stabbed by a woman—when I left the hospital I went to the Enfield Arms, George Road, Holloway, to have a glass of ale—I saw Mr. Dillon, the landlord—I did not tell him there was nothing the matter with me, or that I only wanted to get out of the hospital to have a drink—I did not tell him there was nothing more than a mere fight between me and the prisoner—I told him I felt the effects—I showed no one my clothing to show where I had been stabbed; I believe my waistcoat was open—there was only one cut through my clothes, and that was through the sleeve of my waistcoat; I felt that blow, it was more like a sting than a cut—the material was not very thick—it was not a very new waistcoat—the prisoner is a blacksmith, and a pretty strong man—I am not very weak.</p>

               <p>9.30 p.m. on July 16th I was smoking outside my house, and I saw the prisoner and prosecutor fighting—they had several rounds, and I saved the prosecutor from falling down; he fell into my arms and became unconscious, and I pulled him on to the coping of the railings—I saw the prisoner hit him three or four times; the blow which made him fall was on the left cheek—he bled from the wound—a constable came up and I assisted in taking him to Dr. Wight's surgery, where the wound was dressed and he was ordered to go to the Great Northern Hospital—he could not speak at Dr. Wight's, nor at the hospital—he was detained there—I saw no knife—I heard Hedges ask the prisoner for the rent—I heard no answer; then the prisoner came out in the road and they put up their hands to fight—the prisoner began the fight, he struck Hedges first.</p>

I am House-Surgeon at the Great Northern Hospital—on the evening of July 16th the prosecutor was admitted—he was collapsed—he had two small superficial wounds on the left side of the lower jaw, an incised wound on the neck, and an incised wound on the right shoulder, one behind the left shoulder, three incised wounds on the lower part of the left side of the chest, and two below the lower border of the left shoulder-blade—one wound penetrated the lung—they were clean-cut wounds, and most probably caused by some sharp instrument—he was discharged from the hospital on the 25th, I think—he was in danger for some time—I thought when he came in that he had been drinking, but I cannot say for certain, because the condition of a collapsed patient is rather altered.</p>

I did not give him an answer. Allen subsequently sent James Mace, late of 63, Cirencester Street, to me. Mace told me that Allen was standing across the road (that was on Thursday previous to the 4th inst.), and said that Allen had spoken to him about the Tavistock. I afterwards went across the road and spoke to both of them. I knew what they wanted. I said I would go and look round the corner. I did, and saw a policeman standing opposite. They both then went away. I saw them again on the following Saturday night at my lodgings against the front door. They asked me again if I was going to assist them to break into the Tavistock, as they intended to break in that night. Allen had a steel chisel in his possession. I said, 'You had better wait a little longer.' They left me at 12.10 on the 4th, and I heard a noise at 4 o'clock the same morning. I could not tell where it came from. I thought no more about it. About 6 o'clock the same morning they both came to my room door. I said, 'What is the matter?' They said they wanted to come in, but I would not let them Mace said, "Don't be a fool; let us come in'; and they meant to clean up.

                  </hi>. I live at 65, Ohlsen Road—on 2nd August I was living at 204, Fairbridge Road, Upper Holloway—I have known Trew about four years—he has been away from the country in the Royal Artillery—he returned about the middle of July this year—I saw him the day he came home—on Friday, 2nd August, he came into the front kitchen a little after one o'clock—he asked me what I intended doing, whether I intended going out with him—I said, "No, I do not want you"—he asked me again what I intended doing—I said, "I was going to have my dinner"—he said I was not going to have any dinner that day—I said, "Well, what am I going to do then?"—he said, I was going to die, something like that—he pulled something out of his pocket—I was standing in the middle of the room, close by his side—I told him not to be so silly—he fired at me—I heard a loud report like a gun going off—I caught hold of his arm that he held the thing in—I called to my sister-in-law, Lottie; she was in the back kitchen—she opened the door—I ran down</p>

I am a licensed victualler; I keep the Edinburgh Castle in the Caledonian Road—at 12.30 on the early morning of August 28th I saw that everything was perfectly safe about my house—about 2.0 or 2.30 a policeman awoke me by ringing my bell—I went down and found that one of the large gates leading to the stables at the back of my premises was wide open—that was carefully fastened when I went to bed—a window had been tampered with, and about two inches of the putty had been scraped away and remained on the window-sill—the window had recently been fresh painted—matting that had previously been lying in the yard was found on the roof of a shed just under the window that had been tampered with—I should not like to swear that matting was put on the roof that night—I went with the constable to the Caledonian Road Police-station and saw the prisoners and gave them in charge—I knew them as frequent customers at my house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 402, Edgware Road, and am land-lord of Nos. 383 and 399—the prisoner became tenant of 399 in 1882 or 1833, and occupied it ten years till September, 1893, at £110 per annum rent—after February, 1891, he took a fresh lease for fifty or sixty years, as a stable behind was converted into a factory—he laid out between £600 and £800—he carried on business as the American Camera Com<lb/>pany—early in September, 1893, before quarter-day, I distrained for two quarters' rent, and the things fetched about £60—he contested that, and we got next to nothing—in the mean time he had converted his business into a limited liability company, and the receiver for the company disputed our right—it, went before one of the Law Masters—I appeared in person, and lost; I then appeared by solicitor, and won, but I had to pay some costs; I believe the prisoner bought some of the stock himself and the implements of trade—he lived there till the house was used as a storage—he had nothing to do with No. 399 after September, 1893—in April, 1894, he came to see me, and I agreed to let him and his wife jointly No. 583 for business and residence at 28s. a week, and paying rates and taxes, but he said he should not live there—they got into arrears almost immediately, but only one week is due now—he is still there—he was ten weeks in arrear, but he paid up when summer came round.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. AVERY</hi>. He has occupied the premises eleven years and paid the rent—he paid the rent for nine years before the limited company was formed—I believe he spent £900, but the work ought to have been done for £600; he did not go to a good man, but jobbed it—I think it quite possible that he paid £1,000 for the work done, and then he turned the business into a limited company—I do not know that he had taken most of the shares—he never got any subscrip<lb/>tions for the company, he got no capital subscribed whatever—that is the explanation given of the company coming to grief—he was to carry on the business by himself, with the help of his mother and his brother, who is a debenture-holder—I called at the premises occasionally between 1892 and 1893, both before and after the company was formed, and am quite<lb/>sure he was carrying on a large business—about twenty to thirty men and girls were employed there—the things were shown in the window in the usual way; it was nicely dressed, and you could scarcely go by without</p>

               <p>seeing customers there—after the company was formed the same state of things went on, and then the company went into liquidation, but not be<lb/>fore we distrained—a notice was put up without my permission at No. 399 that the business was removed to No. 383—letters addressed to 399 would be delivered at 383—I went to 383 after he was a weekly tenant—he was still carrying on business in cameras, he had a shop there and work rooms, and a lot of lathes and pots which he had at the other house came there—one or two men and some girls were employed—the business is still being carried on since his arrest—the only rent due is one week due last Saturday—I allowed that, I believe if I do not let him get behind he will always pay—he was, and still is carrying on a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> business, the house is used as a workshop, and I have seen orders from City firms only last week for these articles, one from Nuttall and Co., of Bishopsgate Street—I once saw a cheque from them for something under £5—up to the time of the distress he bought large quanti<lb/>ties of packing cases of me, to send goods off in, four, five, or six dozen a week, it was a genuine running order, all the packages we got we were to send, but since the distress only an occasional case—the Demon cameras are sent off in boxes like this, and wrapped in paper—they are only toys—the profit is not on the camera, but with it are supplied a certain number of dry plates, and when they are spoiled more are wanted and more acid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He has been the tenant of 383 about eighteen months—I have visited him a great many times, and have seen three or four persons working there at one time, not including his daughter—I saw a lathe there and a knife for cutting the edges of cardboard—I do not think I have ever been to 383 without seeing two or three dozen demon camera boxes; I cannot say whether there was anything in them—I saw all kinds of cameras there, and Tobin's fertiliser, and spectacles; the second house was mailer and lower rent, but the window was well<lb/>stocked, and there were cameras there which he said were worth two to four guineas—this is the rent-book—the rent got into arrear from the very first, that was partly wiped off in the spring—he paid two weeks instead of one—he paid better since his arrest.</p>

Id. and another to £104 13s. and one for fertilisers £61 18s.—I am referring to books 7, 8 and 52, numbered "London order book," that is a continuation of the other—I have examined the books, they all appear to be records—I did not strike them through in this way—I find in No. 7 the names of some of the prosecutors in this case—there are other books, this is a fertiliser book, that is, a patent manure-book—I have taken the figures out, the total from January 1st, 1895, is £61 18s., and during 1894 £75—this is the Post Century camera book, and this a miscellaneous order book, this entry is for powder, to be made into ale.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Nathaniel Coombes, of 168, Bowling Road, West Ham—Emily Harrison Coombes was my sister-in-law—she was the wife of Robert Coombes—we married brothers—they lived to<lb/>gether at 35, Cave Street—the prisoner Robert is their eldest son, about thirteen—Nathaniel George is a younger brother—I produce the certifi<lb/>cate of Robert's birth—the father was a steward on board ship—the last time I saw him was on the Tuesday before he went away on the Friday—the last time I saw him while his wife was living was on Saturday evening, July 6th; that was the last time I saw her—at that time she was in good health, the same as usual—the boys were both at home then, they were playing in the garden, quite happy—I never saw Fox till I met him at the house later on—he was not at the house when I was there on the Saturday—on Monday, July 8th, I went to 35, Cave Street, about six in the evening—I knocked at the front door two or three times—I got no answer—I went again to the house on the Monday following, the 15th, about the same time—Mrs. Burridge was with me—I knocked at the door; Fox opened it—I said to him "Can I see Mrs. Coombes "he said "No, she is not at home"—I asked him where she was gone—he said "On a holiday"—I said I was a sister-in-law, and I wanted to know where she had gone—he said she had gone to Liverpool—I said nothing to that, he closed the door then—at that time the two boys came up to the door from the street; before they came up I had tried to go in, but Fox did not open the door. I tried to push my foot in the door and I could not—he did not open the door wide, just a little way—I just put my foot in at the bottom, but he shut the door—the boys came up at the moment—I asked Robert where his <hi rend="italic">Ma</hi> was—he said she was gone to Liverpool, that a rich aunt had died and left them a lot of money, and all he knew was that he was rich—the boys then went away together towards the Recreation Ground, they ran away with some other boys—I then left the house with Mrs. Burridge—I went again to the house on Wednesday, 17th July, about nine in the morning—I knocked two or three times, but got no answer, I went again at mid-day about one, or thereabouts—I went first to my husband's mother—I then went again to the house with Mrs. Burridge, that was about twenty minutes past one—I knocked two or three times—then the door was opened—I don't know by whom, it was a man I think, I could not be sure—when the door was opened I passed into the house I went straight into the back parlour; Fox, Robert Coombes, and Nattie were there; they had been playing at cards; one of them, I can't say which, scrambled them up—I asked Robert where his <hi rend="italic">Ma</hi> was—he said she was round at Mrs. Cooper's, and he would take me round to see her—I said his <hi rend="italic">Ma</hi> was in this house, and I would not go out until the police came. Nathaniel was not there at that time, he got out of the window into the garden as we were talking—I asked Robert if I could go into his <hi rend="italic">Ma's</hi> bedroom—he said no I could not, it was locked—I asked where the key was; he said he did not know—I then went up to the front bed-room to burst the door open—I found it was locked; ultimately I</p>

               <p>borrowed a key from the landlady, unlocked the door and went in, and there saw the dead body of my sister-in-law on the bed—I sent for a constable, and Constable Thwart came—I then came downstairs again into the back parlour, the two prisoners were still there—I said Robert was a bad, wicked boy, he knew his mother was dead, and he ought to have come and told me—he said, "Auntie, come to me and I will tell yon the truth, and tell you all about it"—he said that loud enough for Fox to hear—he told me his <hi rend="italic">ma</hi> had given <hi rend="italic">Nattie</hi> a hiding on the Saturday, and she would give him one, and <hi rend="italic">Nattie</hi> said he would kill her; but he said, "I cannot do it <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>, will you," and I did it—he said, "I slept with mother on Sunday night, and I kicked about, and mother pushed me, and I got out of bed and killed her; <hi rend="italic">Nattie</hi> was in the back room, and coughed twice, that was when I done it, when <hi rend="italic">Nattie</hi> coughed"—I said, "Did your mother cry—he said, "No"—I asked whether she was awake when he did it—he said, "Yes, with her hand over her face"—I asked him what time it was—I think he said, "About a quarter to four on the Monday morning, a week ago". she had been dead ten days—I asked him what he did then—he sad he covered her over and went to Lord's Cricket Ground—I said, "Where is your father's gold watch"—he said, "I have pawned it, I gave it to John Fox to pawn, and some other things"—he was going to give me the ticket but the police came up, and he handed it to the sergeant—I told Fox he was a bad man—he said he did not know any thing about it; that was all he said to me—I noticed that Fox had got on my brother-in-law's clothes, a new suit—when I went to the house on the 17th before going upstairs I noticed a nasty smell of strong tobacco, that was all—Fox was smoking when I went in.</p>

Robert's confession on the 17th was quite open and frank—I did not ask him with what instrument the murder had been committed; he told me it was with a knife, and it lay on the foot of the bed—he did not seem to feel his position at all—I had known his mother many years—she was a very excitable woman—I had seen her nearly every day since Christmas—I have seen the boy several times during the last few years—I have noticed him excitable many times—his mother gave him medicine for it when he complained of his head.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SHERWOOD</hi>. I had never seen Fox before the Monday—I have heard the boys speak of him as coming to chop wood—I did not have any conversation with Fox, I simply told him I was a sister-in-law of the deceased, and wanted to know where she was—I said it was funny she did not tell me where she was going; that was just before he shut the door; I just put my foot in the door; I used no force; I did not push; he did not open the door wide—he seemed as though he did not want anybody to look inside—I was just turning away when the boys came running up from outside; I could not tell whether he saw them; they ran away again towards the Recreation Ground—I gave evidence before the Magistrate twice, I think—I don't know whether Fox saw my foot in the doorway; I did not feel the door against it; there was no one else there but the three prisoners; the house was all fastened up at the back—I was excited—I did not see a Mrs. Hayward go in; I saw her at the door—Mrs. Burridge went in with me on the Wednesday—when I went in Fox was sitting down smoking; the others were standing—I did</p>

               <p>not see them playing cards; one of the boys was scrambling them up—I think I left the front door open when I went in; Mrs. Burridge was behind me, and came half-way upstairs with me—when the bedroom door was opened I went in—the face of the deceased was covered with the clothes, and a pillow on the top—when I left the room Thwart followed me downstairs. Mrs. Burridge fetched the policeman—he came in five or ten minutes—I waited downstairs till he came—I went up in front of him, and when I came down I left him there—Robert produced the pawntickets; they were on a bracket in the room—the new clothes that Fox had on was a grey suit, a plaid or tweed or something—Mr. Coombes had had them on only once—I brushed them and put them away—Fox struck me as rather a stupid man—I believe I have told all the conversation that took place; all that I heard.</p>

Robert was present when she beat me he said, "If you cough twice that will show that I will do it"—he said that on the Saturday, I think—I did not cough—on the Monday even<lb/>ing he brought mother's dress into my room and got the money, out of the pocket—it was in a purse—I could not tell exactly how much there was—it was some in gold and some in silver—I had half of it till Fox</p>

'Wanted, £30 for six months, will pay £6 a month by in<lb/>stalments.'—I do not know how my brother came to write that—I think this letter is in my brother's writing addressed to my father—when my brother bought this knife, before my father went away, he put it first in the dust-bin in the yard, and then just up the chimney in the back-room upstairs; that was the last place I saw it—my brother said "I will keep it here," meaning the chimney—he never said anything more about it—I did not see it on the Sunday night before mother died; nothing was said about it on the Sunday night.</p>

Mother was kind to Fox, too—he used to come to the house pretty often—sometimes he would not come for a week, but sometimes he stopped for a good time—he had slept there once or twice in the kitchen; he has said he would sleep anywhere—he slept there when he came to do some work, and he went away next morning—we and our father called him John, and both father and mother were kind to him—when he came he used to saw up the wood and brush up the garden—he did not run errands for mother—I had known him for three years—my father fetched me from Bow when I stayed there with my aunt, and when I came home to Cave Road I found Fox there; that was the first time I saw him—when he worked in the house I and my brother talked to him from time to time; we knew him pretty well—he called me Natty, and my brother Robert—I used to go out with Fox sometimes before mother died—sometimes I just went to the top of the street with him to see him off—I do not know that I went longer distances with him—I knew where he was to be found—I have heard that he was generally to be found on ships at the Royal Albert Dock—my father's ship is the <hi rend="italic">France</hi>, and as my father had gone it must have been the <hi rend="italic">Soain</hi> on which we found Fox—I and my brother both went to the Dock in the morning—we could not see him either in the <hi rend="italic">France</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Spain</hi>, and they said he was on another boat—we were about two or three hours at the docks finding him—I did not see Mr. Hewson that day—when we got home that same day my brother sent Fox to pawn the watches, and he sent him to pawn the bracelets the next day—he asked Fox if he would do it, and Fox said yes—I and my brother went with him and waited outside, both when the watches and the bracelets were pawned—we went to the Stratford Theatre one night—once or twice we went out and left Fox indoors—we were playing out in the street once—sometimes we played in the garden after mother's death, and when Fox was there—he was with us in the garden when we played—when we fetched Fox my brother said to him, "Come and take care of us while our mother is away"—once when we were playing in the garden Fox said he would tell our mother when she came back if we did not be quiet—we played in the garden in the daytime—Fox smoked a pipe, and my brother smoked in the house—I think he smoked a cigarette—we all of us went out together to get food—we went and had it at a coffee-shop or eating-house about three times I think in the whole time—sometimes we had food at home; some of it was left indoors—we did not have to buy anything during those days; my brother used to make some pastry in the kitchen—I think they bought two quarterns of flour which my mother ordered—there was enough in the house—the three times we went to an eating-house were on different days—I think on Thursday we went to the top of the street for breakfast; we went to other places afterwards—we used to find a coffee-house—I think Fox was only left alone in the house two or three times; all the rest of the time he was with me and my brother—on the Thursday and Monday my brother just opened the door of the room where my mothers body was, and looked in to see if everything was all right there, and shut the door again—it took about two minutes opening the door and shutting it again—on the Thursday I was on the second stair from the top—my brother just put one foot inside the room and looked in, and shut the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Divisional Surgeon of Police—on the after noon of 17th July I was called to 35, Cave Road—I found in the front bedroom upstairs, lying upon the bed and on the left-hand side of it, the body of deceased—she was lying on her back, slightly inclined to the left side—the body was in a horrible state of decomposition; the nose, eyes and ears had been entirely eaten by maggots—on exposing the chest, I found on the left side, over the region of the heart, two gaping wounds—the chemise, bedclothes, and bedding were stained with dried blood—this knife would be a weapon likely to produce the wounds I saw—it was shown to me afterwards by the police; there was blood on it when I examined it, and there are dried blood stains on it now—the smell in the room was frightful—before I got into the house I noticed the smell; the front door was open when I arrived—the buttocks and calves of the legs and other parts of the body were also destroyed by maggots—I should say the smell must have existed for several days—on the following morning I made a post-mortem examina<lb/>tion—the cause of death was the two stabs through the heart, one through</p>

I am not asserting that the smell was equally diffused some days before—the street door was open, and I smelt it in the street—the room door was open—if the door of the room had been kept shut pretty continuously and hardly opened at all, and then only for just a minute there would undoubtedly not have been an equal diffusion of the smell throughout the house—I think that if the door was kept shut there must have been a bad smell in other parts of the house; of course not so bad as it was in the room itself—if there had been a bad smell outside the room it would probably have increased gradually—on the bed alone there was quite a bushel of maggots, I should say—people living in the house would not notice the smell if it increased gradually so much as people coming in suddenly from the fresh air.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the father of these lads—I have been married seventeen years—Robert was my first child—I had been married four or five years before he was born—my wife was a very excitable woman from the first, very frequently laughed and cried at the same time—I was not at home at the time of Robert's birth, I think I had just gone to sea, or came home just afterwards, I cannot recollect—I know that my wife had a very bad time—Robert has marks on each side of the temples, I believe one is visible now; they are the marks of an instrument used by doctors in confinements; I was told so when I arrived home—I first noted signs of excitability about him when he was about three or four years of Age—he always complained of headaches—in disposition he was a very good boy—I took him to Dr. Coward when he was three or four to see what was the matter with him—he always complained of those bad headaches—Dr. Coward prescribed for him—I removed to Liverpool, and I wrote to Dr. Coward from there, and asked him to give me a prescription for the boy, as he was very ill at Liverpool from headache, the same complaint, and in consequence of what Dr. Coward told me I was specially careful; he always told me never to chastise him anywhere near the head, or to touch him on the head, or to give him any home lessons to do; he gave me a letter to give to Mr. Hollamby—the boy complained very often of his head at that time, at intervals of a week or a fortnight, sometimes a month; at such times he would sit down and look very sullen, as if he was having a headache, and would speak to nobody—he always made the same complaint up to the time he went to sea—it was in 1891 that I received a certificate from Dr. Coward—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it; I believe he showed that to another doctor, Dr. Griffin, who attended him at Liverpool—I returned from there at the end of 1892—I did not know that the boy was suffering from an affection of the brain until I got that letter—I have continually had complaints from the lad since 1893—he was attended by Dr. Coward for cerebral congenitis, a disease of the tonsils—it was for that I sent the letter to Dr. Griffin—the boy ran away from home on two or three occasions, once as recently as last November—the reason his school was changed was in consequence of a report made by the school attendant officer, and he was admitted to Stoke Street School—I do not know whether he took bromide of potassium—it was in consequence of an interview with Dr. Griffin that I took my son to New York last winter—he ordered me to take him somewhere about Christmas time—when anything</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There is no insanity on my side of the family or my wife's either, the boy always got on very well at school, he had no diffi<lb/>culty in learning, he is a very learned boy, he read a great deal—he has not to my knowledge been reading sensational books—the books that were found in the house were good books, such as the <hi rend="italic">Strand Magazine</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">New York Century</hi>—he took an interest in the trial of criminals—I know he went to Southend to see Read last year—he had two shillings, and he paid his fare to Grays or Purfleet, and walked from there to Southend and back to see Read—I did not know that he got employment after leaving school till I arrived home.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189509090121"/>
               <p>seemed a very clever boy, and as a rule he was well behaved—from August 5th to 10th his excitability was especially noticed—I saw him on the 5th, the rest was reported by the officer—on the 5th he was excited and would not do what he was told—he was singing and whistling, and was very impertinent to the officers—he has complained of pains in the head on two or three occasions—he told me he had suffered from them more or less all his life—there is a distinct scar on his right temple, and on very careful examination I noticed also a very faint scar just in front of his left ear—those scars might have been caused by instruments used at the time of his birth—the brain is always compressed more or less when instruments are used, which will occasionally affect the brain—I believe children have suffered from fits afterwards—I have come across such cases, and I think it has been stated to me by the mothers—generally the marks disappear, but in this case there is a distinct mark of a wound—it depends upon whether the flesh has been injured or not—in this case considerable violence must have been used—and from the violence there must have been considerable pressure on the brain—I have noticed that his pupils are at times unequal—the variability of the pupils shows that the mischief is not in the eye, but is probably due to cerebral irritation—I asked him whether he heard voices—he said at night he had heard voices saying, "Kill her, kill her, and run away" on several occasions—I was instructed by the Treasury to examine him—I questioned him closely as to those voices, how they seemed to speak to him, and he stated that they seemed to whisper into his ear—he said he killed his mother because he was afraid that if he did not do so she would kill his brother Nathaniel, and that she had often threatened to knock his brains out with a hatchet, and had thrown knives at him—he said he had an irresistible impulse to kill her—I took down those words—these fits of mental excitement might come on at varying intervals—his general behaviour in the gaol has been fairly good as far as I have seen it—I made two reports to the Treasury—I had a conversation with him on the 10th inst.—it led me to the opinion that he was suffering from cerebral excitement—it was peculiar—he appeared in very great glee at being about to be brought here to be tried—his manner was peculiar, but you would hardly say he was suffering from very great excitement that day—he thought it would be a splendid sight, and he was looking forward to it—he said he would wear his best clothes and have his boots well polished—then he began to talk about his cats—from having been very talkative he suddenly became very silent and burst into tears—I asked him why he was crying, and he said because he wanted his cats and his mandoline—I have his letter, which was handed to me on Sunday, which appears to be written by an insane person—(<hi rend="italic">Letter read—addressed to Mr. Shaw</hi>, 583, <hi rend="italic">Barking Road, Plaistow, Essex, from R.

That letter considerably strengthened my previous opinion of the boy's mental condition—I gave my reasons in my report to the Treasury—the things which would indi<lb/>cate insanity are: the inequality of his pupils; his hallucinations of hearing; the fact that whilst in prison he never appeared to realise his position, or showed remorse for the crime he had committed; and the attack of mental excitement from which he suffered from August 5th to 10th—hearing voices is sometimes a symptom of incipient insanity—misanthropy and general dislike to those about them is occasion<lb/>ally so, and sometimes a suspicious disposition—in my opinion he suffers from recurrent attacks of mania with lucid intervals—there are two forms of homicidal mania: sometimes the crime is committed on the impulse of the moment; sometimes with great deliberation and cunning—pernicious literature would be very bad for such a boy to read—I have been studying criminal lunacy more or less for the last twenty-three years—in my opinion these symptoms would be characteristic of the boy during his life.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GILL</hi>. The subject of insanity is very difficult, especially with regard to children—I should say the conver<lb/>sations were held in a lucid interval; he appeared to talk' to me quite rationally and showed no insanity when I first examined him; that was the day after he was received into the prison, as he casually spoke to me and not from his physical signs—he answered my questions intelligently—he appears to be a boy of more than average intelligence—he is well educated, and able to take advantage of the opportunities given him at school—I only find trace of delusion from the boy's own statement; apart from the murder, I saw no delusion—"irresistible impulse" is what I have written, but I would not swear those were the very words he used, but he said something to that effect, either "impulse" or "irresistible impulse"—I am judging from the statement of the father that he had these periodical attacks every two or three months; that appeared to me the same kind that he had when under my observation—I have heard the evidence; a boy may be very passionate and may be vicious without being insane; some boys do give way to extraordinary violent fits of passion, especially if they are interfered with and not allowed to have their own way; but I do not speak of those fits of passion, but attacks of mental excitement, as the father described it to me, that is very different—the mental excitement came under my notice: the boy who is generally well-behaved becomes very excitable and passionate, and appears to be in a very excited mental condition—the father, in his evidence, said this boy had these attacks at intervals of two or three months—the statement the father made in evidence was that pains came on very often, and then there were intervals of a week, a fortnight, or a month</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189509090123"/>
               <p>without them, and that then he would sit sullenly and not speak to anyone—that was hardly the statement the father made to me—except when suffering from what I have described he would be perfectly sane, and would understand the difference between right and wrong—he would then appreciate that he was doing something wrong for which he might suffer if found out—he might have been under the influence of delusion when he bought the knife—I do not know that he was—he might have bought it while suffering under an attack of mania—I seriously mean that he would go to the shop, select the knife, bargain for it, and buy it while under the influence of mania; under the influence of homicidal mania these crimes are done with great deliberation—I have not said he was violently passionate in these attacks—in this case there would be no symptoms you could notice, except it appeared to be a case of moral perver<lb/>sion at the time—no doubt any person committing a crime would be suffering from moral perversion—in this instance we could do nothing with him when he was so excited—I do not mean he was suffering merely from moral perversion, but that moral perversion is one of the symptoms of insanity; moral perversion exists in people who are treated as sane—that is, people who are supposed to understand the difference between right and wrong—whether his inquiring for the knife one day, and going a second day to buy the knife would take place in a boy suffering from an attack of mania, would depend upon how long he was under its influence—there may be no observable symptom of it—a person would have sufficient control to avoid attracting attention—the attack under my observation lasted five days—I think the boy's conduct after the murder and his explanations during the week would possibly be consistent with his being under the influence of mania—so would trying to conceal the crime—I do not think the boy was under its influence a week, but it is possible he might have been—his endeavouring to conceal the crime would point to his knowing he had done wrong—his letter to his father would be consistent with his endea<lb/>vouring to conceal the crime—also if it is true that he said he would get quicklime—he gave me a detailed account of how he did it—he did not tell me he concealed the knife—the first time he told me he had no recollection of stabbing her, but remembered hitting her on the head with a truncheon—on another occasion he told me that he had stabbed her—I do not think he told me about his going to Southend to see Read's trial—he knew who the warders were and that I was the doctor—the boy's behaviour in prison and the absence of motive are unfavourable to sanity—there is nothing in the facts of the case as given in evidence which is inconsistent with perfect sanity.</p>

                  </hi>. I attended the Coombes family for the last two years—the mother was of a hysterical disposition, very emotional, and subject at times to fits of crying and laughing, and to attacks of hysteria—she used to laugh and cry with the least exciting cause—she was generally of a weak and nervous disposition—the nervous disposition and temperament of the mother sometimes affects the children—the lad was brought to me by his father, and sometimes by his mother—the last time was December 1894—he was suffering from attacks of mental excitement due to cerebral irritation—his father brought me two papers, in conse<lb/>quence of which I prescribed for a disordered nervous system—when the attacks were on him he had an irresistible impulse to run away without reason—I advised his father to take him to sea for a trip in consequence of these attacks—what I saw might develop into mania—and from what I have heard since, the boy has changed for the worse from what I saw last, physically and mentally—the disorder is of a progressive nature, and has got worse in my opinion—I form the opinion from what I have seen of him and what I saw yesterday—I have noticed the birthmarks on his temples—I agree with Dr. Walker that they show very considerable pres sure and violence had been used—I gave a report to the school officer as to the boy's mental condition.</p>

I am a school attendant officer at West Ham—I had reason to make inquiries in October 1893 as to the boy's non<lb/>attendance at school—I went to the mother—the result of the inquiry was that the boy had been sick through excitement—when I did see the boy he was in a very sullen mood, and would not answer me—I saw his doctor—in consequence of what I saw, read and heard from the doctor, and by request of the mother, that I would get him another school, I obtained a special order from the School Committee for his removal from one school to another.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Deposition of Lewis Liddilow</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective K</hi>) <hi rend="italic">was read as follows</hi>; At 4.30 p.m. on 15th August I went to an unfurnished house in Shrewsbury Road, East Ham, about three doors from Mr. Wybro's. I there saw Holliday. I said to him, 'Are you the man that put some boxes on a cab on Tuesday afternoon?' He said, 'Yes.' I said, 'What is your name?' He said, 'Edmund Holliday. I am known by the name of Ted.' I said, 'I am a police-officer, and hold a warrant for your arrest.' I then read the warrant to him. He said, 'I know nothing about any property. I was asked to put the boxes on the cab, which I did. They were taken away, and I haven't seen them since; and as for Curly Dick and Mrs. Wybro I don't know where they are. I didn't go with them. I have not seen Mrs. Wybro since she went away.' On the way to the station he said, 'I may as well tell you the truth: I know you have got your information from the girl. In the evening I met Curly Dick at the Princess Alice. He asked me to go with him to Maryland Point Station, where we met Mrs. Wybro and the girl, and from what he told me I then knew that I was doing wrong. I must have been a fool to go with them to London. I am sorry for it now. We went to his brother's at Liverpool Road, Islington, and afterwards in a cab to near Walworth Road. They turned us out of one coffee-house, and at the next house Mrs. Wybro, Burnell, and the girl went to one bedroom. I slept upstairs in another. On Wednesday we all went to Highbury. We sent the girl to see the children, and as she did not come back I came home I did not see a gold watch and chain, or any other property.' He was detained at the station and afterwards charged, and in reply he said, 'I am innocent; why wasn't the girl charged as well as me!' At 5.50 p m. on the 16th inst. I was in Liverpool Street, Islington, and saw the prisoners Kate Wybro and Richard Henry Burnell come out of the Duchess of Kent public-house in Liverpool Road together. I said, to Burnell, 'I hold a warrant for your arrest for stealing on 13th a gold watch chain, £10 in money, and other goods value £20, the property of Mrs. Wybro's husband' I read it. He said, 'I know nothing about it, I have not seen the property, I haven't stolen anything.' She said, 'Why I have the watch and chain, I am wearing it now; it was given to me by my husband. I know nothing about any money; he might have me in another way, but not for stealing anything, as I have only taken my own property. Dick knows nothing about it.' When charged at Forest Gate they made no reply. I searched Burnell; I found £1 10s. gold, 12s. 6d. silver, 1s. 4 1/4 d. bronze; the gold watch and chain produced, two-half return railway tickets. On Mrs. Wybro were found the gold watch and chain, 2s. 3d. silver, 3 1/4 d. bronze, and in her presence at the station Mr. Wybro identified the lady's gold watch and chain she was wearing as his property. In the trunks left at 16, Bow Street, which I took possession of, which were opened in the presence of Mrs. Wybro, I found two sponges, two wash-leathers, one girl's petticoat, one shawl, one waterproof cape, one knee-cloth, one table-cloth, two dinner napkins, one</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plasterer of 59, Bristol Road, East Ham—on Tuesday, 13th August, I was working about 100 yards from Wybro's house—I saw a cab come to the house about 2.30—I first saw Burnell that day about three-quarters of an hour after the cab had gone—I saw Holliday putting the boxes on the cab—I did not see Mrs. Wybro.</p>

                  </hi>. On 13th August I lived at Shrewsbury Road, East Ham—I had been for some years the licensed holder of the Rising Sun—I married the prisoner, Kate Wybro, in December 1894—we got on very well for about three months till Burnell came on the scene, and then he upset it—I had on several occasions grounds for complaint of her conduct with Burnell, and also I lost money out of the bar—on 13th August I went to town—I did not know she was going away that day, she did not tell me she was—I got back about 4 p.m., and found she had gone—I saw the things were greatly upset in the room, and I missed things out of the desk; I missed £8 in gold, £2 in silver, and 8s. or 9s. in coppers; I had seen it safe that morning—the desk was locked; I had given her the key to pay bills out of the money—she paid one, and these are the others; I left her the money to pay; I have paid them since—I also missed this watch and chain of my previous wife; I had never given those to the prisoner, and she had no authority to take them away—once or twice, when her own watch was broken, she was allowed to wear them, or when she went out with me, but I never gave them to her—I also missed thin shawl, which my mother gave me, for a keepsake—I saw that and other things in the boxes when they were opened at the station; I also missed other things that have not been found—the boxes were hers—I have never treated her unkindly—she want on all right for about three months after our marriage, and then took to drink, and came home all hours the worse for drink—I never kicked her or struck her, or threw her downstairs.</p>

               <p>married her; she was in my employ as barmaid, and lived in the house—I had grown-up sons and a cook and housemaid at the public-house; one son attended to the bar—I had no reason to charge my wife with stealing anything while she was barmaid—she is my third wife—I never gave her any of these articles; I gave her a brooch and two rings,—we were on very friendly terms before marriage—I only gave her a diamond ring before marriage—I never mentioned the gold watch before marriage—she had a gold watch; she might have shown it to me before our marriage; I don't remember saying I had a better one upstairs belonging to my former wife—I might have said so—I did not then tell her I would make her a present of it and the chain—I did not go up and open the safe, in which the watch and chain were, under the dressing-table, and take them out and give them to her—I gave her the brooch she is wearing, not a gold brooch—she did not then bring all those articles of jewellery downstairs and wash them; she never had them in her hands—she did not thank me by giving me a kiss in the bar parlour; nothing of that sort took place—I bought what I made her a present of—I deny giving her these things—I may have talked to her about £30 worth of jewellery that my late wife bought; they brought them in when she laid on her deathbed, and she never saw them, and they took them back again—my wife has not worn the watch and chain from the time the conversation took place till her arrest; only when she has gone out with me, and I gave it her to wear—she had no right to have it on except when she was with me; she took it from the dressing-table; it did not always lie there, but when we moved it was placed there—up to the time I left the Rising Sun it was in the safe, but, when I moved, it and other things were taken out—my wife and I used to go out three times a week with the trap—I allowed her to wear the watch when tier's was broken; she did not put this on every day, not once in three months—when we were going out in the trap I did not take it out of the drawer and say, "You can wear this," only when her's was broken—she had to send hers to be mended on three or four occasions—I have never treated her cruelly; if I had the had her remedy—the watch and chain are of the value of about £8 or £9; they and the money are the most important things she took—the goods she is charged with stealing are about worth £10 or £15—I charge her with stealing two sponges, she broke the place open to get them out—I also charge her with stealing two wash-leathers, my daughter's petticoat, a shawl, a pair of gloves and other things—they were found in her box as when they were opened at the Police-station in her presence—I allowed her 15s. a week for pocket-money; I paid the housekeeping—I bought two dozen sponges for the house and yard—the two sponges and leathers had not been used before she left the house—I had last seen the sponges before I left the Rising Sun in the lower part of the sideboard—they were moved in the sideboard—the two sponges, wash leathers, and shawl were not packed in one of her boxes to be removed the week before she left my house—my wife only packed her own goods, not mine—I have no doubt that the shawl was not moved in her box—I did not pack her boxes myself—she had no reason for leaving me—she never complained of cruelty—she called in a doctor once when the came in the worse for drink and fell downstairs—she was never sober</p>

               <p>two days a week at night-time; for the last two months she has never come home sober once a week—before two months ago she used to go out and come home the worse for drink, two or three times a week—I have asked her to drink when we have been out together—I gave her 15s. a week pocket-money, and promised her another 10s. if she did not drink—a Stratford doctor was called in to attend her; that was not in consequence of ill-treatment by me—I never hit her or lifted my hand against her—she did not tell me two or three days before she went away that if I hit her again she would leave me—I should not have given her the keys if I thought she was going away—I did not tell her to leave—Dr. Nicholls was the doctor who attended her—I do not charge her with stealing the locket.</p>

I am Divisional Surgeon of Police, and live at 224, Lewisham High Road—on August 21st I saw Ryder—I found the scar of a wound about one and three-quarter inches long underneath his left shoulder blade; I cannot say how deep it had been, it had quite healed—it might have been caused by this knife—there was an irregular jagged scar about three and a-half inches long on the outside of his right fore<lb/>arm; it was a deep cut, because the skin was adhering to the muscles underneath; it disabled him from work as a seaman for some weeks after I saw him—I saw another wound about two inches long on the right corner of his mouth; it cut through the lip; the scar is still there; it is a permanently disfiguring wound—it must have been caused with some sharp instrument—the tip of the tongue was cut nearly through, and it will affect his speech for some time until the parts get to their natural con<lb/>dition, and then I daresay he will be all right again—the wound on the fore-arm could have been done when he was holding up his arm to protect himself from a blow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think the cut in the back was done by the knife glancing, not a stub; it was a cut on the arm—I cannot say whether the wound on the face was a cut or a stab.</p>

I am in charge of the Fire Station, Bat<lb/>tersea Park Road—I was called to 127, Honeywell Road, on August 2nd, at 1.27 p.m.—on examining I found four separate fires: one in the cup<lb/>board in the back room ground floor, which had been extinguished, but the inside of the cupboard was well charred—I found two fires in the front room, first floor, partly out—I extinguished them—the bed and bedding and the greater part of a towel were burnt, and the towel-horse was alight by the side of the washstand—the bed and bedding were alight in the back room on the same floor—I asked the prisoner whether anybody else was in the house—she said, "No"—and where her missis and master were—she told me her master was at business at the Post Office Savings Bank Department, Victoria Street, and her missis had left the place about 11.30 to see a friend—I said, "Can you account for the fire?"—she said, "No"—I asked her if she had not been upstairs—she said, "No"—she told me she had been cleaning the stair rails on the stairs, and when she got to the upper part she smelled smoke, and she called her next-door neighbour to extinguish it; the place was then on fire—I then asked her if she did not smell the fire from the cupboard, being on the stains—she told me she did not—I said, "How can the cupboard be on fire?" supposing it was locked; and as to how the door of the cupboard was broken open—she told me one of the men who came to extinguish the fire had broken the cupboard door open—the cupboard was charred, the catch was on, as if it had been locked and forced open.</p>
