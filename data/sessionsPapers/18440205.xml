                  </hi>. I live in Wellington-road, in the parish of St. Marylebone. The prisoner Brown entered my service a few days previous to Christmas last, as housekeeper and cook—she had lived with me in 1830, and then conducted herself with propriety—on the 26th of Dec., about half-past six o'clock, I left her in charge of my house—there was also a male, and a female (named Harriet) servants in the house, whom she had hired for me—I returned about eight, and found Brown gone—in consequence of suspicion, I exa<lb/>mined my plate-chest—I had left the key of the plate-chest on a bunch on the mantel-shelf of the common parlour—she had no charge of the keys—the key of my tea-chest was on the same bunch—I missed a silver teapot and biggin, two silver butter-boats and two gravy-spoons, a gold watch, chain and guard, a gold watch, seal and ring, a gold breast-pin, and some 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; notes and sovereigns, which were in a brown-holland sample-bag in the plate-chest; I also missed a cashmere shawl and scarf, and fourteen yards of velvet—I have since seen some of the jewellery, plate, and shawls in the policeman's hands—one of the rings cost me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, and the other 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—the total value of he property was 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;</p>

On the night of the 26th of Dec., about ten o'clock, I saw the prisoners in Chapman-street, St. George's—Brown was tipsy—Maller asked me if I could direct them to Providence-street—I said, "Where is it near?"—she said, "Close to the railroad"—I asked what railroad—she turned to Brown, and asked what railroad she meant—she said, "Close by Euston-square"—they were about four miles and a half from there—I asked where they came from—Brown then dropped a bag at my feet, and took no notice—I said, "You have dropped something"—Maller took it up—I said, "There appears something like money in this bag"—Maller said, "It is only a little money and some things we have bought; this is my sister, and a married woman"—she said it being boxing-day, she had taken a little drop too much, and she was quite ashamed of her; could I direct her where to get a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I directed them towards the Commercial-road—after they were gone a short distance I went after them, and stopped them again—they had gone towards the Commercial-road—taking the bag from Brown, I said to her, "What money have you got in this bag?"—she made no answer, but Maller said, "About 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;"—I asked her if there were any notes—she said, "None"—I said, "I think it is not all right; you must go to the station"—Maller said, if I went to No. 5, Duke-street, the lady there would satisfy me that all was right—I took them to the station, and in the bag I found on Brown were three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and eight 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; notes, thirty sovereigns, twelve half-sovereigns, 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper; a gold watch, a gold guard and chain, three gold pins, three gold rings, a seal, and three silver cruet-labels—I asked where she got them—she said they belonged to her, and her grandmother had given them to her—Maller had got a band-box, and in it a silver coffee-pot, coffee-biggin, two butter-boats, and two gravy-spoons, and she was carrying a bundle of velvet—I asked what money she had about her—she said a half-sovereign—I found on her two sovereigns, twenty-five shillings, and threepence-halfpenny—she said, "All these things belong to my sister"—I asked both where they got the plate from—they both refused to answer—they said they had not given their right names, and refused to give their address—I made inquiry—Mr. Savage came forward next morning, and claimed the property.</p>

Dr. John Hume Spry and several others act as trustees—in January last we had an account of a person named Mary Todd as a depositor—on Saturday the 20th Jan., between eleven and twelve o'clock, the prisoner, Elizabeth Todd, came to the bank and presented this deposit book to me—it is the book which was given to the person who had invested the money in the name of Mary Todd—the first deposit was made on the 14th October, 1837—I cannot say whether she was alone when she came—she presented the book and said she wished to withdraw the whole of the money—there was then 116<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. standing in the name of Mary Todd—I asked her if it was her own money, and if the account belonged to her, she replied that it was her account and that she paid the money in—I then proceeded to fill up the notice ticket now produced previous to its being signed—I handed it to her and told her to write her own name—she wrote a name here which I could not exactly make out, and asked her what name it was—she said Mary Todd—I then asked her again if she had paid the money in—she said she did—I told her it was not much like the writing in our book, and if she could not write it better on the day of payment she would have some difficulty in getting the money—she said she had not written for some years, and had not got her spectacles with her, but between that and the day of payment she would bring her spectacles, and also practise writing in the mean time—we require ten days' notice of an intention to withdraw money—she then left, and on the Tuesday week following, the 30th, she came again—I filled up a receipt and handed it to her to sign—she wrote the name of Mary Todd once—I looked at it and asked her if she could write it better—she said shew ould try, and then wrote the name the second time on the same paper, and I struck out the first—I was not satisfied with that second writing, and snowed it to Mr. Douglas Finney, the assistant secretary—he asked her to write the name again on the back of the receipt, which she did—he said he was not satisfied with the handwriting and should require her to make a declaration before a Magistrate—the prisoner Trussler then came forward and said she could make oath that the was the person who paid the money in—Mr. Douglas Finney then said he would fill up a declaration for them both to sign—he asked Trussler if she was present when the first deposit was made, she said she was—he then pre<lb/>pared this declaration for them to make before a Magistrate—I am not positive which took it, but they went away with it—they returned in about half an hour and communicated with Mr. Douglas Finney—I have been a clerk in the bank twelve years—I never saw the prisoner Elizabeth Todd before to my recollection—I was not the person who received the original deposit in September, 1837—Mr. Douglas Finney received it himself—there are three entries in the deposit book in my handwriting—I cannot say of whom I received those deposits—the depositor does not sign after the first time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant secretary and actuary to the Marylebone Savings Bank—I remember Sheath calling my attention to the signature of Mary Todd, on Tuesday 30th Jan., on a paper—I told Elizabeth Todd the signature was not satisfactory to me, and asked if she was the Mary Todd who deposited the money in the first instance—she said she was—I then said I should require a declaration to be made before a Magistrate of the fact—the prisoner Trussler was about a foot from her—I cannot say whether she heard this conversation, but Trussler came forward on my saying that, and said, "I came with this party, and know her to be the Mary Todd"—I then asked if she saw her write her name in the signature book in the first instance—she said, "No, I was waiting outside"—I then asked Trussler if she would have any objection to make a declaration as to these facts—she answered, no—I then prepared a declaration, which is here—I read it over to them, very care<lb/>fully explaining to them that if they declared here anything that was false, they would be considered guilty of perjury and liable to the same punishment—after reading it over to them and explaining the penalty, I asked if they were willing to make it—they said they were, and then left with the declaration, in about a quarter of an hour they returned—Trussler said, "We have come to tell you the truth, sir"—Todd then said, "The account was my sister's, who is now dead"—I said the case was of so serious a character I could hear nothing further till my father, who is the actuary, returned—I directed them to sit down in the office—after a short time my father returned, and they were shown in to him—before that Todd might have mentioned in my presence that there was a son living and a will left—she certainly did afterwards—I believe she remarked that nearly the whole, if not the whole, of the money had been paid in by her, and belonged to her—I was present when they were shown in to my father, and then Todd stated that the account was not hers, that the money had been paid in by her sister in the first instance—that her sister was dead, had left a will, and there was a son living, but that the whole, or nearly the whole of the money had been paid in by her, and belonged to her that on a former occasion she had received the sum of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—I then pro<lb/>cured the receipt for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; which I showed her and asked if that was her handwriting, pointing to the signature—she said it was—after Trussler had admitted this was not Mary Todd, I said to her, "How could you allow me to prepare this declaration, when you state that you came with the right Mary Todd, and you knew at the time this was Elizabeth Todd?"—I believe she began to cry—I could not swear as to the very answer she made—I and my father told them if they were allowed to go they must consider the charge</p>

               <p>as hanging over them, and most probably in the course of to-morrow (Wed<lb/>nesday) they would hear something more of it—I originally took the account in the name of Mary Todd, but have not the slightest recollection of the person by whom the money was paid.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Crown-court, Covent-garden, and am the son of the late Mary Todd—she was a spinster—I proved her will on Saturday, the 27th of January—I knew she had money in the Marylebone Savings' Bank—she died on the 16th of January—I proved the will in a sufficient sum to comprehend the money in the bank—the prisoner Elizabeth Todd is my mother's sister—I have known Trussler five, six, or seven years.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did not you, as the executor, go and receive the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> During my mother's life-time some conversation arose respecting her name in the deposit-book, or the bank-book, I do not know which, but it was to the effect, that the book has only the name, of Todd, and I urged the pro<lb/>priety of her taking the book herself, at the next deposit, that I should have no difficulty in establishing the fact that it was her money, and no other Todd, knowing I was her executor, her answer was, "You know your aunt has paid in most of the money, and she will not cheat you,"and that she had on one occasion drawn out 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; of the money.</p>

I secured the warehouse at twelve o'clock at night—I went round the premises, and saw all the bolts and fastenings were secure—I observed the counting-house window was perfectly secure—I went into the ribbon-warehouse—the ribbons remain on the counters at night, with paper covered over them—the handkerchiefs are secured from being soiled by wrappers and papers—part of them were on shelves, and part on the counters—they were perfectly safe that night—I went down to the warehouse at seven next morning, entered the counting-house first, and found a drawer in which I keep cash, had been broken open since left it the preceding night—my desk was also forced open, and there was a ladder placed against a shelf in the counting-house, on which books are kept, that would enable a person to get up to the counting-house window, which is a sky-light, very easily—that sky-light had a square of glass taken from it, which would enable any person outside to get into the counting-house—they might get there from a court at the back of the premises on to the flat leads—there are three shelves, which they might use as a ladder to get down from the sky-light—I found a screw<lb/>driver on the desk, a taper, and a box of lucifer-matches—there is not the slightest difficulty in getting from the counting-house into the warehouse—it is on the same floor, the ground-floor—I entered the handkerchief depart<lb/>ment of the warehouse first, and found the wrappers which covered the shelves had been lifted up, and remained in that state—I did not miss any<lb/>thing from there myself—I went into the ribbon warehouse, and found the papers which had covered the ribbons thrown on the floor—I saw some ribbons were gone—I could not tell how many—the locks, and bolts, and everything remained as I had left them the night before, except the sky-light—about thirty young men reside in the warehouse, and sleep in the house—the warehouse forms part of the house, and is under the same roof.</p>

I was in the prosecutor's warehouse, and William Waller, who lives in Bridge-street, Southwark, and is a customer of ours, came there, about eleven o'clock in the morning, and brought ten pieces of black figured satin ribbon for sale—there were twenty rolls—our black ribbon was undressed—I knew them again when he produced them, and detained them—I afterwards produced them to Mr. Leaf.</p>

I have known Hirt seven or eight years, as a commission man—he once kept a warehouse in Gutter-lane—he frequently came with samples of goods, and also has taken samples from my place—he produced a quantity of black and coloured ribbons to me three or four months ago—part of the black was undressed—I have since seen ribbons in possession of the police, which correspond in appearance with those produced by Hirt—they are precisely the same—he asked me if I would buy them—I said, "No, they don't suit me"—he then said, If u you do not think proper to buy them of me, I will introduce you to my principal"—I said, "They won't suit me"—he said again, "Are you fright<lb/>ened to buy them? if so, I will introduce you to the principal, to whom they belong"—before he made that observation, I said to him, "Hirt, you are getting on in trade; I never saw you with a parcel of goods before"—he said, "They don't belong to me,"and asked, if they did not suit me, would I re<lb/>commend him to a customer—I said, "You know the ribbon trade as well as I do"—he mentioned several names, asking if they would suit so and so, and, among them, Mosenden—I said, very likely they would, as I had seen Mr. Mosenden that morning, and sold him a similar lot of goods—he then left, as I supposed, to go there—he had left the ribbons in my passage for a quarter of an hour or so before I saw them, and said be would go and get a sample of ban<lb/>danas,</p>

When I left the premises on the 10th of Oct. they were perfectly safe—I came again at nine o'clock in the morning, and missed some instantly—they were printed, and some China—none of them were common spun—I missed altogether from twelve to twenty printed ones, and six or twelve pieces of China—the value was a little above 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—I have since seen six pieces of printed bandana in possession of John Walls—I believe them to be part of what were stolen on the night in question—I have seen another piece in possession of Peto—they were printed, and two others in possession of Cotton—they are all printed—I believe all I have seen to be part of the stock lost that night.</p>

(which is a place where people pay for goods weekly) he said, "Yes he does"—I asked if there was any thing wrong in his affairs, if there was any fear of his becoming a bankrupt—he said, "The fact is, he is on the eve of bankruptcy, but they will all be redeemed again"—I heard of this robbery afterwards, and on the 31st of Dec. I accidentally met Robinson at Bow—I asked if his name wai not Jones (he had pledged them in the name of Jones, Tabernacle-row)—he said, "No, sir, my name is not Jones"—I said, "Indeed"—he said, "No it is not"—I said, "You live in Tabernacle-row, do you not?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Where do you live?"—he said, "I live at Hoxton"—I said, "Where have you been to?"—he said, "I am going to Stratford"—I told him he was going the wrong way for Stratford, that I was going there, hot he was coming from it—he said, "Then I will turn back and go with you"—I said, "No you will not, we will go ahead now; you know me, I suppose, don't you?"—he said, "No, sir, I do not"—I said, "You surely must know me, at Mr. Wood's, at the corner of Ashby-street, St. John-street-road?"—he said, "No, sir, I do not"—I walked on with him some distance till I met u officer—I told him this man was wanted—he took him, and we came to London.</p>

Fincham's—the prisoner Hurcam brought one bale of coffee from the London Docks to us on the 13th—the warrant for that was delivered to Hutchin at the same time as the other—I heard Hurcam say that he could not get the three bags of coffee—he did not say why.</p>

Fincham—I also gave him a warrant for another bale of goods from the London Docks, at the same time, to be delivered at the same place—I saw him again on the Monday, about twelve</p>

               <p>o'clock on the stand on Dowgate-hill, with his cart, not going to the St. Katha<lb/>rine's Docks—there had been some inquiries made of me by Messrs. Fincham, about their coffee—I told Hurcam there had been great inquiries about that coffee, that it had not come to hand—he said he had not received it—I went to his brother, and made inquiries of him—I received another mes<lb/>sage from Messrs. Fincham and Co., in consequence of which I went again to the prisoner Hurcam, and found him in the Three Crowns, Dowgate-hill—I inquired again respecting the coffees, where they were, and what really were delivered—he said he had delivered the order back to Messrs. Fincham—I said, "If you had not got the coffee, you ought to have delivered the warrant back to me"—I then went back to Messrs. Fincham to inquire for the warrant—I did not find the warrant or goods there—next morning I went to St. Katharine's Docks—in consequence of what I heard there, I pro<lb/>cured a constable, and gave Hurcam into custody—he said he knew nothing about the coffee, that it was taken away by some one—I afterwards gave directions to have Reeves taken.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he get away after it was dropped? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He fell down, and I took him into custody immediately—the lead was found two or three yards from where he fell.</p>

I sold that house to the prisoner—there was a trifling dispute between us about the fixtures—subse<lb/>quent to that, on the 26th of Jan., I was passing No. 41—the door was open—I stopped, looked in, and saw the prisoner in the parlour—I said, "Old fellow, are you going to let us have the fixtures?"—he said, "What do you want?"—I repeated it—he rose from the chair, and advanced to the door where I was standing outside—he came within a yard of me, I should Say—he then drew a pistol from his pocket, and presented it at my head—seeing the pistol, I turned round, and made my escape into the next house, No. 40—I went direct through the passage to the yard at the back of the house—I went into the yard, and closed the door after me—when I was closing the door, I heard the report of fire-arms—I saw no more of the prisoner till I saw him at the station—I afterwards observed that something had gone through the door.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father and mother, in Munster-street—I have three brothers, one named Arthur, who is older than me. One Sunday morning, about eight o'clock, when Arthur was in bed, my brother Edwin and I wanted to take out two dogs which we have—one of them would not go out with him—the prisoner, who is my father, was in the room—he took a broom-stick to poke the dog out—it threatened to fly at him, and bit the broom—Arthur then kept the dog back, and said it should not go out, it was his dog—after breakfast my father was reading the paper—Arthur interrupted him and my father told him to be quiet—Arthur said he bad a right to talk, that was amusing himself with reading the paper, and he was amusing himself he with talking—my mother begged my brother to be quiet, and then my father took up the poker to him, and said he would make him be quiet—my brother then took up the tongs—my mother said, "For God's sake, put down unlawful things, there will be mischief done"—my father then put down the poker, and my brother put down the tongs—my father said he would not do a bit of work till that dog was got rid of—he then punched his fist on the table, and broke a piece off it—my mother then said to my father, "Well, you need nol to have broken my poor father's table"—my father then took up the piece of table and smashed it all up—there were two pots on the table—they fell off—my mother said, "Now you have broken my father's table, I will break your pots"—she kicked one, and broke it—Arthur broke the other pot, and said he—would do that much towards it—after my father broke the table, Arthur struck him with his fist, and knocked some of his teeth out—after that Arthur went out to buy a cap (the shops are open in Tottenham-court-road)—he came home again, and we were at dinner—my mother offered Arthur some dinner—he said, "No, I have had some"—my father said, "Don't give it him, eat it yourself"—soon after that Arthur went out again—he re<lb/>turned in about an hour and a half, and laid down on a chair to sleep, and slept till about six o'clock at night—we had then had our tea—my mother sent</p>

I am house surgeon at University Hospital—the boy Arthur was brought there on Sunday evening the 14th Jan., at near eleven o'clock—he had four wounds on the scalp, varying from an inch and a half to three inches long, two of them one above each other, over both eyes, the skull was fractured; there was a fissure; the scalp was torn from the skull; over the right eye the covering of the bone, the peritoneum was removed; his nose was very much injured, there being a large cut extending from one cheek to the other, across the nose; the two nasal bones forming the prominence of the nose were broken in pieces, and the two processes of the superior maxillary bones were both bare; the six front teeth of the lower jaw were entirely broken off level with the gum; the tongue had a triangular wound, and there were several smaller wounds about the face; he appeared to have bled very much, and was quite in a collapsed state when he came in—I ordered him to bed—he rallied, and I dressed the wounds—none of the wounds were dangerous in themselves, but from the effect that might follow I supposed him to be in great danger.</p>

               <p>Jan. I was at the Post-office—I had previously procured this letter with the Birmingham post-mark on it, addressed to Mr. Tyrrell, Bank of England, London—Mr. Russell, another inspector, was with me in the assistant-inspec<lb/>tor's room—I saw Mr. Russell inclose a sovereign in that letter, and a 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; note of the Edinburgh Bank—before the sovereign was inclosed in the letter I marked it on the obverse side, and Mr. Russell marked it on the reverse side—Mr. Russell sealed the letter with coloured wax—this is the sovereign—my mark is a dot, on the head side, after the word "Rex"—I have a me<lb/>morandum, which I made at the time, of the mark, and it answers the de<lb/>scription of the coin—the date of the coinage was also taken down—the letter, with the sovereign in it, was placed in this other letter, directed to "Mr. F. Morgan of Birmingham, to be left at the Angel Coffee-house, next door to the Bluecoat-boy, City-road, Islington, London"—I then sent for Henry Rice, the superintending letter-sorter, and gave him the letter, with directions to place it among the prisoner'sletters in the Inland-office—at that time the letter, with the sovereign in it, was certainly placed within the folds of the other—it was allowed to fall into it, so that it could not be perceived, and it could not shake out—the prisoner was on duty that morning—I went to the Angel Coffee-house, where the outside letter is directed—I got there about ten minutes past nine—I was not acquainted with the landlord up to that time—I stated to him why I came—about a quarter of an hour after I had been there the prisoner came—that house is within four or five doors of the first house at which he delivered any letters—he delivered this outside letter to the landlord, who immediately gave it to me—the other letter was not then in it—I saw the prisoner deliver this to the landlord, and without losing sight of it, I received it from him—I then went to the Bank of England, and saw Mr. Tyrrell, to whom the inner letter was directed—I as<lb/>certained that he had not received the letter—I was on duty at the Post-office next morning, the 30th—John Arthur, the letter-carrier for the Bank of England, received instructions to bring all letters directed to the Bank of England to me that morning, and had done so up to eight o'clock, about which time he brought this inner letter, directed to Mr. Tyrrell, saying he had just found it on his desk—he gave it to Mr. Boydon, another assistant-inspector—I was not there at that moment, but I received it within a minute afterwards—it was then sealed, but it had been opened—it was not opened in my presence—Mr. Rackley, another assistant-inspector, showed the letter to the prisoner, who was sent for as he was leaving the office, about a quarter-past eight in the morning, and said, "Have you seen that letter be<lb/>fore?" or, "Do you know anything of that letter?" or words tantamount to that—he said he knew nothing about it—Mr. Rackley replied that he had evidence that the letter had been in his possession yesterday—the prisoner's seat is about six or eight yards from Arthur's desk—there are ten or twelve letter-carriers' seats between them—the sovereign is my own.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-officer attached to the General Post-office. On Tuesday morning, the 30th of Jan., I was sent for to the inspector's office—I there saw the prisoner, Mr. Rackley, Mr. Blott, Mr. Russell, and Mr. Playle I believe—this letter addressed to Mr. Tyrrell was produced, and the prisoner was asked if he knew anything about it; but before that, he was cautioned that whatever he said would he used in evidence against him—he said he knew nothing about it—it was stated to him that it was known it was in his possession the day before—he said he knew nothing about it—I asked where he lived—he said at No. 26, Goswell-terrace, Goswell-road—I went there, and saw a female on the first floor, who answered to the name of Frost—I afterwards went back, and stated, in the prisoner's presence, what had passed between myself and Mrs. Frost—I said to her, "I want the sovereign your-husband gave you yesterday"—she went into a back room—I followed her, and from a chest of drawers she took this box and gave to me, stating that the sove<lb/>reign was inside—I only found one sovereign in it—it was not locked, nor Were the drawers—this is the sovereign which I have produced—I asked her when her husband gave it her—she said the day before, after he had done his delivery—I returned to the Post-office with the sovereign and box, and stated to the prisoner that his wife had given me the sovereign, stating that he gave it to her yesterday—he said that all the money he had got, he got on his work yesterday for his directories and postage—he was asked where he got the so<lb/>vereign from—he said he did not know—the sovereign was shown to Mr. Playle and Mr. Russell—I afterwards pointed out the woman who gave me the sovereign, to Mr. Rickards and Richard Craddock.</p>

                  </hi>. I was chief mate on board the vessel commanded by Captain Dunnett—I joined the vessel at Guayaquil—Wilkinson and Gibbs shipped a day or two after I did—when we arrived at Bahia, Wilkinson and Gibbs came and asked the captain leave to go ashore, to see the doctor, consul, as they did not wish to stay in the ship, for they were not able to their duty—the captain said he could not put them ashore till he had himself first seen the consul—the captain went ashore to see the consul, and sent a boat for them about one o'clock—they then went on shore, and came on board again about four o'clock in the afternoon—(we anchored at Bahia on the 4th, and left on the 7th, I think)—Wilkinson did not come on board again at allgibbs and Clyne said they had come for their clothes, as they had got a dis<lb/>charge from the consul, to stop on shore at Bahia—it was too late then to take their clothes on shore, and we did not let them have them—they came again next day—they said nothing about the doctor.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a passenger on board the vessel—before it arrived at Bahia, I had heard both Gibbs and Wilkinson complain to the captain of sickness, Gibbs, from the time he first came on board, and Wilkinson, per<lb/>haps</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184402050060"/>
               <p>three weeks or a month before—I saw Gibbs state—my opinion is, had we not touched at Bahia, and got medical advice, he would have died—we arrived at Bahia on the morning of the 3rd I believe—on the vessel coming into port, four of the men came to the captain and requested to go ashore—three of them, Gibbs, Wilkinson, and Clyne, in consequence of ill-health—the captain went ashore with me before he would allow them to go ashore—I did not remain with the captain while he was at the consul's—I met the men with the captain at the chandler's-ship store, and saw him go with the men to the consul—on their return I heard him tell them, "You hear what the consul has said, the doctor will not grant you certificates, you must go on board"—they replied, "No, we will not go on board, it will be cruel for the consul to compel us to go on board in the state we are in"—the captain said, "I shall go to the consul and report you, and of course he will be obliged to take you up as deserters"—the captain left me, to go to the consul—I did not go with him—I saw the captain again a few minutes after—I know Lodine, and Smith, and another man—I consider they were shipped instead of these men—I was with the captain afterwards, looking after other men, and he got these men from the master of the <hi rend="italic">Eschylus</hi>, lying in the harbour—he went to the consul for his papers—I was not with him when he got them, but he shortly afterwards returned, and the vessel sailed—I took the last man on board myself—I went to the consul to do that, but he was not in town—I saw his clerk—the vessel sailed about three hours after that—I gave the witnesses some money—it was not given me by the captain—I did not give them dollars, but what is termed milrees, which is paper money—I have never had that money repaid to me—it was a present from me to the men—I considered it really a cruelty to have sent the men on board the ship, and believe they deserted the vessel in consequence of ill-health, and with the feelings of a sailor I could not allow them to be left destitute in that country, without assistance—I am a sailor myself, and have commanded a merchantman—I swear the money was my own, and it was given them for my own objects.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

English, but the exchange varies—I gave it them entirely from feelings of compassion, and I think any man, under the circumstances, would have done so—the captain dared not give them money as deserters from a ship; and as proof, he did not wish to defraud them of their wnges, he brought them on shore himself to the con<lb/>sul, in his own boat, and a doctor with them—he never told me to give them money—I do not know that the consul did not grant them certificates—I was at the store when the captain was talking to them, except for a very few seconds—the consul's office is only four doors from the store—I saw them walking with the captain—the captain could not have had any conversation with them at the store when I was not present, nor at any time—I should say that was not more than two or three hours previous to the vessel sail<lb/>ing—I believe I was scarcely ever absent from the captain, except at the time he went to the consul's—he never went from the ship without me.</p>

I attended the deceased the day after the accident—on removing the dressing of his head there was a long torn wound extending five or six inches to within an inch of the outer corner of the right eye—it went through the integuments down to the bone in front of the head—he died from nervous spasm, from locked jaw, which in my opinion arose from the injury—that is not the reasonable result of concussion—it does sometimes arise after wounds</p>

               <p>should have thought it was from pain, but as it was after, I thought it was liquor—excitement might come on, but not so soon after the accident—he did not manifest any excitement while being dressed—the accident might reduce excitement if he was intoxicated before—it might be the effect of the injury he received.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, at Thornhill-wharf, Pentonville. On the 6th of Jan. I was at King' s-cross, and saw two omnibuses going at the rate of about nine miles an hour, within three or four yards of each other, I think, but I could not plainly see the Association one which was behind—they were coming towards me—I saw the Great Western omnibus, in at<lb/>tempting to pass the chaise, catch the near hind-wheel, and throw the chaise half over, and when it came down again it pitched the deceased out on his head—there was no difficulty in passing—the road is fifty or sixty feet wide—the chaise was three or four feet from the curb, and going at the rate of four or five miles an hour—I think with ordinary care the accident might have been avoided—the prisoner did not stop—I ran after him, seeing Mr. Hatton was bleeding from the head—I said to him, or the conductor, "You had better stop, I think you have killed a man!"—I hallooed three or four times, both the conductor and the prisoner were turning their heads—a gentleman inside put his hand out, and insisted on their stopping.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long was the gig in your sight before this hap<lb/>pened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not more than two or three minutes—it was the hind-wheel of the omnibus that struck the chaise—it caught the tires of the wheel—it was sixty or seventy yards from the Cross—the omnibus stopped parallel with the Cross—I have seen the Great Western omnibuses before—I think they are more carefully driven than other omnibuses—the practice of the other pro<lb/>prietors is to put one omnibus before, and another behind, to hunt them.</p>
               <p>The Hon. <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLES LENNOX BUTLER</hi>. v live in Grove-end-road. I was in this omnibus—I entered it near Harley-street—it went at a fair pace to the corner of Tottenham Court-road—we started from there at a rapid pace, and I observed another omnibus running at the side of us—both drove at what I considered a fair pace till we arrived at Euston-square—they stopped at the side of the square, as if to rest for a moment, then drove at a very fast rate indeed, till they arrived at the spot where this accident happened—I was in such a state of alarm, that I took out my pencil and entered the number of the om<lb/>nibus I was in, and the one that was racing against us—I put my pocket-book back, and in two minutes this occurred—I saw somebody thrown out of a chaise—v sat facing the window next to where it occurred—there were not many passengers, but they were all shook, or raised off the seat, by the con<lb/>cussion—I immediately called to the conductor to stop—he took no notice—v called a second time more peremptorily—he then called to the driver, who stopped—a man ran up and told him to stop.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> On which side of the omnibus were you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the right, and about the centre—there were five other passengers—I sum<lb/>moned the two drivers before the death occurred—I cross-examined the wit<lb/>nesses before the Magistrate—v was brought up to the law, but did not take to it—v have not employed any attorney.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Arnold, of No. 27, Great Portland-street. I let lodgings in the course of last year—I had lodgen there in June—the prisoner lodged there—I have no doubt of his being the person—his appearance was not different to what it is now—he wore hair on his upper lip—he lived there about twenty weeks—the last time I saw him was Friday, the 30th of June, about four o'clock in the afternoon—I know Lieutenant Monro by sight—he breakfasted with him that morning—he was in the habit of coming backwards and forwards to Mr. Grant, I think, for weeks—I cannot tell how I learnt his name, but I have heard it mentioned—I believe he was there again on the same afternoon—I did not see him—I heard he was there—I did not hear his voice—Mr. Grant came home again that Friday evening, I should say between nine and ten o'clock—I did not see him—I never saw him after four or five o'clock in the afternoon—the last time was when he was outside, passing the window—his portmanteau and things were left, and were taken away some months after—he had given no notice of going away—I had no other gentleman lodger in June last.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Wright and Smith, attornies, Golden-square. Iwas applied to on this matter on the evening of the 31st of Jan.—a letter came to our office, directed to the firm, which inclosed a letter which I have, and which brought my attention to this—I afterwards saw Robinson on the subject, and received from him this card, and one or two letters—the letter in question I received from Mr. Wright—in consequence of an arrangement that was made, I went to Grillion's hotel, and saw Robinson—in consequence of what he told me, I went to Vine-street station, procured the assistance of Mount, the constable, and went with him and Robinson to No. 116, Drummond-street, the address on this card—I knocked at the door, and asked whether a person named Smyth lived there—I found that he did, and was at home—I was asked into the passage, and the prisoner came down to me—I introduced myself as a friend of Mr. Robinson's—he asked me to walk in, which I did, into the back parlour—I told him I understood he made a very abominable charge against Mr. Robinson—he said, "Hush, hush, there are gentlemen in the other room, they will hear what you are saying"—I told him that rather than avoid any exposure in such a disgraceful matter, I had called to endeavour to arrange it—I produced a letter to him, not the one in question, and said, "I believe that is your handwriting, Mr. Smyth?"—he said it was—I then asked whether he had written a letter dated the 28th of January, in which he said he had lost 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, and claimed three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; notes—he said he had—I asked what was the reason that he claimed those three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; notes—he said that Mr. Robinson might have settled it at that time if he thought proper—I then asked if he had written a letter the following day, in which he claimed 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—he said, "Yes, I certainly did write the letter"—I asked why he wrote that second letter—he said that Mr. Robinson had not acted in a gentlemanly manner, and that was the reason he had doubled his demand, or the reason why he asked 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—I said I thought it was a great pity a thing of this sort should become publicly known; that I had seen Mr. Robinson, but, unfortunately, all the money he had in his pocket was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but I had promised to go to a friend of mine and get 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; more, in which I had failed—he then asked, if I was a friend of Mr. Robinson's, why I did not pay the money myself; at the same time adding, "If your friend won't advance money, why don't you go and get it?"—at the latter part of the conversation I drew my purse from my pocket, and said, "All the money I have is about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;"—I then produced a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; note, and said, "Will you take this on account, and I will pay the other 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in the course of to-morrow?"—he said, "I have no objection to take the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, pro<lb/>viding you promise me faithfully to bring the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; to-morrow"—I asked what time it would be convenient for me to see him, and one o'clock was fixed—I gave him the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; note of the Brighton Union Bank—the policeman was waiting opposite the house at this time—I asked the prisoner if he would be kind enough to show me the way to the door, (for the purpose of giving notice to the policeman—all the story about bringing the money to-morrow was a scheme for the purpose of giving him into custody with the note on him)—he came to light me to the door—he put the light down on the ground—I took off my hat, which was the signal agreed upon with the policeman—he came up immediately, and I gave him into custody—Robinson was waiting a door or two from us—I made a motion to him, and he came up and identified him—when the policeman came up, the prisoner ran from him, down the passage, and into the back parlour—the policeman and I followed him—he made a motion with his arm, as if to throw something out of his hand, and, as I fol<lb/>lowed him in, a piece of paper dropped on the table—I took it up, and it was</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>)—" Sunday, 28th January, 1844, Mr. Roberson, Sir, It gives me the greatest pain to be under the necessity of writing to you on a subject I am now about to do, but I think it better to apprize you of the circumstance before writing to his Lordship, your master; as I lost on Saturday night, in your bed-room, or on the stairs of the hotel, a small brown pocket-book, containing three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; Bank of England notes, of which I have not the numbers, and having a call for a large demand of cash on Wednesday morning, will, I assure you, greatly injure me; and that dread<lb/>ful insult offered by you on that night, in wishing me to let you commit such a crime on my person as you did, is much against you, and unless you for<lb/>ward to me the sum lost, by Tuesday night, my solicitor will write to his Lord<lb/>ship on Wednesday morning concerning your base conduct. I am bent on going to the utmost extremity of the law, should you fail in sending it to me at my lodging, 116, Drummond-street, Euston-square, by the time named. I feel so disgusted with you, that I sincerely hope, you will not attempt calling on me; for a man of your years to be guilty of such a crime, was you now here, I am sure I should give you in charge; return me what I have lost, and keep out of my way, and no one shall ever hear of it. Mr. Roberson, Grillion's Hotel, 7, Albemarle-street, Piccadilly, London."</p>

Hartman," and I called to his attention that in the body of the note it was "William Hartman"—he said John William Hartman was his right name, and that was always the way he signed it—he said he met with Captain Farmer at his house, or counting-house, in White Hart-court—I went there in the course of the week, and found that he was not engaged in any such ship, nor was any such ship going out.</p>

I bad two paper-hangers working under me; I moved down to Graves-end about ten months ago for change of air. Parrot happened to see me there, and called me everything that was bad before a gentleman who employed me. I never left him in the public-house, neither was I there at the time.</p>

               <p>On the 6th of Jan. I was in the back parlour behind my shop—I saw the prisoner come in, in a stooping position, to the back of the counter, take a pair of brushes, and go out—I followed him eight or ten doors, and took them from him—he said, "Don't punish me, sir; I am a poor lad."</p>

I searched the prisoner's box—it was locked—she burst it open saying she had lost the key—I found this paper of copper in it—I know it, as it is rather a thicker paper than we usually put them up in—it was done up like the others, and a person could tell by the feel what was in it—I gave her in charge.</p>

The prisoner was butler there about three months—he quitted his service on the 28th Dec.—I know a person named Bridget Mullins, by sight—she was h the habit of calling on the prisoner—she never came farther than the street door, except three times—the first time the prisoner had met with an accident, and he said, "If my laundress comes, ask her down, I want to see her"—another time she came to inquire for the prisoner, he was out, and my fellow-servant insisted on her coming down till he came in, which she did, and was shown into the housekeeper's room—I saw her come in and go up—on the last time, when she went away the prisoner went out with her—we did not know she was his wife—she always came in the character of his laundress—she did not give any name till New Year's-day, which was the third time that was when she came to tell me she was the prisoner's wife—he was gone then—these are Mr. Robert Keate's candlesticks—I had seen them occasion* ally in use—I believe these knives to be Mr. Keate's and such as were in me—here are some of the same pattern to compare them with—these socks and carpet-bag are Mr. Keate's—the prisoner's wife had no opportunity of taking anything while I was with her—I did not lose sight of her when she came in January—I think these plate-brushes were there when the prisoner came into the service—here is a shirt, and a table-cloth, with Mr. Keate's name on them—this china vase is Mr. Keate's, and was always kept in the pantry cupboard—when the prisoner's wife came she brought linen to him and took it away to be washed, and with the single exception of that time when she waited in the housekeeper's room, she was not out of the prisoner's company—he came in and they went out together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you seen his wife since he has been committed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, at the office—she used to tell me tales about him—she had a child at the breast, which she called his child—Mr. Keate has eight servants—my duty generally takes me up stairs three or four hours every day, and then the butler attends to the door—there is an area gate—while the prisoner was there he and I were the only persons in the house, except for six weeks—during that time. I was in the country, and then another female and the pri<lb/>soner were in the house—he had charge of the place, and access to the cup<lb/>boards and plate chest—while I was in town I kept the key of the cupboard and the linen—when I left I gave them to Mr. Keate—these are common plated candlesticks—these knives were in parlour use—this shirt was kept in Mr. Keate's drawer.</p>

On the 27th of January the two prisoners came to the shop, and one of them asked if we had any pieces of meat—they both pulled the pieces over—I sold them three quarters of a pound for threepence—Cook gave me a sixpence—Penn was close by and saw the sixpence—I put it in the bowl—it was quite a new-looking sixpence—there were two very old sixpences in the bowl—both the prisoners went away together—after they were gone I took the new-looking sixpence out of the bowl, before any other had been put in—I looked at it, and let it be in the bowl till a man came in and told me something—I looked at the sixpence and marked it—I afterwards gave it to Allen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am principal warehousekeeper of the town ware-house of the East and West India Company—I have been so thirty-nine years, and have been familiar with the warehouse the last eight years—the preparatory steps to selling tea are, on the receipt of an order from a broker, to lay them down for inspection and sale—the lids are taken off the packages, and are laid down in numerical order—the broker attends, or some one, for the purpose of going through the teas, to give them a character for the governance of the trade, and samples are handed up by the servants in trays, each containing samples of three chests; then catalogues are issued—the trade are furnished with a card by the committee of brokers—the names and measures by which they are to sample are determined by that committee, over which the Company have no control—it is then the duty of the parties coming for samples to produce their card, and that card states which number of tin they are entitled to sample by—these are the tins—it is permitted to be piled and coned up as high as they can—it is the duty of the Company to take an equal return, according to the sample they have taken, and the tea is required to be as near the quality of the sample as pos<lb/>sible that we may lose nothing—the persons who come to sample bring tea in bags, according to the tea they are about to sample from—it is the duty of the servants to see that no persons sample tea who are not in possession of the card, and who produce the same quality and quantity that they take—John<lb/>son is overlooker, and Green a labourer—they were so employed that morn<lb/>ing—the samplers are not allowed to assist themselves—Green was a labourer under Johnson—Redman was a labourer, but his duty that day no way placed him in a position to be at the sample room—I did not know anything till that day of Harman or Neale—I had never seen them before—after they have got their samples, this list is on the table, for the purpose of registering their names as the persons belonging to the houses for which they register, which is signed by them, also the number of samples and the size, and the initials of the persons who take them—it would have been signed by Harman and Neale on that occasion, not by the labourers, they have only to see that they do sign when they take away their samples and bags—in consequence of information, on the 10th of Jan. I directed the gates at both ends to be watched—the mode in which the teas are to be obtained, and the mode of registering the person's name afterwards, are well kuown to Johnson and Redman—a little after two o'clock, on the 10th of Jan., I went to Fenchurch-street-gate—I saw Harman and Neale under the gate, with two empty bags—in consequeuce of a com<lb/>munication made to me, as they entered, I turned round, and followed them up</p>

               <p>stairs into the warehouse—that is the show-room—they took their seat at the remote table from the door, where the merchants go for the purpose of sam<lb/>pling—Green was in the room where the table was—there were no persons at the table but Harman and Neale—Johnson was near the entrance door of the room, where he had ample means of seeing what was going on—it was the duty of both of them to see the card—if two persons came together, it would be the duty of Green to see one card, and Johnson the other—they were not both to see the same card—Redman was down in some of the alleys, marking the lots on the chests—Johnson moved across the landing, from door to door—after Harman and Neale had taken their seats, Green brought up samples of tea, which was his duty, to the table where they were sitting—while Harman and Neale were in the room I went into the room to ask for the ware-houseman, Mr. Hitchings; and I went into an adjoining room, where I could command a view of the men and the tray—Green continued to hand the sam<lb/>ples up to Harman and Neale at the table—I saw the signing list on the table in the room where Harman and Neale were—after they have got their samples it is the duty of these persons to see that they sign the paper, and that they bring an equal quantity of tea for what they take—I saw Green lay the list on the table—Johnson then directed Harman and Neale down a staircase which would not have given them egress into the yard—it was a different staircase to the one they came up—before they left I saw Redman come up to them, leaning his hand upon the table, and stooping over, holding a conference with them—Johnson was still at the door on the landing—when Harman and Neale got up from the table to go, they each had two bags full—Johnson directed them down the staircase with the bags full—going down that staircase would take them into the street by a way that they would not pass me—I came out, and went up to Green—the list was on the table at the time—I asked him who those parties were, and whether he had seen their cards—he said, "Yes"—I asked him what the number was—he said he did not recollect—I said, "Then show me where they have signed the list"—he turned it over three or four times, and could not find it out; and as the thing was so recent, I rubbed my hand over to see where the ink was wet, and there was not any—he did not give me any name—I could not find the name of Weedon on the list—I then gave Green, Johnson, and Redman into custody—I was afterwards shown a bag of tea by Davis—when I saw Harman in custody of Davis I asked him if he had any card—he said he had not—I after that saw Neale in custody—I have examined the loose tea in the bag—it is congou, and such as we have is the warehouse, and not sample—this (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>) is the largest measure by which they sample—I sent for Johnson, Redman, and Green, to be brought down to the place where Harman and Neale were—I desired Johnson to look round the room, and see if he recognised anybody, with the exception of females, that he had seen at the warehouse—(Harman and Neale were close by at the time)—Johnson said, "Do you, Sir?"—I repeated the question, and re<lb/>ceived the same answer—I repeated it the third time, and his answer was, "I say, do you, Sir?"—I put the same question to Redman and Green, while Harman and Neale were close to them—they said they did not know them—in the course of the business which Redman had to perform in numbering the chests, he had no business at the table where the samples were—nothing could call him there—his duty would not call him at all to communicate with Harman or Neale; but he came up to the table while they were sitting there, before they got up to quit the room—I saw Johnson in the act of tearing up a piece of paper at the time I gave him into custody—I took it from him, and have it here; and here are three pieces of paper that were picked up at Redman's feet when he was searched by the officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Messrs. Hunt and Co., of Harrison-street, Gray's Inn-lane-road. I was private watchman to the establishment. I received instructions, and on the 13th of Jan. I watched the chasing-room—I got into an adjoining room, in which was a trap, which enabled me to command a view of the chasers' benches—there are two rows of benches in that room where the men work, and a trough runs along to catch the silver filings—I stationed myself there about a quarter before six, I saw the prisoner and a number of men at work—when the bell rung the other men left the room—one person remained to clear up the shop, and the prisoner remained dawdling about the shop—I thought he was filing his nails, but I did not see the file in his hand—I watched him narrowly—he stationed himself near the forge—he then took a gallipot, as I thought, and I saw him pour something from it into a piece of white printed paper—he folded or screwed the paper up, and put it into his pocket or about his person—I proceeded down to the counting-house to get teil clerk to go to Mr. Hunt—I stationed myself near the door—the prisoner came down almost immediately—I top ped him—he seemed confused, and asked me to let him go up again—I fused—he broke out of my custody, and ran up stairs into the chasing-rooidi from whence he came—I got up close to him—he was standing directly opposite me in the middle of the shop—I watched him—Mr. Hunt came inta the shop, and ordered him and me into Mr. Day's room at the end of the</p>

Between twelve and one in the night of the 23rd of January, I was rowing down the river with two officers, and was near the junks at Crown-wharf—I saw the prisoner in a loaded coal-barge—he walked to a light punt, lying between two loaded coal-barges—we rowed to him, and found him lying on the flat of his face, between two piles of coals—I asked what he was doing, he said he had brought the punt to take some coke when there was water enough—we went down and returned aside the barge, and saw him come up from the cabin, take several pieces of coal off one barge and the other, and put them into the punt—we took him in the punt—I have compared these coals with those in the barge—they correspond.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you know whose barge it was, except from what you were told? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not till I went and found Mr. Wickers—I did not observe the name on the barge—I took Wickers to the same barge—she was lying in the same place—the prisoner said he brought the punt down and was going to take her under the gas-works to load coke—we then went about fifty or sixty yards up the river, and when we came down again my brother officer asked him who he had got in his cabin—he said, "No one"—we did not say, "You had no coals forward when I spoke to you before"—he said the coali in the punt belonged to him, they were the remains of seven tons that he had had previously—I observed when I hailed him at one o'clock, that he bad coals in his barge—at the station he said to the best of his judgment he had eight tons of coals in his punt—I found there was one ton and three hundred weight—he did not say, "I must have lost three hundred weight myself"—we are frequently rewarded by the Commissioners of Police—I took him just after three—I did not from one till three take any person—it was a beautiful star-light night—there were not many vessels about—a person could get from one craft to another.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Calcutt, butcher, Queen's-buildings, Knightsbridge. From information I received on the morning of the 17th Jan. I watched the prisoner, who was our servant, from half-past five o'clock to half-past six, in the back parlour—it was dark—my husband goes to market at that time—I had a view of the shop without being seen by any one—there was a gaslight in the shop—I saw the pri<lb/>soner talking to some person at the door—a policeman first, then a man passed along who I did not know—the prisoner said, "Good morn<lb/>ing, stop a bit, I have a bit of washing for you"—I know where the pri<lb/>soner's washing is done—it was not his washerman—the man said, "You must be very quick, as I am rather late this morning"—the prisoner said, "Step round the corner, I will be with you immediately"—his going to the back would bring him close to the door—the prisoner then got on the desk and looked over to see if any one was in the parlour, but as I was close under the blind he could not see me—he then turned off the gas, and sawed off a breast of mutton, chopped it, and handed it to the man—he did not weigh it, or receive any money—I then looked over the blind to see if I could identify the man—I could not—the prisoner looked round and saw me—I went out and accused him of the theft.</p>

I was in company with the prosecutrix; we were both drinking; as I was passing next morning she called me, and sent me out several times; a man she called Smith came, and she gave me the scissors and cloth, and told me to get 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on them—I went to Mr. Sutton's, and could only get 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the man met me at the door, and told me to give the money to him, which I did; we went to the White Hart, and had a quartern of gin; the prosecutrix told the man to keep the change; soon afterwards she saw me, and told me to try to get the money to get the things back, as she was afraid of her husband; I said I had not the means.</p>

On the 6th of Feb. my wagon was in Brown's-lane, Spitalfields—I missed a cloth off my horse—I went up to the prisoner's cart, and found it on his cart—he said he did not take it from the horse—he went away, and left his cart with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Sinclair Puckett, of Rosoman-street, Clerkenwell. On Saturday evening, the 3rd of Feb., I went with my child into the parlour, with a lighted candle, and saw the prisoner standing by the side of the fire-place—I saw his face—he asked if Crawford was there—I screamed out, and he got out of the parlour-door—I followed him to the street-door—it was three or four yards from where he passed me, to the street-door—I had my candle in one hand, and the child in the other—the street-door was shut—he opened it after about two minutes—he was feeling up above the lock—I screamed, and put the candle in his face, which put it out—he escaped—I called "Stop thief," but did not go after him—he jumped off my step into the road, and went towards Lower Rosoman-street—he was brought back by a policeman and the person next door—I saw a black mark on his face, about an inch long, like the snuff of a candle—some one said they thought he got in over the area—he said he had not been there before at all—when he was brought back I missed a silk frock off the screen in the par<lb/>lour—I afterwards missed a pair of trowsers and a piece of calico from the back parlour—they were in a bundle which bad not been there before—they were safe half an hour before—when the policeman brought him back, he said, "Please don't give me in charge"—I found some matches in both rooms, and in the front parlour burnt matches, which had been struck, but not lighted—these are the things—they are ours.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Francis Tucker and two others, of South Moulton-street. In consequence of observations I made of the shop cash, during Aug. and Sept., I made a communication to my employers—I after<lb/>wards observed the entries made in the cash-book—I took particular observa<lb/>tion of the dripping and other stuff that was purchased during the 9th of Sept., 1843—on that day John Tarrant, who is usually in the shop, went to Gravesend—I remained there besides the prisoner—we were the only persons in the shop—at two o'clock the prisoner went to dinner—I looked at the drip<lb/>ping and the change—the dripping is kept in a large tab in the cellar, and the change on a board about three feet by two and a half—the tub would contain about three hundredweight of dripping or a little more—I took the trowel which is usually kept in the cellar and smoothed the surface of the dripping in the tub, and I made a cross on it all the way across the tub—I then examined the changes on the board—there was about two stone of it, just sufficient to cover the board—I returned to the shop and looked into the drawer which is used for the reception of dripping in the shop, before it is taken down to the tub in the cellar—I found the drawer quite empty—I have the shop cash-book here—it was the prisoner's duty to purchase dripping and articles of that description in the shop, and enter them in the book—while he was out that day I examined this cash-book—I found the last entry was two stone of changes, by which it appears that they had been delivered before he went to dinner, and there was about two stone of changes on the board or dresser—on the prisoner's return about three, I left the shop—I returned a little after four—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184402050176"/>
               <p>then looked at the shop cash-book and found an entry of thirty-seven pounds of dripping, 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and two stone four pounds of changes 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making together 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went in the cellar and examined the tub, and found there had been no dripping whatever added to it—I looked in the drip<lb/>ping drawer, and none had been put in there—I looked at the dresser, where the changes were kept, and none had been added there—the cross which I had made on the dripping in the tub was quite visible, and if thirty-seven pounds had been added to it that would not have been the case—on the 25th of Sept. Tarrant returned from Gravesend and I made a communication to him on this subject—here is the shop cash-book—it is balanced on the 8th of Sept., and the balance carried forward in Tarrant's writing—he went to Gravesend about twelve o'clock, and on that morning this book came into the prisoner's possession—he had to examine it and see that the cash corresponded with the entries—he balanced it on the evening of the 9th, and the balance is 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. over in the till, which will often occur—the balance brought forward is 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was the prisoner's duty to pay for changes and dripping out of the shop-till.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would not the prisoner frequently purchase in the morning and not enter them till the evening? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is not a usual thing—I have frequently seen him purchase dripping—I do not swear that on every occasion he has entered it—I do not know that he has not done so—I have not made any mistakes—I know Mr. Clarkson—I believe he keeps a little shop in Ebury-row—I do not remember his borrowing three papers of Palmer's wicks from our house—he frequently borrows them—I do not remember his borrowing three pupen of Palmer's wicks—I did not go to Mrs. Clarkson and tell her that I had for<lb/>gotten to enter three pounds of metallic wicks, and ask her what I should do, nor did I say, "You must not let our people know it, for if you do, Sargeant will find it out and kick up the d—I's own <hi rend="italic">row</hi> about it"—I will swear there was not an omission of entering three pounds of Palmer's candles—the prisoner has never found fault with my conduct—there might be a few little words perhaps—I do not remember omitting to enter some goods purchased by Mrs. Clark<lb/>son, on the 24th of Dec.—I will not swear I did not omit it—I do not remem<lb/>ber an entry that should have been made on the 27th of Jan. that was not in<lb/>serted till Feb.—I swear that was not the case—I never make entries in the book—I make them on a slip of paper—I have on every occasion made that entry at the time the sale took place—I never failed to do so—I am porter to the prosecutors—it might be the case sometimes, that when goods were de<lb/>livered at our house, instead of paying for them at the time, a ticket was given to the person who left them, and they would come some days after and receive the money; but that would be entered on the day on which the goods were bought, not on the day on which the cash was paid—I am certain of that, be<lb/>cause there is always a ticket left in the till, and that is brought in as the money paid out—it stands as cash in the book—when the cash is paid the ticket is then destroyed—I know that to be invariably the case—I have seen it done—I do not keep the books.</p>

               <p>the dripping and wax ends come from Lord Liverpool's house to our house for sale—I do not know what his lordship does—other noblemen and gentle<lb/>men send their dripping and wax ends—I do not know whether it is the practice of our house to allow the house-steward or the principal servant 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound on every article brought—there is a perquisite allowed—I do not know whether that 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound would be put down as a separate item—the prisoner's department was in the counting-house—he did not usually attend the shop, only when other people were absent, but he might come into the shop—I do not know who has got the prisoner's place, or whether it is settled—my wages were raised about five weeks ago, or a little more—it was since this affair.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Francis Tucker and others. On Wednesday, the 10th of Jan., in consequence of suspicion, I saw all the sperm and wax ends and scrapings that I had in stock, weighed, about two o'clock—Murrell and Tarrant were in attendance on me in so doing—the weight of the whole was 471lbs. 8ozs., and there appeared by the shop cash-book 13ozs. of scrapings bought that afternoon, which would make the whole weight 472lbs. 5ozs.—I used all the precaution in my power to ascertain the exact quantity—next day, the 11th, about ten ruinates to five o'clock, I gave directions to Shaw, the policeman, and I put three sovereigns and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; worth of shillings, all marked, into the till—there is a well in the till under where the money is kept loose, in which there is a bag with other gold in it—I do not see any entry made in the book by the prisoner on the 10th of Jan.—this entry of 13ozs. is by Tarrant—on the 11th of Jan., about half-past five, I found the prisoner had entered in the shop cash-book as having paid 13lbs. 8ozs. 8 drachms of wax ends 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, 4lbs. of sperm 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and dripping 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., making in the whole 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I directly called in the policeman, and took him into the counting-house—I called in the prisoner, and said, "Sar<lb/>geant, here is an entry I don't exactly understand, when did you buy these things?"—he hesitated, and at length said, "In the morning at eleven o'clock"—I said, "That answer does not satisfy me, I have strong doubts as to your integrity, will you show me the contents of your pockets?"—he threw a lea<lb/>thern purse on the desk—I said, "You have more money about you than this"—he then placed his hands in his pocket, and put on the desk a quantity of silver, I believe all in shillings—I found amongst them eight of the shil<lb/>lings which I had marked on the Wednesday and put them into the till on the Thursday at ten minutes past five during his absence, and this conversation took place about a quarter before six o'clock—I gave him in charge—I said to him, "To save me the trouble of weighing the stock again, the weight of which I know perfectly well, will you tell me where the things are that you say you bought?"—he replied, "You seem to know all about it; I don't say"—the policeman said, "You need answer no questions, but do you choose to account for having the marked money upon you?"—he replied, "I don't say"—I omitted to state that when I discovered the marked silver amongst his money I could not discover the marked sovereign—I had put three marked sovereigns into the till, and only two of them remained—one of them was gone—I then sent for the bag which was placed in the well of the till, and in that bag I found the marked sovereign—the prisoner was then taken to the station, and I proceeded to weigh the wax ends and other things, and allowing for the 13ozs. being added to it, the real increase was 3ozs., allowing for the turn of the scale—it was quite impossible that I that morning at ten minutes to ten o'clock, and the prisoner was engaged in my presence from about ten minutes to eleven till twenty-five minutes to twelve, and in that time he made no purchase of wax ends, or scrapings, or dripping—he never left the counting-house—I was engaged in an interview with a gentleman in a small place that adjoins the counting-house—while the prisoner was not engaged with me he was with Mr. Harrison in the counting-house—I can un<lb/>dertake to say that from ten minutes to eleven till twenty-five minutes to twelve o'clock he-was not out of the counting-house.</p>

I went to South Moulton-street, by directions from Mr. Smith—the shopman and porter went away, and during their absence I watched the shop—no person took any thing to sell that day—I saw the prisoner go to the till while no person was in the shop—I crossed the road, and looked through the window—he took something from a bag in the till, and appeared to be counting it—I thought it was money—he had it in his left hand, and was running it over—after that he went into the counting-house—about a quarter of an hour after that Mr. Smith took in the shop cash-book, and he said to the prisoner, "Sergeant, here is an entry I do not understand"—he asked him when these goods had been purchased—the prisoner said, "This morning, at eleven o'clock"—Mr. Smith said, "Why was not the entry made at the time?"—he said he had omitted it—Mr. Smith said, "I don't feel satisfied, I should like to see what you have in your pocket"—he gave him his purse, in which was a check and some money—he then put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out some silver, and amongst it were these eight marked shillings, which I now produce—Mr. Smith asked in what drawer he had placed what he bought—he said he seemed to know all about it, and he did not say.</p>

                  </hi>. In Nov. 1840, I was living in Back Church-lane, Whitechapel, and carried on the business of a boot and shoemaker. After the fire at Hoare's-wharf, I purchased some Hessian linen canvas, and other things, at the sales—there were five successive sales—I saw a man named Nathan at all the sales, and he saw me—on the 4th of Nov., Nathan came to me at Goulston-street, where I have a warehouse—he said to me, "Well, Mr. Berlyn, have you sold all your linen yet?"—I said, "No"—he said, "I think I can sell a great quantity for you; what will you allow me?"—I said, "I will allow you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; per cent. on all that you sell for me"—he said 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; per cent, would not pay him, and it was ultimately agreed that I should allow him a farthing a yard, which made it come to 6 1/4 <hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; per cent—he asked me to give him samples of the various sorts I had, and the quantity of each, which I did—he came again the same day and said he had seen the person he wanted the linen for, that he was captain of his own vessel, and a man of large property, that the captain wished to see me himself to bargain for this linen, and if I would go with him at half-past four that afternoon, after 'Change time, to No. 15, Baker-street, Lloyd's-square, Captain Cornish would try to deal with me—we arranged to go that afternoon at half-past four, after 'Change time—about twelve o'clock Nathan came again and said he had seen the captain since he saw me, and the captain wanted a quantity of flock—I said, "Flock is a thing I do not sell, and I am no judge of it"—he said, "I could not haw come to a better person than you; I know you have a few pounds at com<lb/>mand; I know a person who has a large quantity on hand, and has a bill to pay, and he would be glad to sell it at a little loss to turn it into cash"—I said I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184402050199"/>
               <p>was no judge of it—he said he had been brought up in that business all his life, and he knew the value of it to a fraction—he advised me to take a sample of it to the captain—Nathan went and got the sample and brought me the price as 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; a ton—he said the man had a ton and a half of it—Nathan and I then took the samples of the linen and the flock to No. 15, Baker-street, Lloyd's-square—the name of Cornish was on the door—we knocked, a lady opened the door, Nathan went in and I followed him—the lady said, "Your pleasure, sir?"—he said, "Will you be kind enough to tell Captain Cornish that Mr. Nathan is come?"—the parlour door then opened, and the prisoner was there—he said, "It is you, Mr. Nathan; step in"—we went into the parlour, and when we entered Nathan bowed to the prisoner, and introduced me as Mr. Berlyn, and then he said to me, "This is Captain Cornish"—the prisoner asked us to sit down, and when we had sat a minute or two, the prisoner laid, "Well, sir, I understand you have a quantity of this linen?"—he asked me the price—I said I had 4,000 yards of the Hessian linen, at 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 4,000, at 3 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he offered me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard, and to take the whole 8000 yards—I told him I could not make any abate<lb/>ment from the price, and he said as that was the case he could only take 1000 yards at 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when that bargain was made he said, "Have you brought a pattern of that flock that I wanted, Mr. Nathan?"—Nathan said, "Yes, Mr. Berlyn has got it"—I produced it, and agreed to let the captain have it at 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; a ton—I told him there was about a ton and a half—he said he wanted it for shipping—he did not mention what vessel he was captain of, but said he was going to set sail in a day or two—when I asked him the price for the flock he said I was much cheaper with the flock than I was with the linen, and he agreed to take that at once—he said I ought to make some little allowance, as all his dealings were for cash—I said I did business on no other terms—he then said, "I want these goods to-morrow; they must be here between twelve and one"—I said very well, he should have them, and they were to be paid for on delivery—that was the agreement between us at the time—I was then about to take my departure, and the captain said, "Won't you take a glass of wine before you go?"—I said I was not in the habit of drinking wine—he said I was not half a sailor, and would I have some grog—I at last had a drop of clear gin—I then went away, and Nathan with me—I laid to him, "Where is this flock?"—he told me to come with him, and took me to a man named Isaacs, of whom I bought the flock for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—the next day I took the flock and linen in a van and a cart—I paid a sovereign for the use of them—I went, and Nathan with me, to the house in Baker-street—I knocked at the door, and the captain opened it himself—he said, "Good morning, Mr. Berlyn; you have brought these goods; you are very exact; if you will be kind enough to take them round to my warehouse, in Spring-street, my man will be there and receive them of you, and he will assist you in unloading; then come back, and I will pay you"—I was going to leave the house with the goods, and he said to me, "Have you got the invoice?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Let me peruse it, to see that it is all right"—I gave it him and went round to Spring-street, where I met his man, and he assisted me to unload the goods into a coach-house—I then gave the men a sovereign for the van, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get some bread and cheese—I went back to the house, and knocked—I saw a woman, but I could not find the captain," and could not get my money—the next day I went to the police-office, and, by the advice of the Magistrate, I was accompanied to the prisoner's house by the police-inspector—I went to the warehouse with a sledge-hammer, and gave two or three men 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-piece to assist me—I broke open the door—I found the flock, and got all that back again—I went across the yard, and got into the house—I saw a lad, who came with a crow-bar, and said, "What do you want here?" and made a blow at me—I did not see the prisoner there at first, but I saw him afterwards at the back parlour window—he said nothing—I said, "I want my property"—a woman who was there held up the invoice, in the prisoner's presence, and said, "What do you want? it is only a mere debt; you can do nothing but sue for it"—I had broken the window to get into the house, followed by two or three persons—I got severely handled by a number of persons in the house where the pri<lb/>soner was—one struck me with a poker in the ribs, and I did not recover it for three weeks, and I got nearly blinded, as I had an umbrella <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> into my eye—I found about half the linen in the house, and succeeded in gaining that—the persons who went with me were frightened, and decamped—the value of what I lost was about 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—I saw Nathan after that, and taxed him with being a party concerned—he said what a fool I must have been to be <hi rend="italic">gulled</hi> by him out of so much money, and he only wanted such fools as me to enable him to pay for his wife's confinement—he mentioned something about sharing some money, but I forget it almost; it was, that two or three of them had a share, or a <hi rend="italic">swag</hi>, or something, out of it—I once saw the captain afterwards, but I could not secure him; I had broken both my legs and arms, and could not chase him—I found him here in Newgate, and recognized him at once.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brushmaker, and live at Walthamstow—I keep pigeons in a loft over a stable, and a wash-house. On Monday morning, the 22nd of Jan., I fed them, and saw they were all safe—there were from sixty to seventy—on the Tuesday morning, between seven and eight o'clock, I found the lattice door of the loft and the area door broken—the person had got over the pigstye—there were thirty pigeons missing—they were valuable—the prisoner had come to my house for employment five or six weeks before—he, wished to build a shed for me, but I did not allow him to do so—he came on my premises at that time, and saw the pigeons, and remarked to my man that they were very fine ones—on the Friday after the robbery I found four of my pigeons at Mr. Puryer's, in Hare-street, Bethnal-green—he de<lb/>scribed to me the person from whom he had them—in consequence of that I went with a police-sergeant to the prisoner's house, at No. 11, Hope-terrace, Bow-common, and in a back bed-room found fifteen of my pigeons—I then went into a shed in the yard, and out of a number of pigeons which were there, I selected three, which are all marked, and I can swear they are mine—this is one of them—it is a red-beard, and is marked on the wing—here is another which is marked on the wing—another, with a white feather in the tail, which was marked by myself—here is another, which if called an almond-drag, which is not to be matched in London—I value it at a guinea.</p>

                  </hi>. Iam in the employ of William John Bayfield, a pawnbroker, No. 73, New Cut, in the parish of St. Mary, Lambeth. The prisoner was in Mr. Bayfield's employ, and left on the 14th of Oct. last—he was in the habit of calling occasionally—on the 22nd of Jan., in the evening Isaw him outside the shop, and went to him—he said, "Is the governor (meaning my master) in the shop?"—Isaid, "No, but be is going out directly and so am I"—Ithen left him, and went in doors—Icounted a quantity of money which amounted to 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in copper, and 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold—Itook the silver and gold up stairs—6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in loose silver Iput into a cash-box—Ialso put 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold into the cash-box, and put it into a bureau in my master's bed-room—there was then 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in silver in two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; bags which Iput in the bureau by the side of the cash-box—Ilocked the cash-box and bureau, put the keys in a drawer in the same room, and then went out—Ihad lost sight of the prisoner all this time—it was about nine o'clock—when Igot a few doors from the house Isaw the prisoner walk into the house—Iwas in the habit of counting the money, and taking it up stairs every night—the prisoner knew that was the practice—he had lived with us eighteen months—Ireturned home about a quarter to ten, and from something which was said to me by the housekeeper about the pri<lb/>soner having been a long while in the garden, Iwent to see where he was—I</p>

I have some property in the neighbourhood of Romford, in Essex—I was living at Brixton in 1842—I had occasion to build some houses at Romford and Brentwood—Mr. Edwards introduced me to the prisoner, and he entered into a contract with me for taking some land, and building houses upon it—I adv<lb/>anced him money weekly to pay his men, and on other occasions—in March and April, 1843, he borrowed money of me—he borrowed 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; for a parti<lb/>cular purpose—he said there was an innkeeper to whom be owed some money, and I think he had a bill due for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, and begged I would let him have 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; to pay it—I gave him a check for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—he said Mr. Pain had disappointed him in a loan or payment of money to him, and on the following Wednesday he would bring me the 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—he never returned that money to me—he con<lb/>tinued working for me for about three months—his advances from time to time became much greater than the work he had done, and I found him in great difficulties, so that he could not keep on the spot to look after his men—when I applied to him about the 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, he said he would get me a bill of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; of Mr. Pain's, at two months' date—I had never seen Mr. Pain—I had heard of him by name, and believed him to be a respectable man, a surveyor—no particular time was named for the bill—it went on from week to week, I be<lb/>came alarmed, and pressed him to bring me Mr. Pain's bill for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—on the 17th of May he brought me this bill at two months for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, stating that Mr. Pain refused to give a bill for more than 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, and for a less period than three months—this is the bill—(<hi rend="italic">bill read</hi>)—he told me previously where Mr. Pain lived—when the bill became due, it was presented through my bankers—I never got the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am going on for eleven years of age. I am the daughter of Frances Hellens, and was living with her—on the 27th of Nov. I went out with my sister Selina—I went into Gloucester-street—a young woman came to me, and said, "Little girl, your bonnet is untied"—she asked me to let her tie it, and she did—she then told me she had a son who was gone for a soldier, and had stopped out all night drinking, and said, "I want such a nice little girl as you to go into a public-house and see if there is a soldier there"—I had my little sister still in my arms—the young woman then took her out of my arms, and told me to go into a public-house and look into the tap-room, and see if there was a soldier there—I went into a public-house—she then sent me into a little cake shop, and gave me a penny piece, and told me to buy a lady's-finger, and I did so—she then told me to go to an<lb/>other shop, and get a pound-cake for the baby—I did so—she told me to ask for a piece of paper—she wrapped up the cake and the lady's-finger, and put them into her pocket—she then sent me into another public-house—she then sat down on a step,. and gave me a fourpenny-piece, and told me to go and buy 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of plum-pudding, and to get 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. loaf, and she told me the first public-house she came to, she would sit down and have a pint of beer—she held the child while I went on all the errands—she then sent me for 2oz. of cheese, and I went—we got on to the London-hospital, and then she told me she wanted to go up a court for a minute—she went, and took the baby, and I never saw her nor the baby afterwards—she had told me to stop at the end of the court, and I waited a long time—I do not know how long—a woman said I waited twenty minutes—a good many people spoke to me, and a young man took me to the station, told the people I had lost a baby, and then that young man took me home—the woman who spoke to me, and took the baby, was dressed in a half-mourning gown, a black-crape bonnet, and a dark shawl—she had a crape flower by the side of her bonnet—she had a pale complexion, and she had a flat curl on her cheek—I believe her hair was dark—I was examined before the Magistrate, at Union-hall—I did not know the female who was produced to me, at first, but when I came to see her have the bonnet and shawl on, I recognized her—when I saw her first at Union-hall she was dressed very nicely, not in mourning—she was dressed better than when I had seen her before—the constable showed me a crape bonnet, and, to the best of my recollection, that was similar to the</p>
