I asked her if she knew whether it was a good note; she said she believed it was. I saw it was directed to Postlewaite, London; I asked her where that Postlewaite resided; she seemed to hesitate; in a little time she said she believed in Tooley-street. There was Westham, Essex, upon the note. On further questioning of her she said she believed the banking house was a large shop.

               <p>Q. Was your house broken open - A. Yes; the window was.</p>
               <p>Q. Who left the house last - A. I left it last, about twelve o'clock in the morning; I secured the doors and windows. I returned about one o'clock, I found the iron peg was out of the window. He got in at the window; the door was shut.</p>
               <p>Q. What property did you lose from there - A. Six shirts.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of them - A. Five pound all but a shilling; they cost more; they were worth that at the time they were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the shirts the last time before you left the house - A. I put them in a basket and covered them over with a cloth. I saw them a quarter of an hour before I left the house. I have never seen the shirts since.</p>

I followed him up the lane, and laid hold of him; I told him he had stolen these rails from Mr. Gosling; he said he did not steal them, he was carrying them for the old man. On my turning round within a few yards I saw some person; that person turned out to be Ironmonger. The prisoner put down the rails; we had a struggle. I took him to a public house about two hundred yards off. I immediately returned to the spot where I left the rails, I found them upon Ironmonger's shoulder, he was going off with them; I charged him with taking them, and desired him to put them down and go along with me; he did. The rails had been prepared under my direction, I know them to be Mr. Gosling's; they are the value of twelve shillings. I had seen them on the evening of the 23rd or 24th; they then were within the park; within a few yards of the lodge.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to her about the watch - A. I did; she abused me very much, and said she knew nothing at all about the watch.

After that, in a few minutes, she put her hand in her pocket again. and pulled out five shillings and five pence halfpenny; she gave that to her father, he never looked at it, but gave it to me directly: I kept the money till I surrendered it before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing about the duplicate. - A. She then swore an oath, have I given you the duplicate; yes, I said, and the seven shilling piece under it.

            . I am an officer of Worship-street-office. On the 4th of July I took the prisoner in custody, she was very much in liquor, at that time I received a duplicate of Mr. Dunkin, of a watch pledged for one pound one, on the 4th of July. This is the duplicate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her what she was charged with. - A. Not that time. On the following morning, when she was sober, I told her that she was charged with breaking the apartments of Mrs. Biggins, and stealing a silver watch; she said she did not break in, she found the key of Mr. Biggins's room in the passage, and she opened the door. She said nothing about the duplicate in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Look at that watch. - A. That is the watch that I left in my room on the 4th of July when I went out, it is my husband's property; it was stolen out of my room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I acknowledge I was in a state of intoxication that day, but what drink I had that day I had with my prosecutrix; I was going to do some work for her, and on account of my not going to her place, she was to bring the work to my father, therefore when I pledged the watch I gave the ticket to my father, and the money, in order for him to give it to her.</p>

I left her.</p>

               <p>Mr. TITFORD. I am a linen-draper at the corner of Finsbury-square. On the 18th of August I went out of my house, I returned home, I found the prisoner and another woman in company with her in my shop, they had been extremely abusive to Mrs. Titford; when I came in I said I would send for a constable, I sent for a constable, I told them that they had what was not their own, the other person said I should not see it, it was in the other woman's possession before, the prisoner took the parcel from the other woman, and said I should not see what was there. I sent for a constable; on searching the bundle I found a six quarter imitation shawl, on the other woman I found the other shawl, in my endeavouring to take them to the office she escaped.</p>
               <p>JONES. I am a shopman to Mr. Saunders, I was in the shop at the time that the prisoner took the shawls.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner take the shawls - A. I saw the prisoner come in the shop along with an old woman; she asked to look at some prints, we shewed her some prints, there was none that would do for her, I was at the time shewing two ladies some shawls, they were laying on the counter, I turned my back, and went to the far end of the shop to look at the invoice of them, and left the boy along with these two women, shewing them some prints. Before I returned they both went out, I missed nothing at that time. On the next morning I missed two shawls, I had seen them on the evening before when the two women came there, about twelve minutes before they came in.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the prisoner to the shawls. - A. The prisoner was at the counter close by the shawls, which were on the counter, the prisoner and the other woman were both standing together.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. You say that there were two ladies and a boy that were in the shop at the time, are they here. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not miss the shawls till the next day. - A. Not till the next morning, the shawls were not put strait that night, they were left in a drawer throwed altogether. The prime cost of these shawls was twenty-six shillings.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The young woman that I met gave me the bundle into my hand in that gentleman's shop, I held it for her, the gentleman asked me for it, I gave it to him, I said it did not belong to me.</p>

I work for Mr. Dodd, I saw the prisoner come in the shop, she asked to stand up out of the wet, I saw the boots hanging up when she came in, she staid about four or five minutes, when she went away the boots were gone, my master pursued her one way and I the other. I found the property upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might she be off. - A. About two hundred yards, she had got them wrapped up in a pair of pantaloons in her apron. As I was going out of the door I saw her drop some potatoes out of her apron, and one of the boots. I picked the boot up, I saw that she had got the other wrapped up in a pair of pantaloons; I took her to the shop and sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these boots inside of the shop - A. Yes; I am sure they were inside, within the door.</p>

They took me to the house; I do not know where it was.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, 135, High Holborn. On the 10th of August, between two and three in the afternoon, the prisoner came to pledge a gold watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say - A. She asked two pound; I lent her that sum upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about the prisoner being the person - A. No. I saw her again on the Monday following, at 28, Cato-street, at her lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you where she lived - A. Yes; St. Mary Devises, in Wiltshire; she pledged it in the name of

            , No. 9, Virginia-row; I have had the watch ever since; I produce it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to her house, 28, Cato-street - A. Because I disputed her pledging the watch. I went No. 9, Virginia-row, to enquire for Mrs. Gamble; I was told that Mrs. Gamble did not live there; I went there to enquire whether I could hear any thing of her; she gave that address; I was told that Mrs. Gamble did not lodge there, but Mrs Sweetman did. I was directed to Cato-street; I told her of the circumstance of the handbill coming round of the watch; that she must go with me; she came without any hesitation.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not deny having pledged the watch with you, did she - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the watch - A. About ten pound.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at that watch and tell me whether you know that watch - A. Yes; it is mine; I know it by the form of it; the name inside is Vivan, No. 19. I have no doubt of it being my watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going down Holborn talking to the child; a gentlewoman tapped me on the shoulder, she said I believe you are a countrywoman of mine; she asked me if I was not a Wiltshire woman; I said my husband was a Wiltshire man; she said she was going down into the country, she would give me a shilling to do a favour for her; she gave me the watch to pawn for two pound; she told me her name. Through the gentlemen disputing about the watch I forgot her name; I pawned it in my own name; I thought she came honestly by it; she was a creditable person. I gave the gentleman my true direction.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. What other person was in the house at the time - A. There were two servants, a gentleman that lodges in the first floor, an a servant of his.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door fast or not - A. No; and that is how I supposed she got in; it was a very sultry hot day, the door was left on a jar for the purpose of air coming in.</p>
               <p>JURY. I wonder how she could escape the notice of so many in the house - did any of the servants abscond from the house at that time - A. No; nor did the gentleman; he is a man of respectability.</p>

I followed the mob into the Shepherd and Shepherdess field; after the fight was over, the croud divided into two columns; after that I went up to see the man who was bruised, a soldier that had been fighting. In about a minute the prisoner and another worked in on each side of me between the mob, and one, by that means, I thought I felt the watch go out of my pocket; I tried to get my hand down between them to feel whether it was gone or not, they pushed against me so that I had not room, at last I gave a little back, I got my hands down, I found it was gone. I took one of them with one hand and the other with the other hand, I pulled them both five or six yards from the ring; I then said one of you two have robbed me of my watch, the men in the ring all came round me in one minute, and left the man that had been fighting; I kept my hold, and a gentleman popped his head over my shoulder; he said, young man you have got more than you can do, have not you a friend that can take one in custody while you keep the other, I answered yes, and delivered one out of my hands to my friend, and bid him keep him; he being rather afraid of the mob, did not touch him; I kept fast hold of the other. It was Goodman that I let go; he then stripped his coat off, and said, search me all over whether I have got the watch or no. Some person said, d - n you, put on your coat and go off, he put on his coat. The prisoner pulled a watch out of his pocket, and asked me if that was my watch, I told him no; my friend, said Hartley, make him prove where he has got that watch. He cried out, father, come and take my watch, they have robbed me of my watch. A man came up, pretending to be his father, took the watch out of his hands. They went away, I I saw no more of him, I still kept my hold of the other, and the mob began to hustle one person against me, and then another, they said I wanted to steal watches. I saw the mob all round was against me; I let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your watch. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Goodman afterwards. - A. Not till he was taken in custody the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there a great number of people around you when the watch was gone. - A. There were, but their backs were towards me, they never touched me at all, Goodman and the other were nearest to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never find your watch again. - A. I never saw the watch again.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see your desk again. - A. Not till past twelve at night, I then went again to my desk and found the desk was broken.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any body in the warehouse at the time the desk was broken open. - Q. Yes, the prisoner Hobson, he was horse-keeper, employed by Mr. Willan, he was discharged the day before. On seeing my desk broken open, and seeing the prisoner there, I asked him how he came there, he said he came through the hole in the warehouse, and that another person of the name of Craddock had come in before him. I observed the hole in the warehouse, it communicated to the stable, it was large enough for a person to come through; he said he came through the hole in the wall, he went to the desk, and took the halfpence and the penny pieces himself. I saw them found upon his person, among which was a twopenny piece. They are common coin, I could not swear to them, I lost them, and the twopenny piece was battered very much.</p>

He wheeled the barrow across the Strand into Swan-yard, I there asked him what he had got; he said nothing of consequence. I put my hand in the barrow, moved the rubbish, and saw the lead. I said you have got some lead here, you must take it back again; he was very loth to do that; he said you shall have part; I said no; take it back. He took it back to the commissioners side, by Mr. Goslen's; Mr. Bensfield stopped him; I went to the pay office and brought a constable. He told Mr. Bensfield that he got the lead from the gutter. It appeared to have been a chimney pot; it has been knocked up, there are marks of the bricklayers hammer upon it.</p>

               <p>Q. Are there leaden chimney pots upon the top of Mr. Bobery's house - A. Yes; there were a considerable number of chimney pots missing. The prisoner was a person employed on the top of Mr. Bobery's house. I consider the whole of the property his Majesty's.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it was unfixed or fixed you cannot tell - A. No.</p>

            . On the morning of the 18th of July I came down stairs a little before eight o'clock, and not finding my breakfast ready I walked out as far as Blackfriers bridge. and returned soon after eight; as I was coming down King-street to my own house I saw my young man, who was left in charge of the warehouse, pass me very swiftly, returning home; I hastened my pace in order to see what was the matter, as I found he was ringing the bell very hard before I could come to the door to ask him the question; he came towards me and told me that we had been robbed: I asked him who, and where; he said come along. I have just now left the two thieves in Cheapside; I went with him into Cheapside, he told me he had left them under Bow church clock; he said come along; I hastened with him up Cheapside, and on looking down Bow-lane the young man pointed out the two prisoners at the bar as the men. We followed them from Bow-lane into Basing-lane; seeing the two prisoners go into a public house called the Red Lion, the corner of Red Lion-court, Basing-lane, I immediately sent the young man to get a constable; he did so, and we went in and apprehended the two prisoners drinking together out of one glass. We found no goods upon them; the goods were dropped at our own door.</p>

            . On Tuesday morning, the 18th of July, at the house, 36, King-street, Cheapside; it is the corner house of Trump-street; that warehouse has two doors in it, one in Trump-street and one in King-street; I took the shutters down in the morning; I always make it a rule to secure the Trump-street door. On my sweeping the dirt out of King-street warehouse door, when I had swept the dirt off the pavement, I came in the warehouse, I heard a person rustling at Trump-street door, I went immediately and opened the door, leaving the King-street door open. On opening the door the prisoner

             asked me for a person of the name of Corbett; I then said that I knew no such person thereabouts; he then said the firm was Corbett and co.; I still said that I knew no such person thereabouts; then he said he had got a direction in his pocket, he wanted me to read it for him, but he made an excuse, said he could not find it. In the mean time I heard a rustling noise at King-street warehouse door, which I had left open, I turned myself round and saw the prisoner Wilson conveying some printed cottons out of the warehouse, from off the pile which lay on the counter in the warehouse; I called out to him, who is there? and before I could leave the Trump-street door I saw the prisoner Wilson come round the Trump-street door to go into the market, from the King-street door, without the goods; by seeing him and knowing him to be the same person I saw conveying the cottons out of King-street warehouse door, I asked him what he wanted there, he turned himself round and said he wanted a person of the name of Smith; they then both were at the Trump-street door, I immediately secured the Trump-street door and went to seek for the property I was left in care of. On my going out of King-street warehouse door I saw the eight pieces of cotton lay by the King-street door, on the pavement, with two or three ends lodging against the threshold of the door; I picked up the goods, brought them in, and laid them on the counter; I secured both the doors of the warehouse and put the key into my own pocket, I then went and stood in the private doorway and saw the prisoner Wilson standing at the bottom of the street; in the Crossway of Cateaton street, looking up the street, with his back to Guildhall, I went up stairs to get my hat, I came down stairs, went down the street, I saw neither of them; I then went into Cateaton-street, and made my way into Cheapside; I saw Wilson and Simpson nearly under the clock of Bow church, in company with a Jew, with a bag under his arm; they were all talking together; I then hastened into King-street as quick as possible; I was ringing the bell very violently, finding no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180909200011"/>person in the warehouse I turned myself round I met Mr. Bloomfield close to the door, I told him that we had been robbed, and wished him to hasten with me, that I had left the two men in Cheapside; we pursued after them and found the two men in Basing-lane; they stood there about a minute or two, they went into the Red Lion public house in Basing-lane. I went and got a constable; we went into the public house, I gave charge of them both, they were taken to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. The goods that were taken out, were they your master's goods - A. Yes; I can swear to the goods; they were all of one pile laying on the counter.

On the 23rd of August, about half past nine at night, I saw my marked money was all in my till; I had marked a dollar, fourteen shillings, and three sixpences; the shop then was shut up; I left them safe in my till and all business in the shop had ceased.</p>

               <p>Q. You had inside shutters in your shop to secure the shop - A. Yes, the last shutter that was shut up was locked, that secures the whole. On the morning of the 24th I looked at them again, I found there were about twelve or fourteen shillings, the dollar was missing. Upon this I went out for a constable, I assembled my servants together, and the prisoner among them, I stated the circumstance that I had been robbed for some time past, and that it must be some of them that had got it; they all denied it, the prisoner among the rest; the officer searched two of the young men, I looked over the money that they had got in their pockets, and while he was searching the other porter the prisoner said you need not proceed any further, it is me who has robbed my master, and fell upon his knees and begged for mercy; he produced a part of it, the officer searched his pockets and found the remainder.</p>
               <p>- BOLLAND. I produce the money; I have had it ever since; there is nine shillings and a dollar, making in the whole fourteen shillings; the rest of the money is here.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I turned round to the prisoner and expressed my surprise that he had robbed me; he said he had done it by taking out the small shutter from under the flap of the counter, that is what we call a trap door; I tried the trap door the night before, I could not open it; he said he had done it that morning and the morning before; he said the other porter was down stairs cleaning his shoes when he did it.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, I live at No. 30, Barbican. On the 7th of August, about a quarter before two, the prisoner came and offered to pledge a remnant of carpet for half a guinea, he stated that it was worth seven or eight shillings a yard; I asked him what he gave for it, and not seeing it cut like a workman, I then asked him again how he came by it; he said Lord, Lord, what do you ask me that question for. I sent my young man to shut the side door, an officer passing at the same time I called him in; in the mean time I went to the door, he jumped over the counter, from the box, of my side. When the officer came into the shop he told him he worked with a Mr. Cross in Aldersgate-street, an upholsterer; I sent for Mr. Cross; he came; he said it was none of his, nor did he know the man. The carpet I gave into the hands of Leadbetter.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday the 7th of August, a little before two o'clock, I was passing along Barbican, the pawnbroker came to the door and called me in, he said there was a man there had a piece of carpet, he believed he had not come honestly by it. I asked him how he came by it he said he bought it of a man in the street, he gave either five or nine shillings for it, I am not sure which I took him to the compter in company with Mr. Richardson, we enquired at the different brokers in broker-row we came to Mr. Mullett; he said he had sent his porter out with different patterns of carpet, he had not returned; I told him we had put him in the Compter; he went with me to the Compter, and said he was his porter; we found the other carpets with a barrowwoman in Featherstone-street.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>

On the 9th of September I sent the prisoner out with a load in a truck to East Smithfield; on account of suspicion I followed him at some distance, and from information that he deposited things at the Marquis of Granby public house in the city, kept by one Crouch, I went into a house, up one pair of stairs, that overlooked the public house, I waited five or six minutes and at last I saw the prisoner at the bar come into the yard rather hastily, and go to a kind of a stone bench, he unbuttoned his breeches and took out several things that he threw under the bench, I could not see what it was; I desired a man to watch his motions, and went to my truck. This man came up hastily to the truck with a woman and went to the different wharfs; I saw him carefully and diligently deliver every parcel, many of them were of considerable value. I followed him and saw him come out of of the Marquis of Granby. I went home and desired him to be sent to me when he came home, and when the prisoner came I desired the officer to take him in charge; he denied robbing me; I said give me the key of the cupboard that you have at the Marquis of Granby, upon which he produced the key; I said is the sponge that you have taken to day in that cupboard; he said yes, and a few more things, he hoped I would have mercy on him, and said that he wished a pistol was put to his head that minute, or that he might be sent on board a man war; I told him I could do neither, I wished to bring the person to punishment that was guilty, if there was any person that he knew that was more guilty than he, I will do every thing in his favour; he said he he knew of nobody, and made no confession, upon which the officer took him to the watchhouse. He willingly gave up the key of his trunk. We proceeded to the Marquis of Granby, and the cupboard there stated to belong to Dunn, the officer opened it, we found several articles which I believed to be mine.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>

On Saturday the 9th of September I was sent for, Mr. Oppenheim gave me charge of the prisoner, I searched him, I took a bit of sponge out of his smallclothes, he said it was his master's; he took out two keys, one of his lodgings, the other he said belonged to the Marquis of Granby, he said he had some property there belonging to his master; he said he had sold four pounds six ounces of sponge to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180909200013"/>some person he would not mention.

The prisoner was in my employ; on the 15th of August, from information, I got up early before the men came to work; my wife locked me up in the shop, I concealed myself. The key of the shop was given as usual to the boy to open the shop, the bell rung, the boy let the prisoner in, he engaged my boy's attention with talking about Bonaparte, shortly afterwards a woman came in for some snuff, he still continued his discourse, the woman said if you do not serve me I shall go, I shall not wait while you are talking your nonsense, he immediately took two handfulls of tobacco from the cask and put it in his pocket; took a white handkerchief out of his pocket wiped his mouth and put it on the top of the tobacco in his left hand pocket, took off his coat and hung it in the passage: shortly after my wife came down and let me out of this place that I was concealed in, I went and procured an officer; presently the prisoner put on his coat and went to breakfast, I permitted him to go 12 or 13 yards from the door I ran after him and collared him he dragged me back from my own shop. In the middle of the shop there was a cover-head of Shag-tobacco cut the day before, put there for the purpose of cooling, he went into the back warehouse, pulled off his hat and out fell about a pound and a half of unfinished tobacco that he had cut that morning; the constable searched him and found very near 8 ounces of shag tobacco in his left hand coat pocket; the prisoner said he never sold any, he took it merely to give to his friends. I asked him what he did with that in his hat, he replied he did not take that.</p>
               <p>MR. WALFORD. You were occasionally in the habit of giving this man tobacco? - A. No, I told him that if he asked me for some I would give him some, I had been robbed; he was never to take any.</p>

I found the prisoner and her husband there, I asked them if they had got any bank notes whatever in their apartment, the husband said he had got a one pound note which he had taken for his labour, he produced it. Mr. Swift looked at that note, and said that was not the note which he had lost, I then saw the woman was flurried, I searched her as far as decency would let me, she put her hand under her stays and sat down on a box by the side of the bed, Mrs. Swift was called in, on the bed was this hussiff containing this one pound note, Mr. Swift said it was his.</p>

I am a shoemaker, my wife deals in clothes, on the 2d of September, the prisoner brought the articles into my shop, she said she wanted to sell them; my wife examined them she said, I believe you have taken these things off some person's line; she would have nothing to do with them, they were rough dry, she went out of the shop and went about eighty or ninety yards from my shop stood in a confused state, my wife thought it a pity that we had not stopped her, I went out and passed her, she did not observe me, she then came back to my door, I tapped her on the shoulder and asked her what she wanted for the articles to induce her to go into the shop, she said 5 s. 6 d. she gave fourteen or fifteen pence for them, she lived at 4, Catherine Wheel Alley and she bought them of two women in the street, Jews. I told her being Saturday there were no Jews about, I stopped her, she offered to give me the things to let her go, then I questioned her again how she came by them, she said she had them of a woman in the Curtain Road, I said I dare say the poor creature that sold them to you is wanting them again. I got her out of my shop under pretence of looking for the woman, she did not know where she was. I live in Long Alley, I decoyed her into the office.</p>

A good many bundles of linen, there was one bundle belonged to Mrs. Cook. The prisoner came to our house on Friday afternoon and asked for a bundle of linen, I told her I did not know which bundle she wanted, she said she would shew me the bundle, she put her hand on the mangle upon the biggest bundle that was there, I told her I did not know how much they were, let me count it over; she said that she paid my mother last night when she brought them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a mother living - A. Yes, she was in the country then, I told her that my mother was not at home then, she said she paid the woman in a blue gown, that was my aunt, she was down in the cellar, I called my aunt, she did not come-up, the prisoner said I need not call my aunt up she paid her last night, she took the things away.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see this prisoner again - A. About a fortnight after in Wild Street at a public house where she came to receive her money her husband had left her. I knew her again directly, a young man was with me that lodges in our house, I pointed her out to him, I said to the prisoner did not you come to our house last Friday week for a bundle of linen, she said where do you live; I said in Swan Yard, she replied she did not know where Swan Yard was, then she said she would stop there while I went to fetch my father, and as soon as I got to the bottom of Wild Street she said she would show this young man where she lived she took this young man to Bembridge-Street where there were a pack of town girls.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the morning as I went out to work, I heard of his missing his small clothes and his watch. I went out to work, when I came home at night two officers were in the little parlour, the man that lost his watch, and two or three more were sitting in the tap-room he said, Thomas we have had two men searched, we should like you to be searched, I said I had no objection; Stanton took off my hat, and put my things by, that I could not get at them, he found two duplicates and a one pound note in my pocket, he said you must come along with me, I said I had no mind of going as I had nothing to do with it my hands were tied. I was cock found the piece of paper in my hat, the landlord and the men were there. The pawnbroker thinks fit to swear to me, I know nothing of the watch. I sent to the prosecutor he came to me in my imprisonment. I offered him four guineas for the watch although I was innocent of it, he said the officers would not let him do any thing of the kind.</p>

I pushed her away, she begged my pardon, and said she did not mean to put it into my pocket, she meant to put it into my breeches; I found my watch was safe, I said, go along, are you not ashamed, if you want any thing go to a proper place; I had then got my watch and money, she then drew me by main force from the Strand down Beaufort buildings.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. Yes, as I am at this minute.</p>
               <p>Q. How far down the buildings did she draw you. - A. About fifteen yards, I then pushed her away, and found I missed the watch, I took her to the watchhouse there she was searched, I could not find the watch upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body passed you - A. Yes, two men one went between her and the houses, and one behind me, there was none nigh me but her by three feet, the moment that man passed I said, watchman, this woman has robbed me, that man run away, he was a soldier, the other man was in the middle of the street, the soldier was nighest.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long were you with her from first to last. - A. Put it all together, I do not suppose it was five minutes; neither of the men was near enough to take the watch, they passed me twice, once in the Strand, and once in Beaufort buildings, when I missed the watch, the soldier ran away; I told the watchmen the soldier must be the man that had got the watch, he said, hold her hands.</p>

            . On the ninth of this month I in company with the officers went to search the prisoner's house, he was at home. We found two blankets in his bed-room on the bed, and one on the box, they being government blankets I was certain he could not have bought them, we found a saddle-girth in his drawer, which I have no doubt was taken from the house, in the cellar we found a table cover under a garden light, the table cover we had used for domestic purposes, we also found 2 pieces of green baize these are the blankets, I know them to be mine, they are decayed government stores, they are manufactured on purpose for Chelsea College, the family has had the contract for forty years and no one has had them ever since. We never sell blankets in that state, we always boil them before they are sold, this is a saddle girth, we could not miss them because we never take stock. I know the table-cover, it was made on purpose for a table, it is worth sixpence, and the piece of baize, we had baize of that description. I was in the cellar when the officer found it, the prisoner gave us the key of the cellar when we asked him for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else live in the house besides the prisoner. - A. Yes, several other persons.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. None of this property you can swear to in any other mode than it is like the property which you had. - A. Yes there is no doubt about the property.</p>
               <p>Q. As the green baize was in your domestic use, you had servants in the house had not you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether any of them might have taken it away you do not know. - A. I suppose they would not, it might be so.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of something passing in your mind, did you watch the prisoner on the 12th of August, did you observe him going away from his employ that morning - A. Yes, I followed him about an hundred yards, when I came up to him, I said Mr. Cooper you must come back, when he came back I asked him what he had in his parcel, he said a pair of pantaloons, I took the parcel in my hand, and found it was very heavy. I desired him to untie it, he did so, and the pantaloons appeared; I opened the pantaloons, and it contained two or three parcels of these types, they were tied up in paper, the writing on the paper described what type they were, the writing was my overseer's.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say to you - A. Oh God! Mr. Harding it is all over with me, and added that it had been a very unlucky week to him.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the value of these types - A. They are worth fifteen pence a pound as old metal, the value of the whole found upon him was between</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you call them papers of types -</p>
               <p>A. Because after printing they are separated in sixteen parts of a sheet, and tied up in paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the trade any particular name for them when they are tied up - A. I believe not except in the manner which has been used.</p>
               <p>Q. Would any body know by a paper of types what they mean - A. Yes, as I have stated as many letters as compose a page.</p>
               <p>Q. That in the trade would be called a paper of types - A. I do not know that there is any specific term for it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the jury, I commit myself to your mercy, and trust that as it is the first felonious offence that I have been charged with, I shall not solicit in vain, particularly on account of my family and relations who are of respectability. I might have had several citizens to my character, who could have spoken to my honesty, but I have preferred the danger of not having the best of witnesses, rather than plunge the best of parents into the greatest wretchedness; to the best of my knowledge there are but two or three persons except my wife in possession of my reputed crime, and the lenity I may obtain in consequence thereof shall not be ill-bestowed. I will by my future conduct make atonement for the lenity shewn me, and the distress that will fall on all belonging to me, by my appearance at this bar.</p>

On the evening of the 19th, about 8, our foreman gave me information of twelve brushes, and two pots of blacking being under the cellar stairs. About nine o'clock, when the workmen were going out, I desired every man to go up stairs in the parlour; Codey was the first man, he went up two pair of stairs, instead of going into the parlour; he was called down, he then went into the parlour, all the men were there together, I observed I knew one of them to be dishonest, no honest man could have any objection to be searched. I searched Codey, and found a bottle of blacking in his pocket, I then desired him to go into the kitchen on the same floor. A constable came afterwards and produced four or five brushes, he said they had been thrown out of the window.</p>

I am porter to Mr. Matthews; on Tuesday evening, about a quarter before nine, master desired us all to step up stairs into the parlour, the prisoner went before me, instead of going into the parlour, he proceeded up two pair of stairs, I followed him half way up; I told him that I supposed we had come by the room that we were to go into; the prisoner said nothing to that. I returned down again, my master asked the prisoner what he went up there for, the prisoner made him no reply; we all went into the parlour, master searched the prisoner, he took out of his pocket a bottle of blacking; he then asked the prisoner where the brushes were, the prisoner denied any knowledge of the brushes, and said that he had not taken any; the prisoner then was ordered into the kitchen, and me and my fellow servant was likewise, we were to take care of him. When the prisoner had seated himself, he began to be very busy under his apron, observing to me and my fellow servant at the same time, that his life laid in our hands, he drew from his small clothes six or seven brushes, and put them under the sink, he also put two brushes over the cupboard; he sat himself down, in two or three minutes he rose up, took all the brushes, and threw them out of the window into a court at the back of my master's premises.</p>

            . I am a constable, I searched the prisoner at the Marquis of Granby, I asked him for the key of the closet, he seemed to make some hesitation, I told him it was of no use, I must have it, he put his hand in his pocket and gave me the key, I then put the key into the lock of one of the closets of the Marquis of Granby, the landlord pointed it out to be the prisoner's locker, I had broke open the door before, I found that key fitted the lock, I found in that cupboard all the things mentioned in the indictment.</p>

               <p>Q. By what means did the prisoner obtain the closet of you - A. By using the house and having his meals there, he had the key of it, it was intirely under his controul, nobody but himself had access to it. I had no opportunity of knowing what he brought there, I saw the constable break open the cupboard, and examine the contents of it, he took out sponge and several articles.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the prisoner every day at your house - A. Yes, at his meals.</p>
               <p>MR. GLAND. You are the gentleman that we saw last night, how many closets have you in this house - A. Two that they had by themselves, the key belonged to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you taken up for this - A. I was taken before the Lord Mayor, I was in custody for it.</p>

I did not see him drop it, I saw it on the ground, Mr. Crofton picked it up.</p>

On the 9th of August, about ten minutes after seven, I was taking the shutters down, no one in the shop besides myself, the prisoner asked to see some ribbons, I went round the counter, and put the drawer of ribbons before her, upon the counter, in the mean time another woman came in, and wished to see some silk handkerchiefs, I did not take down the handkerchiefs to show her, I attended upon the prisoner Brown, she asked me several times to shew her the handkerchiefs, because, she said, she should be too late for market, I took down the handkerchief-drawer to show her some handkerchiefs. In the mean time, I observed the prisoner take out several pieces of ribbon out of the drawer, she put them into a large pocket which she had under her apron, I desired the other woman to ring the bell, two or three times, she did not, then the prisoner asked the price of a ribbon' I told her sevenpence, she told me to cut her on a yard of that, I cut off a yard, and wound it round my hand, to put it up for her, and went for to ring the bell, when she perceived that I was coming round the counter, Brown laid down the sevenpence without taking the yard of ribbon that was cut off for her, and went out of the shop, when I perceived the prisoner go out of the shop, I asked the other person to stop in the shop while I went after her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she do so - A. No. While I went after the prisoner, this woman went out of the shop, I did not see the other woman go out, I went after the prisoner, the prisoner had got three doors from the shop, I told the prisoner to walk back, as she had got property that did not belong to her, she asked me what, I told her ribbon, she denied having any, and refused to come back, I took hold of her coat, and puller her back, she called me a d - nd little b - r, I got her in the shop, she put the ribbon in the drawer again, nobody had come down stairs, she took out a great many pieces from her pocket, and put them in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say when she returned - A. She sat down, and said any body might search her.</p>
               <p>MR. HICKES. I am a servant of Mr. Kerrison, the prisoner was in the shop when I came down, as I came down stairs, my fellow servant stood opposite to me, he said Mr. Hickes this woman has been stealing all these ribbons upon the top of the drawer, she took them away, and when I brought her in, she returned them into the drawer, the prisoner said any body might search her.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I only came out of the door to look after the person that carried the basket for me, I laid the sevenpence on the counter, I had nothing to do with the ribbon at all.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer. On the 24th of July, as I was going in at the gate these two men were coming out of the gate of Mr. Buckler's premises, Casey had got Lane's jacket under his arm, I asked him what he had got, he said he did not know; I asked him to turn it out of the jacket, he did, it was lead. The two prisoners were both coming out together; there was a knife belonging to Casey with it. I discharged them both from the ground, and locked the door. I examined upon the top of the building, the lead did not fit, the middle piece had been taken away. The lead was fresh cut, and the lead found upon Casey was fresh cut. The lead was cut away from the house belonging to Mr. Buckler.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I never saw him before the 2d of September, he came into the house with wine and spirits. I saw him come into the house with wine and spirits in hampers from White and Proctor's.</p>
               <p>Q. How many - A. I think 5, I am certain 4. I was called up to dinner about 4 o'clock, and when I had nearly finished my dinner, I heard the warehouse door open, I came down and saw the prisoner in the warehouse with the hampers close to the door, I saw the pieces of cloth in one of the hampers. I examined the hamper, I found the end of a piece of cloth 20 yards and a half marked with our private mark in my own hand writing. I searched further, and looking into another hamper, I found a second piece of cloth, and in another hamper, a bottle of brandy; there was our private mark in my own hand writing on the second piece of cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of these two pieces of cloth - A. Forty pounds in the whole, I looked at the bottle of brandy. I saw the seal of White and Proctor on the cork.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Q. What share have you in the business - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you there when the prisoner came a second time - A. I was.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you recollect whether the goods that first came in were in hampers or flat baskets - A. What I call hampers perhaps you may call flat baskets, two of the hampers that I found the cloth in had partitions.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he leave a hamper or more while you went down in the cellar with him - A. I assisted him down with the first baskets, I was in ill health, I called in a porter from next door.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had come down in your cellar did not he leave the hampers in your warehouse - A. I was in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. The whole of the time in his absence - A. I do not know that I was in any other place, I cannot swear that I was there the whole time.</p>

               <p>Mr. Bolland. Whether they were hampers or flat baskets, were there two pieces of cloth when he brought them A. No.</p>

We stood there a considerable time waiting for it, there came one of the watermen that watered the horses, and pushed me in right between two men. One of the men took my watch out of my pocket, his name is Simpson; he ran a little way down Holborn, and I after him; I got hold of him by the coat-tail. Gee followed after me and struck me on the knee with a stick, and then he struck me on the side of the hand, which caused me to fall; then Simpson delivered the watch into Gee's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him - A. Yes, Simpson returned back again up Holborn, then he was taken in custody by the watchman.

            . I am a watchman in Holborn. On the 23d of July, about one in the morning, I heard a cry of watch and thieves; I saw Simpson run as if to go up Holborn, and then he made a turn as if to go down Holborn. I jumped off the pavement, and seized him; the prosecutor came and declared he was the man that snatched the watch out of his pocket. I took him to the watchhouse.</p>

            . I am a tallow chandler and oilman, King's head court, Holborn-hill. On the night of this robbery, I was going up Holborn-hill, seeing a good many people at the corner of Bartlett's buildings, I had the curiosity to stop to see what was the matter, I heard a man call out he had lost his watch, he pointed to a man that was just walking off the curb into the middle of the street, he said that man has got his watch, he gave some foul language, and said how could he think so, he called out watch, the watchman laid hold of him; I believe, I am not certain, he knocked the watchman down on the curb-stone, and made his escape down. hill, as fast as he could; the man that lost his watch he pursued him, and through running I do not know which way he fell down likewise, I think he fell because he never came up to him, therefore he made a great oration.</p>
               <p>Q. What when he was down - A. Yes, he said he was robbed, he made an oration while he lay on the ground; he sung out in that kind of way as if he was dead, he complained that he was bruised, and he had hurt himself, I saw the man go past the church and the watchhouse, I returned back again, he laid hold of another man, he said that was the man that had taken his watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the first man that run past the watch-house, made his escape - A. He did, I am perfectly satisfied he had a short jacket, I think he had an apron on likewise, I am not certain of that, he laid hold of another man just at the same place where he had challenged this man facing of the public-house, they dragged him to the watch-house; out of curiosity I stepped into the watch-house, and heard the examination, the man said he had been robbed of his watch, and that was the man that had taken it. I made an observation to the officer of the night, that he had challenged another man with taking the watch. I believe I did say why did not he lay hold of me.</p>
               <p>Q. I wonder he did not do so - A. He was cut about the mouth, and very much intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Q. They did not lay hold of you - A. They did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I wonder they did not. Did you know these men before - A. No I knew none of the party, the officer of the night knew me, he made it known to the party.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be out at that time of the night - I am often out late of a Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, how much of what you said is true - A. I did not expect what I had got to say was to be doubted, I came forward out of humanity, his sister came to me last Monday or Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Do you remember seeing Bisset there - A. No, I never lost sight of Simpson before he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the watchman knocked down - A. Yes, there was an old watchman knocked down in the kennel I think by Gee; I had just got hold of Simpson by the tail, and the watchman fell down behind him. Gee ran down Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to say that man Bissett was not one of them - A. I cannot say whether he was or not, there was about half a dozen of them at first round the place.</p>
               <p>Q. to Boram. Do you know Bissett - A. I have some slight knowledge of him, he came to the watch-house, he made an observation that the prosecutor accused another man that passed the watchhouse. I was not satisfied; I committed Simpson. The prisoner abused me when I took him up to the alderman; he said I knew Bissett; I said I knew where he lived, and through that information they found him out.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Bissett - A. He serves some of the butchers in Fleet Market with candles.</p>
               <p>Q. to Greenfield. When you heard the cry of stop thief first, was there another man running<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180909200029"/>ran down Holborn and pushed down a watchman at the corner of Bartlett's buildings.</p>
               <p>Simpson to prosecutor. Who gave charge of me - A. The young man that is here.</p>
               <p>MR. HUGHES. I was in company with the prosecutor on the night this happened; we had been up Holborn, we were coming home, we stopped at the corner of Bartlett's buildings, Dearlove wanted to get something to drink, they would not serve him, the door was shut; some person pushed him away; my wife was with me, we walked towards Thavies inn; I heard Dearlove call out; I gave charge of Simpson when I saw him running.</p>
               <p>Simpson said nothing in his defence.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a person, he sold the sugar to me in the street; he was a sailor.</p>

On Tuesday the 12th of September, about five in the afternoon, hearing that there was a man in my sister's room I immediately run down stairs to see if my sister was in the kitchen, I asked her if there was any man in her room; she said no; I replied there is, come along; I immediately run up stairs; I met the man near to my sister's room door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it that man, the prisoner - A. Yes; he had this bag with him; I asked him what he had got there; he said it was his own property, that he had been up to the top of the house, to a shoemaker there; wishing to be satisfied I sprang a few stairs and threw open my sister's room door, to be convinced; my sister said in the mean time, he is run away; he dropped the bag in the presence of my sister, on the outside of the street door against the rails in the street; I pursued him and never lost sight of him till I apprehended him. I brought him to the watchhouse, he was searched by the watchhouse keeper, a watch and two spoons were found on him; the bag was taken back to my house, I have kept it ever since in the same state it is now; it contains seven sheets; it is the prisoner's bag, and a sleeves belonging to some body else; the sheets were property entrusted to my sister to wash</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the door to see how the door was broken open - A. When we searched the prisoner at the watchhouse he had picklock keys and an iron crow; one of the drawers in my sisters room appeared to have been broken open by an iron crow.</p>

On the 11th of August, between four and five o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner coming out of my counting house window, I called to him, upon which he ran away, I pursued him and took him; we afterwards brought him back into the yard, we searched him and found two five shilling papers of halfpence, and some loose ones; he said they were his own.</p>

            . I am clerk to the prosecutor. On the morning of the 11th of of August I was sent for by the prosecutor; when I came to the yard I found the prisoner in custody; the halfpence that were found on the prisoner I had them the evening before in my possession; I found the two locks in the desk broken open, and the halfpence gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Thursday evening I went up to the Adam and Eve public house, Tottenham-court-road, I changed a one pound note, they gave me ten shillings in halfpence. I was locked out, I went and slept in a cart; in the morning I was going down Cheney Mews, two men came and stopped me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to bed to her - A. I did; I wound my watch up in her presence and put it in my small clothes pocket; we went to bed; she would not take her clothes off; in the course of a few minutes she said she was very dry, she went down to get some gin and beer; when she went out for the gin she said take care of your smallclothes; she put them on the bed and I put them under my head, under the sacking; in the morning when I awoke the watch and the prisoner was gone. I have seen the watch since.</p>

               <p>Humphries. When I got round the bed I told her I should pull her out if she did not get out quick; I asked her where her pockets were; she said she had none; I said I should find them. She took the pockets out, I took the watch out with my left hand; I said, slow that then; she said he gave her the watch last night to take care of; I asked him, he said not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you apprehend the prisoner - A. Yes, on Tuesday the 5th of September at Paddington near the White Lion public-house, I told him that I was an officer of Bow-street. I was come to apprehend him on suspicion of stealing two five pound notes, he said he did not know any thing about it, I then asked him where he got the five pound note that he had given to his sister to get changed at the public-house, he said that he had never gave her a five pound note. I asked him two or three times at the place where I apprehended him, and then I took him to the White Lion, and then he was asked by Mr. Sparke the last witness, he denied it then. The sister was then brought into the room, she was asked where she got the five pound note that she changed at the public house, she said that she had it of her brother in his presence, he said then that he did give it to her, but he did not know where he got it: there were many questions put to him where he got it, he positively denied knowing where. I took him down to the office, and then went with Mr. Sparke to search his father's house, we searched the father's house and found nothing. The next morning I went with Mr. Sparke to a Brewhouse, there we traced the other five pound note, it was taken from Mr. Lloyd at the White Lion. When I went back I asked the prisoner if he had his breakfast, he said he had, I told him that the other five pound note was was traced to Lloyd, he began to cry and said he was sorry he had told me a story when I apprehended him, he did give the five pound note to his sister and the other five pound note he gave to Mrs. Lloyd. I asked him what he had done with the letter that he had taken out the note, he said he had tore the letter, I then asked him what he had done with the money, the ten pound; he said he had lost a great deal of money when he was first employed in the post-office by not knowing the marks of the letters, he had made use of that money for the purpose of what he had borrowed to make up the deficiency that he was behind; he cried very much. I asked him if he would like to see his father, he said No, he was ashamed to see him.</p>

In bringing her down the alley, I got a blow upon the back part of my head by an Irishman; he used very rough language to me because I would not let her go.

               <p>Mr. Knapp. The stock was not shut when he gave him the money - A. No.</p>

             came into the shop, she opened the private door and let in Archer, I saw them come into the shop together. Archer produced a cloth and laid it on the counter, Fisher went to the flour bin and took out a shovel full of flour, that is about 6 lb. she put it into the table-cloth, then she went to the shop-window and took out the rolls and biscuits, the woman took them in her hand, she wrapped the flour up in the cloth and gave it to Archer, and she went out, Fisher went as far as the door with her, and shut the door after her. I took, hold of the prisoner and told her what she had been doing, she began to cry, and said it was her aunt that had led her into it, I left Fisher in the shop and went after Archer.</p>
               <p>Q. What age is Fisher - A. Seventeen. I went after the aunt and laid hold of her before she had gone three doors from the house. I found the flour, biscuits, and rolls with her.</p>

I fetched the 5 l. note, I laid it down on the bar he took out his pocketbook to give me a 10 l. note, he took up my 5 l. note, he did not give me the 10 l. note.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you object - A. I had not time to object to his going. I told my husband he was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure he did not give you a 10 l. note - A. I never saw it.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180909200042"/>Q. Can you say with certainty that he never took it out of his pocket-book - A. I never saw him take it out.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not pursue him or give any alarm - A. Not till I told my husband, that was almost directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he pursued - A. He was pursued in about three hours or sooner than that.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband was at home at the time - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he went out did he say he would return - A. No, before that he had ordered a dinner for himself and two friends, my husband went down stairs and cut a loin of lamb into chops.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this - A. Between twelve and one, he said he would be ready for his dinner between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him again that day - A. No he did not come to dinner, I did not see him till I saw him at Hatton Garden office on the Thursday following, I believe.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. How long had this man used your public house - A. A week or a fortnight, I cannot say. We went into the house on the 11th, and this was on the 22d, he did not sleep at our house, he only had some meals.</p>

               <p>Q. You say he asked you to give him change for a 10 l. note - A. He told me he would settle the bill.</p>

               <p>Q. You were to give 5 l. and that would make up the amount of ten pound, at that very moment he took the note he said there was a gentleman, did you see whether there was a gentleman - A. There was a gentleman, I did not see him go to him. I did not expect that I had a moment to wait for the change.</p>
               <p>Q. Then after he spoke to the gentleman he went away directly - A. I do not know that he spoke to him, he went away.</p>

He came to me on the Monday, I asked him for the 3 l. that my wife had lent him to pay his men, and the twelve shillings, he damned me and told me to go down stairs. On Tuesday morning he came again, I asked him for the money he told me he would pay my wife, he told me to go down stairs and cook him a dinner for himself and two friends, he ordered the dinner in half an hour. I went down stairs and as soon as I cut the chops I put them on the fire. I asked my wife whether Smith had paid her, she said no.</p>

               <p>Q. You must not tell what your wife said - A. I found him that same day about 3 o'clock. I took him in the open street in Leather Lane. He told me he lodged at Mr. Lock's, a butcher in Fulwood's rents.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether that was true - A. - Yes, he had lodged there, but he had no box or trunk there, he had desired me to fetch them. When I caught him in Leather Lane he tried to get away from me. I told him he was my prisoner, I should not loose him till I went before a magistrate, he told me to be quiet and hold my tongue he would settle it. I took him into Mr. Neptune's public-house by force, he pretended to take out his pocket book to give me the 10 l. note; he had only five one pound notes which I supposed he had taken for the change of the five pound note that he had taken off my bar, he was taken to Hatton-garden office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. He produced the pocket-book, and in the pocket-book were five one pound notes - A. Yes, he offered them to me for the debt that he owed me, it is in the possession of the officer. I took them five one pound notes by the consent of the gentlemen present for the satisfaction of the debt.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the day stated in the indictment, I was sent for to take the prisoner in custody, he was then in the parlour at Mr. Neptune's public house. Mr. Pritchett desired me to take him in custody, the prisoner said he would settle it with him, the landlord and he had some words, he put down the five one pound notes, and the landlord took them and went out to get a stamp receipt to give him. I searched him, I could not find any other money about him than the five one pound notes, the landlord then insisted upon me taking him in custody. I took him to the office, and in conveying him to the house that we use called the Royal Oak, he said he would give me and my brother officer a guinea, if we could do it away for him, this is the pocket book that I took away from him, four of the notes were given to me, the other he said he had sent out to get a stamp receipt.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, and called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 25th of August, I received information of the prosecutor that he was robbed of his watch, he took me to the house and shewed me the girl, she said she knew nothing of the watch. I searched the room and her, I found nothing. I went out into the street, a girl called to me and told me that the woman had got the watch. I took the girl up stairs, I said is this the woman that you say has the man's watch, she said yes, then she confessed that she had the watch, she told me if I would go to Mr. Mordant's I should get it. I went to Mr. Mordant's he keeps houses there, he told me to keep in the parlour, however, I followed him into the room, he took something out of the desk gave it to the prisoner, she said I have got it. I went back to the prosecutor where I had left him, she took down an old chair and turned the key out of the chair, she said here is the key.</p>

I told them I had no objection, I let them into the room, the woman came and said my man has no money he has given me the watch, she gave me the watch. I was to keep it till 9 o'clock the next morning, he did not come till past 2 o'clock, he wanted his watch and not to pay me for the room. I would not give him the watch without he paid me for the trouble, he went for a constable, when I saw the constable I gave him the watch, he discharged me and gave me some liquor, he went away and likewise the constable. I saw no more of them till 6 o'clock at night, then they came and took me away, I have been in custody ever since.</p>

               <p>Q. After they are delivered to you they are put in books - A. Yes, but these not having the stamps, were not put in books, they were returned to the office.</p>

               <p>Q. Before you read that, which was taken down by you, what the prisoner said, was any promise or threat made use of - A. No. He said that he made use of a part, and was robbed of the other part, that is all that he said to the charge that was made by Mr. Bowra. He said he paid him 103 l. 8 s. 6 d. for stamps at the stamp office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Are you sure he did not say, it is very true, I was robbed of a part, and for the recovery of it I spent the other part, that would make all the difference - A. If he had said so, I should have taken it down.</p>

When he came in, he stood at the front of the mantle piece, with one hand on the mantlepiece; I asked him civilly how he did, he came and shook hands with me, and sat down on the opposite side of the table, the servant of the house came and asked him what he had ordered, and whether he wanted any thing; he said, bring me a pint of beer, during the time that she went to fetch the beer he put his hand into his pocket, and took out a knife; when she brought the beer, he tendered this knife until he paid the money the next day; she immediately refused the knife, and took the beer back to the bar, her master told her she did very right, he sat two or three minutes, then he went to the bar, and got the pint of beer on credit, he brought the beer, and asked me to drink, I told him I did not wish to drink, but he forced me to drink out of the pint of porter; he forced me to drink the second time. Then three young men came into the house, they came to the box that we were sitting in, and asked him to sit higher up the seat, he moved higher up the seat, came round, and sit at my right hand. One of these young men, I had a slight knowledge of, and I was in conversation with them; these three young men had a pot of beer, they asked me to drink two or three times, for which reason I passed the pot, after I drank to these people that gave it me, then the prisoner at the bar got held of my right hand, and squeezed it very much, as I thought in friendship, I turned my head, and desired him not to squeeze my hand so, that it was not agreeable. The pot passed again after that; after he squeezed my hand, and while I was leaning across the table conversing with these young men, the prisoner took out a knife, and passed it upon my throat, and said, b - r your eyes, I will kill you.</p>
               <p>Q. You were leaning across the table - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He put the knife to your throat while you were leaning across the table - A. Yes, I immediately started up, and put my hand to my throat, and ran out of the box for fear of the second attempt, he had cut me, but I ran out of the box for fear he should attempt it the second time. I went to the bar, and said to the landlord, that old villain has cut my throat, and I do not know for what, I was immediately taken to the watch-house, by two men, bleeding very fast; from the watch-house I was conveyed to the hospital by two patrols, as an accident, and there I remained three weeks and two days in the house, and last Thursday week, I was made an outpatient.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you given him any offence - A. No more than what you see now.</p>

             for fear he should drop, and I looked at the wound; I took him to the watchhouse; and There were two patrols who took him to the hospital. Then I waited at the watchhouse while they brought the prisoner in at the watchhouse; he said, if he had a bayonet he would skewer us all.</p>
               <p>- I am the constable of the night, I found the man laying on the floor, he had two stitches put in his throat at the hospital, he bled profusely, this is the knife that it was done with. The prisoner did not attempt to deny the fact.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I will tell the matter as nigh as I do recollect, first of all, I wish to address your Lordship and the jury and the hearers; I was in a state of intoxication at the time this matter happened; I had 9 knifes in this pocket and 4 in this; I had known that young man only 10 or 12 days before this happened by sleeping in a room with him. On the day this happened I sold 2 knifes to some women in Smithfield; I went down Chick Lane to find a lodging for a man and a woman I did get them a lodging. I went into the public house; I do remember seeing that young fellow; I called for a pint of beer to put the time over for the horse fair. I dropped to sleep and got into a doze; to the best of my recollection this young man sat on the side of me and that young woman on the opposite side of the box, they sung some scamping songs. I wore a surtout coat over my body coat, I missed my knives, I said, young fellow give me the knives, he called me an old b - r, there were some people on the other side of the box, who I believe were his companions, they slipped into the other box; however, I had a knock of my nose, they took all the knives away from that pocket, and some from this; I am an old man, excessive lame, and very weak; I was seven weeks in the hospital, for the rheumatism, I was obliged to drink laudanum and rhubarb, and upon my word, eleven shillings and a halfpenny was the last money I had after I had pledged all my clothes, and if I did wound the man, it was in my own defence. I was an entire stranger in the place; I was an helpless old man among a parcel of people who had robbed me, and whom I considered as dangerous, afterwards I was taken to prison, they were obliged to wash me in the yard, and dress me in these clothes, I have had nothing but the prison allowance, bread and water, for five weeks.</p>

On the 2nd of August, or thereabouts, I was at my desk, writing; I saw some person reaching into the shop, and taking some books, he took four books into his right hand, I expected him to put them down again, but he walked off, I came down from my desk, I saw him between a kind of a half run and a walk, I called stop thief, and ran after him; when he got into the Old Change, he threw the books out of his hand into a building, where some carpenters were at work near the corner of the Old Change; he continued to run forward, and I pursued him, a gentleman from some warehouse stopped him, I never lost sight of him until I had hold of him myself; I brought him into my shop, and when I came into my shop, I believe the street keeper was there, I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I reside in Paul's chain, I was going home at the time this circumstance happened, there was an alarm of stop thief, I like other people ran; Mr. Simmons came up, when some people stopped me, and supposed I was the thief, no person came forward and said I was the thief, no property was found upon me, now I leave it. I have a wife and five children at home, my wife is very far pregnant; I am very sorry that Mr. Simmons should come here to bring a charge against a man, when no property was found upon me, and nobody saw me.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon after were they taken - A. In about 20 minutes I was present when they were laid hold of, each of the prisoners had a joint of the Clarinet with them, I directly said that was my instrument, I told the officer to do his duty, they made answer they had found it, first they said in the street, and next behind the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Walker's person as well as Bird - A. Yes he lived opposite, I never found my violin or my cloaths nor my sister her money I am sure the Clarinet and case is mine.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know him before - A. Only the night before I had the key of my brother's stable, I went back to the stable with him, the mare was safe then, then he told me there was a gentleman in Brick lane wanted to see her. I went with him, and the gentleman did not want to buy, he only wanted her for four days, the prisoner was driving the mare in a chaise at the time, as the gentleman wanted to see her in harness, I told the gentleman my brother would not let the mare, and told Rogers to take her out of harness, and bring her home to the stable; when I went back, I stopped some minutes, the prisoner did not come with the mare.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave him in possession of the mare - A. I did not think but that the man was honest enough to bring back the mare to the stable himself. I waited ten minutes in the stable, I went into Whitechapel, I saw the prisoner with the mare, I said Rogers you bring back the mare directly, he replied, I will, I am only going to speak to a gentleman.</p>

               <p>Q. Is your wife here - A. No, I did not think she was of any use here. I took my wife away from her and turned my wife towards the front door to go home they laid on the floor, both one by the side of the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you quite sober - A. Yes and my wife too, I believe the prisoner had drank a little, when the prisoner was eating her bread and cheese, she had the knife with her then, I saw her put it in her pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took your wife away, I suppose you pushed the woman away - A. No, I left her on the ground, my wife and she had been changing a blow or two. When I took my wife away, she came up to me, drew the knife, and put it into my back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her open the knife - A. No, my back was towards her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it make you ill at all - A. Yes, I have not done a stroke of work since, I kept my bed about three weeks. In a day or two afterwards she called upon me to see how I did, she asked me to drink, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her give you the wound - A. No, I know she did it, there were no one besides me, and her, and my wife. When she had hold of my wife's hair, I laid hold of her hand and took it away.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a great deal of trouble to get it away had not you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you hurt her at the time - A. I do not know, I did not stand for that at the time.</p>

               <p>Q. No, your thoughts were to get your wife away - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. This was quite a sudden quarrel between your wife and her - A. Yes, I had no ill-will to her. It arose in the heat of the moment at that time. I did not imagine that she had any ill-will to me; I have drank with her several times afterwards.</p>

             came to my shop with a wound on the lower part of the back upon the hip, the wound was better than two inches in length, and about half an inch deep.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be done with some cutting instrument - A. It was such a wound as a knife would occasion. I dressed the wound; he used to come in two or three days to have dressings to dress it himself; I did not consider it a dangerous wound, I did not advise him to keep his bed. He could not work; it would not allow of him stooping; he could not sit down well, he must either stand or lie.</p>

             came in with his gig about three o'clock in the afternoon, he brought the coat to the stable, and left it with the gig in the coachhouse. I believe the coat was stolen about three o'clock in the afternoon. It was not missed till Friday morning about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner Rafferty - A. I never saw him to my knowledge, I did not see the coat till Saturday, and then I saw it in the box belonging to Rafferty in his own lodgings, Rafferty was present, he had the key in his pocket, I had information first from Stevens, I suspected Stevens, I could not find him, he left me on the day I hired him. Stevens hearing that he was suspected came to me to clear up the point threatening to punish me for accusing him. I got him into the stable, and locked him in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him it would be better for him to tell - A. Yes, I detained him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see ever Rafferty on the premises that day - A. No, the coat found in Rafferty's box was the same coat that belonged to Colonel Rutherford, I watched Rafferty into a stable in Cheney Mews on Saturday morning, I followed him in, locked the door, and put the key in my pocket, I said good morning to him, he said good morning, I had the advantage of him, I told him no, he had the advantage of me, I wanted the coat that he pawned in St. Martin's lane, and fetched it out again that he received of

             on the Wednesday afternoon, then he changed countenance, said he had a knowledge of the coat, he received it from Stevens, he told him that he brought it from on board a ship, I asked him if it looked like a sea-faring coat, and how he came to have half of the thirty shillings, the money it was pawned for, I took this coat out of Rafferty's box in his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Stevens's Defence. He said upon the honor of a man, if I would say what I had done with the coat, he would forgive me.</p>

               <p>Rafferty's Defence. When he told me the coat was lost, he said I will do you no harm, only deliver me up the coat, I did not know that the coat was stolen, I took it out the evening before, to return it to the man, I told him what a distressed state I was in, my wife died, and left me with three young children.</p>

             a twelvemonth. On the 2nd of last February I was discharged from the 1st regiment of guards; from that time I was employed at Drury-lane till the house was burnt down; I was in distress, Mrs. Peters lent me a pillow case to pledge. When I had the duplicate of this bed I went to this Jew, I asked him to lend me seven shillings on the ticket; he said let me look at it, and call again in a quarter of an hour; I went; he then put nine shillings in my hand, and said we will say I bought it, and when you come for it again it is all the same, you must buy it again. He was to have a loan for the money; this was on the Tuesday; I called on the Friday, he was out; I went on the Saturday, after his sabbath was over, to give him the money, before the time was over; then he told me it was sold; I said I shall have you before a magistrate, I being poor I could not do it; I was taken up by my landlady on Sunday morning; she said now we will come to an agreement concerning these things, you must pay part of the rent this week, likewise take out the things I lent you to pledge. I was then put in prison; after that they had me out of prison, they brought me into the marines to pay the seven pounds; I was with them two days; I was taken to the doctor, he found I had a fault in my lungs, as such they could not take me into the band again, so they put me back to prison.</p>

            . Q. Did Mrs. Newman bring you from the ship at Greenhithe - A. A man of the house did; her man brought me up to her house from the ship. I went with Thompson to get some money from the company, and then we went back to Mrs. Newman; as soon as we came into the house she asked me where the note was.</p>
               <p>Q. You had left it at the public house, had you promised her your note - A. No; she gave me a black eye and a bloody nose; she took four pound, half a guinea, and six shillings, from out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she take it for - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you owe her any thing - A. Yes, for the former day. She took me in the room on the ground floor, next the street, and locked the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You owed her some money, did not you - A. Yes, for these trowsers.</p>
               <p>Q. And you owed he some money upon an absent bond - A. Yes; she had the bond for it, and I owed her for this handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you owe her for all - A. I cannot tell you. I staid nine days in her house afterwards, I was so bad I was obliged to have a doctor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. With respect to the five pound that she had of you - did not she pay over that five pound to the man that had advanced five pound upon your note - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was for the purpose of entitling her to the possession of your absent note - A. Yes. She paid the five pound before she was taken to the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Her man did accompany you up to town, and paid your expences up to town - A. Yes. I had these blue trowsers of her, and different sums of money.</p>
               <p>Q. And there was an old debt that she claimed of six pounds ten shillings; when you left the country you left in her debt - A. Yes; but not so much as that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This man swears that I brought him from the ship, it is no such thing, my husband brought him to the house; he owed me some outward bound money; when I asked him for the money I got part of it, then when he came to the house he got clothes; he went to Mr. Phipps and got clothes and money, and signed a power of attorney or bill of sale; they came home and told one of the men, as I understand; I asked them what they meaned to do, if

             meaned to cheat me, as he had done before; he said he was led into it by some people; he gave me four one pound notes. I asked Thompson if he had done the same; he said yes, if I would go and pay the advance, what they had got, they were willing I should have the note; they were sorry for what they had done; he gave me three one pound notes, and said, do not let us be angry; he drank a deal of liquor, dined among twenty two boarders in the house, and staid till Monday; he got clothes and money of me. On the Monday they said mother, get ready, we are going to take the notes; they went to the house of Phipps and co. to take the money. Thompson came home to my house and dined on the Monday evening, I staid in the city till he returned; he then fell in an officers hands. I knew nothing of this till the Thursday this Omas came home to my house, had wine. and a doctor, and every thing he had need of. I know nothing of the transaction of the robbery.</p>

I said where are you going; he said he would go to the Two Brewers, I sent him there. Then he went away and I missed my watch, I ran down directly to the public house, he was not there, but from information I went again to the public house, and there he sat; I told him if he would come to my house I would give him some more short pipes, if I had ever given him any.

On the 16th of August the prisoner and her sister came into the shop, she asked to look at some printed cotton for a gown, my young man shewed her two or three pieces, he is not here. I saw she was rather troublesome in serving, I told him to go to his dinner, I would wait upon her myself. She came a little after twelve and staid almost till two; I shewed her near forty pieces. The sister was in the shop all the time, sometimes close by her and sometimes walking about the shop; at last the prisoner fixed upon a piece of printed cotton cotton, six yards were cut off for her; the sister left one shilling and five pence in halfpence upon it; I was to keep the goods till she paid the rest; the goods came to nine shillings and sixpence. When her sister held out the money her hands trembled very much, which gave me suspicion; they both went out together, and when the prisoner had gone about five yards from my door I took hold of her and brought her into the shop, the sister ran away; I asked her what she had of mine, she said nothing; I removed her apron and saw the property; about twenty-five yards of gingham.</p>

               <p>Q. So then they dragged you, a poor helpless creature, such a young man as you, ten yards up Dyot-street - why do not you, when you tell the story, tell the truth - did not you go with them - A. I went along with Butler up stairs into a little room; this was about twelve o'clock; we went up stairs together, there were two beds in the room, and Butler and Ellis were in the room, Sullivan was in a room close by; I had my watch in my pocket, and my money; I asked Sullivan if I could be safe.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay with the women - A. I had not been there ten minutes before I missed my watch and my money; when I missed my money I alarmed the watch; I accused Butler with having my money she said she had not got it, nor the watch. Ellis was gone out; I gave charge of Butler to the patrol, he searched her, he found Ellis at a cook's shop just by. Butler stopped with me; he brought Ellis to me and searched her; we found some money, but not the watch or note; there was a shilling found which I had given me in change at the King's Head; it was a remarkable shilling.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he drunk or sober - A. He had been drinking; he seemed collected. He told me he had been robbed; he had lost his watch and two pound in money; he took me to a house in Phoenix-yard, it is a shocking place; I went up stairs with him into a room where there were two beds; he pointed out the bed which he had been sitting upon; I turned down the clothes, I picked up a one pound note, I gave it him; I found

               <p>Butler's Defence. Between eleven and twelve o'clock, I met this man by the Maidenhead public house, he asked me to have a glass of liquor, I said if he liked; he treated me. He said it was very late, could I get him a bed; I told him I could not get him a decent bed, he said he did not care what bed it was, he was tired, he said he would give me two shillings to sleep with me, he would give me more money in the morning, I said I could not sleep with him for that. I came down stairs.</p>

               <p>Sullivan was not put on her defence.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever attend her before the 11th of September - A. Yes; I attended her about four months ago; she came to me and complained of the dropsy. On the 10th of September, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I taxed her with being pregnant, she said she was not, she never knew a man from a woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you form a judgment whether the child was born alive - A Alive, I should suppose, from the appearance - from the loss of blood, the navel string not being tied.</p>

               <p>Q. Then your judgment is, it died of neglect from not tying the navil string, not from strangling - A. Being rolled up in linen might still tend to increase the death of the child. The child was rolled up at the time I saw it; whether it was rolled up in linen at the time it was alive that I cannot say, except that blood was found in the linen, which I suppose came from the navil string.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the whole your judgment is that it died on account of the navil string not being tied - A. Yes.</p>

She told me Dr. Wallis attended her for the dropsy, and a water doctor in town. She denied to me being with child two or three times, she said it was the dropsy, with wind on her stomach. I was there on Friday before she was delivered, and on Saturday when she was in strong labour.

At Red Lion-street he took the stockings out of my hand, put his hand on my shoulder, said you stop there, I will bring the money directly. He went in the Red Lion public house and shut the door after him; I stopped out half a minute, I then advanced into Mr. Kemps passage, he was about four or five yards off, he instantly called for pen and ink; he brought me a little note wafered up, he said there my dear, give that to your mistress, there is a two pound note; I said they came to two pound seven shillings and sixpence; he said then, I mean there is a three pound note in there; I said very well, and out I came. I went into the next door, the hair dressers, I said see if I am right, and shewed the paper; he said it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180909200060"/>was not worth a farthing, it was nothing but a lottery bill; I told him to come with me, if not I should lose all my master's property.

Mr. Kemp, the landlord, heard the disturbance, and came to know what was the matter, I told him; then I told the prisoner if he wished to save himself any further trouble, if he chose to pay for the stockings well and good; he said he had not sufficient money for that purpose; he was going to pay for seven pair and return two; I told him that he had better now pay for the seven pair and return the two to the girl; he then said he had not the money; I then asked how he could say he was going to pay Mrs. West and had not sufficient money to pay for them.</p>

            . I keep the Red Lion public house in Whitechapel. The prisoner came in my house about five o'clock and ordered a pint of ale; Mr. West's maid servant came in and asked if a man was there; he was in the kitchen; he came out immediately to her; he asked for pen and ink, he wrote, or pretended to write, and then sealed the lottery bill in a piece of paper, gave it to the servant, said it was a two pound note, and then afterwards it was a three pound note, and that he would call upon the mistress for change. In a few minutes after I heard the maid servant and the last witness in the tap room talking to the prisoner, I was in the bar; thinking that he was going to swindle the young woman I came out of the bar and sent for an officer; I ordered the front door to be shut by reason of the mob; he tried to make his escape from me at the side door; he could not. I took him into the back parlour soon after Mr. West came, he identified the stockings; Mr. Griffiths the officer came and searched him, he found a dozen duplicates on him which proved to be property that he had taken this way. This is the paper that he put in his pocket.</p>

            . I searched the prisoner in the parlour, these witnesses were all with me; in his pocket were three or four shillings, I gave it him, it was all the money he had about him. I found twelve duplicates which led to other property; these stockings were produced to me there in the parlour.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I called at Mrs. West's this day three weeks on purpose to buy some stockings for my wife and myself; I requested Mrs. West to send them to Mrs. Kemp's and I would pay for them; Mrs. West sent the servant, I took the stockings from her into Mr. Kemp's house, I told the servant there was one pair that Mrs. West charged six shillings and sixpence I should not have; I should take a few of them and call and pay for the same and return that one pair; a little time after the servant came in the room with one of the witnesses; he called Mr. Kemp to aid and assist him; they dragged me into the back room and sent for an officer, he searched me and took away duplicates of my own private property. I did not intend to defraud or rob them out of the money, my whole and sole intention was to return to Mrs. West and pay her for the stockings I had purchased of her.</p>

            . I am a watchman to the London dock company. On the 3rd of September last, in the morning, between the hours of six and seven, I went over the casks of brandy, I could not see through the casks of brandy, the heads were so close; I got upon the casks of brandy, and I saw the prisoner's head of one side; he arose from under the boodge of the cask and ran away. I saw the man distinctly and knew him well; the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go from that part of the cask where you saw him rise from - A. I did; I saw two bladders, one had a quill in it, it was in the cask; I dispatched a person to give our officer notice of it; one of the officers came, I shewed him where he had been, and gave him the bladders with the brandy in them; one was partly full and the other was filling from the cask.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 15th of September, about twelve days afterwards, do you remember seeing the prisoner - A. The watchman on that station cried out for help, I ran with two watchmen to assist him, when I came within a little distance of him, I said that is the man that robbed my station of the brandy, I am positive that the man I saw apprehended on the 15th of September, was the same man that was taking the brandy on the 3d. I gave the bladders to Watkins.</p>
               <p>WATKINS. I am constable of the London docks. I received these two bladders from the last witness, they contained brandy, about 3 gallons in the two bladders.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see them do any thing - A. No, I was in the back room at the time, and my wife desired me to come in the shop, as my daughter had missed a piece of ribbon; I went into the shop, I saw the prisoners there; my daughter informed me in their presence, that she had missed some ribbon; she thought the prisoners must have got it. I ordered them to produce it; they both declared they had no ribbon at all, I told them then, that we would search them, we took them into a back room for that purpose, and searched them; the prisoner Brown took off her beaver hat which she had on, and laid it down on a seat, I examined her hat, and in the inside of the hat I found this ribbon.</p>
               <p>Q. What is its worth - A. Twelve shillings, the prisoner then said, it must have rolled into the hat, that is all she said.</p>

The prisoner Brown asked to look at some bonnets, I shewed; her several, they said they would not suit, she then said if she left a crown at any future time whether we would make her one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all that passed on the ribbon - A. Yes, I left the two pieces of ribbon on the counter and shut the drawer that we keep the ribbons in. They were then proceeding to leave the shop, saying they would call again about the bonnets. The ribbons would not do, I then missed one of the pieces of ribbon and enquired of them after it, they both said they saw me put it in the drawer, I was certain that I had not put it in the drawer, but immediately looked, having not a piece of the same colour in the house. I looked and could not find it. I said I was certain that one of them must have it. Then my mother called my father into the shop, and I served some other customer.</p>

            . Q. Are you a Surgeon - A. Yes, On Tuesday evening about ten o'clock, when I arrived at the Skinner's Arms public house, Skinner's fields, I found the deceased on the steps supported by men, I requested him to be brought into an inner room, finding his pulse to be quicker than I wished it should, I drew blood about a pint, he was in liquor and that is the reason I bled him, when I had bled him I found his pulse amended from that motion. I requested him to be taken to Somer's town in an arm chair his head to be kept uppermost, he died I understand that evening. On Thursday, I opened the head a vessel had burst itself on the brain.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form a judgment what had occasioned the breaking of that vessel - A. Violence of any kind, his own exertion, intoxication, vomiting or falls, it might have proceeded from any thing that made the vessel to be in extortion. I consider the cause of his death being occasioned by the pressure of extravasated blood on the brain, and that was occasioned by some violence, what violence I cannot say.</p>

On Monday morning when I came to town he was not in the way, he was gone to Gloucester-place to wait upon a customer. I did not see him any more till Townshend the officer took him, then I saw him.</p>

            , On Thursday evening I was going along the Strand, I was about ten yards past Essex Street, I heard the cry of stop thief, I ran across the road, and catched hold of the prisoner, at the New Church in the Strand, the gentleman came up and said give me my snuff-box, the prisoner said he had not got it, if you will give me liberty to go over the rails of the church-yard I will look for it, they would not let him go over, they took him to Bow Street office, in the mean time we were having our hearing before the magistrate, two boys came in and produced the box.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking down the Strand and crossing, some people ran past me, and the cry of stop thief was called out, I made out of the road, and stood against the church yard, I heard something fall; the gentleman came up, and collared me, he said, you rascal, you have got my box, I said, I heard something fall in the church on the stones, perhaps it was thrown over.</p>

I did from outside of the door, it is my brother's property and mine, I did not see it taken; in consequence of information I went after the prisoner, I found her in Houghton-Street, about a hundred and fifty yards from my house with the carpet under arm, I then told her that she and I would take a walk to Bow-street with it. I took her to my own home and sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say how she came by it - A. I told her it was my property, she said another woman gave it her. This is the piece of oil-cloth, I believe it is mine, I cannot positively swear to it having no mark on it, I had seen it about a quarter of an hour before, it is worth fifteen shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner that did it - A. Yes, it was rolled up as it is now, she unrolled some of it and then she rolled it up again, she took it before her until she got into Clare market, I told Mr. Warlters of it, he brought her back with the oil-cloth.</p>

The woman that gave me the oil-cloth was head and shoulders taller than me, I was not in Clare-street that day, the woman that gave it me I knew some time ago, she said you take this, she was going to New Inn, I was going up Houghton-street, when the gentleman stopped me, instead of looking after the woman, he took me to his shop.

               <p>Q. Had he any thing with him - A. Nothing then, I am sure it was him. About 12 o'clock I saw him coming from Church Hill where Butcher lives, I was at a distance when I saw him first, whether, he had any thing I cannot rightly tell. I saw him lay down behind the furse-bushes on the horse-course, he laid there about five minutes, he got up again and came towards Hampstead. I followed him down Hampstead into Shepherd's field at a distance. I never lost sight of him above a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you overtake him - A. I did not; he got over the stile out of one field and into another. I run down to the stile when he got over he got half way down the field, he stopped and looked back, he had no chickens with him at that time; Mrs. Hartley met him she said she saw him put down a bag, we afterwards found the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you follow the prisoner after he laid down among the furse bushes and get up again - A. Yes, he did not see me as I know of.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner there when the bag was taken up - A. No, he was gone down the field he was taken in custody that night and taken to Hampstead watchhouse, he was afterwards taken to Hatton Garden office.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the chickens - A. Mr. Adams kept the chickens, they were produced at Hatton Garden.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that the man you saw in Shepherd's field is the man that you saw squatting down in the horse course behind the furze bushes - A. Yes, because I had him in custody before, I knew his person well.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see whether he had any thing about him or not - A. No, I afterwards found this green bag by the information of Mrs. Hartley in a corner of the field where he had passed, it contained three chickens I also found in the green bag this little bag with some wheat in it.</p>
               <p>Q. That bag does not belong to Butcher - A. No, I kept these chickens till they were produced at Hatton Garden.

After all the change was counted on the counter, I asked the prisoner to count it, he did, after he had counted it, I shewed him a paper that I had entered it on, the prisoner said it was all right, I put the money and the paper in a handkerchief, he went out with it to carry it to the pawnbroker, after he returned I asked him if it was all right, he said yes, only four shillings that were bad. In half an hour after that, Mr. Walker's young man came to know what change I had sent, I told him ten pounds one shilling and sixpence, he said Mr. Walker had not received so much, when the prisoner came in, I told him Mr. Walker's young man had been, and he said the change was not all right, I told him he must go to Mr. Walker's, he said he would go in the morning. In the morning he told me had been, in a few minutes Mr. Walker's young man came in, and asked about the prisoner, I found he had not been, I told him then he must go with me to Mr. Walker; he did, and there I found he had only given 7 l. 11 s. 6 d.</p>

I took the prisoner up stairs, I told him I was afraid he had robbed me, he said he had not, the officer might search him; the officer searched him, he found 13 shillings in silver and a seven shilling piece, three of the shillings were marked with the letter Y, he said he hoped we would forgive him, it was the first time.</p>

               <p>Q. Had the prisoner been employed with you at any time - A. Yes, about four years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. You took stock on the 25th - A. Yes, some time after a customer, Mrs. Goodall sent for a certain size of black beads which we were positive we had, upon our looking for these beads and not finding them, and Mr. Bristow knowing that there were such a stock in our shop, he ordered the stock to be retaken, that was about three weeks after the 25th of July, upon our retaking the stock we missed 348 dozen of French beads and a paper of white ostrich feathers, containing from 20 to 30, and a quantity of straw plat, some garnet and a variety of other things to the amount of two hundred pounds. We sent hand bills round to the different pawnbrokers and we had bills stuck about the street with the reward of 50 guineas, Mr. Hackleman came to my solicitor, and my solicitor came with him to my house, and there I saw the beads, I went to Mr. Hackleman's house in the beginning of August and saw these beads there I saw 60 dozen of beads; they were part of the articles that we missed, these are some that I have still in my possession, and the article that I found at Mr. Hackleman's exactly correspond with these.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any thing in these beads that you saw at Mr. Hackleman's that you can swear that they are yours. The jury cannot be positive if you are not - A. They were in short rows and we had them all threadled in long rows after we took stock, I have no doubt they are my beads.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. How many of them that were found at Mr. Hackleman's that you would swear to - A. I would swear to 40 dozen; they were pledged at Mr. Hackleman's in the name of

            . In consequence of finding these at Mr. Hackleman's, I immediately went to the office to obtain a warrant to have Bell taken up, I went to Kensington, we apprehended the prisoner, we searched his lodgings but found nothing, this was about the ninth or tenth of August, we brought him to the watchhouse in a coach, on his road with us in the coach, with one of my warehousemen and the officer, he made an observation which was to know if I should like to have my feathers back again, I answered I should certainly be happy to have back my property, he told me that he had destroyed them, I told him if he was not the thief I would do every thing to clear his character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. And that you would not hurt an hair of his head if he told you - A. I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you promised him any thing before you got him in the coach - A. I conceive I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Before he said any thing you made that promise in his own apartment - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After this you must not tell us any thing he said - A. I had Paddington Canal searched. I discovered no feathers whatever. Mr. Barlow of Berwick-street, had purchased some feathers, I there saw six, they are here, I cannot swear to the feathers, some of my warehousemen know the feathers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did you assist in taking stock in June in that part respecting the beads - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted there are many dealers in beads besides yourself - A. Certainly there are, I do not think that any house imports half the quantity I do.</p>

               <p>Q. You have no knowledge of any person having access to your drawers - A. If they could get possession of the key of the warehouse they could have access to the drawers. The prisoner knew where the key was.</p>
               <p>Q. That is four years ago - A. They are in the same place now.</p>

            . Q. You are in partnership with Mr. Hughes - A. I am, I selected the whole of these feathers from the stock of Mr. Barlow, I recollected that we had a feather exactly as this is, I should think myself justified in taking my oath that this is our feather. I have not the least doubt of it, I believe I have seen it half a dozen times since we have taken stock, Mr. Barlow never bought the feather of us.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you have seen it three or four times since you have taken stock - A. It is most likely I have.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you swear that you had ever seen it after you took stock - A. I cannot, it is very likely, I rather think I did not count the feathers when we took stock.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hackleman. Q. Do you know the prisoner - A Yes, on the 4th of August I took in these beads, of the prisoner, they were in the paper that is here, there is No. 2 written on the brown paper, that is all that is written upon it.</p>


               <p>Q. At the time that he brought them to you, did any conversation take place between you and the prisoner - A. He wanted more money than I liked to lend him upon them, I did not wish to take them in, they were things that I did not understand, he said that he had a bill to take up which would be due in a few days.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him how he came by them - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Hughes. How many rows of beads are there that you will take upon you to swear to - A. About twenty dozen, ten dozen in each of them rows, they are stringed as those I had, we had them threadled upon these long threads, all our sky-blues.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Bristow. Look at that No. 2, upon that paper, do you know that - A. Yes, it is my own handwriting.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know when you put that - A. It might have been done two months before we took stock, it is my hand-writing, and it was made for a feather paper. I made one, two, and three, afterwards it was entirely spoiled and dirty from being used, consequently it was put aside as waste paper. It was in our possession on the 25th of June, our goods require nicety, we never send goods out in paper like that, we burn them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever searched to see whether the other two parts of the paper were in your possession - A. No I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. to Parkhurst. Look at these beads, whose property are they - A. I have no doubt but they are Mr. Hughes's property.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you say to the blues - A. There is a dozen that I can speak more positive to than the others. I was looking for a bit of paper that I had let fall behind the counter, I took a stick and raked out a dozen of beads, I said there is a dozen of beads, we could have sold them five hundred times over, we had no beads of that size. I have no doubt of them beads whatever.</p>

He had slept there three nights before within a fortnight, it was discovered that he had robbed all the three beds that he had slept in in the nights before; in order to detect him, and to bring him to justice, I ordered that he might have a bed, and when he was gone to bed I directed that an officer might be fetched from Bow-street, saying that I had a thief in the house.

               <p>MR. PALMER. I followed the man immediately, I did not like to stop him immediately on account of injuring his character, I followed him till he came to White-lion street, I saw the top of the bolts, I called him to me, he said he would rather go home to his breakfast, I took hold of the bolts, he said he knew what was the matter, he had been a thief to me some time. These are the bolts, they are my master's property.</p>

On the third of August, Mrs. White applied to me to take up a trunk and different luggage and to carry them in a cart to her house. I received the trunk and luggage from Mrs. White at the Docks into my cart on that day.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the trunk and luggage belonged to Mr. Robinson - A. He lives with Mrs. White at Poplar, I called at her house and delivered the luggage with another man, he said he believed that was all that belonged to Mrs. White. I drove to another place and unloaded my cart, I found I had a trunk left I did not know who it belonged to, I left the trunk in my cart and went to the docks to enquire. I left the cart in the care of a boy. The prisoner helped me load the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner is an Irishman, did you know him - A. No, he asked me to let him help me load the cart. The prisoner came up to my cart and required of me the payment that Mrs. White had promised him, I took him to the public house and treated him with the share of two pots of beer and bread and cheese, as a reward for his having assisted me. I then came back to my cart, and said, by some means or other I have made a mistake, I have a trunk, I do not know who it belongs to, I got up into the cart threw some hay over the trunk, and then I fell asleep, the trunk was on the side of me and when I awoke I missed the trunk; I received some information, the prisoner came up to me in the course of half an hour, I walked with him up to Mr. Randell, I asked him if that was the person that he saw with the trunk on his shoulder, Randell said yes, the prisoner denied it, I then told the prisoner if he did not tell me where the trunk was or produce it, I would give him in charge of an officer, I sent for an officer he went with the officer and brought back the same trunk that I had in the cart.</p>
               <p>- DAVIS. I am constable, I took charge of the prisoner for stealing a trunk out of Furnish's cart, he denied it, in consequence of my putting him in the watchhouse at last he confessed it, and went with me to a house in the neighbourhood, he went up stairs and fetched the trunk.</p>

            . I am a salesman, High-street, Bloomsbury. On the 15th of August, about nine in the morning, the prisoner came to my shop and offered this piece of lace for sale, he asked half a guinea for it, and then he produced the other pieces and asked a guinea for the three, I asked him whose property it was, he told me it was his own, he lived in Sidneys-alley, I told him I did not think he came honestly by it, I must take him in custody, I sent for a constable and gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, and called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>MR. RIVETT. I am a musician belonging to the guards. On the evening of the 19th of September, the boy came running up to me and asked me to stop the prisoner he had taken his hat out of the house, I asked the prisoner why he did not give the boy his hat, he would not; he said he was going to Portman-street, as he was going along I asked him twice to open the handkerchief to satisfy the boy and me, when he came a little further he said he only took it out of a joke, he told us to go in the public house and order a pot of beer, I said no, then you will walk off. I took him into the public house the watch-house keeper was sent for, when he came in he said, oh, Mr. Johnson you will not leave off your old tricks; he told me he was the greatest rogue that lay under the sun.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I came by there were a parcel of boys playing. I kicked the hat with my foot, I picked it up, the boy walked after and said master give me my hat.

On the 8th of August I saw the prisoner standing by Mr. Blowers door and another woman, I watched her a quarter of an hour, the woman that was with her held some handkerchiefs that was hanging out side of the door so as to hide the pile of goods, and the prisoner held up her cloak so as to hide her from the people of the other side, I saw her take the piece of printed cotton from off the pile at the step of the door, I went across the road and took her into Mr. Blower. The other woman ran away.</p>

On the 9th of August I had occasion to go up stairs, I left the shop in the care of Mrs. Leadbetter; when I came down she informed me there were some girls loitering about, she did not like the look of them.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that they were all four near your shop - A. Yes; there were five, but these four prisoners were four out of the five.

             was nearest the window; I lifted up my finger and said my girl, if you do not go away I will have you taken up; upon which I looked round to a frame of beads in the front of the shop, I perceived that several were taken away; they were hung in a glass frame, enclosed in wood; I had put them up there within an hour. I pursued the prisoners, I overtook them at the distance of about fifty or sixty yards; they were walking along as it in company together.</p>
               <p>Q. How could any person outside of the shop come at these beads - A. They were in a frame hanging upon brass wire; they were locked on the brass rod.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the row of beads appear to have been broken - A. No; the beads were unlocked in their snaps; there were two rows which had not snaps attached to them, they were tied on with blue galloon, they were gone also. Four rows were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell what passed when you overtook them - A. I seized hold of Clancy and Powell and said where are these beads that you have stolen, upon which they said the other girls have got your necklace, pointing to these that ran off; I then left them and pursued Hyams down Little Furnstile, into the passage of Mrs. Skeppington, a chandler's shop; I seized hold of her arm, I said where are the beads you have been stealing, she said she had not stole any thing; Mrs. Skeppington said whatever she has stolen from you she has dropped by her side; on my looking down I found a row of beads by her side, they are necklace beads; I knew them to be mine, they are the beads that I had in my shop, they are worth sixteen pence. I found nothing more upon her; I gave her into the charge of

From her information we went after the others in Newtoner's-lane, they were standing by the side of a passage; upon the prisoner Clancy we found this bracelet, this was the same that we lost from our shop. We took them to the watchhouse; the prisoner Clancy said if you will forgive me, and go along with me, I will find you more. We went to her mother's house in a court in Newtoners-lane and found two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180909200079"/>other rows, they are my property also.</p>

               <p>MRS. SKEPPINGTON. Q. Did you see this girl come into the passage of your shop - A. Yes; Mr. Powell asked her what she had got, she said nothing; I heard something fall, I told him whatever she had I believed she had dropped. The beads were found in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hodge's. Do you live in this neighbourhood - A. I live in Holborn; I had seen Welling about for half an hour, I saw them altogether, I cautioned them.</p>
               <p>Hyams and Clancy said nothing in their defence.</p>
               <p>Powell's Defence. I am quite innocent of it; I met the girls coming down Holborn, I was going of an errand for my mother.</p>

               <p>Q. What reason have you to charge the prisoner with stealing twenty five pound of iron - A. I lost a deal of property.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of information that you had from your boy did you go to this place and see these pieces of iron where they ought not to be - A. I did. On last Friday week the prisoner and his partner were out in Holborn fixing some bars; he and his partner were came home in the evening, I was sitting up stairs in my room, my boy informed me that he had taken away the iron under his coat; I pursued him as far as Saffron hill, I could not catch him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your iron - A. No. I went to Hatton Garden office and got an officer; when the officer arrived at his lodgings the prisoner had just got home; I charged him with stealing a bar of iron, he denied it; I told the officer to take him in custody. I have never found the bar again. When I looked under the stairs at my own house the large bar was gone and the small one left.</p>

On the 17th of September, about half past eight in the morning, the prisoner came into the shop under pretence to dispose of a bit of silver, I was called down to her, the girl left her in the shop when she came up to call me; I bought the silver of the prisoner. About twenty minutes after I found that there were three silver watch chains missing out of the window, I suspected that the prisoner had taken them; I applied to an officer and went with him to the Highway, we found the prisoner; I took her with one of the chains in her hand, she was shewing it to another woman. I never found the other two.</p>
               <p>Q. How could she get at the chains - A. By sliding the glass case any person might get at it. The chain is worth three shillings.</p>
               <p>- TODD. Q. Were you with Mr. Marshall when the prisoner was laid hold of - A. I was. When I laid hold of her she had this watch chain in her hand. I have had it ever since.</p>

I took her up stairs and shewed her the damage I had received from the fire in Bear-yard; she said she was perfectly satisfied I was innocent of it. I came down stairs and left her with my wife in the passage; she went up with my wife after that.</p>

            . Q. Did you see this woman when she came to your house on the 21st of September - A. Yes. After she had the conversation with my husband she asked me to go up stairs with her to shew her my bed room, which I did; she begged me to leave the room a minute; I left her alone for a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any silver table spoons in the room where you left her alone - A. Yes; silver table spoons and silver salt spoons; she took all the property from that room.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she remain in that room - A. Not more than a minute. I went into the room to her, I found her shutting the drawer, which made me suspect her; I came down stairs with her; I did not tell her what I suspected; I desired her to walk into the parlour where my niece was. I went up stairs as quick as I could to look for my spoons; I perceived the spoons were gone from that room; I came down and informed my husband; she was searched by the constable; my niece will tell you of that. I never saw her before.</p>

I was in the parlour when my aunt shewed the prisoner up stairs; when she came down stairs I heard the spoons rattle, she laid them down by the side of her, or in the chair; I called my aunt she did not come into the room immediately. I saw the salt spoons in her hand, she was trying to pull her glove over them; my aunt came in, and then I charged her with taking these things, then I went for a constable, after the constable came I found the umbrella under her clothes.</p>

             - A. Yes; he was a helper in my dyehouse; the first time he worked for me was about ten years ago; then he lived with me three years; then he left me, he went to Manchester and was drawn for a soldier; I think he returned to us about a twelvemonth ago, then he was to serve with us three years. On Wednesday the 30th of August I sent for the prisoner, hearing that he had enticed Hutchinson to go to America; he came; I charged him with the act of seducing Hutchinson to go to America with him; I told him our contract was for a term of years not expired, and that he was an artificer in the cotton line, I believed it to be an illegal act, and that if he continued in doing it I would prosecute him; he told me that he had agreed to pay his passage, and was to pay it that day, but from my information of his being an artificer, and also being my contract servant, he would not do it. On the 1st of September I went before the magistrate, Hewitt told the justice that he had paid the passage that day, and produced the mates receipt for the money, and also a note from Hutchinson to him for the passage, and money advanced to him. The receipt and note read.</p>

            . I am a journeyman dyer, I work for Messrs. Hughes and Lewis. I was at the Yorkminster public house about seven or eight days before Hewitt and Hutchinson was taken up. Hewitt and Hutchinson were there; I heard Hutchinson say that if Hewitt would pay his passage to America he would go, he was tired of his situation; I am a journeyman, Hewitt is a <rs id="t18090920-187-viclabel1096" type="occupation">labourer</rs>; I asked Hewitt what motive he had in it; he said he was only taking him in a friendly way; Hewitt said he would pay if he would trust to his honour in paying him back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the conversation originate with Hewitt - A. I believe Hutchinson began it to get Hewitt's consent to pay the passage. About two days after that I heard Hutchinson say he would stick to Hewitt as long as he had a button to his coat. I thought Hutchinson was imposing upon the old man; I am positive that he was no workman; I told the old man it was of no use to take such a man; I knew he was no tradesman in our line; I told the old man so because he might not be robbed of his property.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I have only to tell you that you are full as bad as that man is, and ought to be indicted; you wished he would take an able manufacturer out of the country - A. No; I did not make use of any such word.</p>

On the Wednesday morning I sent for Hewitt, and in the evening of the same day I had some conversation with Hutchinson, I told him it was very improper of him breaking his engagement with us by going to America; I told him I would stop him or punish him, I do not know which; he then said he would come to work the next morning, I believe; he did not come; I applied to a magistrate and he was brought before him.</p>

            . I am a stationer and rag merchant. On the evening of the 31st of August Hewitt and the defendant came into my warehouse and asked me to count up how many dollars for twenty-seven guineas; I did it for the purpose of paying the passage to America; he meaned to pay for this man's passage and his own; thirteen pound for Hutchinson, and fourteen pound for his own.</p>
               <p>Q. You are witness to that note - A. Yes; I told Hutchinson that Mr. Hughes was very unwilling for him to go, he would not let him; he said he shook hands with his master; he consented to his going, and wished him well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go on board with this man - A. No.</p>
               <p>Defendant. At the first of this you went with us - Did not you go down with me to the captain and leave a one pound note for the earnest - A. When Hewitt paid the money I went down to the docks, curiosity led me to walk about the docks; I did not go down with you.</p>
               <p>Q. The captain asked Hewitt if he was a mind to go, he said yes: you asked the captain about me - A. That is not true.</p>
               <p>Q. The captain said I take none but farmers, I did not twig the captain; you said yes, farmers; Hewit said he was a farmer, and I was going to help him - I was going to say I was a cotton manufacturer - A. I did go on board with the defendant, I cannot say the captain's name; I heard say the ship was going to New York.</p>
