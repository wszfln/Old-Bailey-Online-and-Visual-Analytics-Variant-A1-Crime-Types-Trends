I persued, and took him with the great coat upon him, and he delivered it to me (the coat produced in court, and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I had been greatly distressed by sickness, and from time to time I carried these things out; but not finding myself able to get them again, I wrote my master a letter; that if he would advance me twelve guineas to get them out I'd ask for no more money til l I had made it clear. I leave it to the mercy of the court.</p>

The prisoner came there last Monday was a week, and called for a pint of beer; he sat down, and ask'd me what it was o'clock. I pull'd out my watch, and said it was a quarter too slow; he took it up, and said so it was, and put it in his pocket. In a few minutes time I turn'd about, and said I believe you have made a mistake in putting my watch in your pocket and then he offer'd me some reasons for his so doing.</p>
               <p>Q. What reasons did he assign?</p>
               <p>Murphy. He had been at our house, and wanted to buy a spotted dog of mine, asking me a guinea to boot betwixt this watch and my dog. He came again in a day or two after, when we agreed for half a guinea to boot, which I gave him, and he took away the dog and left the watch, the same which he put into his pocket; at that time he said he was advised to take the watch away.</p>

She took me to an empty house, where I sat down, and had a fit. Her candle went out, and she went out to get it lighted; but not returning, I began to search my pockets, and missed my watch, a gold ring, nine guineas, twelve shillings, and my silver buckles out of my shoes. I went and call'd out, I had been rob'd. The people came about, and I described the prisoner so well that they took me to the house where she lodged; but she was not to be found. I got a warrant and constable the next day, and search'd the house, and was told she and another woman were gone by water. We took water and went to Lombard-Street, and found them in a silversmith's shop selling a gold ring; but that was not mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get any of your things again ?</p>
               <p>Duncan. No, I did not. She had some silver about her, but none of my things. She told me yesterday in the prison that I gave her the buckles.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain the prisoner is the woman?</p>

               <p>Q. How long had he been your apprentice ?</p>
               <p>Cheltenham. About fifteen months. Some time past, I could not apprehend how he came by so much money as he spent, going to clubs, and being out late at nights. I ask'd him how he supported it. He said he borrowed the money. Last Monday I put six-shillings and six-pence into the till, with two farthings, all in copper. I went out of the way in the afternoon, and desired my wife to keep the children out of the shop. When I came home at night, I sent him of an errand. Then I told the money, and found nine-pence missing. In the morning I went out again, and when he came to my wife for the key, I bid her tell him I was gone out, which she did. After that I told [I had an opportunity, he being gone out] the money, and missed one-shilling and six-pence more. Then I charged him with having taken this money. He owned it, and shew'd it me in a canvas bag. I ask'd him for the key with which he open'd the till, and after some time he produced it; and after that he own'd to me he had, within a fortnight, taken out about seven shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promises?</p>
               <p>Cheltenham. I said, I am glad I did not mark the halfpence, and that I'd beg the court to be tender, and send him on board a ship, sooner than hang him.</p>

               <p>I never tried the key, and am very innocent of what I am charged with; I had borrowed half a crown on Sunday last of Mr. Twycross, and in the evening, I changed it into halfpence, being very dry, with a milkwoman in Fleet-Street, to drink a halfpenny worth of milk.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Twycross. I am a victualler, and live in Long-Lane. I have known the prisoner about a year and half, and I never heard any ill of him. He borrowed half a crown of me last Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in one piece?</p>
               <p>Twycross. I do not know that now.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it?</p>
               <p>Twycross. Much about three in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he go afterwards?</p>
               <p>Twycross. Indeed I can't tell.</p>

I observed it was broke open, and also that the till in the bar was broke. I said to the porter, What have you been doing, as the locks are broke open? but he made me no answer. I went up, and told the drawer the locks were broke open. We came down, and found the two drawers out of the book-cafe and the till in different places. The window on the ground floor was open, which had been fasten'd the night before; and there was a box belonging to our little boy lying open, which he said his money was in.</p>

            . My husband keeps the Bell tavern in Friday Street. I went to bed betwixt eleven and twelve on the 13th of September, and lock'd the doors myself. I saw the parlour windows fronting Friday-Street bolted. Next morning I was told my house had been rob'd. I went down and examined the book-cafe (which was broke open with a borer) and missed a pair of stone buckles which I had put there myself; two parcels of money, one about thirty shillings, the other about forty; I saw a guinea among it. I had the keys of this case, which stands behind the bar, the till of which was also broke open, wherein there were about the value of five shillings in good halfpence and a paper of bad halfpence, about two shillings worth; there was also an iron box with about five shillings in it belonging to one of the apprentices, and a bit of paper containing an account of what I laid out for him, which paper I always kept in that box, and put the box in the till. I wrote upon that paper what I paid for the boy after Mr. Holyland went out of town; it consisted of some of my husband's writing and some mine.</p>

               <p>Council. This paper was sealed up by the grand jury.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this paper.</p>
               <p>M. Holyland. This is the same paper that I mean, which I kept in the tobacco box. The last time I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175610200009"/> wrote upon it I put it into it, put the box in the till, and had the key in my own possession.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to fix upon the prisoner, to take him up?</p>
               <p>M. Holyland. Mr. Willets a plaisterer and two of his men came and told me they saw a man in Distaff-Lane, between the hours of three and five, describing his person and voice, which answer'd that of the prisoner; upon which I caused him to be taken up, my husband being out of town. The constable brought the prisoner to my house, who ask'd me what I had to alledge against him. I desired the constable to take him somewhere else, and he carried him to the Bull head in Bread Street. When he found he was going before my Lord mayor he desired to speak with me; he said he was quite innocent of the thing charged against him, but rather than be exposed he would make it up, and laid down I believe ten shillings upon the table, saying if that was not sufficient, and he had enough in the world, he would give it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. The constable that took me up said, If I would own it she would make it up for 3 or 4 guineas, is not that true?</p>
               <p>M. Holyland. No, I know of no such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before this robbery was it that you wrote upon this paper?</p>
               <p>M. Holyland. I wrote upon it some time in September.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money might you lose?</p>
               <p>M. Holyland. There was about 10 s. lost out of the till</p>
               <p>Q. What out of the book cafe?</p>
               <p>M. Holyland. Two parcels of money, one about thirty shillings, the other about forty.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. Had you any occasion to open the box, from the time you wrote upon this paper till this robbery?</p>

            . I am a constable, and took up the prisoner on suspicion of his breaking Mr. Holy-land's house. The next day I went with him before alderman Gosling, where he said that the morning the robbery was committed he was at the Horns in Gutter Lane, having spent the evening there in company till one or two o'clock, when he went away in order to go home, but thinking the family was gone to bed he was not willing to disturb them, and went with a woman of the town, whom he met with at Holbourn-bridge, to some street near the watch house in High Holbourn, where he stay'd and drank some negus; he said he could find the house out, so I went thither with him in a coach, but not being able to find it, tho' we went to all the streets thereabouts, and into several houses, I brought him back to Guildhall. But we found out Mrs. Hays's house, where he said he had bought a handkerchief; they said he had been there that morning and bought a handkerchief, but paid 6 d. short, which he then paid.</p>

            . I keep the Horns, in Gutter Lane. I remember the time this robbery was committed. The prisoner was at my house, and breakfasted with me between nine and ten. The night before the robbery, he spent the evening (at a club) at my house, and staid till about five minutes before two. I saw him when he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he clean or dirty?</p>
               <p>M. Ashpinwall. He was very clean.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear of a wager laid?</p>
               <p>M. Ashpinwall. I was in the room, and a half crown was thrown down by the prisoner, to bind the wager, which was for a guinea, and he said he had not a guinea. When they came down the reckoning came to nine-pence each One gentleman paid a shilling, and he insisted they should all pay alike, and leave money for the servant. I gave the prisoner three-pence out of a shilling, and he spent that at the bar in liquor.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say about the halfpence ?</p>
               <p>M. Ashpinwall. He said it was not worth his while to put them in his pocket, as having no more.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in liquor?</p>
               <p>M. Ashpinwall. He was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he drink at the bar ?</p>
               <p>M. Ashpinwall. He drank a couple of glasses there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see he had any thing of bulls about him?</p>
               <p>M. Ashpinwall. He had nothing at all about him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a ladder?</p>
               <p>M. Ashpinwall. No.</p>

            . I live at Mrs. Ann Hays's, at a sale-shop, Middle Row, St. Giles's. The prisoner came to our house on the 14th of last month, at about a quarter after six in the morning, and said he wanted to buy a ruffled shirt. He bought one. It cost nine shillings, and he paid for it in silver. He bought a handkerchief and neckcloth. One cost three shillings, and the other half a crown, and paid that five shillings and six-pence in halfpence. He had several bad halfpence about him, and gave me six-penny worth of them, and said. If I would not take them, he'd throw them away. At his first coming in, he told me he came twenty miles that morning (from Chichester) in the stage coach, to the Packhorse on Turnham Green, and that he had walked from thence to our house, and was very tired, and faint, and wanted to get him a pot of purl; I said, there was none to be got. Then he desired us to get him a pint of rasbury. There was none of that. Then he wanted to get a quartern of gin, and my fellow servant fetch'd it. He had a barber fetch'd, and was shaved, and paid him in halfpence. I joak'd with him, and said, I thought he had stood at a good corner that morning. He said, he had got a great many halfpence, which he took out of his father's bag, and that I had them as he had them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he clean or dirty?</p>
               <p>J. Clark. He was extreamly dirty. His hands were of the colour of lead, and he desired to wash them. I carried him some water and soap, and he desired to have a scrubbing brush to get the dirt of his hands. I carried the brush to him, and brush'd the cobwebs off his cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of any particular piece of paper?</p>
               <p>J. Clark. I did. When he pull'd the money out of his coat pocket to pay, he pull'd out a piece of paper with it, which fell down. When he had paid me, he took up the paper and read it, and threw it from him into the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this paper.</p>
               <p>J. Clark. (She took it in her hand.) Here is the mark I made on it. This is the same. It remain'd in the window till my mistress came home from Kentish Town. Then I told her I had had a customer from Chichester that morning, and that I had sold him a shirt and handkerchief. She thought it might have been a customer of her's these, that with her very largely, and was angry with me for letting him go before she came. I said, I kept him as long as I could, and that he went away about nine, and left a piece of paper behind him, by which she might tell what trade or business he is of. She look'd at it, and said, I can't tell by this; but it is one that is very curious, for he sets down what his shoes and mending costs; I'll lay it by till I see him again, and lock'd it up in her cupboard, in the parlour. I never saw it after, till the 23d of the same month.</p>
               <p>Q. How came that paper to light?</p>
               <p>J. Clark. On the 23d Mr. Holyland came to our house, and examined me, whether I had seen any thing of his; after he had been told by my mistress, and shewn this paper. When she ask'd him if he knew any thing of that paper, he immediately said it was his and his wife's hand writing. The next day we went before justice Fielding, and there Mr. Holyland swore to the paper, as part of his hand writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175610200011"/>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner the second time?</p>
               <p>J. Clark. He came the 14th of September, and I saw him again the Thursday following at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any talk about this paper at Guild-Hall.</p>
               <p>J. Clark. It was not mention'd there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know some of the servants at Mr. Holyland's?</p>
               <p>J. Clark. I did not before the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not one of them frequently come to your house?</p>
               <p>J. Clark. No, never; only when they sent for me to come to Guild Hall. That was the drawer that came then.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Mr. Holyland to ask you after something more of his property?</p>
               <p>J. Clark. He said, he lost some buckles, and ask'd me after them; I said, I saw a pair of buckles, but did not know what they were made of.</p>

            . I was not at home when the prisoner came to my house. When I came home my servant told me there had been a gentleman there, who came from Chichester, and had bought a russtled shirt, handkerchief and neckcloth, and with all he had left a bit of paper, and as she could not read, gave it to me, and I read it. It was about shoes making and mending, and paying for them. I thought it had been a customer of mine that lived at Chichester. I took and lock'd it up directly, thinking if he came again I'd give it him.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this paper.</p>
               <p>A. Hays. (She takes it in her hand.) This is the same paper. Here is my name which I wrote upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with it?</p>
               <p>A. Hays. I shew'd it to Mr. Holyland when he came, who desired me to come with it the next day to justice Fielding's, and there it was seal'd up to go before the grand jury.</p>

            . This paper (taking it in his hand) is of my own and my wife's writing.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the nature of the paper?</p>
               <p>Holyland. It is an account of money paid for mending and making shoes for our apprentice.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this paper kept?</p>
               <p>Holyland. It was generally kept in an iron tobacco box, with the boy's money, and put in the till; we have four partitions in the till, and it was kept in the back partition.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the care of the till?</p>
               <p>Holyland. My wife had at that time, I being out of town when the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How near to the till and book-cafe did your servant lie?</p>
               <p>Holyland. He lay in an open place in the entry, not a great distance off.</p>
               <p>Q. At coming down stairs are not you obliged to go through that entry to go to the book-cafe?</p>
               <p>Holyland. Yes, we are.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not doors between?</p>
               <p>Holyland. There are two, but they are always left open.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not one of your boys lie with the servant?</p>
               <p>Holyland. Yes, he does.</p>
               <p>Q. How high is your one pair of stairs window?</p>
               <p>Holyland. It is 14 or 15 foot; I mean that which fronts Distaff Lane, the room the rope-ladder was found in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think a drunken man could get up 14 or 15 foot high, then open a window and come down, and not awaken your servant?</p>
               <p>Holyland. The ladder I apprehend to be just the same as any other ladder; it is very unlikely it should be done without awaking my servant, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175610200012"/> that it was done is certain; and the best reason I can give for it is this, My porter goes to bed earlier when I have company in the house than when I have not (we had four or five companies that day) he usually goes to bed between eleven and twelve, in order to get up to do the business of the house, and sometimes he goes to bed in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your boy get in liquor?</p>
               <p>Holyland. No, he does not.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the contents of that piece of paper?</p>
               <p>Holyland. The boy's little accounts were kept on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Give an account how you first saw this piece of paper again.</p>
               <p>Holyland. I came to town on the 20th of September and a day or two after being inform'd that a pair of buckles had been seen in Middle Row, at a shop where the prisoner had been, I went to the woman, who told me she saw a pair of buckles, but she could not take upon her to say they had stones set in them; she then ask'd me if I had lost any paper, and on my reply that I could not tell, she open'd a place and took out this paper, which I told her was mine, desiring her to take care of it, and bring it with her on the morrow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner once live with you?</p>
               <p>Holyland. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Holyland. Look at this paper; see if you can find your own hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Holyland. Yes, here is my writing upon it, (pointing to it.)</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley. The prisoner lodged with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lie at home the night this robbery was committed?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley. I live in the Fleet-market.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he generally pretty regular as to coming home in the evening?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his general character?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley. A very sober well behaved man, a man that I have trusted with a great deal; he has behaved exceeding well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know him distress'd for want of money?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever stay out in this manner before?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley. He has staid out on nights before that time, but then I thought he might be at his uncle's.</p>
               <p>Q. Has that been the case often?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley. He has staid out two or three nights before.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did he lodge at your house?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley. I can't say how long; I believe about five months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever apprehend, when he has stay'd out, that he was about such business as he is now charged with?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he an opportunity to have rob'd you of any thing?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley. He had, of a great deal of money both in my drawers and shop, had he been so minded. I have trusted him to take money in my shop, and to go to my drawers; he has been a week together in my shop, while I have been in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your shop?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley. It is in the coal trade: I have trusted him with 10 l. at a time; he has been faithful and just.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I am quite innocent, I know nothing at all of what I am charged with, nor of that paper.</p>

            . My son had bought of the prisoner some goods, and I was told he left word I might hear of him at the Queen's Arms, Newgate-Street. I went there, and inquired of the people at the bar for such a person, by the name of Lowth, which he had wrote in our book, and they knew of no such person. Then I suspected he did not come honestly by the things he had sold.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your shop?</p>
               <p>Palmer. It is at the bottom of Chick-Lane. He came again on the 25th of September with other goods, and ask'd if we would buy them. My son said, this is the man that I bought the cloaths of, on the Saturday before. I look'd at the cloaths, and said I would not buy them. He immediately tied them up in his handkerchief and went out, I followed him, and at the end of Field Lane (at a brasier's shop) he went in and left them, and said he'd call for them immediately. These are part of the goods here produced, for I had the looking of them over in my shop, and know them well. I went into the brasier's shop, and ask'd the man of the shop if he knew the man that left the bundle. He said, no. Then I said, it was clear to me that he stole them, and beg'd he'd stop him and the bundle when he came for them. The prisoner came back in about a quarter of an hour, and the brasier sent him to my shop; he said, Sir, what is the meaning you stop the cloaths which I left at Mr. Walker's? I said, because I suspect you stole them, and the others also, which my son bought. He said, I don't care to expose myself, I came honestly by them, and pray let me have them; I said, if you be an honest man you need not be uneasy. Then he agreed to my taking the cloaths into my possession, and said he'd give me an account where he liv'd. Then I went with him to Mr. Walker's, and when we came to the door he ran away. Then I concluded the things were stolen, and advertised them on the Wednesday following. Going to the Exchange about half an hour after twelve o'clock I saw the prisoner at a musick shop, facing Bow-Church. I knowing his face immediately follow'd him to a house in Cannon-Street, where he carried a letter, and there I took him.</p>

               <p>Benjamin Skingle. I live at Mr. Chavat and Limber's, in Crispin-Street, Spitalfields, who are in the handkerchief trade; on the 22d of September we lost a dozen of silk and cotton handkerchiefs out of our warehouse.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175610200015"/>Q. What were they worth?</p>
               <p>Skingle. Twenty-four shillings; they were taken off the counter behind the door. I had sold them to a person but about half an hour before I missed them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day did you miss them?</p>
               <p>Skingle. I missed them about three in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the prisoner do business in your warehouse?</p>
               <p>Skingle. No, he used to do business at the printer's.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he there?</p>
               <p>Skingle. He came to get a petition sign'd, and I bid him stay a little; he went out to a publick house, but did not come back: This was a little before two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take them?</p>
               <p>Skingle. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they ever found again ?</p>
               <p>Skingle. No, they were not; he was taken up, and being charged with them confessed he took them, before Peter Turquend.</p>

I look'd a little distance back, and seeing the prisoner stooping down upon a post I ran back, and laid hold of him by the collar, telling him I missed my handkerchief and believed he had got it.

               <p>Cheek. No, if I had been sober I should not have done as I did. I went with them, and this good woman wanted me to undress myself and go to bed with her. I would not, but we sat together at the foot of the bed. I soon missed my money, and asked her to give it me again, but she denied having it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the other woman near you?</p>

               <p>Cheek. I don't know that she touch'd me.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you miss it ?</p>
               <p>Cheek. Not till I got from sitting on the bed, when I charged her with it. I kept the door, and would not let her go out, when she went to a drawer and took out a knife and fork, saying she would strike the fork into me. Then she put the knife to my throat, and I held up my hand, when she cut the back of it, and had it not been there she would have cut my throat. The watchman coming by I charged him with her, and he took her to the watch-house, where we searched her, but found nothing. She denied having the money before the sitting alderman.</p>

            . I am a watchman, and as I was beating the hour ten I heard somebody call Watch out at a window. When I came into the room, there were the prosecutor, prisoner, and another woman; he charged me with the prisoner for taking a 36 s. piece and half a crown from him, but she denied it. I took her to the watch-house, the other woman got away.</p>

               <p>This man came to me and another woman, asking us to drink part of a pot of beer, which we did, and then he wanted to go to my room. We went thither, and he treated us with a dram. While the other young woman was gone for the dram he threw me on the bed, and wanted to be rude with me against my will. After that, he threw me down upon the stairs. I wanted him to go out of the room, and said my husband was coming. He said, d - n you, you b - h, I'll lay you sprawling. He pull'd me, and we fell down stairs together, and he drag'd me in the mud when the watchman came. I never saw any money.</p>

            , my father-in-law.</p>
               <p>Q. What things did you lose?</p>
               <p>Hawkes. I lost two locks and three keys (there were two keys to one of them ) and five pair of steel snuffers. We found but four pair at the prisoner's house. I can't be certain, with regard to losing brass cocks out of such a shop as our's is; but they are what the prisoner confessed he took out of our shop, and likewise the frame saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they mark'd?</p>
               <p>Hawkes. No, they were not; I lost an iron padlock. As to the fire-shovels, tongs and pokers, and iron screws, they were found upon the prisoner; but I can't say they were mine, only the prisoner own'd they were mine, and beg'd for mercy. We search'd his house and cellar where he work'd, and found the other things. We took him before justice Welch, and there again he confessed the taking all the things.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Hawkes. He had been one of our out door workmen for several years.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he work'd for you?</p>
               <p>Hawkes. I believe he has for seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. How has he behaved during that time ?</p>
               <p>Hawkes. As an honest man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he industrious ?</p>
               <p>Hawkes. As to that I can't say.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to be taken up?</p>
               <p>Hawkes. I missed things, and had intelligence of his being lurking about the shop in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make these sort of goods for you?</p>
               <p>Hawkes. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time of his confession what was said to him?</p>
               <p>Hawkes. Nothing at all. He confessed taking the things found upon him, and beg'd for mercy.</p>
               <p>Q. What was said about mercy?</p>
               <p>Hawkes. He desired we would pardon him. I can't say he used the word mercy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he then tell you he had got the other things ?</p>
               <p>Hawkes. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any promise made him of mercy ?</p>
               <p>Hawkes. No, none at all; since that I have been with him in prison, and desired him to be frank and free, telling him he should be the better for it; but I made him no such promise before.</p>

            . I am a brush-maker, and live in the Strand. We used to see the prisoner about the prosecutor's door, on mornings, at five o'clock, or thereabouts. We thought he had no good design. Sometimes he'd be going in, and start back again. On the 27th of September I saw him do so, when Mr. Barrow came to the door, and call'd to him, and he went away. We had sent Mr. Barrow a letter, that there was a man used to come to his door with a bag, on mornings, and we suspected him to be a bad man. The time of this robbery, being the 27th, we workmen were all watching him, some out at a window above, and some below. One of our men push'd out, and took the prisoner. We carried him to a publick house, and sent for Mr. Hawkes. He charged the prisoner with stealing the tongs and things he had upon him, and the prisoner owned he did. I also heard him own it before the justice.</p>

               <p>Robert Brudenell. I was going home in my chair on Tuesday morning the 5th of October, between one and two o'clock; I had not been very well, and was asleep, but the chair being set down (in <placeName id="t17561020-39-crimeloc183">Berkley Square</placeName>

               <p>Q. How many men did you see?</p>
               <p>Brudenell. I saw only the man that hold it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know him?</p>
               <p>Brudenell. I can't say that the prisoner is the man; the first words I heard were, '' Your cash, '' your cash.''</p>
               <p>Q. Who said that?</p>
               <p>Brudenell. The man that held a pistol to my head, in a low voice. I did not rightly understand him, and said hey, hey, or something like it, being but just awake. He then used some rash words to make me make haste, and the first thing I gave him was my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What watch was it?</p>
               <p>Brudenell. A gold one.</p>
               <p>Q. What might you value it at?</p>
               <p>Brudenell. At about ten pounds, it was an old one; he took it, and then asked me for my cash, when I took my purse out of my pocket and slip'd it under me, and gave him my loose silver, which I think was about five six-pences. Then he put down the top of the chair, and bid the chairmen go on. I saw the foremost chairman standing about ten yards from me, and the hindmost told me afterwards he was standing behind with a man who held a pistol at his head. When I thought they were got clear from the chair I desired to be let out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any servant with you?</p>
               <p>Brudenell. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a light or a dark night?</p>
               <p>Brudenell. The moon was just getting down, rather dark than light.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever your watch again?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175610200020"/>Brudenell. No; the prisoner said that on hearing a pistol go off he threw it into a pond. I pursued and overtook one of the men; there were some watchmen with me. The person we pursued snap'd a pistol at me, and after that fired again and missed me, but kill'd a watchman about ten yards behind me; it was a very narrow escape.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that watchman's name?</p>
               <p>Brudenell. His name was Crowder. This is the pistol [producing one] that was fired.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the watchman live afterwards ?</p>
               <p>Brudenell. He died in less than half an hour. Upon that pistol's being fired I told the person I would shew him no mercy, and slack him twice with my sword. Then he surrender'd and desired to be carried before a justice. After I had taken the pistol from him I was conducting him to the watch house, and going along met colonel Brown and captain West, who went thither with me. I set the person down in a chair, when he directly said to captain West, I hope captain West you'll take care of me. I found also he knew me, but not my name; he said he had seen me mount guard many a time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that man?</p>
               <p>Brudenell. He was a soldier. Captain West asking him what his name was, he said his name was Browning, and that he belong'd to col. Parker's company. Being asked which Parker, he said colonel

            . I asked him who was with him in the robbery; he said that was a soldier also, but would not tell his name. I asked him where he lived; he said he did not know, but that he always met him near Lincoln's Inn Chapel, and that they went to rob together in Berkley-Square or thereabouts, but the other would never let him know where he lived. One of the two chairmen swore before the justice, that the man who shot the watchman was the man that held the pistol to my head.</p>

            . I am high constable of Westminster. Mr. Fielding desired me to go down to New-Prison to see the man that was stab'd. On Tuesday in the afternoon, about five or six o'clock, I went. He was alive, but died about seven. After some talk with him he told me his accomplice's name was Hirst, but went by the name of Johnson, and that he was concerned with him in that robbery, and he lived in a court by Lincoln's Inn; which I found afterwards, was Bishop's Court. He could not tell the name of the court. He told us if we went to a coffee house at the corner, the people would direct us to the house. We went, and were directed. We inquired for him, and was told he was gone into the country. Browning said, he had a pistol, which was fellow to that which was taken upon him. Upon finding some letters in his buroe, there was one directed to Mr. Newton. We applied to him, and he carried us to several different lodgings. At last we went to the Barnetstage, and found he was gone in it, to Potter's Bar, in Hatfield road. On searching his lodgings we found these purses ( producing six or seven) I and Mr. Newton went to Potter's Bar on Wednesday in the afternoon, to the house of (I think) one Warner, a private house. There we found the prisoner at the bar. Mr. Newton told me that was the man, so I secured him. I put my hand in his pocket, and pull'd out this pistol. It was loaded. ( Producing one, and the two pistols being compared and examined by the jury they appeared to be fellows.) I charged him, and he said he'd surrender. There was his wife sitting by him. We pinion'd him, and brought him that night to justice Fielding's and there he made a confession. I was present and saw him sign it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he sign it freely ?</p>
               <p>Barnes. Mr. Fielding said to him two or three times before he sign'd it, Mr. Johnson, if you sign this, you are signing your death warrant; I'd have you confessed what you'r about, for your confession you can't ritrect.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it read over to him?</p>
               <p>Barnes. It was; I heard it, and also before that I heard him make it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this agreeable to the confession you heard him make ?</p>
               <p>Barnes. It is.</p>

My servant came to me the day before yesterday, and told me there was some gold lace taken off two hats that were sent to dye and turn. We suspected it might be some of the carpenters. I asked him whom he suspected. He said, the prisoner; because he only had been at work in that part of the shop where it was missing from. His master was acquainted with this suspicion. He talked with the prisoner, and he denied it. I took him up into my lodging room, and there he denied it stiffly. Having no other way left, I told him my maid saw him take it. He then began to make a bargain with me to promise not to prosecute him. I replied I'd be tender if he'd come immediately to a plain confession of what he had taken. Then he confessed he had taken the lace and carried it home, and after much difficulty he confessed his having taken three pair of worstead stockings. I then call'd up some people of the house. He gave the key and a written order to one of the men to go and bring the things. I went with the man, and left him in the care of others. I could not find the things. Then I brought a friend to the prisoner, and he confessed the same before him. The things were found afterwards, but I cannot give an account of that.</p>

               <p>Q. Does Mr. Snee usually accept bills?</p>
               <p>Halifax. He commonly makes draughts on his bankers, he very seldom accepts; he makes draughts under his own hand, so does likewise Mr. Randolph his partner.</p>
               <p>Q. to Falder. Are you acquainted with Mr. Randolph's hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Falder. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the name of his writing?</p>
               <p>Falder. It is not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>If I was guilty, and knew it to be a wrong bill, I will be judged by your Lordship whether I should have offer'd to stay there till my master came. I did offer to stay there, and they trusted me to go to the London stone tavern and back again. I could not find that Mr. Goodwin. My father lives two hundred miles off. I have sent twice to him for money to advertise this Goodwin, but have had none sent me.</p>

               <p>Q. to Halifax. Did he offer to stay, or go to the tavern and return?</p>
               <p>Halifax. I laid hold of the bill and kept it; he got out of the shop and desired to have the bill; but I would not let him have it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If Mr. Snee will please to speak to my character, I shall be obliged to him.</p>

            . The prisoner lived with me about three months before the bill was published, and behaved very well; I have trusted him at different times to receive several large sums of money, and he always brought it very honestly. I have sent him with money to the Excise-Office, to the amount of four hundred pounds, and he always gave me a faithful account.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he write?</p>
               <p>Snee. He could.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this bill of his hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Snee. I have too much reason to fear the body of it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose writing do you think the acceptance to be?</p>
               <p>Snee. I can't say that is his, but a man may seign different hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you or can you not say whether the acceptance was wrote by him?</p>
               <p>Snee. I really can't say whether it was wrote by him or not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to leave your service?</p>
               <p>Snee. On account of his being taken ill; I had so good an opinion of him, that I believe I should have taken him again, had I had no knowledge of this fact.</p>

I think it was the 21st of July I met the prisoner, at the end of Old-Street. I said how do you do. He said, I do not know you. No! do you not know me said I, my name is Richardson.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you tell him that was your name?</p>
               <p>Hall. Because in the year 1752 I sold this Richardson some stockings, at the Castle in Wood-Street, and I paid away a bad guinea there, to Mr. Greenhow, which I had of one Richardson, and ever after that I suspected this man of making them, Richardson having told me he took it of the prisoner at the bar; therefore I told him my name was Richardson. I thought he dealt in this sort of traffick, so I asked him if he had any queer sixes; saying, I was going into the country.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by queer sixes ?</p>
               <p>Hall. Because I have heard them talk so when they wanted to change thirty-six shilling pieces; I meant counterfeit ones.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did he make you?</p>
               <p>Hall. He said, he had none; but he could let me have two or three guineas, and some half guineas. I ask'd him what I must give him for them. He said you know the price, it is fives, I said, what five shillings! He said yes, a piece for the guineas. Then I asked the price of the half guineas, and he said fours. He gave me two of the guineas into my hand. He took them out of a piece of brown paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the half guineas in that same paper ?</p>
               <p>Hall. They were. There were three half guineas, I agreed to give him ten shillings for the two guineas. When I had them in my hand he said, don't let us stay, come pay me for them. Said I, no I shall not. When he said, let me have my gold again. I said, no I shall not; for I apprehend you to be the corner of them, and I'll take you before a magistrate, so I desire you to go quietly with me, or I'll call an officer, and said I had direction to sieze him. We went quietly out of Goswell-Street down Swan-Alley. Turning up St. John's Street, to Woods Close, he offered to go from me. I took him by the shoulder, and said he might as well be quiet. Then he knock'd me down, and attempted to escape. I got up again, and we fell to fighting. Then a great croud of people gathered about, and there happened to be a constable. The prisoner charged him with me, and said I had rob'd him? Then I told the constable I had an order to apprehend the prisoner, and carry him before a magistrate for coming, and said I would not part with the gold out of my hand. We went to justice Keeling's house, and he was not at home. Then the constable took him to the sign of the Angel, in Goswell-Street, where we met with Mr. Baileys, the justice's clerk, and told him the case, and that I, having suspicion of him, had given information of him to the warden of the Mint. He advised us to take him directly to a magistrate. He was taken before justice Welch, and there he was searched; but we found none of the half guineas about him. He was committed. The two guineas were sealed up at the justice's, and I set a mark upon them, and the second time of his examination they were delivered to the solicitor of the Mint.</p>

               <p>Hall. People that go about selling goods see such things if they take notice. I go selling stockings about to those places, where I have seen such men along with Richardson, which was the reason I suspected him. One or two asked me to change thirty-six shilling pieces. I said, I would not, and they answered they were not queer.</p>

               <p>Q. Is your name Richardson?</p>

               <p>Hall. Yes, he did after I told him my name was Richardson.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand at first what he meant by fives?</p>
               <p>Hall. I might understand what he meant.</p>

            , I am a constable. On the 21st of July I took this prisoner into custody, in Wood's Close. Hall and he appeared to me to have been fighting. I saw three half guineas (as they appeared to me) in a piece of brown paper in the prisoner's hand. They went to fighting again, and somebody laid hold of my mare's bridle which I was on, and I dismounted, and took hold of the prisoner. I asked him what was become of the three half guineas. He said, I don't know. The prisoner charged me with Hall, for robbing him of two guineas, and Hall charged me with the prisoner. I took them both to Mr. Keeling's. He not being at home, I took them to the Angel, in Goswell-Street, to inquire for Mr. Baileys (justice Keeling's clerk) for advice. There the prisoner went down to the necessary house (I knew he could not get out backwards.) I thought he was a long time before he came back again, so I went to see for him, and he met me at the door. He said, if you'll let me go I'll give you a guinea, and put one into my hand, and said, you never shall want for money as long as you live.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know he was charged with putting off counterfeit guineas?</p>
               <p>Beachamp. Yes, he did very well. I said to him will you go and lose your two guineas, and give me another; if your's was a right cause why should you do that? He said, in a right cause in get rid of a villain what would not a man do. After that I went to see him in New-Prison, and ask'd him to drink a glass of wine. I believe he did not know me at first. I said, how do you make this affair old gentleman, I believe you'll come nastily off. How came you to sell the two guineas for ten shillings ? He said, suppose I had a mind to sell 100 l. for a halfpenny, what is that to you? Then he found I was the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with him before the justice?</p>
               <p>Beachamp. I was. It was justice Welch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he searched there?</p>
               <p>Beachamp. He was, in the yard. There was a good guinea found upon him, and two or three shillings in silver; but there were no halfguineas found.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he ask'd what became of the three half guineas?</p>
               <p>Beachamp. I am not able to say whether he was or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know you was searching for the three half guineas from what was said ?</p>
               <p>Beachamp. I said, I saw three half guineas in his hand, and he denied that he ever had any.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any resistance, or strive to get from you?</p>
               <p>Beachamp. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you take to be that villain he mentioned ?</p>
               <p>Beachamp. I took him to be this Hall. I till then took Hall to be the aggressor.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that was a good guinea which he put in your hand?</p>
               <p>Beachamp. It was as good a guinea as ever I saw in my life by its appearance.</p>
               <p>Council for the crown. Was that guinea taken from out of a brown paper?</p>
               <p>Beachamp. No, that and three shillings were in his naked pocket.</p>

            . I am headborough of St. James's Clerkenwell. On the 23rd of July I went to search the prisoner's lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he lodge?</p>
               <p>Jones. In Great Warder-Street, Cold-Bath Fields.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the landlord's name?</p>
               <p>Jones. His name is Duddle. I found several little materials, and some</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175610200027"/>Q. Look upon this money?</p>
               <p>Jones. (He takes a piece in his hand.) This is a King George the first's shilling, made in the year 1723.</p>
               <p>Q. to Chamberlain. What coin are the two counterfeit guineas?</p>
               <p>Chamberlain. They are King George the first's 1723.</p>
               <p>Jones. I found six of these shillings made that same year.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they all good shillings?</p>
               <p>Jones. They are. There is no alteration on them. I found another piece of silver in imitation of a half moidore, with cross bars. (Produced to the jury, who look at it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this money found?</p>
               <p>Jones. The six shillings were in a drawer wrap'd up in a piece of paper. The half moidore was in the same chest, but not the same drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. What other money did you find?</p>
               <p>Jones. I found a 3 l. 12 s. piece, a very good one, and some very good guineas; these were in a drawer, but not in the same paper. I found also a little piece of box wood; here are some faint impressions on it ( producing it.) I saw a great sight of old snuff-boxes, some pieces, bottoms, and sides, and tops, some silver and brass rims, they look'd very dull, and lay in a dusty careless way, some in boxes, some in drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that he carried on the trade of snuff-box making ?</p>
               <p>Jones. I should think too. [He produced a parcel of other things tied up in a handkerchief.]</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Jones. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. What place are you constable of?</p>
               <p>Jones. I am headborough of St. James's, Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live there?</p>
               <p>Jones. I do; my house is there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you bring away the snuff-boxes ?</p>
               <p>Jones. No. I did not meddle with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the landlord of the house?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes, and told him, I wanted to search the house for one Domine; he said there was no such man lodged there.</p>
               <p>Q. What name did the prisoner go by?</p>
               <p>Jones. He went by another name, I can't tell what now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not declare to the landlord, that there was no ground of suspicion whatever?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else?</p>
               <p>Jones. I found a small anvil or slake in the window, cover'd with paper (produced in court.)</p>

            . I am engraver to the mint, and have been so about seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this piece of box wood.</p>
               <p>Yeo. (He looks at it.) This seems to have been intended to be used to flatten a piece of silver after it had been made hollow by raising the scepters, so laying it down and putting the end of this upon it, which is quite flat, by striking on the top of it, it would make the silver lie flat again; here seems, to be a confused mixture of the prints of money on the end, by the striking it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these two guineas that are here produced.</p>
               <p>Yeo. These certainly are counterfeits, they are shillings gilt after the scepters were work'd up out of the silver.</p>
               <p>Q. What coin is it?</p>
               <p>Yeo. It is a coin of his late majesty king George.</p>
               <p>Q. What coin is the most easily alter'd this way ?</p>
               <p>Yeo. These of king George I. and also some of queen Anne's, such as have a rose, heart, or letters between the crosses, which stand projecting, for by the means of chasing tools that metal may be drove out of its place, so as to raise the scepters; whereas others that have not this metal to work upon are run so early to form scepters on.</p>
               <p>Q Look at one of these shillings that were found in the prisoner's room.</p>
               <p>Yeo. These are the most fit for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Look upon this half moidore.</p>
               <p>Yeo. It is silver; I suppose this to be a cast half moidore.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any of these in silver before?</p>
               <p>Yeo. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. There are other things the last evidence produced, look at them.</p>
               <p>Yeo. Here is a sand bag or cushion to engrave on; a block of pewter with cement on it, to fasten down any metal to engrave or chase, engraver's scorpers, crucibles, and engraver's tools.</p>

               <p>Duddle. At Michaelmas last he had lodged with me half a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at the searching of the room?</p>
               <p>Duddle. I was. I saw all these things found.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175610200028"/>Q. Did he follow any trade or business?</p>
               <p>Duddle. I never could discern he had any.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body come about business while he was at your house ?</p>
               <p>Duddle. Not one soul.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there no watches, snuff-boxes, teaspoons, or any thing of the silver trade, sold while he was at your house ?</p>
               <p>Duddle. No, none.</p>
               <p>Q. When he went in and out, did he use to lock the door?</p>
               <p>Duddle. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose he did not go out of the house, but out of his room into the kitchen, was his room door lock'd then?</p>
               <p>Duddle. Sometimes not.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it when he was in his room?</p>
               <p>Duddle. Then it was mostly lock'd, but not always. I and my wife have been in the room with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the key hole ever cover'd when he has been in the room alone ?</p>
               <p>Duddle. It has sometimes; but with what I can't tell. We thought he lived upon a little matter he might have of his own, and not having much before hand might mend his own shoes, or the like; and we thought his blinding the key-hole was with intent the rest of the house should not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear him at work with tools, as a silversmith ?</p>
               <p>Duddle. No, never.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Who made his bed?</p>
               <p>Duddle. He himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not a woman come to him sometimes?</p>
               <p>Duddle. There was a woman used to come to and fro, that used to black his shoes. I know her. She is an honest woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she use to make his bed?</p>
               <p>Duddle. I can't tell that. It is my opinion he made it himself.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he lodged with you did you suspect him of this ?</p>
               <p>Duddle. No, I did not. We thought him a very honest man, that could barely subsist in a decent way and manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not heard what trade he was bred up in ?</p>
               <p>Duddle. Not before they came to search his room, and take his tools away. Since that I thought (by the tools) he was a goldsmith, no otherways.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>As to the tools, in the first place, they all belong to my trade, every tool there. As for the shillings, they are common money. There is hardly any body but what have them in their pockets, that have any silver. As for the half moidore, that is not one, it is something like it. These pieces are to be had common at goldsmiths shops and bankers. This of mine, it is to be seen, has been made a great many years. It may be seen by any workman that it is not made by any man in England. The two bad guineas I know nothing of. I never made one, neither did I ever utter any bad piece of money, either English or foreign coin, upon earth. Is it not a strange thing that having been in London so long, and in Mr. Pentelow's gaol a quarter of a year, and exposed to publick view, yet nobody should appear against me but this fellow, if I was guilty. This Hall is a fellow that has got neither house nor home. He is what we call a family man, a very bad sort of a fellow. He has others that go about with him a shop-listing, buying stolen goods, and every thing that is bad. I never saw him in my life time, nor he me.</p>

               <p>Colverwell. It was a linen one (producing it.) The prisoner at the bar was just behind me. He stop'd her I search'd her and found my handkerchief, and nine others, and a snuff box in her apron. I carried her to the watchhouse. She owned a man took them, and she received them of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body with her?</p>
               <p>Colverwell. There was a man, but he made his escape from us.</p>
               <p>Jacob Lotelia. I was coming home last Sunday in the evening a little after eight o'clock. Near Bishopsgate, I saw the prisoner and one Soloman (that I had long suspected or picking of pockets ) walking together. I passed them, and wa between them and Mr. Colverwell. He had two gentlewomen with him. I thought the prisoner and Soloman intended to pick his pocket. I live in Lis I turned down to go thither afterwards,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175610200030"/> out of curiosity, I turned again to see whether they pick'd his pocket or not. I past the prosecutor, and then I observed his handkerchief did not hang with the corner out of his pocket, as it did just before. I said, Sir, I believe you have lost your handkerchief. He felt, and said he had. Then I laid hold on Soloman, and the prosecutor the prisoner. Soloman threaten'd to knock me down, and he got from me, and ran away. At first he said he did not belong to her, and she said the same; but when he was gone, and she was stop'd, she said, stop him, stop him, he does belong to me. We searched her, and found an iron snuffbox, and nine handkerchiefs upon her. The prosecutor owned one of them as soon as he saw it, and described a mark upon it, which we afterwards saw.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was taking a walk over More-Fields and met this young man Soloman. He ask'd me if I'd go and drink some beer. I said, I did not care if I did; and after that, as I was walking up Bishopsgate-Street, the prosecutor and two gentlewomen came by me. After that the evidence here said, that man and I had pick'd the prosecutor's pocket of his handkerchief. The young fellow had a tustle with the gentleman. He bid me hold up my lap, which I did, and he flung these things into it.</p>

The prisoner came into my master's shop, I think, on Friday the 1st of October, pretending to be a customer; I was then serving one. After I had done, she came to me to cheapen a handkerchief, and as she was standing by the counter upon looking round I missed my watch, to which I had been putting a new string before the other customer came in, and had laid it down in the window while I served her. The prisoner and I could not agree for the handkerchief, and when she was going out of the shop I charged her with having taken my watch, which she denied, and said she would be search'd by any gentlewoman in the house. I directly call'd down our maid, who search'd her, and found it; I saw it taken from under the prisoner's arm.</p>

The prisoner came and call'd me from work, saying, his master had given him an old bedstead, and a great many other goods; he also produced five caps, which he desired me to go and pawn for him. I pawn'd them for 8 d. and brought him the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fetch them out again?</p>
               <p>E. Fish. I did, I believe it was on the same day, and he was taken up the day following.</p>

            , going out of town (as she told me) to see her father and mother, left the key with the prisoner, who lived in the same house, that her master should not lose the sale of any of his goods; she went out, and when she return'd she could not get into her room; in the dusk of the evening Mrs. Fish brought the key of the door, and said the prisoner gave it her to bring home. In the morning about eight o'clock I heard her scream out, making a sad complaint. I went up to see what was the matter, when she told me that all her money, her ring, some caps, handkerchiefs and ruffles, were gone. In turning over the things in the box we found a chissel, how it came there I can't say, but this is the very same chissel. (producing one.)</p>

            . I lay in bed, in the barn where the hens roosted, and a child about ten years of age with me. Between ten and eleven o'clock two persons came in. I heard a stranger ask where he was got now. The prisoner answered him, and said, d - n your eyes don't speak a word. After this I heard three fowls taken from their roost. I believe four, by the fluttering of their wings. I heard them kill them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner?</p>
               <p>M. Taylor. No, but I know it was he that said that, for I knew his voice, being used to him, morning, noon and night, and in the night he spoke it with a sentence. There was but a little dog-house between us.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be certain how many hens were taken from their roost?</p>
               <p>M. Taylor. I can swear to four of them, that were intirely killed.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of them?</p>
               <p>M. Taylor. They were taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>M. Taylor. They were not left there.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>M. Taylor. On the Saturday before Michaelmas day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the justice?</p>
               <p>M. Taylor. I was; I heard the prisoner examined, and swore that it was his voice I heard there that night.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say for himself?</p>
               <p>M. Taylor. He felt to abusing me, not attempting to justify himself as a man would do. I knew him by his voice, for I have heard it early and late; I have heard it thousands of times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say nothing for himself before the justice?</p>
               <p>M. Taylor. He said, Sir, I know no more of it than you do, I have not been there since my master discharged me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>That night these fowls were lost I was at work for a butcher in the town; I came home and went to bed, and did not go out till nine o'clock next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. to M. Taylor. You hear the prisoner, is that the same voice you heard in the barn?</p>
               <p>M. Taylor. It is the very same voice.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was it that you heard the voice in the barn?</p>
               <p>M. Taylor. As near as I can tell it was betwixt ten and eleven; it was just before a hard shower came upon us.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Hardley. Because when I took her she own'd it, and carried me to the pawnbroker's house where she had pawn'd it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she live in the house with you?</p>
               <p>Hardley. No, she did not; she used to come along with a ballad-singer to my house. She came one night and I let her in, and having no place to lie at I permitted her to lie at my bed's feet. I went out in the morning to get myself a pot of beer, and when I came back she and the gown were both gone.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it last?</p>
               <p>Hardley. I had it in my hand about an hour before I went out. The people underneath where I live said they saw the prisoner go out with a bundle under her cloaths, when I was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet with her again?</p>
               <p>Hardley. About Broad St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge her with taking the gown?</p>
               <p>Hardley. Yes I did, and she said she got a key, open'd my door, and took the gown out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make her any promises before this?</p>
               <p>Hardley. I promised I would not prosecute her, if she would confess.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came it about that you do prosecute her?</p>
               <p>Hardley. Because I could not get the gown from the pawnbroker without it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she say the pawnbroker lived?</p>
               <p>Hardley. She went along with me to the house, and called for it in her own name.</p>
