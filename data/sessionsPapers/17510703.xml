            . I am a watchman in the Tower ward: On the 18th of June, about 11 o'clock at night, I was at the bottom of St. Dunstan's-hill, the prisoner came towards me, and made a stop about ten yards from me. I went to him and ask'd him what he had got, he said, seeds. I set down my lanthorn, and took him by the collar; he jump'd away from me and ran up the hill. I pursued him, he fell down at the bottom of St. Mary's-hill, and was taken. The sugar was produced in court, and weighed 114 pound, the sack was mark'd COURT. I had light enough by my candle to know him again.</p>

            . On the 19th of June last, in the evening, I lost a silver pint mug; and on the 22d, pretty late in the evening, I lost a two quart silver tankard, with a 3 l. 12 s. piece of gold on the top of it. On the 23 d I sent notice<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175107030003"/> to Goldsmith's-hall, and likewise advertised it the 25th, by which means I came to find it out. The prisoner, and the 3 l. 12 s. piece were stop'd at one Mr. Holland's, near Bishops-gate, who sent for me. I accused the prisoner of the fact, and she immediately confess'd, that she and her brother had stolen the things. I desired her to go and show me where the tankard and mug were. She took me to a house in Dunning's alley, and shew'd me the tankard knock'd and cut to pieces; the piece of gold was cut out with a knife, and damaged in cutting out; then she went with me to Mr. Burry's, a pawn-broker, where she had pawn'd the mug for two guineas. The goods were produced in court and deposed to.</p>

            . The prisoner brought the silver pint mug to me on the 20th of June, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, saying, her mistress had lived in Barbacan, at the sign, of the Cattle, (there was a Castle engraved on the mug) and that she wanted money, &amp;c. I told her, I chose to carry the money to her mistress. She said, her mistress lived in great credit, and the people would know me, which would not be so well. I would not lend her any money upon it. After that she came again with a woman, who, she said, was an intimate acquaintance of her mistress, which woman I had known about a year and a half, who testified it was her mistress's, so I lent her two guineas upon it.</p>
               <p>Gyles Smyth went with the prosecutor to find the things, and confirm'd his testimony.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in her defence said, It was not she, but her brother that took the things.</p>

I got up, and at that time miss'd nothing. When the children got up and went to be dress'd we miss'd the child's coat and stay; then we went to searching and miss'd the tea-chest, and other things. I went and described the things lost to several pawnbrokers round about, and when I came home the spoons were stop'd at one of them, who sent for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175107030004"/> me.

I took her that is got away to snew me the boy, and left the prisoner in custody. She went with me to Cable-street, to a house of very ill same where Young was (one Stitchbourne keeps the house). The woman gave me the signal, the boy got up and crept under my arm to get away, but I took hold on him, and took him over to the sign of the Blew Anchor, where the prisoner, Hughs, was to be brought: there my journyman demanded of him, what he had done with the goods. Young said, he would let us know where every thing was, and that the tea-chest was then at his washerwoman's, and the woman that is got away, who lodged at that house, had bought it of him for half a pint of All-sorts. The woman who bought it went with me there, and took it out of a cupboard under the stairs, it had one of my child's petticoats lap'd round it.

I ask'd him, what was that woman's business? he said, this is the woman that has bought the child's coat, and the things belonging to it. Then I had five of them. I went to Justice Manwaring and told him the affair, he order'd me to bring them to him. I took them there, all but the person who made her escape, and the boy confess'd the fact, saying, he broke the house open between two and three o'clock, and went in and took the things mentioned. The goods were produced in court, except one canister which was lost. The spoons and tongs were mark'd J. M. M.</p>
               <p>James Halfhide the apprentice confirmed the above, with this addition : That at the time Young was taken he had a pair of his breeches on.</p>

I knowing he had no business there, after about ten minutes he came out, so I followed and overtook him near the Castle. He had got a wallet on his shoulder, I ask'd him what he had got in it, he said, victuals. Then Mr. Morgan call'd out of a window, and ask'd, what was the matter. He said, I had stop'd him. I said, I thought he had things about him that did not belong to him: then I took him back to the Bull and Gate, saying, if you are clear I will call for a pot of beer. When we came there he said, don't make a noise, I have got three ducks in my wallet, and I am a poor man.

The other person had trowses on, he shoved his hand into his pocket, and pulled out a butcher's knife; my wife said, for God's sake Mr. Weeden deliver what you have; I gave him a guinea, about eight pennyworth of halfpence, a silver tobacco stopper with a cork screw in it, and a brass handled penknife; then he saw I had on a large pair of silver buckles, he stooped down and took them out, and likewise took an enamelled gold ring from my finger; the prisoner said to my wife, d - n you, your ring, madam ; he tore it off her finger, and the blood followed it, and likewise pulled up her coats to examine if she had silver buckles in her shoes, and examined her if she had any money: after this they bid us keep strait forward, and if we made the least noise in the world they would be after us in a minute.

I clap'd my hand under his coat and found them to be base goods: I said, I desire you will go before the constable of the night. Said he, I don't choose it. He seized my staff and was too strong for me, so he got away, and left his great coat which he had on his back, and two pieces of cloth in his pockets, his dog staid with the things.

            . On the 20th of June the prisoner came into my shop to look at some muslin, my servant shew'd her some, and ask'd her 4 s. 6 d. per yard, but she wanted to see some more. I was in the middle of the shop and had a suspicion of her, and watched her very narrowly. She call'd for a stool, saying, she was lame. In looking over the muslin she shuffled up her petticoats and conveyed a piece under them. She seem'd presently after to be in a great deal of confusion, then put her hand to her pocket and shuffled the piece down again, so got off the stool and took it up and laid it on the counter again. She said, she wanted enough for four neckcloths. My servant cut off six yards, and said, it came to 24 s. She laid down a shilling, and said, she would call by and by, and went away. I fetch'd her back and search'd her, but found nothing upon her. She had 24 s. in her pocket, which she said she would give me rather than go before my Lord-mayor.</p>

            . The prisoner came into our shop the 19th of June and desired change for a 36 s. piece, saying, he had been all over the neighbourhood and could not get it chang'd. I ask'd him if a guinea and a half and the rest in silver would do. He said, not so well. At first he said, if I would lend him eight shillings he would leave the 36 s. piece with me, and pointed to a coach that stood empty, saying, he wanted it to pay the coachman. I laid down a guinea and told out fifteen shillings upon the counter, he took it up: then he said, be so good as to let your little boy go with me for the 36 s. piece; saying, here boy, take the change, and gave it him. I said to the boy, go with the gentleman. My husband was at the next door but one, and I sent to him as soon as they were gone.</p>

               <p>Crowder. I live with Mr. Hancock. This day fortnight the prisoner came to our window and look'd in, and ask'd my mistress, if she would be so good as to change him a 36 s. piece. My mistress said, will a guinea and a half do and the rest in silver? He said, it would not so well, because he wanted to pay his coach hire. She counted the money down. He said, be to good as to let the boy go along with me, and I will give him the 36 s. piece. My mistress said, go along with the gentleman; so he put the money in my hand and I went with him. At the turning of the corner he ask'd me for the money, but I did not give it him readily. He said, D - n you, you dog, give me the money. He took it as quick as he could out of my hand, and bid me stay there and not stir away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you willing he should have the money?</p>
               <p>Crowder. I refused it him, till he took it. Presently my master came to me, the prisoner ran as fast as he could up the street. My master ask'd me, whether that was the man. I could not forbear crying, but said it was, as well as I could. My master ran after him and took hold of him, I saw him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose fight of him from the time he took the money out of your hand, to the time your master took hold of him?</p>
               <p>Crowder. No, I did not.</p>

I had been at Harrow-on-the-Hill, and from thence to Edgar, to buy wood, and came home about eight o'clock. About a quarter before nine we went to supper, then I went to the alehouse, next door but one, to get a pint of beer; I went in but drank none; my maid came in and said, Sir, you must come home this moment. I ran immediately, my wife was at the door, she said, I am afraid that man is a sharper, pointing to the prisoner, he then was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175107030009"/> within two hundred yards of me. She told me what she had done, and wished I would go and see he did not trick-the boy. I saw him all the way till I came there, and saw him stop the boy, but what he said to him I cannot tell. He laid fast hold on his hand, the boy turn'd back and cry'd, and the prisoner ran away as fast as he could towards Audley-street, he was got a good way beyond the coach. I came up to the boy and said, is that the fellow? I did not stay for an answer but run after him, and laid hold on him in Audley-street. He said, what do you want? d - n you. Thirty six shillings, said I. Here it is, said he, and gave it me. Said I, I will know who you are, and what you are. Said he, do you know what you have done? you have compounded a felony. I got assistance and took him into an alehouse. He said, you don't know who I am, if you did you would not play these tricks upon me. He offered me five hundred pound bail. There was a man came to me in a ruffled shirt, but his cloaths were very ragged, who said, he would produce me five hundred pound bail. Said I, where do you live? He did not choose to tell me. Said I, it is true you have a ruffled shirt, but you have no breeches. All I could get of him was, he was a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask the boy, whether I did not desire him to go with me to a gentleman that wanted the change to pay me half a guinea; and if he did not make answer, take the money and go to the gentleman.</p>

Said he, if you will give me change for a 36 s. piece I will pay you; and bid me go and get it chang'd and he would stay there. I being in liquor went into the shop to ask for change for this piece, and she gave it me. I said, I had not the piece, the man that owes me the half guinea has got that. Said she, you look like a gentleman, I hope you will not go to cheat me; so I gave the money to the little boy. Going along I saw my friend take to his heels, so I took the money and ran after him.

There was a woman with a callimanco gown with her, she stood at the window, the prisoner was in about six minutes, and I saw her come out again with some things in her apron. I went immediately to Mrs. Jenny, and ask'd if she had lost any thing, she was above stairs, she went down and missed the things. Then we went and pursued the prisoner, and she was taken just as she was going to take water. She had on a stripe cotton gown, which I gave as a direction to apprehend the right person. She was brought back with the things in her apron.</p>

I took him up with an officer, and he confessed the fact. The first words he said were, pray, Sir, don't hang me, and I'll help you to one of your watches again. I had then not said a word to him. He said one of them was stop'd on Saffron-hill by Mr. Burchmore, to whom he offer'd to pawn it; and the movement of the other he had broke to pieces, and sold the silver for 7 s. 6 d. I took the boy with me to Mr. Burchmore's, who told me he believed the prisoner to be the boy who brought such a watch to him, which, upon advertizing, another boy came and claim'd, and he had accordingly delivered it to him. It was a very old watch, and the figures upon it were the same we make use of in Accounts; name, Nicholas Nibb, Oxford.</p>

I believe the prisoner is the same person that brought the watch to me; he brought it the 24th of May was twelve-month, and said his master lived in Hand-alley, Holborn, whose it was; he went accordingly, but did not return. I kept it till Monday, and then advertised it. He produc'd the Advertiser in which it was. About six weeks after, a young fellow came swearing and damning to my shop, and said, he'd prosecute me if I did not deliver it, it being his, at the same time describing it. I told Mr. Bradford then, and so I say now, that I am willing to satisfy him for it, it being my fault in delivering it.</p>

            . I issued out warrants, and advertised the things the 16th of May. Mr. Barlow came to me the next morning, when I went to Mr. Huntley's brother to see if I could get any of the other spoons to compare with it, which I found it exactly answered. I gave them 11 s. 3 d. which he gave for it. After five or six days I got intelligence that some of the things were pawned at one Mr. Mennil's, who had lent 9. 6 d. upon three spoons, the two salts, and pepper box, which I took out. The prisoner was taken up, and being accused with the fact, owned she had pawned these three articles.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Huntley. The first time I saw the prisoner was the 11th of May, when she came to me at Edmonton as I sat at the door, ask'd me if I wanted any matches, and begg'd some small beer. I got up and drew her some. When she had drank it, she ask'd me if I would have my fortune told? (the prisoner went under the character of a Gypsy.) She told me it would be a very lucky house to me, and told me also that there was money, upwards of 70 l. buried in the cellars. She named twenty-five large pieces of gold, some large pieces of silver, three gold rings, silver spoons, and other things, which were buried by an old man and woman, and that they were buried there for me, and that I was the person who was to have them. She then went away, saying she would be with me again on Tuesday. Accordingly she came when I was in the fore room, but only asked for a little small beer, and went away, having no opportunity of speaking to me then. She came again the next day, when she told me about the money, what quantity there was, and that I must get a quantity of silver or gold, four or five pounds value, and put into my right side pocket till such time this money was brought.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when you had this Talk?</p>
               <p>S. Biginton. We were in the kitchen: she was to come again the next morning, which she did, a few minutes after six. I let her in again, and brought the plate, eight large silver table spoons, two tea spoons, a pair of silver salts, and a silver pepper box, and put them on the table before her: she took the spoons in her hand, and wrap'd them in a cloth which she brought; I put in one salt and the pepper box, and then she roll'd the cloths up round, and ordered me to go and put some salt in the fire. When I came again the cloths were rolled again, and I put the other salt in. Then she ordered me to get a piece of packthread, with which she tied it up at the end where the spoons and salts were, as I thought. After that she told me I must get a parcel of linen of all sorts to put this into, and that they were better than to put it in my pocket. Accordingly I went and got some linen, and she put it in amongst it, tied them up, and put the parcel into the cellar. I went with her, and she told me I must not go near it till she came again, which would be in about two hours. She went away about seven o'clock, but not returning, I let the things lie till about eleven, at which time they would be wanted for dinner; but when I untied the parcel to take out the plate, there was nothing in the cloth but a wooden spoon, a flint, a steel, and some powder, I believe it was gunpowder; it was tied up as it was she left it. Upon this I made a discovery, and my mistress wrote a letter, and sent it away.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again after this?</p>
               <p>S. Biginton. I saw her again last Wednesday in prison; but as soon as she saw me she went away.</p>

I went up to them as fast as I could, saying, consider, gentlemen, what you are go ing about is a thing of a very dangerous consequence, and you are both; I suppose, in liquor, and when you are sober you will be sorry for it. Capt. Sowle said he'd take my advice, and so put up his sword. Then the deceased whispered to him, but what they said to each other I cannot tell. Capt. Sowle said to him, as you persist upon it, I'll meet you in Hide-park at four o'clock. The other said, there is no time like the time present, and insisted upon satisfaction then, Capt. Sowle bid him a good morrow, and walk'd away from him, but the other followed him with his sword drawn in his hand, saying, damn your soul, several times, you are a coward like the Core you belong to. They walk'd about sixty or seventy yards from me, and he seem'd to give aggravating language. Then Capt. Sowle drew his sword, and they went to it; I ran up to them as fast as I could, and call'd to them for God Almighty's sake to give over. I saw the captain receive a wound in his left arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you endeavour to prevent this before?</p>
               <p>Malcomb. I had not my sword or stick with me, the evidence is a soldier. I went in between them, and Capt. Sowle withdrew, I catch'd at their swords, and twisted Paschal's out of his hand, and then going to Capt. Sowle, he let me have his without any resistance. Paschal ask'd me for his sword again, and said, are you going to rob me? I said, no, I had a spirit above that, and that I had a great mind to break both the swords, for I could stand by so doing. He ask'd me for it a second time, and I told him, I took him to be a gentleman of honour, and if he would promise to use it no more at that time I would give it him, which he did, and I put it into his scabbard myself, saying, if he had been kill'd it was his own seeking, because he insisted to fight the gentleman. He said, let the consequence be what it will, I heartily forgive the gentleman. There were then four or five people about them. Capt Sowle ask'd me to help do up his arm, and if I had a room thereabouts.  I carried him to my room, and call'd up my wife, who wash'd him, and tied up his arm. Then he refused me to go and enquire for the deceased, when I did, but he was gone. At that time I did not think he was hurt at all, seeing no blood.</p>

               <p>Q. What size man was Paschal?</p>
               <p>Malcomb. He was a tall, thin gentleman, taller than the prisoner, and seemed a stronger man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any other wound the prisoner had, besides that on his arm?</p>

             with him. They went into a parlour in the back part of the house, and stay'd there some little time. While they were there, I went up stairs to put on my coat. I just ask'd Mr. Paschal whether he would have his slippers, and thinking he was going to bed, I did not ask him any farther questions, nor did he say any thing to me. When I came down they were both ready to go out. I heard no words of difference pass, but out they went together. I knew nothing farther of it till Mr. Paschal came back, about half an hour after eight. When he came in I was called down into the fore parlour, where I found him sitting in a chair: he pull'd up the flap of his waistcoat, and said he had a little scratch ; it was in the lower part of the right side of his belly. He said he was in good spirits, and behaved the gentleman. He thought he was not at all hurt, and looked upon it as a thing of no consequence. His shirt was no more bloody than what it might have been by the scratch of a pin, (tho' it bled inwardly we found afterwards.) I prevailed upon him to go up to bed, and desired he would permit me to send for a surgeon, but he would not; notwithstanding that I sent for one Mr. Pinkstone, but when he came, the deceased would not permit him to do any thing to the wound, so he went away again. About one or two o'clock he began to be faint, when he admitted him to be sent for again, but then I was not at home, so can say nothing to it. This was on Monday morning, and he died on the Wednesday following ; There were several other gentlemen that attended him during that time.</p>

            . I am waiter at St. Alban's tavern, in St. Alban's-street. Mr. Paschal was in a club there on Sunday night, the 5th of May. About 12 o'clock, or a little before, Capt. Sowle came to the same company.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober?</p>
               <p>Roper. He was fuddled. The company staid till near four o'clock in the morning, and left Paschal and the captain by themselves. They staid near an hour, and were hiding their money under hand. The door stood a-jar, and I was at it, but hearing them get up to go away I went in, and heard Mr. Paschal say to the captain, I'll go where you dare not go. They went down stairs together, and so out of doors. Capt. Sowle offered to have a chair which was at the door, but Paschal took him by the arm, and they went up the street together. I look'd after them, thinking there was something amiss. I observ'd Capt. Sowle had a sword, the other had not.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you seen them in that company before?</p>
               <p>Joyant. I have seen Paschal there before in that company, but don't remember I ever saw Capt. Sowle in that company before, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see them together before?</p>
               <p>Joyant. I don't remember I ever did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think Capt. Sowle had went in the chair if the other had not prevented him?</p>
               <p>Joyant. I think he would, had not the other took hold of his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Capt. Campbell?</p>
               <p>Joyant. Yes, sir, he was the last person that went out of the room, and left them together.</p>
               <p>Fleming Pinkstone. I attended the deceased on this unhappy occasion. I went to him on Monday about nine in the morning, the gentleman of the house shewed me his bed, and I opened the curtains and said, sir, how do you do? He gave me out his arm, and said, do I want to be let blood? Said I, if you have no complaint, I don't think this pulse will admit of the loss of blood, but, continued I, I hear you have other complaints, if you have, pray shew me. No, said he, if I don't want bleeding I am your humble servant, good morning to you. I went into the next room, and said, what shall I do in this case? The gentlewoman desired me to come again when a friend of his would be there. So I went away, and was sent for again between twelve and one. Then the deceased laid open the bed, and turning up his shirt, I saw a small puncture in the lower part of his belly, on the right side, upon which I took my probe, and found it passed into the cavity quite through. He then complained of a violent pain on the point of his left shoulder, and I found a great anxiety about him. I went into the next room and told the gentlewoman of the house I was afraid it was a thing of great consequence, and desired to have a consultation ; then I went and desired the deceased would name a person; upon which he ask'd me what I thought of Mr. Andrews. I answered I thought very well of him, and should be glad to have him there. Accordingly he was sent for, and came in about 15 or 20 minutes. While he was sent for I sat on the bed-side, and ask'd him how this came; but he seemed to decline that, and turning about said, I don't know who gave it me, but I am sure he is a gentleman. When Mr. Andrews came we consulted what was proper, and dress'd him in the usual manner. Mr. Andrews going out of town, and I finding him worse, called in Mr. Hawkins, but he died on Wednesday in the evening; after which I open'd him, and found the wound had passed through the cavity into the abdomen, and opened the left iliac vein, the consequence of which was a great extravass of blood. I am certain that wound was the occasion of his death.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the deceased say any thing else?</p>
               <p>Pinkstone. I don't recollect he said any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lay the blame on any body?</p>
               <p>Pinkstone. If I understood him by his behaviour he seem'd to be extremely chagreen'd with himself, especially when I came first in the morning he seem'd very uneasy, and continued so thro' the whole, being very fullen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>My lord, the deceased was almost a stranger to me, for I never had seen him but once before. It was by accident I went into that company. I have since heard Mr. Paschal was very unhappy in his liquor, and a very quarrelsome man. The treatment he gave me was very exasperating, following me with a drawn sword, which obliged me to draw in my own defence. I am very sorry for the event. I have a great number of gentlemen here to prove I am no quarrelsome man, or any thing of that sort. I received the first wound on my shoulder which threw me backwards, and I must have been on my back, had it not been for some rails; the second would have been in my body, had I not taken it into my arm; and the third was the unhappy one which I am exceeding sorry for.</p>

               <p>Campbel. I was with him once when he seemed to give a great deal of uneasiness to a company, yet I could not conceive by his speech he was in liquor; I never knew him but that time so quarrelsome.</p>

               <p>Campbel. I have been very often with him, and I never heard or saw he was in the least quarrelsome either sober or in liquor; I have been in company with him when we have drank pretty freely; I went to the deceased a second time; the next day he told me, with a great deal of chearfulness, he had had a fine sweat and was pretty well, and said he had heard from Captain

               <p>Campbel. Mr. Paschal was stronger and taller a great deal than the Captain.</p>

               <p>Ferguson.

            . I am a surgeon, an apprentice to Mr. Harrison ; this girl was brought to the London hospital to be examined by the surgeons about a week ago; she had been there two or three times before, this was the last time; upon examination<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175107030017"/> we found she had a gonorrhoea, that is what is commonly called a clap; there was no laceration, or any thing else but the running.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any penetration?</p>
               <p>Tompson. There had been none, no man could penetrate her body, she is of too tender an age for that; it was the opinion of all the surgeons there had been no penetration.</p>
               <p>Q. Could a gonorrhoea come without a penetration?</p>
               <p>Tompson. It might come by an impure cohesion.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been apprentice?</p>
               <p>Tompson. I have served six years of my time. Upon this deposition the girl was not admitted to be sworn, the prisoner was <rs id="t17510703-21-verdict106" type="verdictDescription">

Mr. Tombs, the constable of St. Margaret's Westminster, sent us word we might see it if we came to him, he had advertised the watch before; my father and I went and swore to the watch; the constable asked me if I thought I should know the man; I said I should; we went to the Gatehouse, and from amongst a number of people I pitched upon him directly, I am certain of him.

               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this done indecently to the young woman, or using her roughly?</p>
               <p>Steping. It was done in such a manner that I really thought he was acquainted with her, it was nothing indecent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she go with him freely?</p>
               <p>Steping. She and he went up to the deceased together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she go up to him for protection?</p>
               <p>Steping. I did not observe it was for that.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you understand by that expression about dust ?</p>
               <p>Steping. I understood Passmore meant don't let us have a quarrel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the deceased strike the prisoner first?</p>
               <p>Steping. I think the prisoner received a blow on his arm, and then he immediately returned it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think Westmore was in liquor?</p>
               <p>Steping. I really think he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you look upon Westmore to have been a healthful man?</p>
               <p>Steping. I believe he was a weakly man, a little blow might have knock'd him down.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been a strong man, do you think that blow could have knock'd him down?</p>
               <p>Steping. No, it could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner any thing in his hand?</p>
               <p>Steping. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe it was that blow that kill'd him?</p>
               <p>Steping. No, sir, I do not. I believe it was the fall that kill'd him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after he was dead?</p>
               <p>Steping. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the wound?</p>
               <p>Steping. It was on the right side upon the temple as I took him up there was a bump arose.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know whether it was by the blow or the fall ?</p>
               <p>Steping. I go by what the surgeon said that bleeded him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Passmore a right or a left handed man?</p>
               <p>Steping. I believe he is a right handed man.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the blow fall?</p>
               <p>Steping. I believe it fell on the jaw.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they faceing each other?</p>
               <p>Steping. They were, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. How near did you stand?</p>
               <p>Steping. I stood within a yard of the deceas'd.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was this?</p>
               <p>Steping. It was between ten and eleven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the moon shine?</p>
               <p>Steping. It did.</p>
               <p>Q. Which hand did the prisoner give the blow with that knock'd him down?</p>
               <p>Steping. With his right hand on the deceased's left side. I believe both the blows were given on the jaw.</p>

            . I went into the Temple-walks to see the fire-works, and just as the clock struck ten we look'd for them: as I stood there this gentleman came up to me and took me round the waist, and ask'd me, if I would go take a walk or a run, or drink a glass of wine. I refused him, he pull'd me, and I gave a stagger, which might make the other witness believe I was consenting. Mr. Westmore desir'd he would let me alone, saying I belong'd to him. The prisoner said, I did not, I was his cousin. The deceas'd said, I was no cousin to him, and he would take me home as he brought me out: with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175107030019"/> that the prisoner went very civilly away. He came round again and pull'd Mr. Westmore by the wig, he had taken a little walk in the walks between. Just as he pull'd him by the wig I saw one of the fire-works go up at Cuper's garden, I turn'd round and saw only the blow given by the prisoner, which knock'd Mr. Westmore down with his right hand. I went for a surgeon to bleed him, then I saw him home, and after that I saw his head opened: his scull was crack'd just above the temple, where was a great bump on his head.</p>

            . I am a surgeon : On Wednesday was se'night, about half an hour after ten o'clock, I was call'd to bleed the deceas'd in the Temple, where I found him lying insensible. After I had bled him I sent for another surgeon, and we agreed to lay the scull bare ; there we found a breach about an inch long above the temple bone, and likewise a depression on the right side the head. I apprehend that fracture was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>To his Character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Howard. I have known the prisoner about four years, he has been a kind of a servant to me, and used to shave me and do my wigs. I always took him for a person of a very peaceable disposition, very unlike to run into any quarrel. He is a person of sobriety. I never saw him in liquor in my life; an honest person, I would have trusted him with any some of money, and a good natur'd fellow. I don't think he would, knowingly, kill any man in the world, under any provocation.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dryle. He has attended me in the manner he has Mr. Howard. I think him a man very unlikely to commit any crime of this sort, I don't think he would begin a quarrel. I have heard the trial, and don't think, upon these circumstances, he intended to kill the deceas'd.</p>

They gave me some saucy answer, so I laid hold on the prisoner and deliver'd him to the constable. Said the prisoner, I wish you had taken him that was along with me, you had then done the trick; and added, there is but one thing can hurt me; that was, that he and two or three more robb'd two people in two different haycocks, one of the men had a woman along with him. I took him to Bridewell, the prosecutor came and challeng'd him with the breeches, and 8 s. 6 d. Said the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175107030020"/> prisoner, how can you say so much?

             I have known the prisoner five years, I then lived in High-street, St. Giles's: I dealt with Mr. Clayton, a butcher, in Hanover-yard, and the prisoner was the man that frequently brought my meat home. Clayton used to buy tea, and things of me, I know it was about Midsumer 46, I first knew him for that reason. I used to go to Sturbidge fair, and I had bought a parcel of snuff that was not good so I was going to Bristol fair; Mr. Clayton being a merry man I ask'd him to go with me; that fair begins the 25th of this instant, at that time the prisoner liv'd along with him. I went to Sturbridge fair about the fourth of September, coming back again about the 27th, for I went round to Bury and New-market, the prisoner told me he came from Norfolk, so I used to give him a dram and talk with him. I have a small estate in Northampton-shire, and another in Warwick-shire, and I have a little lordship in Buckingham-shire, I went to receive my rents, and would fain have taken the prisoner with me. When I came back, which was in about six weeks time, he was gone from his master.</p>

            . The first time I ever saw this paper was the very day I wrote it; Mrs. Cohuan was then living; I wrote it, and left it upon the table to be perus'd by the parties the 24th of Nov. 1749. I wrote it from a copy.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not your name subscribed to it as a witness ?</p>
               <p>Delaclose. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you subscribe your name to it?</p>
               <p>Delaclose. It was the 6th or 7th of December Mr. Jurdan g ave it me, and said Mrs. Cohuan was dead, and that she had sign'd the same will. So I set my hand to it at his desire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her sign it?</p>
               <p>Delaclose. No, I did not, my lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you then put your name to it?</p>
               <p>Delaclose. Because I was drunk, I was wrong in that, but they plied me with wine, and every thing of that nature, in order to sign it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when you sign'd it?</p>
               <p>Delaclose. At the prisoner's house, but I told him if there was any dispute in the commons I would never appear to swear to it. He said there would be no dispute there at all, as there are but a few houshold goods in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is the other subscribing witness?</p>

Some time in November, 1749, Jurdan came to me and desired me to go to the Commons with him: we went to Mr. Holeman a proctor there, and left this will upon his table to be made use of in the Commons: Mr. Jurdan and Mr. Holeman went to the office, but what he swore I cannot tell; they left me in the room till they came back again.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when he delivered it to Mr. Holeman?</p>

               <p>Delaclose. There was room enough, and I was drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. If you was drunk, how came you to remember your name was above?</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Holeman, the proctor; this will was in Mr. Holeman's hands. Mr. Jurdan came there one day for an administration of this woman as a creditor without a will; I ask'd him if he knew any next a-kin? He said there were some relations. Then Mr. Holeman advised him to enter a caveat which was entered the 7th of December, 1749. I was by. He came again about a week after along with Delaclose, the witness to the will. Delaclose pull'd this will out of his pocket, and said it was the last will of Mrs. Cohuan. The prisoner did not say any thing about it, Delaclose speaking every thing for Jurdan. The prisoner could not speak English, so it was to be proved in Jurdan's name; he is the sole executer named in it; Delaclose said he wrote the will with his own hand, and had had it in his possession ever since the death of the woman.</p>

             took the money up, and we went into the fields. There were eight people or upwards against him and I. The deceased and the prisoner fought, fair boxing, what we call so, about twenty minutes : the deceased fell on his side, and before I could get him up all the company turned to the right hand and left us to ourselves. There were two men to assist me in carrying him to the White Hart in Windmill-street, Tottenham-court Road, where he never spoke above a word or two, which was to ask us to carry him to the vault, which we did, but brought him back as he went. I got a coach and put him in it, but he never spoke a word afterwards. I myself was used very ill, and suffered as much as he, save losing my life.

I saw the two shake hands twice before they went to it; they fought about twenty five minutes. I had not an opportunity of seeing the whole of it, but I saw two falls, once the prisoner fell upon the deceased with his knee in his guts, which the company cry'd out shame on; but they fought a long time after that.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I saw the deceased the night he came home. I inspected the body after he was dead, and found a puncture on the right scrotum. I open'd his body by the desire of the jury, but did not open his skull; the parts of the body were all found and well, only putrified by the extravasated blood. There were some external bruises, but none but the fracture had gone far in: there was a large contusion on the scrotum; his head was contus'd violently, and there were two great wounds upon it. I imagine the fracture was owing to the fall, as it seem'd to be done by the round end of a stone about the breadth of a shilling, which fracture I look upon to be the cause of his death.</p>

            . I was the first that came into the field; I gathered the loose bricks that lay about and threw them at a distance, and cleared a place to fight in; the ground was dry and prodigious hard; when they first engaged the prisoner made a blow at the deceased, and retired I believe near ten or twelve yards, staggered and fell; the deceased followed him up and waited for his getting up again; my opinion is that by this means they might get amongst more brickbats, and by the fall he might receive his damage.</p>

            . On the 11th of June the rejoycing-day, Dann the baker came and asked me if I would go upon the scamp with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Chailes. This was opposite the Fox in Drury-lane; he brought me a little lower down the lane; I said I had no arms. Holland and his wife were there, and she gave Holland a pistol which she took out of her bosom, and gave Dann the baker a hanger.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Chailes. This was about eight o'clock at night. Holland said he heard there was to be a masquerade at Marybon-gardens that night, and was in a hurry, saying we should have no chance; he made us run almost all the way, and said, that those who did not go home now, would stay all night. We met with nothing going thither; on coming back again he brought us a new way in the fields, where we heard people talking: we met a man with a lanthorn, who said he was prepar'd for us, so we did not attack him.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Chailes. I guess it was betwixt ten and eleven o'clock. Then Holland said, we can do nothing in London streets till between twelve and one. We heard the clock strike one as we were coming down Tyburn-road, where we stop'd a gentleman, and desired him to deliver; he said, he had no money but his ring.</p>
               <p>Q. Where abouts in Tyburn-road was this?</p>
               <p>Chailes. It was about half way from St. Giles's pound to the gallows. Then we went on farther<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175107030029"/> and came to Prince's-street, hard by Leicester-fields, and met a gentleman there; Holland was the first man, and I went last; I cannot rightly swear to his face, but I believe the prosecutor to be the man. Holland desir'd him to stand, saying, if he made any noise he would blow his brains out, and put a pistol to him; the gentleman never spoke a word. Then Dan the baker, and Holland ran to his pockets, the baker handed to me the pocket-book behind him, and I put it into my pocket; there were a case and some notes in it, but I did not examine them at that time. I stood behind Holland's back, and what they gave me I took; they gave me no money. Going to Grosvenor-square Holland said he had got but 6 s. 6 d. and gave me 2 s. for my share; he also gave Thorowgood 2 s. There was a pocket-piece which we took to be gold, and went to a stone at a gentleman's door and rubb'd it. Holland said to me, keep the pocket-book till To-morrow when we go out again, and I'll keep this, when we will share it. The piece was not so large as a shilling, for we compared them together, and one side of it was a little like that of a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. to P rosecutor. Had you such a piece about you?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had a piece of foreign coin about me, it was silver.</p>
               <p>Chailes. After we had divided the money we walk'd about the streets till day-light, when Holland said we had better go home, which we did, but were to meet next day in Drury-lane. Dann and I went together, and we were to give an account whether there were any bank notes in the pocket-book. Dann told me he'd get me a lodging, so we went to Newtoner's lane, and knock'd up the people of a house, and a woman came down and let me in, but would have the money before-hand, so we gave her 3 d. each, and got a candle. Dann ask'd me for the pocket-book, which when we open'd we found a letter, this he burnt, and there was a note which he did not burn; there were two pieces of sealing-wax also, red and black, he kept the red and gave me the black, and I kept the pocket-book. The next morning when we went down stairs he wanted to ease himself, so he tore the note in two and used half of it; I wanting to do the same he gave me the other half, which I kept. Then we went to Clare-market, and got a kidney and sweetbreads, and in Drury-lane I happen'd to meet with

            , who said, what the Devil did you go out last night with Holland, he will hang you, he made himself an evidence once before? See No. 19, in last Kingston-assize paper. This made me so afraid that I went directly to one Mr. Stanley, and told him I had been out the night before with Holland and Dan the baker.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason you went and told this?</p>
               <p>Chailes. Because I was afraid I would be hang'd, so I told Stanley they were to meet me in Drury-lane that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Stanley live?</p>
               <p>Chailes. He lives in Rosemary-lane; he and two or three more went and took them in the place where we were to meet.</p>
               <p>Q. from Holland. Can that evidence produce any body that ever saw me in his company?</p>
               <p>Chailes. Dann the baker brought me into his company, I never was in his company before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Dann the baker?</p>
               <p>Chailes. I have known him two months, and have drank with him at the Crown in Russel-street three or four times : he used to serve my uncle with bread, who keeps a cook's shop in St. Giles's. I have also drank with him at the Fox in Drury-lane.</p>

            . About the 12th of last June the evidence, Chailes, came to my house: he sent up stairs for me, and when I came down he told me he had a thing to reveal to me, hoping I would be of service to him; upon this he put his hand in his pocket and pull'd out this pocket-book, and said, the night before he had been in company with Holland and Dan the baker, and they had robb'd a gentleman near Piccadilly of that book, a silver medal, and some small trifle of silver; saying he was told by one Pendigrast, that this Holland had made himself an evidence against some people he had been concern'd with before, and had hang'd them, and therefore he wanted to know of me how he could make himself a clear man, and get shut of such people, saying, he was told they were men that would hang any body. He showed me part of the note belonging to the gentleman he said they robb'd, and if I could get Holland I should find the piece of money in his pocket if he had not made away with it; he also told me Dan the baker and he went to a house in Newtoner's lane, and that Dan had torn the notes left they should come in evidence against them, and that he pick'd up the piece of a note. Then I told him the only way was to apply to a justice of peace, and give evidence in regard to what he had seen committed. Then he said he had parted that night in Leicester-fields, and they were to meet<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175107030030"/> at the Fox in Drury-lane at 11 o'clock. Accordingly I went, in company with Mitchel, Harris, and Penprise, and at the door we took them both, in company with some idle huffies, a little in liquor, and we brought them down to my house, at the ship in Rosemary-lane, where Penprise pull'd a silver medal out of Holland's pocket; and we search'd Thorowgood also, but found nothing upon him. When Thorowgood saw the pocket-book at my house, and I said here is the robbery quite plain, he said, I will go to justice of peace and make myself an evidence. He owned the fact, saying, he was along with Holland. Said Holland, hold your tongue, you'll do yourself no good. Holland, cursing and swearing, said, he could never be hang'd above once.</p>
               <p>Holland. When we were carried before the justice the evidence swore the pocket piece was taken out of his own pocket.</p>
               <p>Chailes. I did not, my information will tell to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Q. to Stanley. Did Chailes own before the justice it was taken out of his own pocket?</p>
               <p>Stanley. No, my lord, he did not. I was sworn before the justice, and I saw Penprise take it out of Holland's pocket.</p>

            . I have known Holland about a year. I was at Mr. Stanley's house when the evidence came there, and went with Stanley to the Fox in Drury-lane in order to take the two men; about eleven at night we took them, and carried them to Stanley's house, where, on searching them, I found this piece in Holland's pocket, and have had it in my custody ever since. They searched Thorowgood in another room, so I don't know what they found upon him. The pocket piece or medal, as it was called, produced in court.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I had such a piece of money as this in my pocket; but as it is a coin, there may be such another. It is like mine. It is, I believe, a Hungarian piece.</p>

            . I was at the taking the prisoners on the 12th of June at the Fox in Drury-lane. Dan the baker confess'd the fact, and desired to be made an evidence, provided he could go before the justice first of all. When he found Chailes was carried out to be made an evidence, he cried, I am a dead man, and if he is gone it does not signify any thing to carry me. Holland, at that time, said he was sick before the justice of peace; but he appear'd well and hearty, and swore at a prodigious rate.</p>

            . I was coming up Holbourn and I met Dodwell, an acquaintance of mine, the 28th of April last, he was executed at Tyburn among the last, there was another man along with him. Dodwell ask'd me, where I was going, and desir'd me to go with him. He stop'd at a door and desir'd me to stay there, so he and the other man went into a long entry.</p>

               <p>Cullen. I believe it was the prisoner at the bar, I never saw him before. They both came out again, Dodwell struck a light and had a dark lanthorn in his pocket: then Dodwell desir'd the man to stand at the door, and he and I went up the entry and he went in at a window: he handed out to me several things, some pewter dishes, some wearing apparel, and one saw; I put them down by the window, and handed some of them to the other man, but the watchman came and prevented us from taking them away.</p>

There were two women of the town passing their joaks as I went by, I said, I would charge the watch with them; then the prisoner said, he would assist me to secure them: as I did not secure them the prisoner said, I ought to give him something to drink in gratuity: then I said, I would make him drink, but we could not see a publickhouse open. We saw some pease-scop, and he said, he lik'd that better than drink, so we went in, he had some and I paid for it. Then we went on, and when he was in an alley near <placeName id="t17510703-45-crimeloc209">Horseshoe-alley</placeName>

               <p>Kirk. I had said, if I should meet any body that had a mind to rob me, I would shoot them before I would be robb'd. He went away with my half crown, a pair of scissers, one pair of silver buttons, and my pistol.</p>

               <p>Kirk. He put his hand into my pocket and took them out: He took out a pen-knife and a key, which he returned me upon my asking for them.</p>

(Produce in court, and examined by the jury.) The hat I found after they left me; I called out, watch, watch, murder, very loud.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say to you?</p>
               <p>Couty. I don't remember any distinct word they said to me; I know not how I came by my wig again ; I went home with my hat and wig too; it was a moon-light night, and two great lamps just by me, that I was able to distinguish the very men; five watchmen came after they were all gone away ; but before they came, a sentinel, who stood at Somerset-house gate, who I believe saved my life, pursued them with his bayonet fixed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go to the Gatehouse, and there had some difficulty to know the men?</p>
               <p>Couty. I made so little difficulty I knew them at the first sight, and I believe I could know the third person; he dogged me from Serjeants Inn to the Change not three weeks ago. I saw the advertisement of Justice Lediard within two or three days after this, so I went by myself to the Gatehouse; the man that keeps the Gatehouse shewed me a great many; said I, can you shew me no more? then he shewed me into a little room, there Masterson sat in one corner; I was satisfied in my conscience he was one of the men; after that I saw the other (Lawler) and was satisfied about him; then I went to Justice Lediard and described them, and his Worship was satisfied I knew them; he desired me to take his clerk with me another time, and see if I could point them out to him, which I did.</p>

            . On Saturday between the 25th and 26th of May I was sentinel at Somerset-house gates, from about the hour of ten till five in the morning, with my firelock on my shoulder; betwixt the hours of twelve and one I heard a call of watch; I went into the road, and stood to hear if I could find it out; after I had gone about ten yards I saw the two prisoners laying abominable blows on the gentleman, as I went towards them the gentleman called, murder; I said, here is assistance coming; I saw Lawler with a hat in his hand, he held another on his head at that time; I saw Masterson, he also had a hat on at that time; Masterson ran down the Strand, I turned him twice there; then he ran up Catharine-street; I having my gun in my hand and all my accoutrements about me they prevented my taking him, and I knew the consequence might have been bad had I left them behind me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175107030033"/>Q. Did you see them after this?</p>
               <p>Holmes Yes, my lord, I saw them at the Justice's in Westminster about a week after this thing happened; I described Masterson by his coat before I saw him there; I described the hat also before I came to the Justice, saying, it was a well-cocked up hat, which one had in his hand, and I described Lawler's person.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did they use the prosecutor?</p>
               <p>Holmes. They dealt multitudes of very violent blows upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. With what sort of instruments?</p>
               <p>Holmes. I saw a stick in Masterson's hand when I ran after him, and by the light saw something glitter before I came to him, but whether it was a sharp weapon I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was Lawler from the prosecutor when you saw him with the hat in his hand?</p>
               <p>Holmes. He was about three yards from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other besides the two prisoners?</p>
               <p>Holmes. I saw none but the two prisoners and the gentleman lying on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of this hat?</p>
               <p>Holmes. When I came back the gentleman had it in his hand, and his knuckles all over bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Where did you find your hat?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I found it about eight yards towards Somerset-house from where they knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you describe Lawler?</p>
               <p>Holmes. I said he appeared to be a shorter man and fresher coloured than Masterson; I said the person I chased was in a dark coloured waistcoat and stockings, and Lawler had a blue grey coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way was Lawler's face when you observed him?</p>
               <p>Holmes. When I saw the hat in his hand his face was towards me, and I said before the Justice, I had rather a greater view of Lawler's face than the other's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say you did not know the other witnesses ?</p>
               <p>Holmes. No, sir, I did not say so.</p>
               <p>To shew how they were armed, and in what manner taken.</p>
               <p>John Lee. I am a watchman; on May 28, between 12 and 1 in the morning, in a court near the prince of Wales's gate, I was attacked by two men, one passed by me, the other, which was Masterson, made a chop at me; I pursued him; he went down Little St. Martin's lane and flung his weapon away; before one o'clock I took him; his weapon was taken up by another watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him fling it away?</p>
               <p>Lee. No, Sir, I did not. This evidence shewed a cut on the right side of his head, which he received by the chop.</p>
               <p>Jos. Holmes. On the 28th of May at night, I was upon my duty as constable of St. Anne's parish, between twelve and one o'clock, going round the back part of St. Anne's church I heard an outcry by the end of Knaves Acre, several people crying out, stop thief; I turned up King-street, and three men rushed by my clothes; I followed them down Gerard-street, I went down Newport-alley, and took a watchman along with me; I turned into Cranbourn-alley, and in a passage there I saw three men run into the entrance that leads to the prince of Wales's back gate, I called, stop thief, and pursued them; one of them was down seemingly on one knee, I fell upon him, and called to two sentinels at the gate to come and assist me; I unbuttoned the prisoner's coat (it was Lawler) and took out this hanger, it was in a scabbard, I took him to the watch-house, and in a little time they brought in Masterson.</p>

I was sentinel at Leicester-house; about the hour of twelve at night I heard the cry, stop thief, the first man that passed me was Masterson with a cutlass in his hand; he made a blow at my comrade, I thought I heard somewhat fall; the next man that came was Lawler, I seized him by the collar; I had immediate assistance; the prisoner had a hanger by his side in a scabbard; (he produced a pocket pistol;) I found this pistol on the spot where Masterson made a blow at my comrade, loaded and primed.</p>

            . I was sentinel at the prince's back gates, I heard alarm and went out; Masterson came by with a cutlass flourishing it over his head, he made a blow at me; at the same time something dropped from him; after him came Lawler; my comrade and I seized him, we found a cutlass betwixt his two waistcoats; I asked him what he carried that for? he said for his own safety.</p>
               <p>Lawler's Defence.</p>
               <p>Here is the copy of my detainer, it is for stopping my prosecutor with an intent to rob him ( holding it in his hand;) now he has preferred a bill against us for a robbery; he said, he never heard us speak a word, but he believed when we struck him it was with an intent to rob him.</p>
               <p>Masterson's Defence.</p>
               <p>I heard him say the same before the justice.</p>
               <p>Lawler. I desire justice Lediard may be sworn and examined.</p>
               <p>Justice Lediard. Mr. Couty said before me, he was used in the manner he has describ'd, that he had lost his hat and wig, but he could not take upon himself to say, they had taken them from him, for he found them after the scuffle was over. The soldier went farther, he said, he knew Masterson extremely well, for that he had turn'd him two or three times: as to Lawler he was not quite so positive, but said, he was pretty certain he was one of them, and that he saw a hat in one of their hands; that he saw but two; and added, he believed the other might be run away.</p>

            . I am turnkey at the gate-house: Two or three days after the prisoners were committed, the prosecutor came and ask'd for three prisoners that Justice Lediard had committed; I said, there were not three persons committed for one thing in the goal, but said, he should see all the prisoners we had got; I shew'd him all, but he did not know either a one in particular, this was on the master's side; then he ask'd me, where are the three men? wanting me to show him the particular men; I said, he had seen them among the rest; they had stood all round, and he was within the door. Then he went back to Justice Lediard and brought his clerk, so I shew'd him them again, and the clerk whisper'd to him; and after that he said, now I know them; I ask'd him whether he was rob'd, he said no, he was assaulted, not rob'd, and shew'd me the cut in his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Give us an account of this affair when you went to the Gate-house.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I went to the Gate-house, and this very man shew'd me a great many prisoners, in a place going on the right side of the goal, but I saw none that I wanted; then said I, can't you shew me them that were brought in from Justice Lediard's? he said, that will not do (I then knew no better) then said I, can't you shew me more prisoners? so he shew'd me some more on the left hand side, there I saw the two prisoners, and my concience told me they were two of the men; I went to Justice Lediard's and acquainted him, that I had found out two of the men who had almost murder'd me.</p>
               <p>Justice Lediard. Mr. Couty came and said, they had shew'd him some of the prisoners, but refused to shew him all; but at last, said he, I saw two men, and describ'd their persons right; then said I, these are the two prisoners committed by me, so I sent my clerk with him; this Diamond, who is one of the turnkeys, I believe the jury will give but little heed to what he says, for the positively denied he had ever seen the prisoners in his life before, and I have been well inform'd they have been very frequently there before.</p>

            . I know Thompson, he lodged with me: on the 25th of May, being Whitson-Eve, he came home between eight and nine o'clock, I let him in, and he supp'd in the kitchin. We staid there till between eleven and twelve o'clock, then the maid lighted him up to bed, and I am very sure he could not get out of the house, for I had the key of the door with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he lodged at your house?</p>
               <p>A. Lewis. About three weeks, my lord.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was this?</p>
               <p>A. Lewis. It was on a Saturday.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175107030035"/>Q. By what do you recollect the day, to be so certain?</p>
               <p>A. Lewis. I buried my child that day, (I had lain in just a month.) and I paid for the coffin and shroud that day, and have the receipt by me, that is the reason I remember it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your child buried?</p>
               <p>A. Lewis. It was buried in St. Ann's parish : I have another child lies there.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got that receipt here?</p>
               <p>A. Lewis. No, my lord, I have not. I also know the day by having a prisoner then in my house, in a lockt up room, and I have the writ by which he was arrested. My husband is an officer.</p>
               <p>Mary Clark. I live servant with Mrs. Lewis: Lawler had lodged there about three weeks, or a month, before this thing happen'd. On the 25th of May, between eight and nine o'clock at night, he knock'd at the door, so my mistress got up and let him in; he went into the kitchin and sat down to supper; about eleven o'clock my mistress call'd to me to give him a candle to go up to bed, then I gave him one and he went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up with him?</p>
               <p>M. Clark. No, I did not, I saw him go up: Between eight and nine o'clock the next day he got up and came down stairs, and I know he could not get out, because my mistress takes the key up with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was up first that morning?</p>
               <p>M. Clark. I was up first.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the doors all fast?</p>
               <p>M. Clark. They were all very safe lock'd, my mistress had the key of the street door in her own chamber.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing remarkable in the family to cause you to be so certain of the day?</p>
               <p>M. Cark. There was nothing remarkable to my knowledge, to put me in mind of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there nothing remarkable?</p>
               <p>M. Clark. Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Mrs. Lewis's child dead?</p>
               <p>M. Clark. Yes, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that buried?</p>
               <p>M. Clark. I don't know whether it was buried the Whitson-eve, or the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. How old was that child?</p>
               <p>M. Clark. It was about three months old.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you live with her when she lay in?</p>
               <p>M. Clark. I did not, sir: I have liv'd with her about five weeks in all.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Lewis. How old was your child that died?</p>
               <p>A. Lewis. It was between two and three months old.</p>
               <p>Q. to M. Clark. Who was in the house besides your mistress, you, and the prisoner?</p>
               <p>M. Clark. There was a mantua-maker, and a prisoner.</p>
               <p>Jury. My lord, we would be very willing to pay the expence of a messenger to go and search the register-book of that parish, to be better satisfied about it.</p>
               <p>Q. to A. Lewis. What is your husband's name, and the child's name that was buried on Whitson-eve ?</p>

               <p>Mary Hall. I lodge at Mrs. Lewis's house: I am a mantua-maker, I go to work at eight o'clock in the morning, and come home at eight at night.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lodged there?</p>
               <p>Mary Hall. Ever since last Christmas: In the beginning of May my landlady told me, she had a lodger up one pair of stairs backwards, and that he said he was a sea-faring man: she went to inquire his character a day or two after, the people told her, he was a very honest man, and paid his way through: when he came to the house his name was Thompson, otherwise Lawler. I come home every night at eight o'clock, having odd jobbs to do at home: He came home always at very regular hours, and always very sober; he used to ask the maid for a candle and go to bed: The last time I saw him was the Saturday before Whitson-eve, I had a gown to finish for a gentlewoman that was going to Uxbridge on the next morning, which was Sunday: my landlady, that evening, ask'd me to eat a bit of cold lamb, the prisoner, and a prisoner that was in the house were at supper; after supper I heard the prisoner ask the maid for a candle to go to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the evening was this?</p>
               <p>Mary Hall. I can't say what time, it could not be very late or very early, I never saw him after that time; three or four days after that my landlady said, he was in trouble to her great surprize ; I am sure what I say is honest and the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lodged there?</p>
               <p>Mary Hall. It is almost from last Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to remember the day so particularly ?</p>

               <p>Q. Has she a young child now?</p>

               <p>Mary Hall. I came there the latter end of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that child born one, two, or three months ago? or a month or two months after you came there ? recollect, you must give an answer as near as you can.</p>
               <p>Mary Hall. I believe the child was born about Feb. or March.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it now living?</p>
               <p>Mary Hall. It was living when we came from home.</p>

After that we met two men on horseback and one on foot. My brother said to me, Jack, don't go any farther, let us cross over the stile, fearing they should do something to us; so I jump'd over the rails, and fell upon one of these bundles. I then call'd to my brother and said, here is something lying, let's see what it is ? and as he was coming to me he found another bundle. These other things he bid me put into my pocket, and we should see what they were when we came to the light, but we had not gone thirty yards before they stop'd us.</p>

            . I live in Oxford-road, and my husband is a watchman in Rathbourn-place. On the 29th of May I went to their house, and they used me very ill, so on the 30th I fetch'd a warrant for them; but they wanting to make it up with me, I went to see them on Whitson-tuesday in the evening at John's house. I supp'd with them, and staid till near twelve at night. They said as it was the royal-oak day, they would get some boughs, and go a bird-catching, but would first see me to Rathbourn-place; and as my husband had done calling the hour twelve I wish'd them a good night, and we parted there.</p>
