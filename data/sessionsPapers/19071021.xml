The wound was struck upwards and inwards in the direction of the heart. It had gone through the bag which contains the lung and had wounded the lung.

                  </persName>, 659, City. Just after five p.m. on September 16 I was on duty in King William Street. I heard someone shout, and saw a man fall in the road. Prisoner was driving a pony and cart, proceeding south; I twice shouted for him to stop, but he took no notice. I ran about 150 yards after him, and he then pulled up. I found he was drunk. I asked him if he knew what he had done, and he replied, "No." Leaving the injured man with another constable I took prisoner to the station; he was charged with drunkenly driving and injuring a man; he made no reply except to deny that he was drunk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I noticed in the street a waggon and a coster<lb/>monger's barrow; the waggon was in front of both prisoner's cart and the barrow. Possibly when I shouted prisoner did not hear me; this is not a quiet street at that time of the day. I had to help prisoner out of his cart. I judged him to be drunk because he could not pull his horse up properly; it was not properly under his con<lb/>trol. I know that he must have passed the Mansion House, where there is very heavy traffic, and plenty of police to notice drunken drivers. I do not say that prisoner was helplessly drunk. He told me he had only had some ginger ale and whisky, and that he was suffering from influenza; also hat he had been driving through the City for many years and had never bad an accident. Inquiries prove that he is a respectable, well-behaved man.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I judge he was drunk because when he was asked to get out he made no attempt to do so; also because of the attitude in which he sat in the cart; he sat in a kind of crumpled up posi<lb/>tion, and swayed from side to side.</p>

                  </hi>, costermonger. At the time Duke was knocked down I was with him with our barrow; we were going towards King William's statue, on the left side of the road. I was at the two handles; he was on the offside shoving me along. We were going along the street when a pony and trap came along, and the wheel hit Duke on the left-hand aide and knocked him down; he fell on the right; his head was cut on the right. The trap was going seven to eight miles an hour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Duke and I had been out from 10 in the morn<lb/>ing. It is the custom of costermongers who sell things from barrows to move from one side of the road to the other when they are observed by the police. We had been working King William Street. It is</p>

On September 18 Duke was admitted; he was suffering from three frac<lb/>tured ribs on the left side, with a slight bruising of the skin over the site of the fracture; he had pleurisy over the same area; and some small abrasions on the right side of the scalp; also he was in a con<lb/>dition of chronic bronchitis. He died on the 20th from syncope, from fractured ribs and pleurisy, and the bronchitis was undoubtedly a very important contributory cause of death. The main cause was the fracture, which was the result of a severe blow.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I am a salesman of horse and cattle. I have been accustomed to driving in the streets of the City for 45 years; this is the first time any sort of accident has occurred to me. On this day I first drove from my place of business a Walworth to the City Road; there I hid two ginger ales and Scotch whisky. From there I went to Highbury, and then was driving back to Walworth; I had no more drink that day. (Witness described the route he bad taken, and said he was several times held up by the traffic, so that he must have passed a number of constables.) At the Bank of England, on getting the signal from the policeman, I drove across into King William Street. When outside the Tube station there was in front of me a large three horse tandem waggon. I noticed a costermonger's barrow coming on the offside of the road towards the Bank. I was going very slowly; my pony is an old one and cannot go fast. All of a sudden the barrow whipped across the road and earns in front of me. The old man (Duke) ran across in front of the pony and I saw him stagger and fall on to the barrow; I never felt the least shock, and I am certain I didn't touch him. I passed on the offside of the waggon to get through the traffic; a three-horse tandem waggon is of considerable length. Just as I passed by the leader's head the policeman came up to my pony's head; I had not heard anyone shout. He said, "Do you know what you have done?" I said, "No, I don't"; he said, "You are drunk"; I said, "That's a lie; I'm not; I have not had sufficient to make me drunk or any one man"; he said, "Well, come along; you have knocked a man down; I must take you to the station." I am weak on the ankles;</p>

               <p>as I went to get hold of the dashboard my hand slipped and I went back again on to the seat. The constable said, "I can see you are drunk"; he got hold of me and helped me down. At the station I again denied that I was drank. I am 64 years old, and have never had any charge brought against me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. as I was pulling off to get round the waggon I saw the man stagger and fall, but I knew I had not touched him, and I did not stop; he may have suddenly become exhausted or lost con<lb/>sciousness.</p>

                  </hi>, overseer, Western Central Post Office. A letter posted at Godalming at about half-past 10 would arrive at the West Central office about 2.45 p.m. the same day. Prisoner would be making the 2.40 collection at that time. On September 30 he was in the office about 3.1 p.m. In the ordinary course the letter addressed to the "Winning Post" would have been delivered in Essex Street about 3.40 p.m. Prisoner was not the Essex Street post-man. The letter would be sorted by the postman who takes the 3.20 delivery out. Prisoner could have got access to the letter if he had wanted to. When the letters are brought in they are turned out on to a table and each postman sorts out his own letters. If the over seer's back is turned it is possible for a man to go to another part of the office.</p>

                  </hi>, messenger, General Post Office. On Octo<lb/>ber 1 I was keeping observation on prisoner. He left his home in Clerkenwell, about half-past nine, and after making a call in Theobald's Road went by 'bus to Holborn. Thence he went by bus to Stamford Street, Blackfriars Bridge, where he got on to a car going in the direction of the Elephant and Castle. I got on to the car too. He went into the post office in London Road and I fol<lb/>lowed him. There were two other persons in the office—a man and a woman. The man deposited some money and the woman purchased stamps. Prisoner stepped aside and let me go to the counter first. The other two persons were served before I was. I purchased a penny stamp. When I came out prisoner was left alone in the office. I watched at the door and saw the clerk cash three postal orders, one of them being the order for 2s. produced. There were also orders for 7s. 9d. and 5s. 3d., payable to James Burleigh.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. I was not likely to mistake you for anybody else. I had been watching you for a fortnight. When I was told off to watch you I was given the number on your uniform.</p>

                  </hi>, clerk in the secretary's office, General Post Office. I saw prisoner at the General Post Office on October 1, about four o'clock. I told him who I wag and that I was going to ask him certain questions which he could answer or not, but the answers would be taken down in writing and might be used against him. I showed him the three orders and told him I believed them to have been cashed by him that morning at the London Road Post Office. He said, "I never cashed them." I said, "You were seen to enter the London Road office shortly after 10 o'clock." He said, "I have never been in the office in my life." I then asked him to write at my dictation the names appearing on two of the postal orders, "J. C. Burleigh, London Road," and "John Craven Burleigh, London Road." Then he wrote his full name and address. In both instances he spelt Burleigh, B-u-r-1-i-e-g-h, the same as the orders had been signed. On October 11 he was arrested. The writing on the orders it very much disguised, but, from certain peculiarities, I am of opinion that it is the writing of prisoner.</p>

                  </persName>, 642, City. On the 3rd of this month in the early morning I was on duty is Arthur Street, and saw the two prisoners coming along King William Street. They stopped to examine the doorway of No. 49. Concealed on the opposite side of the street I saw Joseph, assisted by Frederick holding his legs, get to the top of the doorway and push the fanlight open, and get through into prosecutor's restaurant. Frederick ran up the street very quickly. I ran after him and brought him back to No. 49. There was nobody about at the time. On Frederick I found a tin opener. I gave Frederick in charge to another constable, and getting a ladder I entered the restaurant through the fanlight. I found the cash register had been removed from the counter, and placed on the floor on its side at the back of the premises. Prisoner Joseph I found concealed in the basement behind a wooden partition.</p>
               <p>To prisoner Frederick. I saw you help your brother through the fanlight.</p>

                  </hi>, manageress of the restaurant. The fanlight was left open 2 in. or 3 in. It is always left open at night for ventila<lb/>tion. I do not live on the premises. The cash is removed from the, cash register at night and looked up in a cupboard. The cash register is always left on the counter at night. In the morning it had been removed to the far end of the shop and placed on its side.</p>
               <p>The Recorder observed that prisoners were indicted for breaking: and entering a shop, hot if the window was left open that was clearly not a breaking. In the case of an ordinary cash window a person entering by raising the sash sufficiently to admit of him entering was not breaking into the house. This was decided in the case of Rex v. Stevenson (Moody's Crown Cases Reserved, 1, 1884 to 1837), where the question was whether prisoner had been properly convicted of housebreaking or should have been convicted of larceny only. The judges met in Hilary Term, 1828, and all said that there was no decision under which this could be held to be a breaking, and that they ought not to go beyond what had been decided unless the case was within some settled principle, which this was not.</p>
               <p>The Grand Jury being still in the building, the Recorder directed that a new bill should be submitted to them, charging prisoners only with larceny of the till, and directed a verdict of acquittal on the pre<lb/>sent charge. The above decision, he observed, no doubt had its origin in the distant times when men convicted of housebreaking were hanged and the fullest effect was given to any technicality which would enable a man to escape the dread penalty of the law, and the mere removal of the till from one place to another justified the conviction for larceny.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210014"/>
               <p>Upon the indictment for larceny the Grand Jury returned true bill.</p>
               <p>(Thursday, October 24.)</p>
               <p>Prisoners were brought before a fresh jury, the evidence being the same. Joseph again pleaded guilty.</p>

In passing No. 49 Joseph observed that the fanlight was open, and said, "I am hungry; I have got nothing to eat; I am going is here to see if I can get something." Then he climbed up the door and witness walked away quickly because he was frightened and wanted to have nothing to do with it. He was followed, and brought back by the constable as described.</p>

Frederick was employed from August last year till September this year by one of his own countrymen, but left in consequence of a dispute about money matters.

Burn distrained for rent, and Long and Co. now owe us £110 16s. 10d. for rent.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Frampton. £15 16s. 10d. is due on the third distraint and £95 for rent after Clifton left the premises. (To Mr. Elliott.) I do not know Goodman.</p>

                  </hi>, 65a, Oxford Street, broker. On December 12, 1905, I distrained on 10a, Soho Square, for £23 15s., rent due at Michaelmas, and put Edwards in possession. He remained in for 35 days, when the goods were sold to Watson, a nominee of Clifton. The distraint was satisfied by two payments, a cheque for £16 10s. by Goodman, which was returned dishonoured, and afterwards presented and paid, and a further payment. On March 6, 1906, I again put Edwards in possession for the Christmas rent, which was paid 28 days afterwards. On May 2 I put Edwards in possession for the March rent. He remained in 49 days, and the goods were sold on June 26 and did not realise the amount of the rent. Goodman called on me two or three times.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Elliott. Goodman called to see me about giving Clifton time and to talk the matter over. I think he said he would put the matter right if I held over. I gathered he was the financial man looking after Clifton.</p>

               <p>conducting the business. I saw and Goodman there on several occasions conversing with Clifton. In June, 1906, I was put in again and remained in for 49 days. Clifton was still there, and Goodman and Doig visited there. Martin took some books away on June 20 when the goods were cleared out; he brought a card from Clifton, "Please let bearer have the books," looked over the books and took some; the rest we left there. I have seen Ralli talking to Clifton in the street and in the house three or four times. During the second distraint five cases arrived; I did not see the contents, but the empty cases were left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Elliott. I thought Goodman was a cus<lb/>tomer. He came in like anybody else and appeared to be buying goods. I did not tell him what I was there for. (To Mr. Jones.) I have never seen Martin before or since he came for the books, about 15 months ago. I have no doubt he was the man who came. (To Mr. Frampton.) I saw once or twice.

                  </hi>, shirt dealer. In April, 1902, I started in business with Clifton as shirt makers under the name of Long and Co. at 10a, Soho Square, and in April, 1905, I left the business under an arrangement that I was to receive £50 as my share of the capital. I have not received any part of the £50. The business was then fairly solvent. The value of the stock and machines was about £120, the stock being not more than £20. I kept a complete set of books, I saw, cash-book, private ledger, and day book. We bad no stock book, as the material was sent in to be manufactured and then sent out again, and £20 would cover its value We had no dealings with Bruin Bros., of 65, Fenchurch Street, or with J.H. Vincent, of Mad-dox Street, or Market Place. I do not know either of those persons. I had never seen Vincent, Doig, Martin, Relli, or Moore before I saw them at Bow Street. Moore and nothing to do with the books. Good, man had done business with us to the extent of £40, but he had no interest in the business. Up to the time I ceased to be a partner the business was respectably conducted, and Clifton was, as far as I knew, a perfectly honest man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Frampton. I have known Clifton since 1900, so far as I know, as a respectable business man. (To Mr. Elliott.) Goodman came as a customer. We also had dealings with W.H. Cross, of 70, Fulham Road. (To Mr. Eustace Fulton.) The stock was disposed of quickly, simply coming in and being made up. At one time there might be a very small quantity and at another a large quantity.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. We never had more than £40 worth of stock at the outside at any time. (To the jury.) The partnership was for a period of three years, and was dissolved when that time was up.</p>

                  </hi>, dressmaker. In July, 1904, I began to work for Long and Co. at 10a, Soho Square and continued till June 1906. Knights was a partner with Clifton to April, 1905, after which Clif<lb/>ton carried on business alone to the same amount as before. There</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210018"/>
               <p>were three distraints for rent. About June, 1906, we moved to 26 Dean Street, Soho, when the business (which was still really Clif<lb/>ton's) was carried on in my name with the same customers for eight or 10 weeks, when I left. I left because the women made very funny remarks about their money—one woman was owed 5s.—and I as forewoman had to pay them. After Knights left I have seen Vincent and. Vincent used to come and leave a note for Clifton if he was not in. used to come every morning, and if Clifton was not there he would ask for Clifton's letters and if Clifton had left anything for him. On one occasion when Clifton was ill he opened Clifton's letters and read them. I have seen Martin two or three times. Once he came for a bale of long cloth, which he opened and took part of away. Ralli used to come occasionally in the morning and see Clifton, and they would go out together. Goodman came, not very often. He once spoke to me. I knew his voice by talking with him through the telephone. He would ring up four or five times a day and ask if any parcels had arrived; I would tell him and he would send up for them and get them. We had no typewriter at Soho Square or Dean Street—all letters were written. Knights kept the books till he left; afterwards Clifton kept them. The books were at Soho Square when we left. At Dean Street only one small book was used.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Frampton. I left Clifton in the summer of 1906 because one of the workpeople complained about 5s.; that was the only complaint. While I was there Clifton was a good em<lb/>ployer, and paid me and always paid his servants. The work was telephoned for and fetched. came on several mornings and asked for Clifton when he was out and then went away, and for some portion of the time came, nearly every morning. Once I handed him some letters. I handed something in a large envelope which Clifton had given me to give to him; it contained letters. I could not say if there was a writ. (To Mr. Elliott.) I should say I saw Goodman there up to a dozen times. He took no control; simply spoke to Clifton and asked for parcels. (To Mr. Paul Methuen.) I did not think there was anything wrong in the business being carried on in my name; there was no attempt to deceive anyone. Vincent left a note several times for Clifton. On two occasions he brought the note. (To Mr. Jones.) Martin came once for a parcel; I do not know what it contained. (To Mr. Eustace Fulton.) There were more than 20 workwomen and a great deal of work was done on material already cut. Sometimes we were busy and sometimes slack.</p>

In May, 1906, Martin called to view 6a, Stewart Street on behalf of Long and Co., shirt-makers. He said he thought the pre<lb/>mises would suit, and I afterwards received typed letter produced from Long and Co., of 10a, Soho Square, offering to take the place at £75, and referring me to J. Rowley, of 9, Teignmouth Road. I also</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210019"/>
               <p>had a telephone message referring me to Vincent and Co., wholesale mantle manufacturers, 4, Market Place. I wrote to them, and re<lb/>ceived type written letter produced, stating they bad done business with Long and Co. for some considerable time, and they had met their obligations properly. I also wrote to Rowley, and got a satis<lb/>factory reference. Both the typed letters have the peculiarity that the "p" is out of alignment. The references were submitted to the landlord; he instructed me to accept Long and Co. as tenants. An agreement was drawn up, which Martin called for, and which was returned to me by him signed by J. W. Clifton letting the place for three years at £75 per annum, and on May 30, 1906, I handed Martin the keys. I have received no rent whatever. Early in August I em<lb/>ployed Lewis to distrain. I had repeatedly visited the premises, cell<lb/>ing practically every day about the middle of July for the rent, and saw no business carried on whatever and no hands employed. Some<lb/>times the premises were locked up. Martin came every morning for the letters. I saw no goods on the premises. I saw Martin take a parcel away one morning. I understood he managed the branch for Long and Co. I went with Lewis to distrain. Martin and another man were there. There were no goods; there were some boxes which looked as if they had goods in them, but they were empty; there were two sowing machines. Ralli came to see me. He said he was very sorry I had taken that step; he was head traveller to Long and Co., and that the money should be paid; he asked for time, and said that Mr. Long was gone to Margate on a holiday, and that he was sorry he could not get into communication with him, as he did not know what hotel he was staying at. I said it was very peculiar for a principal to go away on his holiday without leaving his address. He said he would endeavour to find him, and afterwards came back and said he had telegraphed to Margate, and that Mr. Long had gone on to Paris. After five or six days, on his statement that Long was coming back in a few days, I took the man out on payment of expenses. The rent not being paid, I put Lewis in again in a few days, and the two machines were gone; there was nothing in the place but a cutting-table, worth about 2s.—nothing that would pay the expenses, and it was no use leaving a man there. Some three weeks afterwards I took possession of the premises. I told Martin I considered they were nothing but a pack of swindlers—a long firm. Martin simply shrugged his shoulders.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Frampton. I never saw Clifton. I believe I spoke to him on the telephone. I Was told P had missed Mr. Long by a minute. I bad never seen till after I had seen Ralli and Martin. (To Mr. Jones.) When I told Martin the affair was a swindle he said, "I am only the manager"—not messenger.</p>

                  </hi>, 374, Hackney Road, assistant bailiff to Goldstein. I was put in possession at 6a, Stewart Street, by Goldstein on August 9, 1906, and remained in for a week. I saw no business at all being earned on, and no one employed there. There were three sew<lb/>ing</p>

               <p>machines, two Singers and one Jones, which was in a damaged condition, three tables, and in the office there was a telephone and one chair and a costume stand. There was no cloth or materials of any description. Martin used to come in the morning at various times, take the letters, and leave. He stayed sometimes about an hour if he expected anyone to call, or he might say, "I shall be back again about three o'clock." Martin never told me what he had to do with the business—I always treated him as a principal in the firm.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jones. Martin did not commence by sweeping out the premises. I knew nothing about a strike of machinists in London.</p>

                  </hi>, managing clerk to May and Rowden, 27, Maddox Street, auctioneers. In February, 1905, we had the letting of the third floor of 20 and 22, Maddox Street, received an applica<lb/>tion from the Mercur Society, 65, Fenchurch Street, and the pre<lb/>mises were eventually let to Vincent by the assignment of a lease at £150 a year, possession being given in March, 1905. He gave re<lb/>ferences to Berg and Leslie, the Badminton Manufacturing Company, and Braun Bros., of 65, Fenchurch Street. We received satisfactory replies from all those. Braun Bros. wrote that they had had busi<lb/>ness relations with Vincent for some time, and that they considered him a most desirable tenant, fully in a position to pay the rent stated. No rent was paid, we put in a distress, and there was not enough realised to pay the expenses. We took possession in August, 1905. I never saw Vincent in the matter at all. Ralli came in February, 1905, as a friend of the gentleman from the Mercur Society; I did not connect him with the tenant. I think they had a tailor or two for a little while on the premises.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Methuen. Application was made by the Mercur Society on behalf of a Mr. Vincent, of 76, Brondesbury Villas. [To Mr. Moses.] I saw Ralli once in February, 1905, in reference to 20 and 22, Maddox Street. I could not say for certain that he did not call also in reference to the sale of a lease to Abner and Co., of Regent Street. I am quite certain he came with the gentleman from the Mercur Society. [To Mr. Elliott.) I never saw Goodman at all.</p>

Caldwell Moore, 142, Palmerston House. I received letter of October 25 signed "Long and Co., pp. J.W.C," stating they had known J.S. Vincent for a considerable time, and considered him quite able to pay the rent, and a similar letter from Moore. We let the premises to Vincent in November on his paying the rent up to Christmas under the agreement provided, signed by J.H. Vincent, and witnessed by John Ralli. We received no further rent, and the landlords subse<lb/>quently took possession.</p>

Vincent became tenant of part at a rental of £175, and paid three week's rent to Christmas, 1905. I made many applications for rent. Frequently I could get no reply, but on one or two occasions I saw a man who said Mr. Vincent was not in. I never saw Vincent I was in the same building and never saw any signs of business being earned on. We took possession at the end of July, 1906, when seven month's rent was due, none of which has been paid.</p>

                  </hi>, accountant to Jimenez and Sons, 65, Fenchurch Street, merchants. 65, Fenchurch Street is a large block of offices owned by my firm. On March 25, 1903, we let two rooms in a part of the building known as City Chambers, to Braun Bros., at £42 or £45 per annum. I knew one of the partners, Henry Mayer Braun; the other partner, I believe, was Shepherd, whom I did not know. Is August, 1904, we had to distrain for rent, and in September, 1904, a fresh agreement was made with Braun alone, trading as Braun Bros., his partner having left him. I think at a slightly increased real Only about £10 rent was paid, and on September 16, 1906, we took possession under a writ of ejectment. We found about halfs eaten men there—Goodman, and I believe Doig, and Ralli. They were having an altercation with our solicitor's clerk; they did not want to get out, wanted more time—they were packing up their goods and seemed very excited. They went away eventually. I saw Good<lb/>man several times about the time of the fresh agreement. I know Ralli's face very well from seeing him in the building—as I went from or to my office. I frequently saw him in the passages and corridor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Frampton. I cannot swear positively to seeing Doig. [To Mr. Elliott.] When we took proceedings in rela<lb/>tion to the rent we sued Braun Bros. I believe Mr. H.J. Mayer Brian was served with the writ. I knew him personally, and that to was carrying on business at these premises. I have no evidence that he was a fraudulent person, except that when we wanted the rent we could not find him. If you want my personal opinion of Braun I do not think much of him. [To Mr. Moses.] There are about 60 offices in 65, Fenchurch Street; I have seen Ralli in the corridor, and also in the office on the day of the ejectment.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been housekeeper at 65, Fenchurch Street since November, 1903. Braun Brothers then occupied two rooms on second floor Nos. 20 and 21. Their name was on the door and also the Mercur Society. I knew two partners of Braun Brothers; they were there till about the middle of 1904, when they were supposed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210022"/>
               <p>to have handed the business over to a man Darned Shepherd. I found out afterwards that was Goodman; he was pointed out to me by Braun as Mr. Shepherd. After the summer of 1904 one of the Braun brothers ceased coming there, the other came in occasionally for about three months. I have not seen him since. Goodman came nearly every morning. I have seen Moore come in and out about a dozen times. Vincent was there occasionally. Parcels frequently came and I took them into the office; some large parcels would be left downstairs. They were always removed in the course of the day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Elliott. I first knew the firm on Novem<lb/>ber 19, 1903, when I came as housekeeper. I thought they carried on business on the premises as general merchants. I knew Henry M. Braun as the head of the firm. I did not know any person named Shepherd except Goodman. I never heard Goodman describe him<lb/>self as Shepherd; he told me he was Goodman, and persons who called called him "Mr. Goodman." (To Mr. Grain.) I only saw Moore a very few times in the building—two or three times—I think not at all after Braun left. I thought Braun Brothers were carry<lb/>ing on a genuine business. (To Mr. Methuen.) Vincent came nearly every day and stayed long enough to do business—perhaps half as hour. If he was the first he would take the letters and open them, or parcels. I suppose he would open the letters as he took them when he came first. (To Mr. Elkin.) I used to get a signature for registered letters. I cannot say I ever got a signature from Ralli.</p>

                  </hi>, 140, Leadenhall Street, estate agent. In August, 1906, I had the ground floor and basement of 71 and 73 St. Mary Axe put into my hands to let. Ralli applied for an order to view other premises in St. Mary Axe, and an application subse<lb/>quently reached me from 71 and 73 on behalf of a Mr. Doig. of Palmerston House. References were given to W. R. Caldwell Moore, Palmerston House, and J.H. Vincent and Co., 20 and 22, Maddox Street. Moore wrote that he had known Doig 12 years, been con<lb/>stantly in touch with him, And considered him a highly respectable and cautious business man. Vincent and Co. wrote that they had done business for a considerable period with Mr. Doig and had no hesitation in saying they considered him a most reliable tenant. We got a third reference of a similar nature from Braun Brothers, of 65, Fenchurch Street, import and export merchants, also at Warsaw Russia, and Durban, Natal. (This letter was stated to be in the handwriting of Ralli.) Upon those references Doig was accepted as a tenant at £110 a year under lease produced. I had nothing to do with collecting the rent.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Frampton. I do not think I ever saw Doig. (To Mr. Elkin.) Ralli got an order to view other premises, an I we sent him a list containing these. He did not send me any references.</p>

                  </hi>, 18, High Road, Willesden Green, estate agent. In October, 1906, I had the letting of shop and premises at 60, High Road, Willesden Green, owned by Alfred Miles. On October 20 Ralli called on account of W. H. Cross, 70, High Road, Fulham, and said they were looking out for a shop for a branch busi<lb/>ness. I received letter produced of October 27, 1905, from W.H. Cross, shirtmaker, hosier, and glover, 70, Fulham Road, South Ken<lb/>sington, offering to take the premises on a three years' agreement at £90, and giving references to Long and Co., shirimakers, 10A, Soho Square, and J.H. Vincent and Co., 20 and 22, Maddox Street, signed "W.H. Cross pp. J.A.R. I received a very good reference from "Long and Co., J.W. Clifton," and also from Vincent; the owner accepted Cross as tenant, and agreement produced, dated Novem<lb/>ber 11, for three years, at £90, was sent to and signed by W.H. Cross. The only person I saw in the mutter was Ralli. He called about some repairs, and then told me his name. I did not hear of the name of Goodman. After they had been in some time I saw a notice put up in the shop that the business had been transferred. Ralli sub<lb/>sequently, about the end of February, 1906, called and told me the business had been purchased by Mr. Max Adler, and said they wished to have the agreement transferred to Adler. I referred them to the owner's solicitors. Ralli instructed me to let the upper part of the premises, which I succeeded in doing, to Mr. Jory, at Christmas, 1905. I saw Ralli once or twice at the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Elkin. Ralli gave the name of Cross as his principal, which is not unusual. I never saw anyone who was alluded to as Cross. I never asked Ralli for his name or address. (To Mr. Elliott.) I have no recollection of seeing Goodman. There was a young man of about 19, who might be Harry Goodman, occupying a minor position in the shop—I would certainly not suggest he was manager.</p>

About March 10, 1906, Ralli called on me giving the name of Israel, and stated that he was Mr. Adler's representative, who had bought the business of Cross, at 60 High Road, and wanted a fresh lease to Adler for the balance of Cross's term. I said I understood that Cross was a bankrupt, and had absconded, and I should have to be quite certain the trustee had no an interest in the lease. He went away saying he would ascertain who the trustee was. He called at various times during the year on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210024"/>
               <p>the same matter, and referred me to Mr. Gregory, a solicitor, in king's Bench Walk. I always refused to accept Adler as tenant. We dis<lb/>trained three times for the real due in March, June, and September and got paid, but the Christmas rent was not paid. I wrote to Adler and to Coleman about the rent, and received letter produced (stated to be written by Doig) from 70, Fulham Road, stating that Adler was on the continent, signed "For M. Adler, J. Wilson." When the September rent was coming due I wrote to Adler and received typed letter (produced) from 70, High Road, under the heading "General Outfitters' Supply Stores," and stating, "Your letter addressed to Mr. Adler has been opened by us, our Mr. Coleman having purchased the business from Mr. Adler, of which Mr. Miles was notified," etc. We had not heard a word about that before. We put in a distress for the September rent, and Israel (Ralli) came and tendered it on behalf of Coleman. We took it and gave a receipt, but stated that we did not recognise Adler or Coleman, or anybody, Cross having become bank<lb/>rupt. I have never seen Coleman or anyone except Ralli and the solicitor. On October 25 I had a letter saving the business had been transferred to a Mr. Paul Bury. I never saw him. That letter is typed and the "p's" are underneath the line. On November 21, 1906, I had a typed letter (produced) from Paul Bury asking for the lease to be transferred to him, which we refused. Before we could distrain for the Christmas rent the prisoners were arrested, and we took possession in January.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Elkin. We distrained for the rent is consequence of our refusal to recognise Adler as tenant—we did not want to complicate matters. Ralli always called as a representa<lb/>tive. (To Mr. Elliott.) I have never seen Goodman. I have never seen anybody except Ralli and his solicitor, Mr. Gregory.</p>

                  </hi>, wife of John Jon-, foreman bricklayer. Since December 20, 1904, I have occupied the upper part of 60, High Road, over the shop in which the business of a gentleman's outfitter was carried on. I have seen there a young man named Harry Good<lb/>man. Ralli, a shopman named Webb, and a coloured man. I once saw the prisoner Goodman behind the counter in the back of the shop when I went in to make a purchase in the early part of 1906 After they left I saw Martin there. I always paid my rent to Harry Goodman. I have never seen Cross, or Max Adler, or Paul Bury. The premises remained open till the early part of December, 1906, when they left. Martin then called three times for my rent. My letters were delivered in the letter-box in the shop door, and Harry Goodman or the black man used to bring them up, and after they left we had to ask the postal authorities to deliver them at the back. When Martin called for the rent he gave me two letters that had been put into the shop. My rent book is initialled "H.G" (Harry Good-man), except the last two, which are signed "I. Israel" (Ralli), and one in March signed "H. Webb," the assistant. I did not know any) of them by name except Harry Goodman. Goodman seemed to take the lead in the business; when I wanted the gas put on I had to ask</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210025"/>
               <p>H. Goodman, and he said he would ask his father. I naturally sup<lb/>posed Goodman was our landlord. I never knew that Adler or Coleman or Bury had become our landlord; I never really knew who my landlord was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Elkin. I frequently saw Ralli in the shop serving customers at different times of the day and night; the money would old be paid generally to the young woman, the cashier. (To Mr. Jones.) When Martin called for the rent that was the first time I aaw him. (To Mr. Elliott.) H. Goodman told me he was 20; Webb was about 30; the black man was about 30 or 35. I was there from December 20, 1905, and am still occupying the premises. To the best of my knowledge I only saw Goodman once, never spoke to him, and did not then know who he was.</p>

I asked if he was the proprietor. Ralli said, "This is the proprietor," pointing to a gentleman whom he introduced as Paul Bury, who is not here. I said, in Ralli's hearing, "I am making inquiries respecting some lamps sent here from Birmingham for which payment baa not been made." Ralli said, "Mr. Bury knows nothing about that; that would be in Mr. Coleman's time. Mr. Cole<lb/>man was the proprietor of the shop. I will see Coleman and ask him, and the money will be paid. There is a six months credit allowed, and it will not be due till next month." I then left. I frequently passed the shop in 1906, and generally saw Harry Goodman con<lb/>darting the business. I have seen Ralli there on two or three occa<lb/>sions. (To Mr. Elkin.) I have been informed by Ralli that the debt I went about has been paid.</p>

                  </hi>. Since June, 1904, I have been City agent of the European and General Express Company, the owners and occupiers of 71 and 73, St. Mary Axe, of which they let the base<lb/>ment and ground floor to. I showed over premises, when he gave his name as "Alexander c/o Caldwell Moore, Palmerston House." He told me he was commencing business as export packer. The premises were let to him from September 7, but he took actual possession about a fortnight after that date. We removed as we required larger premises, and we left some cases of goods there, which I applied for with my clerk Mr. Fiddy, on several occasions and saw Goodman. He said be could not deliver the cases without seeing Mr. Doig, who, he said, was away shooting. I have seen Ralli and Moore there on two or three occasions, threatened legal proceedings if the cases were not delivered up by letter produced of September 25. Fiddy and I went for them, and either Goodman or his clerk handed me account, produced, of £18 13s. 6d., for ware-housing our cases. Goodman was there. I had further interviews with him, and ultimately at the end of September I took forcible possession of the cases. We received letter of October 5 from Ralph</p>

               <p>Raphael and Co., solicitors, on behalf of. No rent was paid, we took proceedings in the High Court, and under judgment got possession of the premises in October, 1906. I went in with the agent; no one was there, and no goods. Between August, 1905, and October, 1906, I had called 12 or 15 times and saw no signs of busi<lb/>ness being carried on. I never saw Doig after showing him the pre<lb/>mises. I got three letters (produced) in reply to our applications for rent. (Stated to be in the handwriting of Vincent and Ralli.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Frampton. Fiddy was with me when I showed Doig the premises. The tenants made a claim on account of the insanitary condition of the premises. The sanitary authorities did come in. I informed Doig that they would be coming in. I be<lb/>lieve they were there about two months. I claimed rent for that period, and the tenant set up a counterclaim that the premises were not habitable. I never saw Doig about the cases—my dealings on that were with Goodman. (To Mr. Grain.) I never saw Moore before the premises were let. Afterwards I saw him two or three times go in and out. (To Mr. Methuen.) Doig made a claim by letter in respect of the drains. (To Mr. W. Thorne.) Doig was sway when. I had the dispute with Goodman about the cases. (To Mr. Elkin) I refused to make any payment for warehousing the cases.</p>

                  </hi>, secretary to the Anglo-Greek Magnet Company, Limited, 20, Finsbury Square. My company own the base<lb/>ment of 24, Finsbury Square, which was placed in the hands of Denny, let to Vincent at £45 per annum, and he took possession in October 1906. There was put upon the door, "Vincent and Rothenstein," and on the window "McDonald and Co." I have seen Vincent, Good<lb/>man, Martin, and Ralli there frequently up to the end of May or June, 1907; their principal business seemed to be to go in and out about 20 times a day. In March, 1907, I saw Goodman with refer<lb/>ence to their clearing out, on a Saturday afternoon; there was a van outside in which goods were being put. I went into the basement and was stopped by two men. I pushed my way in and Goodman came round. I said, "Are you going to clear out?" He said "Why I said the suspicious manner in which they were taking away these articles seemed to indicate that they were doing so. Goodman said it was nothing to do with me, he was entitled to do as he liked. I said, "I hope in any case you will clear out, because I do not want to have a gang of swindlers any longer on the premises." He wished to know if he owed me any rent. I said, No, he did not owe me any rent—he had paid me for the quarter, I never expected to get any</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210027"/>
               <p>more, end that in any case, whether he owed me rent or not, I wanted him to clear out—I should be only too pleased if he would. Then I repeated, "I do not want a gang of swindlers on the premises." He assumed a threatening attitude, and dared me to repeat that state<lb/>ment. I told him I was not afraid, and that I did repeat it. I had removed a telephone they had put up in the passage where he had no right of access, and put it in their room. He said I had not heard the last of the question of the telephone. In May I saw a notice on the door saying they would be back in an hour, which I believe re<lb/>mained there about a month. I was paid a half-quarter's rent to Christmas, and got the March quarter by detraining; the June quarter was not paid. I entered into possession as soon as I learnt they were arrested. I had several inquiries about McDonald and Co., and answered them. I had correspondence with Mr. Timbrell, the solicitor for Vincent, with regard to the telephone and the alleged slander on my part, and eventually a writ was issued against my com<lb/>pany. We entered an appearance, and heard nothing more of the action.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Methuen. When I removed the telephone there was no rent due, the premises were locked, and I broke in. The conversations about clearing out were with Goodman, not with Vin<lb/>cent. Vincent was my tenant. (To Sir. Jones.) I saw Martin there practically all the time, but I noticed him more in the latter part. I sever spoke to him. I did not see him sweeping the place or carry<lb/>ing parcels. (To Mr. Thorne.) I did not use violent language to Goodman except that I called the whole lot a gang of swindlers. He resented it. I heave been referring to notes which I made yesterday; while waking to give evidence. (The notes were put in and read.)</p>

                  </hi>, clerk to Dunn, Soman, and Coverdale, Gresham Street, estate agents. In March, 1007, my firm had 46, Artillery Lane, to let. Vincent called about them. We subsequently had an application through Reynolds and Eason from Coleman, who referred us to the prisoner Moore and to Timbrell. Both recom<lb/>mended Coleman as a satisfactory tenant. That proposal came to nothing. We then got an application from Petricus and Co., of 29 Fashion Street, offering to take he premises at £57 10s., and referring to Davis Bros., builders, and to J.H. Vinson., of 76, Brondesbury Villas. The references were good, we let the premises to Petricus, and on April 15 a man like the prisoner Martin called for the keys, giving a receipt for them in the name of J. Barker. We afterwards got typed letter (produced) from Petricus and Co., of 29, Fashion Street, complaining of the state of repair, in which the "p's" are out of line. Three years' agreement from March 24, 1907, to March 24, 1910. at £57 10s. (produced), is signed "Joseph Petricus." Letter (produced) from Walker and Co. has a picture as their business pre<lb/>mises of 46, Artillery Lane. I saw their name put up over the side door—we had no communication with anyone but Petricus as the tenant. The first quarter's rent had just become due when the prisoners were arrested.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a native of Russian Poland, and have carried on business at 29, Fashion Street, as "Petricus and Co." as a tailor for 11 veers. My wife is the tenant; the rent is £2 5s. a week. I have seen Vincent and at 46, Artillery Lane, once or twice I knew I was taking 46, Artillery Lane, and told my daughter to sign the agreement. I do not know who witnessed it as "G. Roberts." Rubin brought me the agreement, and was there when my daughter signed it. I did not see him sign it I was twice at 46, Artillery Lane about a month after it was taken. The only reference I gave was to Davis, my landlord. I did not know Vincent and Co. were giving a reference I have never seen Vincent. I never carried on busi<lb/>ness at 46, Artillery Lane. I handed the premises over to Robin, who said he was going there as Walker and Co. Card produced is not mine. I know nothing about the partnership agreement between not and Rubin (produced). I signed one, but I did not know what it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Methuen. I have paid at Fashion Stress £2 5s. a week for 10 years, which is more than the rent of Artillery Lane. I knew Mr. Davis, my landlord, would give me a reference. (To Mr. Thorne.) I did not sign an agreement for partnership—Rubin told me he was going to take the house, 46, Artillery Lane, for me—I never signed a partnership, and I did not want a part<lb/>nership. I did sign an agreement for letting the place to a man whose name I do not know, recommended by Rubin—I think a tall man. (To the Jury.) I received no consideration for signing the lease.</p>

I asked him for the usual references, and said I was surprised at his coming to us, as he might get a nearer price from manufacturers in the City He said that we were nearer, and that we kept a particular kind of long cloth that he could not get elsewhere. He referred me to Braun Bros. 65, Fenchurch Street, and Vincent and Co., 20 and 22, Maddox Street, to whom I applied on our usual form. I received reply (produced) from Braun Bros., staling that they had known Long and Co. for a considerable number of years, and that Long and Co. were good for ordinary trade credit, etc., and a satisfactory reply from Vincent. We supplied goods from October 30 to December 19 to the amount</p>

               <p>of £77 6s. 5 1/2 d. I called at 10a, Soho Square, several tames for pay<lb/>ment, and saw the forewoman, Miss Welsh, and on one occasion in February Clifton. I told him goods purchased in October were due in December, and that we bad no payment. He promised to pay by March 10. We wrote on March 13, and in April took proceedings and obtained judgment in Chambers. I think I saw Vincent there. After the issue of the writ called on me and said he was an accountant representing Long and Co., and was winding up their affairs. He asked me to stay proceedings, and said, "If you go on it means bankruptcy, and there will be nothing for anybody." I told him it was in the hands of Mr. Austin, the head of the department. We have had no payment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Frampton. I saw Clifton several times in 1906 at Long and Co.—I have no doubt he is the man who opened the account in September, 1905, and who gave me the' references. After Doig called on me I believe he saw Mr. Austin at my request. He asked me to give Long and Co. time, and said that he was going to wind up their affairs. (To Mr. Methuen.)

I took him in to the manager. He said he Was going through Clifton's (Long and Co.'s) books with a view to his obtaining a partner, that if we pressed now we should not get our money. He was asked, "What do you know about Long and Co.?—how long have you known them?"—could he give us some particulars as to his position. He said he had not known them long; he was going through their books. I was suggested, "When you have done that and drawn up a state<lb/>ment of affairs, we will consider as to allowing further time." No statement of affairs was sent.

Moore wrote that the statement of affairs of Long and Co. showed a balance of £1,515 12s. Id; and Vincent stated that Long and Co. were good for an ordinary trade credit of £250. The letter is a typed letter, in which the "p's" are below the line. We supplied goods to the amount of £97 5s. 2d., made various appli<lb/>cations, but failed to get payment. Having made inquiries we wrote asking Moore for an explanation of the statement of affairs. He wrote that it was made up to November last. On March 28 we re<lb/>ceived typed letter (produced) from Long and Co., having the "p's" below the line. Proceedings were taken, and judgment obtained, but we got no money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Frampton. Bundle of orders (produced) are typed, and all have the "p's" out of line. (To Mr. Grain.) Our agent Miller, of Milk Street, Cheapside, made inquiries about Long and Co., and suggested we should get references.</p>

(in which the "p's" are below the line) asking for samples and giving a reference to Vincent and Co. It was referred to the counting-house and silk and cotton goods were forwarded to the value of £27 18s. 5d. The goods were either fetched by Martin or sent through Carter, Pater<lb/>son, and Co.

In say, 1906, in consequence of Long and Co.'s application, I went to the offices of Vincent and Co., 4, Market Place, three times in one day, but failed to see Vincent or anyone in authority. We sub<lb/>sequently received a letter from Vincent and Co., and supplied goods to a small amount. Receiving further orders from Long and Co., I asked for a further reference, and was referred to Caldwell, Moore,</p>

               <p>and Co. by a typed letter, which has the "p's" below the line. I called at Palmerston House and saw a gentleman very like the pri<lb/>soner Moore. He said that he had just prepared a balance-sheet from Long and Co.'s books, which showed a surplus of £1, 300, and that they had been established three or four years. I believed the statement made and authorised goods to be supplied. We have re<lb/>ceived no payment whatever and have made a claim in Clifton's bank<lb/>ruptcy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gathorne-Hardy. When I went to see Vincent at 4, Market Place I taw no people working there—a man came to the door—the premises were not open. (To Mr. Grain.)

Vincent, costume and underclothing manu<lb/>facturer, 76, Brondesbury Villas, N.W., and to Caldwell, Moore, and Co., Palmerston House. We received letters from Vincent stating that he had dealt with Long and Co. for a considerable time, and they had always promptly met their obligations; and from Moore and Co. stating that a recent account prepared by them showed Long and Co. to be in a good financial position. On these references we delivered calicoes and flannelette from August 27 to September 21 to the amount of £75 0s. 5 £d.

On June 11, 1906, I received typed letter pro<lb/>duced from Long and Co., 10a, Soho Square, ordering three machines far their new workshop, 6a, Steward Street. I had previously called on Long and Co. and delivered a machine on trial in April, which had been returned. Martin brought the letter and selected three machines suitable for tailoring, which were delivered on June On June 14 we got an order for three more machines, which were delivered and signed for by "J. Martin." We received a further order by telephone for three machines, which were tent and signed for by "J. Martin." I sent the account for the nine machine—£58 10s.—called at Steward Street about 12 times for payment and saw Mar<lb/>tin. He said Mr. Long was not in, that be would bring the matter before him, and a cheque would be sent. In August I noticed that the machines were not at Steward Street. Martin told me that they had been sent to Soho. I went to Soho Square the same day and found the place closed. On August 11 we received typed letter pro<lb/>duced</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Frampton. Wheeler, Wilson, and Co had dealings with Clifton in 1900. I first met him in April 1906, when I think he said he did not require any machines. I did not think it necessary to communicate with him when an order bearing his address came. I never saw Clifton in connection with the supply of these nine machines. (To Mr. Jones.) When I called at Steward Street I could see into both rooms, as the door was usually open I do not think Martin told me the machines had gone to Soho before August, but I am not certain.</p>

               <p>shops which he had, giving at a reference Caldwell Moore, of Palmer ston House. I saw the prisoner Moore and asked him to give me some particulars of Cross's assets and liabilities. He produced a balance-sheet showing assets over liabilities to the amount of £1, 000. I asked Moore if he could verify the assets as being correct, and he told me that he had signed the balance-sheet, which he would not; have done unless he had been satisfied. He showed me the balance-sheet with his name upon it. He said he had made it for people who were putting money into the concern. I was also referred by Cross to Boddy and Foster. Mainly on the faith of Moore's statements I supplied goods to the amount of £201 to 60, High Road, Willesden, to Victoria, and to Fulham. I received no payment and received notice of Cross's bankruptcy. I saw Cross several times before the meeting of creditors, but not after that.</p>

Cross, 70, Fulham Road, and on January 9 a further order for hats and caps to the value of £12 8s. We were referred to Long and Co., 10A, Sono Square, and Caldwell Moore. "Long and Co., J.W. Clifton," wrote that they had done business with W.H. Cross for six years, and found his account very satisfactory. On January 12 I called on Moore, who stated he was auditing Cross's books, and they showed stock £1, 600, book debts £225, fixtures £350. and creditors £1, 200, leaving a credit balance of £1, 000. He said Cross was negotiating to take in a partner with additional capital, and that they were going to launch it into a very large concern, but that at present there was plenty of capital to carrv on the business. On those statements I supplied goods value £50 19s. 9d. to Fulham Road and High Road, Willesden. Two or three weeks afterwards we received bankruptcy notices in re W.H. Cross, and learnt that the information we received was wrong, as there were no assets, and that Cross was not to be found. We instructed our solicitors, Messrs. Wynne Baxter and Keble, to write to Moore for an explanation as to the figures he had given, and stating that the business was sold in December. Moore replied by letters of February 19 and 22, 1906, stating that the balance-sheet was made up to October last, and that he had only heard of the sale a week or two ago. We have received no payment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fulton. I understood from Moore that the balance-sheet had been made within a day or two. (To Mr. Thorne.) Nothing was said about Cross's business being turned into a limited liability company.</p>

                  </hi>, counting-house manager to Munt, Brown and Co., 35, Monkwell Street, warehousemen and manu<lb/>facturers. In May, 1906, a man whom I do not recognise called</p>

               <p>with reference to supplying goods to the Public Supply Stores, 60, High Road, Willesden Green, giving references to Vincent and Co., 4, Market Place, and Long end Co., 10a, Soho Square. I went to Vincent and Co. and found the place closed; and on May 4 to 10A, Sono Square, and saw Vincent, whom I addressed at "Mr. Long," and he answered to that name. He said he had had an account of about £3 a month with the Public Supply Stores and had been promptly paid. I asked him if he could give me any particulars as to their capital or who the proprietors were. He said, "No." I wrote to the Public Supply Stores, and stated the references were not sufficient. Ralli then called on May 7, and said they had paid £2, 000 cash down for the business, and referred me to Caldwell Moore for confirmation. I saw Moore the same day, who told me they had paid cash for the business, that we should be quite safe in sending our goods, and that the Public Supply Stores had ample capital. He answered in very general terms, and said he could not give me the proprietors as his papers were not available. I did not press the question, because I did not intend to send the goods and did not do so.</p>

                  </hi>, secretary to John Harding, Son and Co., Limited, wholesale clothiers, Nantwich. In May, 1906, I received an order from the General Outfitters and Supply Stores, 60, High Road, Willesden Green, and were referred-to Long and Co., 10A, Soho Square, and Vincent and Co., 4, Market Place. Long and Co., wrote that they had done business with Mr. Adler, the proprietor of the Supply stores, for some years satisfactorily, giving credit up to £150, and that the account had always been satisfactorily settled. That is a typed letter with the "p's" below the line. We received a similar letter from Vincent and Co. Believing the references to be genuine we communicated with our London agent, and received typed orders of June 7, 11, and 15, purporting to come from 60, High Road, and also hiving the "p's" below the line. Goods were supplied to the amount of £67 5s. 2d., for which no payment has been made. We put the matter in the Manchester Guardian Society's hands, but they could not find the people at Willesden Green.</p>

                  </hi>, 26, Montague Road, Hendon, London agent for John Harding and Son, Limited, Fore Street. On instruc<lb/>tions from J. Harding and Son, I called at the Supply Stores for orders, saw a young man who made an appointment, and Ralli called on me at Fore Street giving the name of "Jerald." He said he was the manager for the Willesden Green Supply Stores and bought goods, some of which were sent from the rectory and some from the depot. I afterwards received from Harding and Son letter of June 12, 1906. from the General Outfitters and Supply Stores and on June 13 or 14 I called at Vincent and Co. and Long and Co., the references. Both places were closed. At Long and Co., 10A, Soho Square, there was a ticket on the door stating that the warehouse was closed for repairs to machinery, Israel (Ralli) afterwards called to buy some more goods, but I said</p>

               <p>we could not do anything further until we received a cheque. He said he would see the governor, and there would be no difficulty—the cheque would be remitted. The cheque was not sent and I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Elkin. Ralli told me that he was he manager and also that he had been buyer to Charles Bateman and Co.</p>

                  </hi>, manager to Hodgson, Jack and Co., linen manu<lb/>facturers, Londonderry, at their London branch, Aldersgate Street. In May, 1906, I received through a traveller an order for goods for the General Outfitters and Supply Stores, 60, High Road, Willesden Green, under the name of Max Adler, with a reference to Caldwell Moore, who by letter of May 12 stated Adler was good for ordinary trade credit, and that he had purchased the business for a consider<lb/>able sum. On that reference we supplied goods value £15. After<lb/>wards Ralli called under the name of Max Adler, and ordered fur<lb/>ther goods from time to time, which were supplied, to the amount in all of £63 3s. 2d. We have received no payment. Ralli called every two or three days for about a month.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Elkin. I am positive Ralli did not say he was buyer for Max Adler. He brought either a slip of paper or gave the order from a book. He never mentioned that he was the proprietor—he simply gave the order in the name of Max Adler. A traveller sometimes gives the names of the principal he represents.</p>

As it was a retail house, which we do not supply, we let the matter drop. On June 9, 1906, we received a further typed letter (with the same "p's") asking again for samples, which we forwarded to the General Outfitters and Supply Stores, followed by order of June 22. On June 23 we sent the invoice for the goods and asked for cheque. After further correspondence we received typed letter of June 30 with the "p's" below the line, and on July 4 typed letter with the "p's" below the line giving as references Long and Co., 6, Steward Street, and Vincent and Co., 4, Market Place.

On October 9 we were instructed by Moseley and Sons, Limited, to recover £30 13s. 9d. from the General Outfitters and Supply Stores, 60, High Road, Willesden Green, and wrote for payment. We re<lb/>ceived letter of October 10: "I have recently taken over this business, and have no knowledge of the account to which you refer—P. Cole<lb/>man." (Said to be in Vincent's handwriting,) On October 17 we issued writ, and received letter of October 22 from Mr. Timbrell, solicitor, stating that his client had purchased the business since the date mentioned in the particulars. The dates given in the particu<lb/>lars were June 29 to August 14. In further correspondence with Timbrell he stated that the business was purchased from Morris Adler under an agreement of August 2, and the stock on August 7. I afterwards inspected an agreement between Morris Adler, clothier, of 60, High Road, Willesden, and John Percival Coleman, of 142 and 143, Palmerston House, merchant, the consideration being £50, completion to be on August 8. Timbrell on November 14 wrote that his client had returned goods amounting to £5 9s. 5d., as they were not ordered or required by him. On December 29 I received typed letter (with the "p's" below the line) from "P. Bury," stating that the goods referred to were returned.

                  </hi>, cashier to Harris and Co., Wood Street, tie manufacturers. On September 1, 1906, we received typed letter (with the "p's" below the line) from the General Outfitters and 'Supply Stores, asking for samples. We sent a traveller, who brought an order and references. I called on Moore and asked if he could give me particulars about Coleman, trading as the Supply Stores.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210038"/>
               <p>He said, "Oh, dear, has it changed hands again? I know nothing about it." I said I thought it strange that we should have been re<lb/>ferred to him, and that we should have to write to the effect that he declined to give a reference. He said I could do just as I liked in the matter. I wrote to Coleman, and received letter of September 12 apparently written by the same typewriter and referring me again to his accountants Moore and Co. I called at Palmerston House and saw in Moore's office and he gave me figures which I made a note of at the time. He said they had recently taken over the books of Mr. Coleman and I could take these figures to be correct: Stork. £1, 500; fixtures, fittings and furniture. £250; cash at bank, £100 or £120; total liabilities, £800; so that assets were practically £1, 000 over liabilities. He gave me those figures from papers in front of him. He asked "we should be sending the goods. I said I should have to refer to my principal, we did not care about ac<lb/>counts where we were asked to give samples—to people who sought us. He said, "I think they will be all right." I said we did not care for accountant references, we preferred being referred to trade references. He said Coleman could not do that as be had just taken over the business, but that we should find him all right and a satis<lb/>factory man in every way. We supplied ties to the amount of £8 9s. 3d. and received a similarly typed letter asking for the balance of the order, to which we wrote for payment of those already sent. On November 20 we had a similarly typed letter stating that Cole<lb/>man, would send a cheque on his next pay day, the 10th proximo. It was not sent, and on December 11 we wrote for it and received a typed letter from Paul Bury stating that he had acquired the busi<lb/>ness—the "p's" of which are again below the line.

                  </hi>, accountant to E. Radin and Co., Shoreditch, shop fitters. On September 24, 1906, Ralli called on me giving the name of Rowley and ordered some brass window fittings for the cloth<lb/>ing stores at 60, High Road, Willesden Green, value £9 9s. 2d. He said he was the manager, that they were refitting, and that at a later date they would require further fittings. I told him Radin's was a cash business and it was usual to give a deposit. He gave me references to Moore and Co., chartered accountants, and Long and Co, 6a, Steward Street. I wrote to both and received satisfactory references, Long and Co.'s letter being typed with the "p's" below the line. Believing the statements, we sent the goods per Carter, Paterson's on September 28, and posted account the same evening. On October 11 I went to 60, High Road for payment, and. After waiting for half an hour to see P. Coleman, I saw Ralli. who said there was 30 days' credit. I said, "There is no credit given by us at all—the goods were cash on delivery." He said, "Well, our next pay-day is November 10—you will have to wait until November 10</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210039"/>
               <p>our next pay-day." I said, "I am not going to wait. I want either the money or the goods." He said, "You can have neither, and if that is not satisfactory you can go to the devil." I then told him I had found out that one of the references was a fraudulent one—that Long and Co. had been bankrupt for two months previous to their letter. He said I was mistaken, that he had known Mr. Long for 20 years, that he was a highly respectable and wealthy man. (Clifton was adjudicated bankrupt on October 11.) We sued and spplied for judgment forthwith on November 27, when Paul Bury attended the County Court and said that he was the owner of the business, which he had purchased from Percival Coleman on Novem<lb/>ber 1 The Judge gave us judgment in a fortnight. I found out that the man who appeared as Paul Bury had been an insurance agent in Shoreditch named Friburg. On December 12.I went with Mr. Radin to 60, High Road expecting tone execution to be put in, and we found the place closed and empty. On October 11 our fittings were in the shop. I then went to Becketts, furniture re<lb/>movers, Willesden Green, and found Ralli attending to the packing of two vans of goods, including our fittings. Ralli said he would have me put out if I did not go, and called Mr. Beckett, jun. I told Ralli that he and his gang were nothing but a set of swindlers. He said if I believed that I had better have him locked up—there was a policeman downstairs. After that he said if I would only be reasonable Mr. Goodman would see that our account was paid—that we were only little people; he said, "We do not do such as you—we do bigger people, bigger firms. We are not amateurs, at this—we have had an experience of 15 years—we know what we are doing." I followed the goods to the South London Pantechnicon, where they arrived at about three a.m. I never saw my goods again or the money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Elkin. I had three interviews with Ralli. When he ordered the goods I demanded cash on delivery and asked for references, because before putting the order in hand I wanted to know with whom we were dealing. The goods were specially ordered from Birmingham. (To Mr. Thorne.) I had not heard of Goodman in connection with this matter, but I had heard of him in connection with other matters. I knew pretty well what Goodman it was. I had seen Harry Goodman in the shop.</p>

In January, 1907, I saw an advertisement in the "York<lb/>shire Mercury," "Clearing Lines Wanted," and got into communica<lb/>tion with James McDonald and Co., 24, Finsbury Square. On Feb<lb/>ruary 22 I received typed letter produced, in which the "p's" are below the line, asking for samples. On February 22 I received typed letter (with the "p's" below the line) ordering goods to the value of £2414s., which were sent and payment asked for. On March 2 I received another typed letter with the "p's" below the line stating that their principal had had to go to the Continent, and on March 11 and 20 other letters asking if we had any clearing lines. On April 8</p>

               <p>we again applied for payment, and on April 9 received a typed letter with the "p's" below the line stating that their principal had had to go to the Continent in consequence of the death of a relative, who was a passenger in the "Berlin." After further applications we got judgment on June 27 in the Dewsbury County Court. We have not received payment.</p>

Typed document pro<lb/>duced is a draft of the advertisement and has the "p's" below the line. We got in communication with Walker and Co., goods were ordered, and references given to McDonald and Co., 24, Finsbury Square, and Petricus and Co., 39, Fashion Street.

On June 5 we had typed letter produced (with the "p's" below the line) stating that the goods arrived in a very unsatisfactory condition. Further letters (produced) were sent, but we have received no payment.</p>

                  </hi>, traveller. I have known Goodman about 15 years. In March or April, 1907, I met him in London Wall, when he asked me to become trustee for his wife in the business of Walker and Co., 46, Artillery Lane, at £2 a week. I saw him two or three times about it and executed agreement produced between myself and Mrs. Goodman, of 9, Teignmouth Road, Hempstead. The negotis<lb/>tions were entirely with Goodman. I then opened accounts at the London City and Midland Bank on June 12 and at the London Trading Bank, Coleman Street, on June 24, in the name of Walker and Co., with cash and cheques handed me by Goodman. I attended at Artillery Lane from the end of May to July daily. I signed cheque books for both banks and handed them to Goodman, who filled amounts in from time to time except one or two that I filled in my<lb/>self. No business was being done—we were looking for agencies—we had two offers. Letters to Best and Co., of June 19 and 23, are in my writing, written on Goodman's instructions. Press copy letter book produced was used at Artillery Lane. I have never seen the letter signed "J. Petricus" of June 27. I knew of the firm, but never saw Petricus. He did not carry on business at 46, Artillery Lane in my time. Goodman mentioned Petricus in connection with a lease of the premises from him to me. I believe that was never exe<lb/>cuted. Rubin was there daily as porter and Martin as the boy. Ralli used to come in and see Goodman alone nearly every day for a short time. I was paid £2 a week and Martin and Rubin were paid a small amount by Goodman. There was a typewriter used by Mar<lb/>tin. Letters to Best produced have the "p" invariably below the line—they were typed on that machine. In June I saw Moore in Bishopsgate Street with Goodman. Goodman used to go to both banks to pay in and draw out. He introduced himself there as the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210041"/>
               <p>manager to Walker and Co. I was at Artillery Lane the day before the arrest. We had no books. I had ordered them, but they had not armed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Methuen. I was to have a share of the profits as well as £2 a week. I thought it was a good thing, and during the time I was engaged with Goodman about the business of Walker and Co. I had no reason to suppose that anything was wrong or I would not have continued. I signed the cheques in blank be<lb/>cause Goodman suggested I might be ill or away and it might be necessary to have the cheques ready signed. I never saw Vincent. (To Mr. Jones.) Martin was the office boy to take parcels and mes<lb/>sages and he swept the floor out every morning. I do not know any typist named Joe. Martin was learning the typewriter—he was very slow and is illiterate. The typewriter was kept in the inquiry office and I was upstairs. (To Mr. Elkin.) I never saw Ralli take any part in the business. (To Mr. Thorne.) When I met Goodman I was earning my living travelling on commission and selling soap for the K.C. Company, earning about 30s. to £2 a week. I under<lb/>stood from Goodman that Mrs. Goodman had consented to my acting for her. There was no partnership with Rubin.</p>

                  </hi>, High Road, Willesden Green, furni<lb/>ture remover and storer. On June 30; 1906, on Ralli's instructions, I sent my brother with a one-horse covered van to 60, High Road, and, on July 16, on Ralli's instructions, a van by one of our cannon. On July 24 I sent a third van, instructed, I think, by Harry Goodman and confirmed by Ralli, and on November 20, 1906, I sent a fourth van by my brother, on instructions of Ralli. He brought back hampers, which were put in our warehouse, remained a day or two, and were taken to Hurlock's, Walworth Road, by vans brought by Ralli. On December 6 I again received instructions to clear goods from 60, High Road, which were put in my warehouse. They went away the next morning on instructions of either Goodman or Ralli. On December 7, on instructions of Paul Bury, in Ralli's presence, I removed fixtures from the shop and took them to our warehouse; they remained a week or two and were removed by the South London Pantechnicon Co. There were also six chairs which Ralli told me to keep back, which were sent to Smith in Fulham on December 19—I forget the address, but they were returned, "Address not known," and we has a 'phone message to send them to another address, which we did. I have seen Goodman in the High Road and in the shop, 60, High Road, several times in the evenings between June and Septem<lb/>ber, 1906. I have seen Martin in the shop in November or Decem<lb/>ber—frequently just before the shop was closed. I spoke to Good<lb/>man once, he said trade was very bad, that they were doing very badly—that things were quiet. I have often seen Ralli in the shop. I have never seen Cross, Adler, or Coleman. I saw Paul Bury once when he instructed me to remove the fittings. Ralli paid me for the work I did by the job at the time.</p>

He said he was interested in some shop fittings which he wanted removed from Willesden Green and warehoused as he was contemplating taking another shop. I went and saw the fittings and gave him an estimate for removal etc. On December 12 I received typed letter (with the "p's" below the line) signed J. Feldman and Co., 307, Bethnal Green Road. directing us to collect from Beckett goods purchased from 60, High Road, Willesden Green. We removed them in covered vans. Beckett the next day delivered further goods. On February 1 we received order (produced) to deliver the goods to Frank Bowen, auctioneer Feldman, whom I knew, brought the order. They were removed at the end of February. Goodman and Feldman were present.

                  </hi>, Canonbury, job buyer, factor, and commission agent. I have known Goodman about 20 years. He was introduced to me by Reaford and Co., Bunhill Row, for whom I acted as buyer. I knew Braun Bros., of 65. Fenchurch Street, in 1902 and in the early part of 1905 I saw Mr. Braun about buying some pails, which</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210043"/>
               <p>I sold them on commission. Goodman was there. I wet in and out there during 1905, end have seen Vincent, Relli, and I think there. I have been to the London Export Backing Company at 71 and 73, St. Mary Axe, and have seen Vincent, Goodman, Doig, and Martin there. About the middle of 1906 Goodman asked me if I could find a buyer for a portion of an out fitter stock of clothing, hosiery, etc., of about £200 or £300. I went to Hurlock's, Walworth Road, saw Carpenter, his buyer, and made an appointment; Car<lb/>penter met me at the station, and we went to 60, High Road, in the evening. The shop was closed, Goodman opened the door, Carpenter looked over a portion of the stock, and the price was arranged with Goodman at 35 per cent, off the cost prices marked on the tickets. I should say there was about £1,000 worth of stock there. Carpenter arranged with Goodman to take about £200 or £300 worth, which was to be sent on to Walworth Road. Payment was made to me by cheques (produced), £95 on June 9; £30; and £16 17s., and others, the proceeds of which I gave 40 Goodman leas 5 per cent, commis<lb/>sion. In the latter part of 1906 Goodman asked me to see if Hur<lb/>lock could do with another lot of staff similar to the last I saw him at 24, Finsbury Square—McDonald and Co.—and told him Hurlock could take them. Ralli, Vincent, and Martin were there. The price. was the same—35 per cent, off price marked on the ticket. I also sold some clothing and some ties from 24, Finsbury Square to Hur<lb/>lock in January, 1907. The second lot were paid for on December 4 and 8 and 15 by cheques (produced) amounting to £236 11s. 8d., which was paid to Goodman by me less 5 per cent, commission. The third lot I forget the amount of. I handed the money to Goodman lest £10, my agreed commission. I afterwards advanced some money to Goodman and had fittings from 60, High Road, Willesden, trans<lb/>ferred to me as security. I instructed the South London Pantech<lb/>nicon to collect and store them and they were afterwards sold by Bowen. I handed the balance of the proceeds to Goodman, less 5 per cent., my commission.</p>
               <p>(Friday, October 25.)</p>
               <p>I have been to 46, Artillery Lane about six times to see if they had anything to sell. I deal in job lots of pretty well everything. I nearly always saw Goodman there, Martin and Ralli a few times. I sold a lot of hats for Walker and Co. Goodman negotiated the tran<lb/>saction, and I paid him the amount, less my commission of 5 per cent. Latterly a man was pointed out to me as being Mr. Walker. I have never seen McDonald, of 24, Finsbury Square. In paying Goodman I drew Cheques at his request for various persons. I pro<lb/>duce cheques: May 5, 1906, Vincent and Co., £10, endorsed by Vin<lb/>cent and Co; July 16, J. Vincent, £1 8s.; July 30, Vincent and co., £5; Coleman, £15; August 25, Vincent, £7; September 15, London Export Packing Company, £8 10s., endorsed</p>

               <p>manr"; November 27, B. Feldman, £15 3s.—that is a cheque made oat to me, I endorsed it and gave it to Goodman; December 10, J. McDonald and Co., £46 10s.; December 12, J. McDonald and Co., £20; December 15, J. McDonald and Co., £8 10s.; December 18, Paul Bury, £5—I do not know Paul Bury; January 3, 1907 Vincent and Rothenstein, £5 17s. 3d; January 22, H. Simon, £38 10s. 3d.—Simon is Goodman's son-in-law; January 31, M. Coleman and Co., £10—I have met Coleman at 24, Finsbury Square, and at the Export Packing Company; March 1, W. Vincent, £18 7s. 6d; March 14, J. Goodman, £10; March 15, J. Goodman, £16 4s. 9d. Those cheques, amounting to £243 0s. 9d., were all handed by me to Goodman, are all endorsed in the names of the payees, and have all been honoured at my bank. Cheque March 15, J. Goodman, £16 4s. 9d, is endorsed in handwriting like Goodman's; that of March 14 for £10 is endorsed in a hand different to his.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Frampton. All my dealings in these transactions were with Goodman. (To Mr. Methuen.) All the cheques were made payable to the payees by instructions of Goodman and handed to him. I have been several times at 65, Fenchurch Street, and have sometimes seen Vincent there, sometimes not. I am a guardian for Islington. All my transactions with Goodman were, as far as I know, honest. I knew Herman Braun, Paul Bury, and Coleman as real persons. The pails I sold for Braun Bros, were their property to the best of my belief—Goodman acted as inter<lb/>mediary. Goodman gave me to understand that he had sent goods to Willesden Green and also bad lent them money. With regard to the fittings, I advanced £40 to Bury through Goodman, and in con<lb/>sequence the goods were placed in my name, sold by Bowen on my behalf, and I handed Goodman the proceeds leas my debt and com<lb/>mission. I certainly understood Bury was responsible for the trans<lb/>action. I knew Shepherd—that is not Goodman. I frequently at vanced money to Goodman, which he would advance for the purpose of financing others. I cannot say that any particular cheque was in respect of the sales I have mentioned. I do not know where the hats or the ties came from. (To Mr. Thorne.) Goodman had his beard cut on the day he surrendered at Bow Street. He told me he had an appointment to deliver himself up. Goodman told me Darnell was the principal of Walker and Co.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I last saw Herman Braun in 1905. I knew Panl Bury as Friedberg for some years. Goodman never told me why he became Paul Bury in connection with the Willesden business I saw Coleman at the Export Packing Company and once or twice at Finsbury Square and at Moore's office. I knew Shepherd as being at Reeford and Co.'s and have seen him at Braun Brothers'. I have seen Goodman at Reeford's. I do not know that that was Goodman's business. (To Mr. Jones.) I should say Martin was a very menial servant. I saw a man called "Joe" who used to type at Artillery Lane and Finsbury Square. I never saw Martin type.</p>

                  </hi>, buyer of ready-made clothing for William Hur<lb/>lock, Walworth Road, clothiers and drapers. On June 9, 1906, I bought through Feldman of Goodman goods as per receipted invoice produced £72 2s. 10d., less 35 per cent., £25 5s. 10d—£46 17s. Feld<lb/>man introduced me to Goodman—not in that name—and we went to High Street, Willesden Green, together, where I saw the goods; they were new. On June 29 I had a further lot—cost price £65 6s. 5d., discount £22 17s. 3d—£42 9s. 2d. On July 16 I had a further lot cost price, £56 7s. 2d., for £35 16s. That lot included garden hose cost price £10 5s. 3d. On July 25 I had a further lot cost price £74 1s., for which I paid £48 2s. 8d.; December 7 a lot cost price £113 12s. 8d. for £73 17s. 3d. The invoice for that is headed "J. McDonald and Co., 24, Finsbury Square." On December 8 I fought 33 packages of goods, cost price £363 19s. 8d., bought for £236 11s. 8d., paid for by cheque produced to Feldman. In all cases the basis or payment was 35 per cent, under cost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Thorne. I have had frequent dealings with Feldman, always found him an honourable man, and had no reason to believe the transactions were not fair and honest. Some of the goods were shop soiled, and the price I gave was a very good price. I have bought goods at 50, 60, and 70 per cent, off cost price. I am quite certain I did not know Goodman by that name. It may be that so same was mentioned, as I was buying directly from Feldman, and who his clients were was nothing to me. (To Mr. Methuen.) I do not know Vincent. (To the Jury.) The goods were bought at 35 per cent under buyers' cost price. I had no means of knowing whether they were correctly marked except my own judgment, and I was suffi<lb/>cient judge to know.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I have been a buyer 25 years. I should think, per<lb/>haps, one-eighth of the goods had been exposed for sale and so shop soiled. 35 per cent, off cost would be a very big price to pay for soiled goods. Taking them all round, I paid a very good price. (To Mr. Thorne.) I bought the hats at 50 per cent, off cost—that was a very bad bargain—they were rubbish.</p>

There were no operations after January 31,1907. A number of cheques were drawn, for which there were no funds, amounting to about £500. Some may have been pre<lb/>sented more than once—about one-third of that amount. In January, 1907, a bill for a small amount was presented for discount. I did not care to discount it, as the account had been working so irregu<lb/>larly, and wrote to Vincent about it. Goodman then called and said he could not understand why I could not discount it. He told me that anything I told him would be the same as telling Vincent—he was in the confidence of Vincent. On January 15, 1907, there is a payment to Moore of £5 18s.; January 18, Bury, £1 16s.; January 29, Ralli, £5 10s. When closed the balance was 6s. 8d., which was rewritten off for bank charges.</p>

                  </persName>, New Scotland Yard. In Feb<lb/>ruary, 1907, I was instructed to make inquiries with regard to Long and Co. From June 18 to 28 I kept observation on 48, Artillery Lane. I saw Ralli, Goodman, and Martin using the house—Good<lb/>man every day. He wore a frock coat, silk hat, and a full-grown beard and whiskers. When he surrendered at Bow Street he wore a blue serge suit and white felt hat and had his whiskers and beard trimmed. On June 17 I obtained a warrant for the arrest of all the prisoners except Moore and Goodman. On June 28 I arrested at 39, Lombard Street. When I told him I held a warrant for his arrest he said, "Surely not!" I than read the warrant, which charged him with conspiring with Clifton, Vincent, Martin, and Ralli to cheat and defraud persons entrusting goods on credit. He said, "This is past my comprehension. I cannot see bow I come into it." I conveyed him to Bow Street, where he was detained. On the same day, at 9.30 p.m., I went to 76, Brondesbury Villas, Kilburn, where I saw Vincent. I said, "Is your name James Harry Vincent?" He said, "That is my name." I told him I was a polios officer and held a warrant for his arrest. He said, "What for?" I read the warrant. He said, "It is a very serious matter for me, but I do not see how I am connected with the others." I conveyed him to Bow Street. At 12.10 a.m. the five prisoners were charged and made so reply. On June 28, at 6.30 p.m., I went to 46, Artillery Lane, and took possession of a quantity of books and papers and a type<lb/>writer (produced). I have tried the machine, and find that the "p," both capital and small letter, always comes below the line. On July 8, at 3.30 p.m., I went to Palmerston House and saw the prisoner Moore. On July 6 I obtained a warrant for his and Good<lb/>man's arrest after examining papers found at 46, Artillery Lane. After reading the warrant he said, "It is a lie. On whose informa<lb/>tion was, the warrant granted I" I said, "On mine." He said, "You are a liar." I conveyed him to Bow Street. When charged as said, "That is a lie." I tried to find Goodman, went to his address, 9, Teignmouth Road, Brondesbury, and found the house empty I and other officers made diligent search for him. On July 10 I was told by a solicitor's clerk that Goodman would sur<lb/>render at three p.m. at Bow Street, which he did. I read the war<lb/>rant,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210050"/>
               <p>charging him with Moore and five others to cheat and defraud He said "All I can say is I am entirely innocent." He made no reply when charged. When I went to 46, Artillery Lane on June 28 Goodman was there. I asked him for the keys of a drawer which was locked, which he gave me from his pocket. I found in the drawer a bundle of pencilled letters, said to be in Vincent's writing: Decem<lb/>ber 5, 1905. "Dear Mr. G.—This writ was given me list night after I left you"; "December 6. "I have been to Debenhams—they will not alter the terms. Should think it would be all right to have some goods from there. Please arrange for £6 or more for to-morrow, Friday." (A number of letters were read to show that Goodman was controlling the business and that Clifton was doing nothing without consulting him. A large number of documents were then put in and read connecting the various businesses and the pri<lb/>soners all found at 46, Artillery Lane.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Grain. The first hearing before the Magistrate was on June 29, when, I believe, Mr. Muir opened the case, and before July 9 the character and extent of the case had been reported in the papers. Moore's name had been mentioned. I found him at his office. He was then engaged as accountant for the English and Australian Copper Company. I knew he had been in business as an accountant for many years and that he had been a Common Coun<lb/>cilman of the City of London. He expressed great surprise at being arrested. He has apologised to me for calling me a liar. (To Mr. Methuen.) I have made inquiries about Vincent and find he has been agent to the County Fire Office for 25 years and that, in Sep<lb/>tember, 1905, he was manager to a machine company which has since gone into liquidation. I arrested him at his house, where I believe he has been living since 1892. (To Mr. Thorne.) A soli<lb/>citor's clerk came and saw me the day before Goodman surrendered and made an appointment for him to do so, which he did.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. At 46, Artillery Lane I found multifarious docn<lb/>ments which relate to nearly all the firms mentioned. I kept obser<lb/>vation and never saw Vincent there.</p>

                  </hi>, recalled.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Frampton. I have made inquiries about Clifton. As far as I know, from 1902 to the late spring of 1905, he was carrying on an honest business, and from July, 1906, until his arrest on June 28, 1907, he was in honest employment, and that from July, 1906, to the date of arrest he had no connection whatever with Goodman. The firm with whom he was in 1905 as foreman shirt cutter give him an excellent character as a steady and industrious workman; they have told me they would consider the question of taking him back after the trial, and up to the present have not filled his place. The letters found at 46, Artil<lb/>lery Lane show that Clifton was repeatedly asking for the money to pay the workpeople at Soho Square, and that he had not money to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210051"/>
               <p>pay them. Account of assets of Long and Co. is in ink in Clifton's writing—pencil figures are added which are in a different hand-writing. Doig was in employment at Lombard Street at the time of his arrest and has been so since he left Moore's office, where he had a seat and carried on legitimate business as an accountant. My in<lb/>quiries show that he is an industrious man. (To Mr. Elliott.) I watched Artillery Lane after obtaining the warrant—Goodman was then not a party to the charge. I saw him every day attired as usual. I arrested the five prisoners on June 28, and applied for the warrant against Goodman and Moore on July 6, before which date there had been a hearing at the police court, and report in the papers of the bearing, but not of the fact that I had obtained a warrant against Goodman. I suggest his cutting his beard and altering his attire made a difference. I had information that he had left the country. He may have come back again and surrendered because it was too hot for him.</p>
               <p>Further re-examined. After Goodman's surrender it was necessary for persons who had been, in contact with him to identify him. I found about six sheets of the paper of the "English and Australian Copper Company, Limited, 142 and 143, Palmerston House," at 46, Artillery Lane. Vincent received from the County. Fire Office as commission in 1904 £2 16s. 3d., in 1905 £2 17s. 7d., and in 1906 £3 1s. 8d.</p>

                  </persName>, New Scotland Yard. On the afternoon of June 28 I arrested Ralli in Middlesex Street. I said, "I am a police officer—what is your name?" He said, "Israel." I said, "I am going to arrest you on a warrant for conspiring with four other men named Doig, Vincent, Clifton, and Martin to cheat and defraud various firms." He said, "I have no connection with those men. I am a general commission agent." I took him to Bishopsgate Police Station, and afterwards to Bow Street. I found on him pocket-book (produced) containing an entry "A Petricus, 39, Fashion Street, wholesale clothier. Landlord N. and R. Davis, 81 and 62, Hamerton House, Bishopsgate Street"; also a letter from Thornton asking for rent due at 46, Artillery Lane. I saw Ralli write telegram (produced). I found upon him unposted letter to vincent.</p>

                  </persName>. On June 28, at five p.m., I arrested Martin at 46, Artillery Lane, in the office; Good-man was upstairs. I said, "What is your name?" He said, "Barker." I said, "I know you as Martin," and stated the warrant. He said, "I do not know what you mean; I have not obtained any goods; I have only been with this firm a week or two." I said, "The charge does not refer to goods obtained while you have been here." He said, "I do not know anything about any other place." I found on him diary containing entries about Willesden Green, cards of</p>

               <p>J. McDonald and Co., 24, Finsbury Square, cancelled bills of Paul Bury and W.H. Cross, and a pawnticket for three hockey sticks dated April 20, 1907, pledged by John martin with Barker. At 11 p.m., I went to 34, First Avenue, Uxbridge Road, Acton, where Clifton lives, and arrested him. On my stating the warrant, he said, "Do you really mean it?" I said, "Yes." He said, "But I have had nothing to do with any of them for a very long time. Have you got Goodman in custody?" I said, "No." He said, "I am surprised at that; he is the principal." On the way to Bow Street he said, "I cannot understand why you have not got Goodman. He is the man who does all the business." I saw Moore write receipt (produced).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Elkin. Clifton was paying a rent of 13s. 6d. a week. (To Mr. Jones.) I arrested Martin alone in a little office marked "Inquiry office." When he said his name was Barker that was before he knew I had a warrant. He did not deny that he was at Finsbury Square. (To the Judge.) I am sure he did not say his name was Martin, because I called his attention to the fact that I knew him as Martin.</p>

                  </persName>, City Police. In the autumn of 1905 I made inquiries about Braun Bros. About October 15 I went to Palmerston House and saw Moore and Doig. I said the police had had several complaints from manufacturers in connection with the unsatisfactory trading of Braun Bros., and that they had been going references; that Braun Bros, had been carrying on a long firm swindle. I pointed out the risks they ran in lending their names to it. They both stated they knew Braun Bros, very well they had satisfactory dealings with them, and had given their names in good faith.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Frampton. I do not think I ever had a reference for Braun signed by Doig. I first saw Moore alone and he made an appointment for me to see Doig also. I had the address of Doig at 89, Chancery Lane, and was there told he used Moore's office. I have no note of the interview—I did not consider it was sufficiently important.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an expert in handwriting and have given evidence in courts of justice for 22 years on that subject. I have received specimens of the writing of Vincent, Doig, Ralli, Moore, and Martin, have examined the typewriter found at Artillery Lane, and am prepared to give an opinion as to exhibits written by it Letter from Long and Co. as to the taking of 6a, Steward Street is typed by that typewriter and signed by Vincent; also the reference from Vincent and Co.; the letting agreement is signed by Clifton. Letter of June 11, Long and Co. to Singer Company, is typed by the same machine; postcard written by Vincent. Exhibits 16 to 46 (re<lb/>ferring to 46, Artillery Lane) are written by Clifton.

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I am 43 years of age, a married man, with a family, and have lived at 76, Brondesbury Villas for 17 years, before which I was living at Hynd Road, Brondes<lb/>bury. I have been agent to the County Fire Office 25 years for the collection of premiums at 12 1/2 per cent, commission. From 1903 to September, 1905, I was manager to the Hydro Machines, limited, previously I was secretary and manager to another company. I have been in constant employment since I left school till September, 1905, and this is the first charge brought against me. I first knew Good<lb/>man 25 years ago, and have known him since as a financial agent and company promoter and a substantial man. I introduced him to the secretary, and there were negotiations for his purchasing the Hydro Machines Company, which failed. He then proposed to me to be<lb/>come his partner; he had a company in view and desired to join to it a firm of mantle makers; he introduced me to Burgess, and we went to May and Rowden's to sign a lease for 20 and 22, Maddox Street, which I did in the name of J. Vincent and Co. I did not run that business. I took the letters to Goodman. Either Burgess or Goodman told me to do so. I should have instructions to reply in some cases from Goodman, or Burgees once or twice. Typed letters were put before me for signature. I did not know what the Mercur Society was. In November, 1905, the business was moved to 4, Market Place. At that time Hydro Machines, Limited, went into liquidation. Up to then my time was also occupied as manager to that company. At Market Place I acted under the instructions of Goodman in the same way as at Maddox Street. Work was done at both places. I knew nothing of the taking of 24, Finsbury Square until I signed the agreement on Goodman's instructions, and the business of Vincent and Rothenstein was started. I never saw Rothen-stein. I fetched the form from the bank, took it to Goodman, and received it back with the signature of Gustav Rothenstein on it. Let<lb/>ters were handed to Goodman. There was practically no business,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210054"/>
               <p>McDonald and Co. was Goodman; they were to deal in soft goods, Vincent and Rothenstein in mineral water machinery or licensed vic<lb/>tuallers' sundries—my own trade. I had nothing to do with McDonald and Co. I opened the account of "J.H. Vincent, trading as Vincent and Co.," with the London and County Bank, on the in<lb/>structions and by the introduction of Goodman; the same applies to the account with the National Provincial bank of "Charles Vincent, trading as Vincent and Rothenstein." The letter of introduction handed to me by Goodman was in the name of Charles Vincent. I was taken to the London City and Midland Bank by a friend of Goodman's named Stanley and opened the account in the name of "John McDonald." Goodman gave me the money to open it. I believed Long and Co. carried on a genuine business—I saw Vincent and saw the girls at work there. I gave the references to that firm on the information of Goodman. I knew Cross as carrying on busi<lb/>ness at various addresses—Fulham Road, Victoria, and Hammer smith—the General Outfitters' and Supply Store was the continuation of his business, and I gave references as he had paid our account. according to the statements made to me by Goodman. I did not instruct Ralli to get the order to view 46, Artillery Lane in my name. With regard to Petricus, I had seen by his rent-book of 39, Fashion Street that he was paying £2 5s. a week, and thus consi<lb/>dered he could pay the lower rent of Artillery Lane. I had known Doig for many years, and considered he was a substantial man, and so gave him a reference for 71 and 73, St. Mary Axe. I wrote post-card, "I have recently taken over this business, etc., P. Coleman," on the instructions, I think, of Goodman. I was writing on behalf of Coleman. I wrote the letter, "With reference to your claim for rent, I have a large claim against your client, etc.—A. Doig."—it has my initials, "H.V.," under the signature. Goodman told me to write it. Originally I had no idea that anything wrong was being done. My remuneration worked out to about 35s. a week. I never received the money for the cheques I endorsed—I acted on Good<lb/>man's instructions. I left Goodman in May, 1907, and was seeking other employment when arrested. (To the Jury.) In return for my salary I attended at various places during the day, wrote the letters which were necessary, and signed and endorsed the cheques. I re<lb/>ceived my remuneration from Goodman—I was his clerk I should think—35s. a week was all I got.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I suspected there was something wrong about Christmas, 1906. I remained till May on friendly terms with Good<lb/>man writing letters for him. I had never received money from Petricus, I had done no business with Braun. I know Leslie, of Berge and Leslie, but had done no business with them. I had done some work for Long and Co.—made some materials up for them.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner on oath). I am 39 years of age, an married, and have one child. I am an accountant. I first knew Goodman in 1900 by being appointed receiver for the debenture</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210055"/>
               <p>holders of S.T. Roberts and Co., Limited. I had then offices at 3, Union Court, Old Broad Street. I afterwards took offices in Great Winchester Street in partnership with Forsyth Harford, and Goodman called on me as to the progress of this receivership. During 1903 I occasionally assisted Moore, and I afterwards had a seat in his office. I had no transaction with Goodman until August, 1905, when he called on me in reference to 71 and 73, St. Mary Axe, and asked me if I would take those premises for him, as he wanted to put a brother of his in business—I understood Goodman was an undis<lb/>harged bankrupt, and so could not take them in his own name. The premises were to be used for packing purposes only. I took the pre<lb/>mises, and on the first day I took possession I met Goodman and handed the key to him. The next day I called and found an army of workmen trooping in to take up the drains under the sanitary in<lb/>spector's instructions. I never went there again for several months. I did no packing. I never ordered any goods to be sent there, nor received any there, nor have I received a penny from the proceeds of say such goods. When a claim for rent was made by the landlord Goodman instructed Mr. Raphael, and I told Raphael my connection with the matter; I have never paid or been asked for any costs. I first knew Clifton at the end of 1905, when he came to Moore's office. I am not responsible for the balance-sheet of Long and Co. I called several times at 10a, Soho Square at Clifton's request to write up his books from the various accumulated invoices and other papers—they were in arrear. I did not do this as the books were not obtained, and Clifton was not in when I called. Miss Welsh handed me an envelope containing a writ from Marshall and Snel-grove and a note from Clifton asking me to call and ask for time, which I did and saw Austin: his account is correct. I said that I was going to investigate the books of Long and Co. and had only known Clifton a short time: that was the true position of affairs. I had known Vincent for some time, and, in recommending him as a desirable tenant, I had no reason for thinking otherwise.</p>
               <p>(Tuesday, October 29.)</p>
               <p>(Prisoner, on oath). I had nothing to do with the business at St. Mary Axe, and did not know my name was being I used as the manager there. Exhibit 115 is in my handwriting, signature as well. I wrote it at the request of Mr. Moore. I knew I nothing of the financial position of Long and Co. The body of Ex<lb/>hibit 190 is in my writing. I do not recognise the initials. The signature is in my writing. I had never examined the accounts of Long and Co. I signed that "Caldwell Moore and Co." at the re<lb/>quest of Mr. Moore. Exhibit 193, signed "Long sod Co.," to Ellison and Son is not in my writing. It is type-written. I never typed a document on behalf of Long and Co. nor signed one. I remember being in Moore's office in September, 1906, when Mr. Clark called with reference to the Outfitter Supply Stores. I was using Moore's office and Clark gave his name and asked if I would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210056"/>
               <p>give him information with regard to the company. I suggested he should call back and see Mr. Moore, but he was anxious to have the information at once. I found some papers relating to the Stores in Mr. Moore's box. I told him that the accounts which were in draft prepared by Moore were only approximate. I gave him approxi<lb/>mately the figures which were on the papers. I had not examined the accounts of the Stores, and did not know who supplied the figures to Moore. I did not give them as figures I could vouch for myself. I have assisted Mr. Moore for the past few years. I was uncertain whether Moore had papers in connection with the Stores, but I knew where he kept his papers, and I had access to the box in which they were kept, and I searched and found them. I went to 39, Lombard Street, in October, 1906. I left Moore's office in April, 1906, but between that and October I frequently called back again to assist him. I was employed at Lombard Street continuously from Octo<lb/>ber, 1906, to the time of my arrest. I was arrested at that office I was no party to ordering goods from any of the firms mentioned. I gave an order to Long and Co. for shirts and things for myself and paid for them. I produce the receipt, which was in my pocket-book mat the time of my arrest. The credit for eight guineas was for ser<lb/>vices rendered. It was an agreed figure which I was to receive from Long and Co. to write up their books, which I was never able to do. That was the cause of my attending there, and also attending Mar<lb/>shall and Snelgrove's at the request of Mr. Clifton, asking them to give him time. I insisted on being paid for the time I had wasted. Credit is given me in that account, and the balance was paid in cash. This is the first time a criminal charge has been made against me. The date of the bill is September 13, 1906.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. J.P. Grain. I have known Moore about 15 years, intimately, and his family. During that time he unques<lb/>tionably bore a perfectly honourable character. I occupied a seat in his office before his bankruptcy, which was brought about, I have heard, by his becoming party to some bills for others. He was a Common Councilman of the City of London for years, and occupied many other positions, honorary and otherwise, with reference to different institutions, He was a member of the Painters Company. His firm was the Australian Copper Company, by whom he was paid a salary for doing secretarial work. He was paid a monthly cheque. He had leave to do other professional work. I had my own clientele, but at times assisted Moore. He had a fairly good clientele—good firms whose books he audited.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Leycester. I agree that before giving a man a reference it is one's duty to make inquiries as to whether the statements made are true. I have never been an exporter. I first had a place in Moore's office about the latter end of 1902. I had access to the office, but not a continuous seat. I had an office in 1905 at 53, Bolswick Street, Portland Road, for six months, used exclusively for my accountant's business. I never used St. Mary Axe</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210057"/>
               <p>for any purpose. A man named Coleman also had a seat in Moore's office. So far as business was concerned, I was on confidential terms with Moore. I audited people's books for him, but not those of any firm named here. I knew Mr. Hermann Braun and have seen Mr. Shepherd. Shepherd was not Goodman. I never heard of Graham. I saw Shepherd once. I was only at Braund Brothers' on two occa<lb/>sions. My first connection with Goodman was with regard to Robin<lb/>son and Co., which was wound up. I had been book-keeper to it. That was a company alleged to be promoted by Goodman. (Mr. Thorne asked his lordship to take a note of his objection that the pro<lb/>motion and winding up of the company had been brought out im<lb/>properly by Mr. Leycester.) (Cross-examination continued.) I did not know he was connected with Braun Brothers. Mr. Braun wanted me to prepare a statement of his accounts, but I was too busy other wise. I was a reference for Braun Brothers once. I forget the cir<lb/>eumstances under which it was given. It was about the beginning or middle of 1905. I knew very little about them, but I had known Braun for two or three years. I had no business transactions with Braun Brothers, and no money passed between us. Clifton was in<lb/>troduced to me. I knew nothing about his business except that I saw 20 or 30 women at work at Soho Square at the latter end of 1905. I knew Vincent, who was then connected with a mineral water com<lb/>pair. I knew he had the business of J.H. Vincent and Co. in Meddox Street. I think it was a solvent business. I have not worked as an accountant for them. As far as I knew, the business at 4, Market Place was Vincent's. I did not know Vincent and Rothenstein nor Walker. I had nothing to do with Goodman in the winding up. I knew he was concerned in some way in Braun Brothers. I only gathered he had access to the office. I remember Inspector Pantin in October, 1905, seeing me at Palmerston House. He told me he had made some inquiries with regard to Braun Brothers, and advised me not to have anything further to do with them. It was before that that I had taken the offices at 71 and 73, St. Mary Axe to oblige Goodman to set up a business with his brother. I have seen his Brother. He did not set up in business there; he was unable to because of the sanitary authorities. The premises were retained from September, 1905. to September, 1906, and I was nomi<lb/>nally the tenant end signed the agreement and was responsible for the rent. I did not know whether the sanitary authorities were there for a twelvemonth or not. I know now that no rent was paid. I do not know of any proceedings against me. The first intimation I had that there was an action pending was seeing the case in the morning paper. I went round to St. Mary Axe and discovered it. An affidavit was put before me to swear. I emphatically and indig<lb/>nantly refused to sign it and walked out of the place. I have since been told judgment was given against me; I do not know for what. I believe there was a compromise without my authority to settle for £25 and costs and to give up possession. At the time I had nothing to do with it I took the premises for Goodman because he was an</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210058"/>
               <p>undischarged bankrupt. I thought if the business was made success<lb/>ful I should be appointed auditor. I knew my responsibility if he did not pay the rent. I did not pay it because the place was untenant<lb/>able, and I was advised there was a good action for damages against the landlord for letting them. For my own purposes I had no need of the premises. I think I asked Moore to be a reference for me. I understand Vincent was a reference. He had known me for some years as an accountant. I never saw the reference. I had known Braun for two or three years. I mentioned that I only nominally took the premises. I did not endorse a cheque, "A. Doig, manager" I had no idea the correspondence of Long and Co. was being con<lb/>ducted from that address. I always understood the premises were quite unusable for any purpose. It is not true I was at Long and Co.'s every day. I never saw the books. I saw bundles of invoices I was called in about April, 1906. I had nothing to do with making out a balance-sheet for them. The only reason I could not see the books was that for the few mornings that I called Clifton had gone out and had not left the books out. I never knew the brokers were in. I saw no one there but the girls and the manageress. I called on Marshall and Snelgrove's for Long. I did not tell Mr. Bright that if they did not stay proceedings it would mean bankruptcy. Mr. Seton's version of the matter is correct. I did not discuss it with Bright at all. I never opened letters addressed to Clifton, and did not conduct any of his correspondence. I knew nothing about the letter from Long and Co. to Ellison and did not sign it. The signa<lb/>ture is like the one to another letter which I admit signing, but I am certain I did not sign it. It is not the only instance in which my handwriting has been imitated. I have no idea by whom unless it was a clerk employed by Long and Co. I had no knowledge of Exhibit 134, I think. I say I am positive. I do not remember such a letter. Since you have told me the importance of it I know I should have remembered it. I never saw nor heard of it. I wrote Moore's reference to Ellison on July 27. I had no knowledge whether it was true or not. It was written on the same date as the letter of Long's, in which somebody had imitated my hand writ<lb/>ing. I wrote a letter for Mr. Moore at the same time to J. and N. Philips, dated August 27, at Moore's request, not upon my own ini<lb/>tiative or knowledge. I never heard that Long and Co. had been sold up at 10a. Soho Square and 6a, Steward Street. I did not hear of the bankruptcy petition against Clifton on August 18—nine days before. I had not heard of Armitage and Rigby's complaint, or of the brokers being in. I wrote it in perfectly good faith for Moore. I had assisted Moore in the preparation of the balance-sheet and accounts of W.H. Cross when Cross was at 70, Fulham Road, I think in 1904. I did not know Moore was a reference for him in January, 1906. I had nothing to do with the accounts at the end of 1905 or beginning of 1906. I did not know that in February Moore had had a letter of complaint from Mr. Luck about W.H. Cross nor did I know that Cross had gone bankrupt on February 13. I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210059"/>
               <p>may have beard of it since. I heard since that he had sold the busi<lb/>ness to Adler, but not at the time. I knew nothing about the affairs of the Outfitters' Supply Stores, or Adler's, or Coleman's, or Bury s, or Croat's since 1904. I remember Mr. Clark calling upon me from Harris and Co. in September, 1906, and gave him some figures with regard to the stores from papers I found in Moore's tin box. I have no idea where those papers are now. I knew they were founded on an investigation by Moore. I have no reason to doubt the figures. Mr. Clark produced here, that I gave him, are correct: Stock, £1,500; fixtures, £250; cash at bank, £100 or £120; liabilities, £900, showing a balance of assets over liabilities of practically £1,000. I did not know that three days before Moore had refused to give a reference for those people. I cannot say whether the papers I found in Moore's tin box were in his writing. They were not in mine. I asked Mr. Clark whether he would be sending the goods, and he said he could not without first consulting his principal. The Stores had rung up Palmerston House to find out whether the reference had been accepted, and whether the goods were to be sent. That struck me as extraordinary. I told the inquirer that I did not know whether I should be doing right in giving him the figures, but as he seemed anxious to know, I would give him the approximate figures. I told him they were only rough accounts. I understood that the reference I gave was not at all satisfactory, and they did not supply the goods. The information I gave them was too meagre. Exhibit 65 is my letter to Mr. Denny as a reference for Mr. Vincent when he was taking 24, Finsbury Square in October, 1906. I did not state that I knew his financial position. I said I thought he would not enter into any obligation which he did not think he could fulfil, and that I thought that they would find him a desirable tenant. I had heard he had not paid all his rent, but had left 4, Market Place on a compromise with his landlord. I did not know he had not paid his rent at Maddox Street. I gave the reference because I had always known him to be an honourable man. The letter purported to come from the London Export Packing Company, so that apparently a letter had been sent to me there which was forwarded by the per<lb/>son there, whoever they were. I do not know why a letter should he addressed to me to the London Packing Company. The only thing I can think is that Vincent did not know where to write me, and thought that if he gave my address there the letter would reach me. It did reach me, with a sheet of paper enclosed to answer it upon. I saw Felman twice at St. Mary Axe. I have no idea what he was there for. I answered the letter on the Packing Company's paper because the letter was addressed there and the sheet of paper was enclosed. I thought it was a fair reference to give. It might have been better judgment had I used another address. I received Exhibit 319F, the date of which is November 24. At that time I had not seen Goodman nor Clifton nor anybody else, and one night I taw Clifton at Earl's Court Station, when he told me there was a question of his bankruptcy, and asked me if I could prepare his state<lb/>ment</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210060"/>
               <p>of affairs. I said I could not, and I did not. I told him to go to the Official Receiver, and tell him the whole of the facts, and that if I could bring him and Goodman together I would do so. I communicated his letter to Goodman, and be read it. He said he would meet Clifton on the Monday evening at seven o'clock as sug<lb/>gested, according to my pencil note on the card. I did not discuss matters with him at all. I do not know how that letter was found at 46. Artillery Lane. I did not keep my correspondence there.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I saw the solicitor, Mr. Raphael, about the rent of St. Mary Axe. He never sent me in a bill of costs for that action.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). My name is Philip Adler, and am a carpenter by trade. I received two years' education at a board school. I left in Standard III., the highest being ex-VII. I worked for my brother-in-law as a cabinet-maker for six months. I served a four years' apprenticeship. After that I went as a carpenter for two years with Ashby Brothers. After that I was out of employ<lb/>ment for a twelvemonth, and then I was introduced to the London Export Packing Company. I saw Goodman, who said he would give me a trial. He asked me to write a letter of application to be able to judge from (produced). That was the early part of 1906. Goodman said the writing was not good enough for correspondence, but he would see if I were of any use to him at all. He said later on he might be able to put me into a shop to learn the hosiery trade. I told him I should want at least 20s. a week. Then I went into the employment of the London Export Packing Company, taking the name of J.M run because I was told to change my name, it being too Jewish. I have always used the name of Martin since then. I know the man named Adler who has been mentioned. I am not he It is true that when I went to get certain keys I signed "Barker." I also told the police officer my name was Barker. I got rather frightened. I was contemplating taking the name of Barker pro<lb/>perly. I go out with a young lady named Barker, and she wanted me to take an English name. I wanted to take it legally. I was general messenger at St. Mary Axe. I swept out the shop and took parcels, and had nothing to do with the management or the corre<lb/>spondence. I fetched no books from Soho Square. I never saw Edwards in my life. I went to Willesden Green because I was told to go there with messages. I was also told to go round to Steward Street and to stop there and I stopped. I was away from London from July 26 till August 6, camping out with the Jewish Lads' Bri<lb/>gade, of which I am instructor. I did not tell Goldstein that I was only the manager, but that I was only the messenger. I never signed for a parcel "Long and Co." It is true that I told Johns when he called at Steward Street that the work hands were on strike. There was a strike on. I had seen the crowds marching in the East End. After leaving St. Mary Axe I went to Finsbury Square, and afterwards to Artillery Lane, and was there until the arrest. My duties were the same, running messages. I did no know Braun</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210061"/>
               <p>Brothers, and had nothing to do with Vincent. I never gave any reference or bought any goods, or had anything to do with the finance of the business or with the management. There was a typewriter at St. Mary Axe named Joe, and he did all the typewriting there and at Finsbury Square. I used to practise on the typewriter in Artil<lb/>lery Lane. I never typed a letter on it which was sent away by post. I was learning it. I knew that Clifton was bankrupt some time whilst I was at Steward Street. I did not know at the end of 1906. The affidavit which I swore to the effect that Clifton owed me £250 was not written by me nor was the affidavit read to me by the Commissioner when I swore it. Mr. Ralli took me to the solicitor and paid the fee. I did not know the contents of the affidavit till I was at the police court. I did not know what the affidavit was. Mr. Goodman told me to go with Ralli to swear the affidavit, and that it was only a matter of form. I did not type the letter to the poet office at Theydon Bois, and had nothing to do with its com<lb/>position. It was not read to me. I first knew its contents at the police court. It was put before me to put my name to. That is Exhibit 187. I had not given an address to friends at Fernside. I do not know who live there. It used to be occupied by a relative of Goodman, I believe. The cancelled bills which were found on me by the police officer were given me to exchange the stamps. I have constantly visited Willesden this year to see the young lady to whom I have referred.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Elkin. Ralli did not ask me to go with him to swear the affidavit. I expect he was told to take me. Good<lb/>man told me to go with him. The conversation was at St. Mary Axe. I think Ralli took me to Camomile Street or Wormwood street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Leycester. I was told to go to Somerset House with the bills. I was office boy and messenger, not at 10a, Soho Square, but at Steward Street, St. Mary Axe, Finsbury Square, and Artillery Lane, and I never suspected anything wrong in any of them. I went to 60, High Road with messages. I had no idea who the business belonged to at any time. Adler is my father. It is not Max Adler, but Maurice Adler. I was living with him. I never knew he was supposed to have bought 60, High Road from W.H. Cross. I do not know where he is now. I never saw my father with Goodman, nor at Artillery Lane or Finsbury Square, or 60, High Road. I knew Clifton. I spoke of him as Long and Co., but I regarded Goodman as my master and he paid me my wages. I do not remember calling on Goldstein and saying I represented Long and Co. I called for the keys, but I knew nothing about any arrange<lb/>ments. I went to Steward Street every day. There were two work-people employed there altogether about three or four weeks. One worked four or five weeks. I was not there all the time from May 18 to August 22. On one occasion I went to Soho Square to fetch a parcel for Goodman. I took it to St. Mary Axe. There were not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210062"/>
               <p>many letters at Steward Street. I was not there every morning. I do not remember Goldstein when he called there saying that the whole thing was a swindle. He said he wanted the rent. I did not get suspicious. He is mistaken when he says I said, "I am only the manager." I am just on 24 years of age. I took in a good many goods at Steward Street addressed to Long and Co. I do not know what became of them. I have no idea what became of the sewing machines. I do not know whether they went to any auction rooms. I remember Mr. Raper calling once. I told him the sewing machines were at Soho Square, which I believed was true. I did not know Long and Co. were out of Soho Square at that time or that the brokers were in. I do not remember Johns calling for Fevez Freres' account I remember telling him there was a strike of workers. I remember he called and wanted his money. I do not know whether he got it or not. I remember the bailiffs being in. I used to take the letters to Mr. Goodman at St. Mary Axe—letters addressed to Mr. Long. The relative of Goodman who lived at Fernside was not named "J. Mar<lb/>tin." I never wrote the letter beginning "Dear Sirs, I have given my address to several friends as Fernside," but I signed it. I had no idea what it was for and I have none now. I never read it. I was at St. Mary Axe nearly every day. Felman called about six or seven times. I did not know he was having goods from there. I knew nothing about any trouble with regard to the rent. I was a very few times at High Road. I was sent down to help when goods were being taken away in November to Hurlock's. I went with one of the vans to Hurlock's, where the goods were delivered. I went to 60, High Road two or three times after the General Outfitters had cleared out to collect the letters. I was told to ask Mrs. Jory for the rent, and I did. I did not know they left 60, High Road without paying the rent. I was at Finsbury Square every day. I did not see many goods coming in. This pawnticket shown to me is for a cricket bat and some hockey sticks. I got them from St. Mary Axe. I do not know they were goods which had been supplied on credit by Mr. Nutton. I do not remember who gave them to me to pawn. I had the money. I called for the keys of Artillery Lane and was there every day and saw Felman there. I saw him look at some hats, which I knew had come from Messrs. Best. From May until July I was employed at Steward Street, and when I came back from my holiday I went to St. Mary Axe. I never went to Steward Street again. I re<lb/>mained at St. Mary Axe until October. Then they cleared out of there and I went to Finsbury Square. From March or April I was st. Artillery Lane till arrested by Cleveland. He told me he arrested me for being concerned with others, mentioning their names, in a conspiracy to defraud and to obtain foods by fraud. I said, "I don't know what you mean. I have not obtained any goods. I have only been with this firm a week or two." I had been there from April or May up to June 28. Cleveland then said, "The charge does not refer to goods while you have been here," and I said, "I do not know anything about any other firm." I meant I had been employed by the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210063"/>
               <p>same man. I had no idea why he was always changing his name. It sever occurred to me it was for the purpose of fraud.</p>
               <p>To the Jury. My father introduced me to Goodman. I was out of work and he told me he would he able to do something for me. The bills were given to me by Vincent.</p>
               <p>I was not doing anything with the business cards of Macdonald and Co. which were found on me. I expect they were in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I regarded Long and Co., Macdonald and Co., and the London Export Company as one firm. My father is illiterate, unable to write a word of English. He knew nothing at all about Willesden Road. I genuinely believed there was business going to be carried on at Steward Street, where there were work-people and machines. The amount I got on the goods pawned, two sticks and one cricket bat, was 5s.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner on oath). My real name is Israel Israel I have been known by the name of John Ralli from 15 to 20 years I am a tailor and outfitter and a commission agent in bill discount ing. If the transactions are risky I get a little more on them. I was introduced to W.H. Cross and was with him for about a fort<lb/>night at Fulham. When he opened the business in Willesden Green I was manager at 55s. a week and 1 per cent, commission on the turnover. Mr. Maurice Adler was Mr. Cross's successor, and after<lb/>wards Mr. Coleman. I acted as manager all through. Afterwards it changed hands again to Mr. Berry, and I was with him in the same capacity. I received my salary from those four men. I did all the work in the shop—13s. 6d. a week I paid for rent. I have paid on an average from 10s. 6d. to 13s. 6d. a week for the last six years. While managing the business at Willesden Green I had control of the money till the proprietors came for it, when I had to hand it over. Prior to going to Willesden I was employed by Braun Brothers, Mr. Hermann Braun, at 30s. per week. That changed hands to Shepherd, and I got the same salary under him. After that I had no business with Braun. I have no recollection of writing any letter in the name of Ralli. I did ask Goldstein, at the request of Clifton, to give the latter further time for the payment of rent. I had no connection with Steward Street. I used to introduce clients to Clifton for shirts, for which I got a commission. I was never known in any name but Ralli. I called on Roberta at the re<lb/>quest of Adler, who was my master. I called on Beckett in respect of the fixtures on behalf of Paul Berry. I bought the fittings at Willesden Green for Coleman, on monthly terms. I gave him the reference given to me to give him by Coleman, who was then the proprietor. It is a deliberate lie when Mr. Gray says that when it became a question of paying I told him we did not do little people, but only did big firms. I did not say so. I said, "These are not little people; you will get your account." That was after I had asked him to send for a police officer, and if I was doing anything wrong to give me in charge. I did not benefit in any way by the goods which have been obtained. The name "Ralli" was given me by J.R. Dale and Co. when I was working for them in Westbourne Grove fifteen years ago.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Leycester. My connection with Goodman dates from 1901, when I was director of Robinson and Co., a com<lb/>pany promoted by him. I was not in business with him as Referred and Co. I was then in business with another firm. I do not think I have been actually Goodman's servant, nor have we been employed by the same people. He was not in the service of Braun Brothers He was acting in the next office as the Merca Society, with which I had nothing to do. I left Braun Brothers when they were ejected, when the firm ceased to exist. Mr. Braun had sold the business to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210065"/>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd about three or four months before the end came. I never connected Shepherd with Goodman. I have seen Shepherd, who paid me my wages at the latter part. I met Braun before Good<lb/>man came on the scene at all. Braun Brothers had some goods from Long and Co. I think they paid for them. I could net tell you how many transactions. I was in sole control of Braun Brothers at times, but my whole time was not given there. I think that was some time in 1904, at 65, Fenchurch Street, but my memory is very bad. I have been in charge of the place many times. I remember swearing the affidavit in the action of Horton and Richards in July, 1906. At that time I cannot say whether Braun or Shepherd was the proprietor. I see in my affidavit I said Braun had already sold to Shepherd, and that would be so. Shepherd was there pretty well all day. I remem<lb/>ber one parcel of goods, seven dozen white shirts, which Braun had of Long. They sold some calico to Long. There were three or four such transactions. I do not know how they were paid for. Both Braun and Shepherd were very suspicious men. I do not know why Goodman was superintending the packing of Braun Brothers' papers when they were ejected from Fenchurch Street. I do not know whether those papers were moved to St. Mary Axe. I went there sometimes three times a week, at the same time as I called on other houses of business close to there. I was at Long and Co.'s perhaps twice a week, but sometimes not for three weeks. My visits there had nothing to do with Goodman. I think I have met Goodman at Soho Square once. My business was with Clifton, canvassing for orders and selling goods for him on commission. I never sold any to Hurlocks. I never knew the brokers were at Soho Square or that Long and Co. were in difficulties; on the contrary, I heard there was a partner coming into the firm with £800. His name was Roberts. I never saw his £800. I did not go to Steward Street twice the whole time. I was told the brokers were in there, and that they were in difficulties. I saw two or three machines going there, but business was not very active. Mr. Adler—the man who is called Martin—was in control there, and with him was a man with a beard called Rubin. I have seen the latter at 46, Artillery Lane. I think he did the typewriting. He was not "Joe." I called on Goldstein three or four times. I did not tell him I was head traveller for Long and Co. I told him Long was at Margate and I did not know his address. I told him he had gone on to Paris and I did not know his address there. Clifton asked me to call before he left. He went suddenly; I believe his wife was taken ill. He left me no address. I thought he was a little pressed at the time. I have known Robinson from 1900. I had nothing to do with his taking Maddox Street. I did not call with a representative of the Merca Society. Business at Maddox Street was not very active, but I law costumes which had been made. The business was that of J.H. Vincent and Co. I saw Vincent there. He also carried on business st. Market Place. I witnessed the agreement for Market</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210066"/>
               <p>Place because I was asked to. I was employed at High Road from September, 1905, to December, 1906, and was in control first on behalf of Cross and then of Adler. I do not know what it was sold for, but it was a genuine sale so far as I know. Stuff was bought; I do not know whether it was on credit. I never saw people come for their money. I never saw any of Cross's creditors. Adler paid me my wages from December until he sold to Coleman. Adler was never known as Max Adler, but as Maurice Adler. I do not know his position, but he was respectably dressed. I first called on Hayes on behalf of Cross in taking the premises, with Cross. Afterwards I called on Hayes to tell him the business had been transferred to Adler, and afterwards I called on Roberts. He would not accept Adler as a tenant. I offered the rent but he would not take it. I remember Munt Brown. The name used in his case was the General Outfitters and Supply Stores. Goods were supplied; I do not know whether they were paid for. I told Munt Brown the Stores had bought the business for £2,000, which I believed. I also called upon Hodson Jack. I was there about once a week for a month. I said I was buying for M. Adler, not Max. I did not buy goods to the amount of £63 3s. 10d. Those were bought in the shop by Mr. Wood There was no reason why they should not be paid for as it was a prosperous business. My orders did not amount to £10 from Hodson Jack. I ordered goods from Harding and Co., giving the name of Israel, because I had bought goods of them under that name when I was manager for Charles Baker and Co. I told him I was manager to the General Supply Stores. I do not think I ordered goods there to the value of £70. I did not order many goods from a number of other people; I bought very little, only what was really required. I served the customers, dressed the windows, and brushed and kept the stock. I saw Goodman there once or twice. I remember going to Radin's about September, 1906. I think the business then be<lb/>longed to Coleman. I was simply a working man there. I did not know goods were not being paid for. I saw Mr. Radin himself. I do not remember seeing Gray. I said we never gave deposits and we would take a month. I said, "The terms I am to buy on are thirty days." He did not say he would have to have them made. They were very ordinary things. It is not true that my agreement was to pay cash. I do not know whether Long and Co. were given as reference. I think I had heard that they were bankrupt at that time. Gray called on October 11 and told me I had given him a fraudulent reference, as Long and Co. were already bankrupt. He shewed me the "Drapers' Record." I told him Mr. Long was taking a partner and it would be all right. I thought Long was going into Steward Street with a partner. The landlord distrained at 60, High Road in October. I tendered Roberts the rent on behalf of Coleman. I have seen Coleman several times. He had an office at Palmerston Hcuse also. I do not know that his business was that of a whiskey distiller. I do not know where Coleman and Cross are now. I understand that Cross never appeared for his examination in bank<lb/>ruptcy.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210067"/>
               <p>The business was sold to Bury in November, 1906. The only application which was made to me from a creditor of Coleman was with regard to lamps. They had been ordered by Coleman and Bury repudiated responsibility, but that account for lamps was paid. Goodman was not there when Tritton called about the lamps. I do not know how Goodman came to be selling stock to Hurlocks. Bury told me to re-mark the goods at a profit of 25 per cent, on the cost. In some cases I had the tickets taken off and re-marked for Hurlocks. Hurlocks knocked 35 per cent. off. I believe that was the arrangement, but I did not know they had bought until the last and had nothing to do with it. There were some robber goods from Moseley's, but I do not think they went to Hurlock's. Goodman supplied the stores with some bicycle capes. When the fittings were removed I did not know that Radin's portion had not been paid for. That was only £9 and the fittings were worth £200. Gray said it had not been paid for. I never mentioned Good<lb/>man's name in connection with payment. I did not say, "We are not amateurs at this work; we have had 10 or 15 years' experience." I regarded Petricus as the tenant of 46, Artillery Lane. I did not propose to take any premises on behalf of Coleman; I went to take them for Petricus. I called at Artillery Lane nearly every day to see if they had any commissions for me. I was not in the employ of Walker and Co. I have seen Feldman at Finsbury Square. I was not in the habit of calling at the bank for them. I was asked to write Exhibit 222 by Vincent, trading as McDonald and Co. It is a refer<lb/>ence for Walker to Beat. That reference on which the hate were ob<lb/>tained is in my writing, and I tried to sell them. Exhibit 84 from the London Export Packing Company is in my writing and I initialed it, but I was not employed by them. I understood Doig was conduct<lb/>ing it. I was not constantly there. I wrote Exhibit 86 to Hayes and Co. on behalf of Mr. Cross with regard to taking the premises at 60, High Road. For six months I was at 65, Fenchurch Street, once or twice at Maddox Street, perhaps a dozen times at St. Mary Axe, twice at Market Place, and witnessed the agreement. I was in control at 60, High Road. I visited 24, Finsbury Square and Artillery Lane. I never had any suspicion with regard to one of those places that a dishonest business was being carried on. I have had no benefit of say kind except my salary. If the prosecution can prove I have reaped any benefit out of this I will willingly suffer. I endorsed a cheque from Walker and Co. for £10 14s., but I never had any of the money. I never went by the name of John Rowli. The Rowli who gave a reference was not I. The cheque for £3 2s. was not endorsed by me. I got an advance for McDonald and Co. on some cricket bats from a Mr. Hawkins—£10—which I handed to Vincent. I did not know they were obtained on credit. The two cheques on the same date handed to me, 322 and 333, from Hawkins are payable to Good<lb/>man. That is the money I received and handed to Vincent. It was on a Saturday and the money was required for wages, and the cheques were made payable to Goodman because I thought he could</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210068"/>
               <p>probably get them cashed. A Mr. Rubin, who I believe was going into partnership with Petricus, asked me to act for Petricus in obtain<lb/>ing premises at 46, Artillery Lane. I asked Hawkins to make the cheques payable to Goodman. It was after hours at the bank and I got them cashed at a public-house and handed the money to Vincent.</p>
               <p>(prisoner, on oath). I am 55 years of age and a married man with a grown-up family. I first had offices in Palmerston House in 1886. I have never had a word said against my character for probity and honesty. In 1891 I became a member of the Chartered Accountants' Society and did not cease to be so until I became bankrupt in 1905. I then retired according to rule. I became a member of the Common Council in 1895 and continued so till 1903 or 1904, when I was defeated on the poll by about three votes. I am still a Liveryman of the Painters' Company. I have oc<lb/>cupied many positions in the City and acted as honorary secretary to different institutions. In 1886 I became connected with the English and Australian Copper Company, which is still in existence and has for some years paid a dividend. Its offices were at Palmerston Build<lb/>ings till quite recently. In 1885 or 1886 I was appointed by the Committee of Inspection to go through their books and give them a general statement on the affairs of the company. After that I was appointed secretary in 1886 and 1887; they sent me to Australia to look after their business. I was there about eight or nine months and came back and reported. From that time I continued as secre<lb/>tary and accountant, and was in that position when arrested on July 8 I had to provide the offices and clerks and received £300 a year by monthly cheque. I was permitted to act independently as an ac<lb/>countant, and acted in that capacity to a number of companies, even after my bankruptcy. Doig had permission to use my office. I first became acquainted with my co-prisoners in 1902 or 1903, the first being Goodman, whom I looked upon as a man of honesty and finan<lb/>cial means. Doig I have known for a good many years. The re<lb/>mainder I became acquainted with through Goodman in 1905. When in financial trouble I went to Goodman, who said he could assist me. He introduced me to Long and Co., and I prepared a statement from their books. I went to them in Soho Square, I think, about 6 or 7 p.m. and saw Clifton, whom I knew as Long. They produced certain books to me, and I took out extracts of the debts due and owing. Then they sent me a stock list, which I incorporated with their balance-sheet. It was really not a balance-sheet, but a statement. I took the materials for the ultimate result from books. I had the stock sheets and a banker's book presented to me. There was a balance of £8 in the bank book, which I pointed out to Clifton, saying, "You have £118 down in this statement. Where is the other hundred pounds?" He said, "I have cheques and cash in hand, which I am going to pay in to-morrow," I took his assurance and certified the £118. I saw the pass-book, but not the cash book. I acted professionally, and be<lb/>lieved the figures were correct. I received five guineas for my ser<lb/>vices.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210069"/>
               <p>I gave a reference, naming those figures, believing them to be correct. In reply to Exhibit 134 I wrote to Armitage and Rigby saying I had made up the figures to November 1, 1905. I made some inquiries either from Long and Co or from Goodman, and I was asked to make a further inspection of their books, which I did. I wrote Exhibits 259 and 260 to Messrs. Cox and Edwards. There was £200 less in stock than the time before, which I considered was the result of trading. I believed I had ascertained the true state of affairs so far as figures were concerned. I checked the pass-book, but did not see the cash book. It was only a statement of liabilities and assets. I would not look at the cash book in preparing a statement of liabili<lb/>ties and assets, and I did not use it. I accepted the stock sheets as correct. I had no complaint of my reference of Long and Co. from anyone else. I was introduced to Cross and Co., and went to Fulham Road, and was asked to prepare a statement of affairs. I asked Doig to do it for me, as I was engaged in other business. He prepared a statement for Cross, which, of course, I accepted, knowing was a capable accountant, and acted upon the figures in good faith. Mr. Luck warned me with regard to the reference, and I gave no refer<lb/>ence to Cross and Co. after that. I had believed they were carrying on an honest business. I made inquiries, and found they had become the Public Supply Stores. I never saw any account of the Stores at all. When I inquired I was surprised to find that Cross had become bankrupt. I did not know of one single order given by any of these firms which had open mentioned. When I was rather hard up, before my monthly cheque became due from the Copper Company, I asked Goodman if he would advance me up to the amount till the end of the month, and he said he would. I paid a cheque at the end of the month. Another time I think I gave him a cheque, and asked him to give me the money, as I required it in sums of £1 or £2, and he did. Then there were some cheques, which I cashed for him through my tradespeople, and gave him the money. But beyond that I re<lb/>ceived nothing. I never received any of the proceeds of any of these obtainings, of whatever character they are. It was in 1903 or 1904 that I put my name to some bills, for a gentleman holding a position in the City, upon which I was liable, and judgment was recovered against me on some of them. That was the sole cause of my bank<lb/>ruptcy. If there is a favourable issue to this trial I have reason to believe I shall go back into the employ of the company whose servant I was till the day of the arrest.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Stock Exchange, and have known Martin seven years, and have found him trustworthy. At one time he assisted me to dress my damaged arm, and I left papers and money about my room, and had to trust him. His general reputation was good. He was not considered a smart boy.

               <p>details were prepared from his books and I did it at Palmerston House. Moore overlooked what I had done and I believe checked it. recalled, cross-examined. I have been an accountant 20 years, have had considerable experience, and think myself competent. I have known Goodman four or five years. I have known Coleman for two years as agent for a firm, and heard that he had purchased 60, High Road. I believe he is now in America. I first knew Clifton in 1905, when he was introduced by Goodman, and I was asked to prepare a statement of Long and Co.'s affairs. I saw Vincent at Goodman's place. I have seen Berg, of Berg and Leslie—I never knew him by the name of Bury or Burgess, Braun Brothers proposed to buy Berg and Leslie's business and they asked me to go over the stock, which I did, and Braun purchased it. I heard long afterwards that Berg and Leslie shortly afterwards became bankrupt. I have called at 65, Fenchurch Street and 71, St. Mary Axe to see Goodman. I understood that the St. Mary Axe premises were taken by for Goodman. I was once at 46, Artil<lb/>lery Lane. I can only account for some of my letter paper being found there by the fact that Goodman once got me a packet from his printer and he may have retained some of it. The day Martin was arrested I had gone to see Goodman and was outside talking to Rubin. I was told of the arrest. I have never been to 6A, Steward Street Braun Brothers said they wanted me to be their accountant. They were doing an export and import business with the Cape, where they had connections, and they wanted to know exactly how to send out goods on bill of lading and get cash from the bank, and I was to arrange that for them. I only saw Braun about it; I did not know Goodman was carrying on the business. I gave one or two references while Braund was carrying it on. I have no recollection of Pentin warning me and about them. I never had any suspicion there was anything wrong with Braun Brothers. I had a letter from Vin<lb/>cent and Co. asking me to act as their accountant. I made inquiries about him and gave a reference to the landlord of 4, Market Place on Goodman's information. I did not know that he had left Maddox Street without paying his rent. Exhibit 64 is, I think, on paper which Goodman got printed for me. It is not my letter and I do not know the writing or the signature. If I had been asked for a second reference I should have made further inquiries—should have wanted to know why Vincent left Maddox Street. I never saw W.H. Cross's books. I was told they were at my office, and a statement was made out to October 25, 1905. This is a draft of the statement of affairs in the handwriting of and the other is a fair copy of the final result. It shows a balance of assets over liabilities of £1,007. The account was prepared in my office, and I accepted it as correct. Doig prepared it. I heard some time afterwards that Cross had failed in the following spring. Must have been deceived in drawing up this balance-sheet. I do not remember anyone calling on me in Novem<lb/>ber, 1905, about Cross. I may have shown him this balance-sheet show<lb/>ing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210071"/>
               <p>£1,000 surplus and said that I should not have signed it if I had not been satisfied that the stock £1,500 was correct. Doig had the stock-sheets, which I usually accept from the proprietors of the busi<lb/>ness—that is the practice of accountants. I produced the balance-sheet to Luck in January, 1906, and gave Cross a reference. I had no suspicion that he was in difficulties. I told Luck that Cross was going to take a substantial partner. I explained it fully to Lock be<lb/>cause I knew him, that I had drawn out this statement of affairs, and I considered Cross good for £100. I was basing my information on this sheet and that alone. I got the letter of Wynne Baxter and Co. and was very indignant at the deceit practised on me. I went to Goodman about it, and also to Doig. I wrote the letters produced to Wynne Baxter and Co. I afterwards wrote the reference produced from Adler. Goodman told me he had bought the business for a con<lb/>siderable amount of money from Cross—I think £2,000 with £900 down. I had no suspicion that I was being deceived. The reference given by Doig in August, 1906, after Coleman had bought the busi<lb/>ness, was not by my authority. I did not know that Coleman had purchased. I refused to give a reference for Coleman to Clarke. I never heard of Clarke coming to my office afterwards. Doig must have given the information to Clarke in September, 1906, on the papers with regard to Cross's business made up in October, 1905. I gave a reference for Coleman as to 46, Artillery Lane, be<lb/>cause Coleman told me he was likely to get an agency for whisky, and he required a store. I then knew of his connection with 60, High Road, but did not know that the business had come to grief or that they had cleared out in December, 1906. Long and Co. was intro<lb/>duced to me by Goodman in October, 1905, and I went to 10a, Soho Square, to examine the books; they were made up to date. At I was preparing a statement, not a balance-sheet, I only examined the ledgers to get the assets and liabilities, which I took from the balances in the ledgers. I cannot find the statement I made. I was asked for it by Mr. Blow, the trustee in Clifton's bankruptcy, on November, 1906. Copy produced by Messrs. Sutcliffe is no doubt correct, show<lb/>ing stock £1,300. I took that from the stock-list given to me by Long and Co.; this is the original sent to me, and is all I knew about it. When I went to 10a, Soho Square it was a very busy place, and I thought it was a good going business from what I saw of it. I thought the figures given me were right. I took the book debts out of the ledger. With regard to "cash bank £118 6s. 4d.," I looked at the bank book and called attention to it, and was told by Clifton that he had sufficient to pay in to bring it up to the figures he had supplied. Of course, I knew Clifton then as "Long and Co." I gave references to several people on that statement—whenever I was asked. I received letter of May 16, 1906, from Armitage and Rigby, by which I found that I had been again grossly deceived in the case of Clifton, as in the case of Cross—both introduced by Goodman. I complained to Goodman; he said it was only temporary, and that Long and Co.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210072"/>
               <p>would be all right; there would be capital found. I did not go to 10a, Soho Square. I knew Goodman was going to form a company, and that all the businesses were to be joined together and a syndicate formed, and it was necessary that he should keep these people to<lb/>gether and expand their business. I took it from Armitage's letter that the brokers were in. I was afterwards asked to make another statement for Long and Co., which I did in the same way. I naturally concluded that things were going all right again. I wrote letter of November 1, 1905, to Cox and Edwards, stating that there were assets over liabilities £1,505 14s. 1d. I believed it to be true then. I sent a further letter to Cox and Edwards, showing a balance of assets over liabilities to date at £1,352 12s. 4d. I have no papers here showing how I arrived at that statement. I was not aware the brokers were then in possession. Goodman told me the business was all right. I understood he was financing the business. I may have informed Keeling, Wiles, and Co. on May 30, and have written to Fevez Freres that there was a surplus of £1,350. I have no recollection of instruct<lb/>ing Doig to write that to Ellison, or to J. and N. Phillips on August 22. Goodman asked me to come and see the new place, and I went round to 46, Artillery Lane. I had been at all the other addresses again and again. I gave references for Long and Co., Braun Brothers, Vincent, Doig. W.H. Cross, and Coleman without the slightest suspicion that they were untrue.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I carry on business as a financial agent, company promoter, and buyer of job stock lines. I first met Clifton in 1904 when I was at St. Bartholomew Lane as "Goodman and Co." In the following year I took over from Braun Brothers agency of the Mayerpoor Society, and paid Braun Brothers £? a month for the use of a part of their outer office. In September, 1905, they had difficulty with their landlord, and I left. About that time I met Doig, and told him I wanted bigger offices for my busi<lb/>ness, and he decided to take the premises, 71 and 73, St. Mary Axe. My half-brother, Rubin, who had some connection with the Conti<lb/>nent, wanted some packing premises, and he there carried on the business of the London Export Packing Company. Rubin arranged to pay the whole rent to Doig, and I paid Rubin for my user of the premises, about £1 a week, according to the amount of goods which I had there; it varied from time to time. I purchased clearing lines and stored them there—all classes of merchandise. Numerous other people used the premises as a packing place. They would write letters there and might use the paper of the London Export Packing Company; that is nothing unusual. I used the premises to about October, 1906. (To the Jury.) A day or two after we went into St. Mary Axe the sanitary authority sent a lot of workmen in, who took up the whole of the drainpipes. For months I could not get near the place, the stench was so bad. We used the place the best way we could. You could put the goods on one side—we had to—I had nothing else to use. I did not have a receipt for the rent I paid,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210073"/>
               <p>(To Mr. Thorne.) I never gave any references for the taking of pre<lb/>mises or obtaining credit for the purchase of goods. There is no truth in the suggestion that references were written on my direction. After St. Mary Axe was given up I arranged with Vincent to take part of his premises at 24, Finsbury Square for 15s. a week. Vincent was both "Vincent and Rothenstein" and "McDonald and Co." I understood Vincent and Rothenstein's business was something to do with brewers' and publicans' machinery; McDonald and Co. dealt in merchandise. Vincent knew Stanley and got a letter of introduction from him to the bank. I may have introduced Stanley to Vincent, but they had known each other for some time. I had nothing to do with the purchase or disposal of goods by Vincent and Rothenstein or McDonald and Co. I introduced Feldman for the purchase of some ties from them. I did not know where the ties had come from. When Henderson used violent language to me I told him I should kick him out. About this time I advanced money to Vincent as a finan<lb/>cial agent, and, being an undischarged bankrupt, I got Vincent to make out cheques for me, for which I gave him the cash. Vincent was never my servant. As Henderson was very unpleasant, I asked Rubin if he could give me a couple of rooms at his premises, 46, Artillery Lane, as I was going into business making motor coats and mackintoshes, which is really my business. I arranged to pay Rubin £35 a year for his two top rooms, but, as there was some manufac<lb/>turing going on there he let me use the first floor. I was there about two or three weeks. I was not "Walker and Co."—that was Petricus and Rubin; Darnell came in afterwards. I met Darnell, and he asked me to go and see the K.C. Soap Company with him. I went with him and saw the manager, and on leaving he told me he was very hard up; could I introduce him to any business. I said I could not at the moment, but I would see. He asked me to lend him a few shillings, which I did. I mentioned the matter to Rubin and intro<lb/>duced Darnell. They had a conversation and Darnell said to me, "There is a very good chance to do business here; they want a good deal of capital and I could make it go—it is a fine place and a cheap place—is there any way you could advance some money?" I said I had no security. He said I could hold the security of the shop on a document, and he told me what sort of document would be necessary. I said my wife would advance the money. He pressed me that he wanted the money for the business, and I let him have some money to open a banking account. He said, "In the meantime to secure you, I will give you the cheque book. Of course, I cannot draw any<lb/>thing and you will be able to use it." He saw Mr. Timbrell, the soli<lb/>citor, and made the document out. I showed it to my wife and she would have nothing to do with it. Of course, on the strength of that I used his rooms. Darnell was never my servant at £2 a week. I had nothing to do with the taking of 46, Artillery Lane or with the ordering of letter paper in the name of Petricus and Co. While at Artillery Lane I introduced a parcel of straw hats to Feldman from Rubin—they were very soiled. I accepted Feldman's story with re<lb/>gard</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210074"/>
               <p>to that. I kept my papers in a drawer in Rubin's room. I re<lb/>member the police coming there. Birch asked me for the key of the drawer. I said I had not got the key, but I would see if any of my keys would fit the drawer. I found one that would—it was an old-fashioned lock—and I gave the papers to Birch. I did not manage or control the business at Soho Square. I knew Clifton. He in<lb/>formed me that he was going to open a laundry business and that Cross had several shops which he was going to form into a company with the laundry. I saw Cross at Fulham Road, and he showed me the shops at Hammersmith and Victoria, which seemed to do a very good business. I consented to try and float the company, but I wanted to know their position, and said if they would have their accounts audited I would take the matter up. The accounts were audited, and I got the memorandum and articles of association pre<lb/>pared and printed by Raphael, my solicitor, Moorgate Street. Cross then purchased another business at Willesden Green, which he opened under the name of the proposed company, "The General Supply Stores, Limited." Cross was the tenant and paid the rent. My son was sent there to learn the business. I had no control of it and knew nothing of the inner working of it. I advanced money to Cross; he got into financial difficulties, and a sale was made of all his businesses. I refused to lend more money until the company was formed. Ultimately Cross came and told me he had sold his business to Adler, and that he had paid £900 in cash and, I think, 3,000 shares in a company which was going to be floated. Adler is a cos<lb/>tume manufacturer and is the father of the prisoner Martin. I advanced £500 to Adler on bills of exchange, and when the business was sold to Coleman he took over Adler's liability on those bills, fresh bills being drawn. Coleman told me he had an appointment in America and was selling the business to Bury and asked if I would accept the new incomer for the bills, which I did. I used to send in goods to High Street, Willesden, for sale or return, and I used to go there to see what they had sold. I remem<lb/>ber Feldman coming to Willesden Green with Carpenter. It is not true that Feldman introduced me under a false name. The goods dealt with at Willesden Green were absolutely my goods, and the prices paid for them were fair prices as soiled goods. With the ex<lb/>ception of payments in respect of those goods I never received, directly or indirectly, any of the profits of the business carried on at Willes<lb/>den Green. I never received any of the rent paid for the upper floor. I bought some goods from the Fore Street Warehouse Company for the General Supply Stores a few days before the Stores were shut up, for which I paid cash, but I was never repaid by the General Supply Stores for those goods, nor for other parcels of goods. I had nothing to do with the taking of the premises in which the business of the General Supply Stores was carried on, nor with its management. The account given by Feldman with regard to the sale of the fittings at Willesden Green I believe is correct. Referring to Exhibit 319, I did not make the pencil alterations. There is no truth in the suggestion</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210075"/>
               <p>that I tried to disguise myself or hide myself. I have known Ralli for some years, and have done business with him, but he bas never been in my employ. I know nothing about the typewriter which has been referred to. I have a typewriter of the same make (Armstrong), but it is at my solicitors. With regard to Martin's evidence, it is not true that I was carrying on business at Steward Street, and Martin was not regularly employed there. I never represented to any of the people from whom goods were obtained that the prisoners were sub<lb/>stantial people. I have advanced money to the various prisoners in the course of my business as a money lender, and have lost a consider<lb/>able sum. I had not the slightest suspicion that there was anything dishonest in the way the transactions in question were being con<lb/>ducted. (To the Jury.) The sales I have spoken of were not sales in the ordinary way, so I kept no books with regard to them except a little book, which I have not now. (To Mr. Methuen.) The busi<lb/>ness of the London Export Packing Company was carried on at St. Mary Axe by Reuben, and belonged to him, not to me. I carried on my business there as well, and there were various customers who had their letters addressed there. My name was not painted upon the door, but was written on a slip of paper. I cannot tell whether any other names appeared on the door. I cannot say whether the name of "Vincent and Co." was on the door or not. I was not "Vincent and Co.," nor "Vincent and Rothenstein," nor "McDonald and Co." I had nothing to do with the business of Vincent and Co. at Maddox Street, nor was I interested in it beyond advancing money. I am not a registered money lender. I knew Berg. I do not think I intro<lb/>duced him to Vincent, but the idea was that they should go into partnership and carry on the business at 22, Maddox Street, for which I advanced money; perhaps as much as £60 or £70, I am not sure. I did not take any receipt from Vincent for it. An ac<lb/>count was kept in a book. The £60 was not advanced in one sum, but in small amounts of from £5 to £10. It is not true to suggest that I never advanced any money at all. I had a bill from Vincent as security for it. I may have lent Bent small sums of money and got receipts from him, because I had not so much confidence in him as I hold in Vincent, whom I have known for some years. I had no other interest in the Maddox Street premises except lending Vin<lb/>cent money, and did not care whether he took those or any other premises. The transaction had nothing to do with the Mercur Society. Someone may have used the Mercur Society's paper to make the inquiry. I was the representative in London of the Mercur Society. I had nothing to do with the taking of 4, Market Place and did not advance any money in that case. I took no interest in the business carried on by Vincent and Co. alter advancing my money. Some of it was repaid, but I lent it again. I do not know what for. I did not take any security when I lent the money on the second occasion; it was only a small amount. The bill I mentioned was drawn by Mr. Vincent on himself; there were</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210076"/>
               <p>no other parties to it. I did not know Mr. Rothenstein, nor had I anything to do with Vincent and Rothenstein or McDonald and Co. at 24, Finsbury Square. I have not seen Exhibit 310 before. It is untrue of Vincent to say that I gave him that document with the sig<lb/>nature of Rothenstein on it. I was using part of the premises at 24, Finsbury Square for the purposes of my own business, but my name was not painted up there, nor was it written on any piece of paper and attached to the door because the arrangement was only tempo<lb/>rary and we were looking out for a manufacturing place. There was no partition in the room. I had a seat in the offices of Vincent and Rothenstein, or McDonald and Co., for which I paid something like 15s. a week. I was to pay £28 a year and a little extra for accommo<lb/>dation if Vincent attended to any of my private work. I never in<lb/>quired into the business of either Vincent or Rothenstein or McDonald and Co. I got no receipts for the 15s. per week. I was not aware that Vincent and Co. had been turned out of two successive places without paying any rent. I recollect the action being brought against Braun Brothers and the writ being served upon me and mak<lb/>ing an affidavit that I was not Braun Brothers but the representative of the Mercur Society. I did not know anything at all about Braun Brothers' business. I remember Mr. Henderson. I did not say to him, "It will cost you two or three years' rent before you have done with me." He was very rude when he came in and I said, "Are you Mr. Vincent?" He said, "No," and I said, "You had better clear out." He cut the telephone off and damaged the place, and as I knew Mr. Vincent was contemplating bringing an action against him I told him so and said it would cost him something before he had finished. In August, 1905, I introduced Vincent for the purpose of opening an account at the London and County Bank, where I had an account myself for some years, but it was closed in June, 1905, two months before I introduced Vincent. I made a mistake when I said it was Stanley who introduced Vincent to the National Provincial Bank; the introduction came from a Mr. Lewis, who was in Mr. Stanley's office. Vincent asked me to get him an introduction to the National Provincial Bank. I cannot say whether I introduced Vin<lb/>cent to the London City and Midland Bank or whether Stanley did. It is incorrect to say that I am Vincent and Co. and Vincent and Rothenstein, or that I am Walker and Co. I remember Darnell's evidence. He was not employed by me. It is not true to say that up to May, 1907; Vincent was employed by me as a clerk, and that from that date Darnell took his place, nor is it true when Darnell says I suggested that he should be a sort of partner and I should pay him £2 a week, and that he signed cheques in blank and handed them to me. He did not write letters at my dictation, nor open banking ac<lb/>counts, the money for which was found by me. The banking accounts opened by Vincent were not opened by my directions, and I did not find the money for them. Cheques Nos. 308 and 309 are made out to my order and I believe are endorsed by me, but I have no recollec<lb/>tion of endorsing them. I can't say whether the endorsements on the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210077"/>
               <p>three McDonald cheques are in my handwriting or not, because they art not alike. I may have endorsed a cheque, "McDonald and Co." or "Vincent and Co." I cannot recollect whether Feldman handed me cheques drawn to different names by my directions. The endorse<lb/>ments on the two or three cheques drawn to Vincent and Co. and endorsed "Vincent and Co." may be in my handwriting.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It looks like my writing. Both the "McDonald and Co." and the "Vincent and Co." look like my writing, but I have no recollection of endorsing them. It is the fact that Feldman got the money from Carpenter and it passed through my hands, if he says so. I should not think he handed me cheques made payable to Vin<lb/>cent in respect to these transactions. It is the fact that in June and July I was selling to Hurlock's goods which came from 60, High Road, but I do not think these cheques for small amounts had any<lb/>thing to do with it. Possibly it was to meet some other cheques that cheques were passing from Feldman to me, some of them endorsed, in writing like mine payable to Vincent in his various names. The witness Walsh is quite inaccurate in saying that I always appeared to be the person conducting the business of Braun Brothers, and also that he knew me as Shepherd and Co. I had nothing to do with Braun Brothers all the time I was at 65, Fenchurch Street. I was present when Braun Brothers were ejected, collecting my papers and books, but I am not certain whether I removed them straight to St. Mary Axe. Braun subsequently came to St. Mary Axe and brought a parcel which he asked permission to leave there. His papers were not taken there except some that he brought. When he wanted to refer to them he used to call. I do not know whether his papers were taken from St. Mary Axe to Artillery Lane. I do not know what became of his cheque book. I do not know how it came to be found at Artillery Lane. I do not know who drew cheques on Braun Brothers' account in 1905, 1906, and 1907. I do not know who signed them, nor who passed them. I do not know the hand-writing on the cheques. I last saw Braun about two or three weeks before I surrendered. I deny that Walker and Co. was my business. Darnell proposed that he should carry on business in the name of Walker and Co. on behalf of my wife, as a security for me advancing money, but my wife would have nothing to do with it. Petricus then started as Walker and Co. I never carried on business at 46, Artillery Lane. I do not know whether the papers which had been taken from Fenchurch Street to St. Mary Axe were removed to 46, Artillery Lane, unless Reuben took them amongst his papers. I understood that Petricus paid for the letter paper and cards bearing his name found at 46, Artillery Lane. I do not know how the paper of "W. H. Cross" of Fulham Road came there, nor the paper of J. McDonald and Co., of 24, Finsbury Square, of Long and Co., of 10A, Soho Square, of the General Outfitters and Supply Stores, Coleman's paper, Vincent and Rothenstein's paper, and J. H. Vin<lb/>cent's paper. The paper of the Mercur Society I took there. I had nothing to do with Walker and Co's. banking account, but I advanced</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210078"/>
               <p>the money, and Darnell gave me signed cheques in blank as security and I filled them up. The names of the payees and the amounts on the cheques signed by Darnell "Walker and Co." were filled in by me. There is no truth in Vincent's statement that he adopted the various titles of "J. H. Vincent and Co," "Vincent and Rothen<lb/>stein," etc., to oblige me, and he never wrote any documents in connection with Long and Co. at my request. I know nothing about the reference he gave to Goldstein from Long and Co., nor of the orders written by him, and that he was obtaining goods from Sut<lb/>cliffe, Armitage and Rigby, and others. I cannot tell why Clifton was afterwards writing to me about those matters. I did not trouble to read the letters; they did not interest me. I had nothing what<lb/>ever to do with his affairs. I did not interfere with his banking account nor with the banking account of Long and Co. My only connection with him was that I lent him money which I never got back. I believe I once or twice took some parcels of shirts from him as security to cover me. I do not know where they came from. I do not know whether he paid for them or owed for them. Ultimately we settled on a figure and I sold them. The business at St. Mary Axe was carried on by Reuben. I cannot say why the premises were taken in the name of. I would have seen that the rent was paid if they had been in a tenantable condition. It is not true that the letter written by Ralli to the landlord, in the name of was written at my request. I do not know who I. Rowley, of 9, Teignmouth Road, who gave a reference from Long and Co. to Goldstein was. I cannot say if Coleman's two bills of £100 each produced by me are in Vincent's handwriting.</p>

                  </hi>, 3, Chaffinge Road, Beckenham, travel<lb/>ling photographer. The deceased, Agnes Jane Taylor, was my wife</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210080"/>
               <p>and at her death was about 30. We had been married 13 years and had had three children, of whom one survived, a girl named Irene. My wife's last child was born eight years ago. My wife had on the average very good physical health, with occasional attacks of hysteria, at very long intervals, but two or three would come together. She used to assist me by canvassing for orders. Up to November last year we lived at Strood, Kent, and then moved to Beckenham. My wife earned a few shillings a week by working for somebody else, but since January last she has earned nothing, so far as I know. In June or July last year I made prisoners acquaint<lb/>ance, and he visited my house with some mutual friends. In Octo<lb/>ber last my wife complained of pain. That was after she had left my house. When she left I made inquiries, and as a result I found my wife in Benn Road, Clapham. From what she told me I wrote to prisoner. I took my wife to a doctor in the New Kent Road and he said she was suffering from venereal disease. We met prisoner the following day at Hyde Park Corner. I told him my wife had told me of her intimacy with him and what the doctor had said as to her condition. I said he must be the man who had caused it. Prisoner offered to see a medical man to prove he was not diseased. He acknowledged there had been frequent intimacies between him self and my wife and expressed his regret. My wife was left in the park and we went to a chemist's shop and made an inquiry there as to a doctor, because I did not know one in that neighbourhood, and as a result of which we went on to 259, Vauxhall Bridge Road, to Dr. Buchanan. That was the first time I had seen the name. I asked the doctor to examine prisoner and to state whether he was suffering from venereal disease. He was examined in my presence by Dr. Buchanan, who said there was no trace of disease. Prisoner paid him half a guinea. I mentioned my wife because I had to explain why I asked him to make such an examination. Prisoner asked him if he would make an examination of a lady. I neither assented nor had anything to do with it. I told prisoner that if he was free from disease I was perfectly satisfied that my wife was, and I wanted to have nothing further to do with it. Going back to my wife. I told her I believed she had made a mistake and it would be better for her to come back with me and start afresh, but that she must make her choice between us. In prisoner's presence she said she would choose me. We left prisoner in the park. My wife went back with me to Strood and we removed from there to Beckenham on November 11. About Easter my wife made a communication to me, in consequence of which I wrote to prisoner and told him that my wife had told me that they had come to an arrangement that she should leave my house and live with him. She had been away from the Saturday till the Monday to Lowestoft with prisoner. Prisoner told me that he had reasons for wishing otherwise than that they should form a home together, as he had stated he was going to do. He did not wish to have my wife as his companion. My wife heard that and went out of the room, and when she returned she said that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210081"/>
               <p>we were talking about a dead woman—that the had poisoned herself. Dr. Corbyn was sent for and came, and continued to attend her till the got over her illness. I taw prisoner in the City and took him a parcel of trinkets which he had given my wife and demanded Is return all the letters she had sent him. He refused, and said he would burn them, but said that he would not see my wife nor write to her again. I said if he did not keep his promise I would put a billet through him. Dr. Corbyn's account was paid by the prisoner. When my wife recovered I resumed relations with her, and from that time up to her last illness I had no reason to believe that any meet<lb/>ings took place between her and prisoner or that letters passed be<lb/>tween them. In June or July I noticed my wife was suffering from sickness and was taking some medicine with a white sediment. I did not know she had been to see Dr. Corbyn. I understood she had seen attending a hospital twice a week She complained of ptomaine poisoning from eating contaminated fish. At the beginning of August she stayed in bed for a few days and afterwards she stopped in bed longer, and on August 20 I sent for Dr. Corbyn, in whose hands she was up to the time of her removal to the infirmary. I was never away from home at night. I had no knowledge of prisoner visiting my wife. Alice Stace is the only servant we have. She was with us both at Strood and Beckenham.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Assuming that our conception of the word "Socialist" is the same, my wife and I and all our intimate friends are Socialists. The prisoner also had certain Socialistic ideas. My wife made a communication to me in October last year that she had been on intimate terms with prisoner, but she did not tell me the occasion of the first intimacy. She had a strong will I did not wish to divorce her Because I thought she was better in my hands than in those of prisoner. I had knowledge that until that intimacy she had seen a good woman and I wanted her to remain so, I do not know that for some time previous to when it is stated prisoner gave her 415 he had been continually giving her money. She never had need to get money from anyone else, one used to go on Wednesdays and Saturdays to King's College Hospital, and I always gave her her fare and money for incidental expenses. I was quite willing that my wife should live with prisoner if she made the choice definitely and for good. I do not know that prisoner! would not live with her unless he could marry her. She never said-anything to me about an operation until she made the final statement.</p>

                  </persName>, P Division. At 4.30 on Sep<lb/>tember 2, with Sergeant Haigh, I saw prisoner in the City. We told him we were police officers making inquiries with reference to Mrs. Taylor, of Beckenham. I said, "She is now in Bromley Infirmary, very ill, and likely to die from the result of an abortion. Statements have been made, and I shall arrest you for being concerned" Pri<lb/>soner said, "I know nothing about it. I know she has been ill. Once she took poison. I gave her money she wanted. She was very un<lb/>happy. It is true I met her at places, but I cannot tell you all as I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210082"/>
               <p>am bound by my honour. I should like to see the statements, and your authority. Some of the statements were then in a pocket-book which Sergeant Haigh had. They were the statements of Dr. Corbys, Julian Taylor, and Alice Stace. The pocket-book was handed to prisoner for him to read them. After he had read them he gave the book back and said, "I have nothing to say to that. I am bound by my word of honour to Mrs. Taylor not to disclose my relations with her, and I will not tell you anything unless you bring me her written consent. I will be fair to you, but I will not tell you what I know unless she permits me. I do not mind for myself. I only think of her. I cannot tell you anything unless she relieves me of my word. "Sergeant Haigh went for a cab. While he was away the prisoner said to me, "I saw Mrs. Taylor when the operations were done and gave her the money she wanted. The doctor lives near Victoria, but I cannot tell you where. "We then took him to the station, and at the station before he was charged he said, "I do not see what you can do with me about it." The charge was then read and he made no reply. While detained at the police station he said he wanted to make a statement. He was provided with materials and he wrote the state<lb/>ment which is Exhibit A: "Ever since April 3 Mrs. Taylor threatened towards me to kill herself as life had no charms for her any more I always persuaded her to abstain from doing such a frightful thing again for the sake of her family and for my sake, and I pledged my word to be faithful and to care for her. From May she suffered indeserv<lb/>able tortures. I knew about her being afraid of the consequences, and did what I could to make her cheerful and make her support her destiny, and said both Mr. Taylor and I would take care of her. I always opposed her idea of having what she said could save her life I never refused her any assistance in money, but not for a purpose like that. I knew of an operation she had had later on, and I was concerned about it in every way. I met her at Victoria station several times when she told me she had been to a doctor, and so I believe the doctor lives near that station. I have had news of her state often by the maid of "Mrs. Taylor.—(Signed) J. Tockert, septem<lb/>ber 2, 1907." Upon the prisoner was found this yellow diary or pocket-book, and also some letters from Alice stace to him they put in at the police court. They referred to the illness of Mrs. Taylor and her removal to the hospital, and so forth. Prisoner was brought before the justices on September 3 and remanded. After he was remanded he said to Sergeant Haigh, "I wish to make a sap plementary statement." It is marked K. An inquest was of opened on September 9 and adjourned to the 16th. By that time, through the coroner, a statement by prisoner came into the hands of the police. I have looked through the diary. I find an entry of April 3 some shorthand, and then "Beckenham." There is a little circle with a dot in that entry. On June 5 there is some shorthand, a circle with a dot in it, and then "Victoria"; it looks like "3.30." and there underneath "Vauxhall Bridge Road" abbreviated. Then on July 12 there is the same circle-and dot, and "Vauxhall Bridge Road "written</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210083"/>
               <p>at length. I saw the prisoner yesterday and took down a statement from him in writing. It was taken at his own request, and read over afterwards and each sheet was signed by him. It is this: "Central Criminal Court, October 22, 1907. Statement of Joseph Tockert. On July 31, 1907, I saw Mrs. Taylor after business hours, and she told me she had been that day to see Dr. Buchanan, of Vauxhall Bridge Road. He had proposed to her to help her by an operation, for which he wanted first £30, but as she mid she could only find £21 he said he could do it for that money. I was violently opposed to her idea of having an operation, except is a hospital, and I reminded her that in October, 1906, when she was under his treatment the same doctor had told her her womb had to be scraped, whereas she was afterwards cured in a hospital without an operation. She left me undecided. On August 10, 1907, when I came back from my holiday in the country I found a message from Mrs. Taylor, to see her at Victoria. I met her at about five to six p.m. and she told me I had to forgive her, the pain had been too great and the doctor had pressed her to have the operation at once because he was going on his holiday. He had also stated the operation was necessary imme<lb/>diately because the womb was twisted and the child bridged, and it would be too late if the waited longer. I was very upset about it and said she would only have to blame herself. On August 17 I mat Mrs. Taylor by appointment in the City. She was very ill already and lagged me to see her to her train at Victoria. This was about 1.30. We went to Victoria by bus and got down at the Clock Tower. She asked me to wait a moment for her as she has to go to her doctor. I watched her go into Dr. Buchanan's house and she came back about a quarter of an hour later with some medicine. I asked her about the medicine, and she said it was for the after effects of the operation, to relieve her. That was at about three p.m." In the little diary I find under date of Wednesday, July 31, a figure "6" and then "Victoria" with a dot in a circle; then some shorthand, and then "Dr. Buchanan "; then some shorthand, and then "£21." Under the date of August 17 I find a circle and dot, and then something which may he shorthand, and then the word "Victoria." The entries in the hook end at August 23. a identify the following letters which were found on prisoner: Letter G, August 30, from Alice stace to pri<lb/>soner; Letter H, August 31, from Alice Stace to prisoner; Letter J, September 1, from Alice stace to prisoner. I also find amongst the Exhibits, E and E1, E being a letter of September 2 from prisoner to Alice Stace, and E1 an enclosure for Mrs. Taylor. I was at the hearing before the justices on the last day and remember a letter which had been previously given to the justices' clerk being handed by him to the gentlemen representing the Treasury. It came from prisoner and is in his handwriting. I identify the letter.</p>

                  </hi>, 11, Venner Road, Sydenham, financial agent I Was born at Luxemburg and have known prisoner for a very long time. He invested £500 through me in a certain company on my recommendation. The investment did not turn out well, and I pro<lb/>mised him as a friend to pay him back what he had lost. Nothing was said about instalments. I simply paid him back as and when I liked. I paid him in sums of different amounts. Last year I went for a holiday to Switzerland, and lent my house at Sydenham to him during my absence. On my return I found that he and Mrs. Taylor were living in the house together. I objected, and they left within a short time. On August 6, 1907, prisoner wrote to me for £15, which I gave to him afterwards—on August 6, I think. I fix that by a cheque shown to me for £30, dated August 6, which was cashed over the counter and half the proceeds given to him. That was part of the money I was repaying him. He asked for the money to go to the Continent, to Luxemburg. As far as I know he did not go abroved The next time I saw him was two or three days after he was arrested. That morning Detective Haigh saw me at about 11 o'clock and told me about this £15, and wanted to know how I paid prisoner. I did not know then that Tockert was arrested, except from the detective, and I said, "Well, I want to see Mr. Tockert first," and on that I west to see him. He did not make any statement to me with regard to Mrs. Taylor. I said, "Tell me what is all this about t" Prisoner said, "I really do not understand anything of this; there must be some mistake somewhere." I said, "That sounds all right." He said "I am quite innocent in the matter." Then I said, "That is all right; I hope to see you off next Monday." I saw Detective Haigh the next morning, I think, and I told him that Mr. Tockert had told me he was innocent. Detective Haigh said, "You tell your friend to be careful, because there is an entry in his diary mentioning Dr Buchanan and £21. After that I saw prisoner again and repeated to him what Haigh had old me. Prisoner said with regard to the entry in the book, "I will explain to you. Some time before I put that entry in the diary Mrs. Taylor complained about terrible pains in the womb and so on. She said that she must see some doctor and that she had already consulted some doctor, and that that doctor was pre<lb/>pared to perform an operation for "121." She wanted Mr. Tockert to give her the £21 to do some operation. Mr. Tockert would not know anything of it. Mr. Tockert told me, "I would not know anything of that; I cannot agree to that." Mr. Tockert said he could not agree to that, and that if she would do something she would have to blame herself. Mr. Tockert said that was how the entry in the pocket book was accounted for. Then I said to Mr. Tockert, "Well, that sounds all right, but if I were you I should give the name of the doctor." Then Mr. Tockert explained to me that when Mrs. Taylor</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210085"/>
               <p>wanted that money she mentioned the name of the doctor. I said, "Cannot you give the name? I shell see the detective, and I will give the name to the police, because surely the doctor is to blame and not yourself." Then Mr. Tockert said that he promised Mrs. Taylor, when she gave him the name, not to disclose it. I urged him, and ultimately he gave the name to me and I gave it to Detce<lb/>tive Haigh afterwards. I had not seen that the name "Dr. Buchanan he was in the diary, but Detective Haigh told me. I had asked Mr. Tockert, "Do you know the address of the doctor?" He said, "Yes, Mrs. Taylor gave it to me when she told me she had these pains. "Mr. Tockert gave me the address, in Vauxhall Bridge Road, and I gave the full address to Detective Haigh. I saw prisoner two or three times alter that. He never added anything with regard to what Dr. Buchanan had done and what had been the money paid to him for doing it I attended at the Treasury for the purpose of making a statement as to what prisoner had told me in prison.</p>
               <p>Mr. White objected to Sir C. Mathews putting to witness a passage from the statement made at the Treasury, which had been taken down in shorthand, which witness had afterwards struck out when the transcript was sent to him for con<lb/>rective.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence said he saw no evidence of hostility on the part of the witness.</p>
               <p>Witness explained that he had just returned from three weeks in Switzerland, and was raftering from nervous exhaustion at the time of making the statement and had less flurried. He had been treated hostilely at the Treasury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence thought that after what witness bad said of his condition, whether accurate or not, the statement would not be very reliable.</p>
               <p>Witness: The parts I struck out were those which were an incorrect representa<lb/>ties of what prisoner said, I mixed it up with the newspapers. I thought the matter thoroughly over afterwards and corrected it to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Sir Mathews handed the document to his Lordship in order that the point might as before him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence (after reading it); I think under the circumstances it is highly probable that the corrected proof is the more accurate one. I think possibly the statement he originally made was one that he thought was favourable to the Prisoner, and afterwards found he was injuring his friend instead of assisting him The second statement is consistent with the other documents in the cass, whereas the first one is very inconsistent with them. One does not see why prisoner should have made statements of that sort to him when clearly alive himself to the other view of the facts.</p>
               <p>Sir C. Mathews: It will be with your Lordship's sanction that I should make no father reference to it?</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence: I think it would be unsatisfactory to do so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have known prisoner for many years, and always known him to be of the highest repute in Luxemburg. When I gave him the £15 I knew he war about to take his holiday, whether abroad or in this country, and that he had no money to enable him to go. Detective Haigh told me my name was mentioned in the diary in connection with the £15. Prisoner absolutely denied he was guilty of any conspiracy or had anything to do with any operation at all. I know he would have been opposed to anything of that sort. He told me that Mrs. Taylor had said, "I will have an operation done" and he told her he was quite prepared if the child would come he would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210086"/>
               <p>take her to Luxemburg and live with her and marry her. He said he would have nothing to do with an operation, and would not allow it. That is what he told me.</p>
               <p>Sir C. Mathews said that Alice stace and other witnesses could be called, but the evidence at to prisoners agreement with the woman could not be Strengthened.</p>
               <p>Mr. White submitted that the prosecution had produced no evidence of any cos<lb/>piracy or connivance between prisoner and the woman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice A. T. Lawrence: I do not think there is a case that it would be safe for me to leave to the jury. The facts seem to me to fall short of showing that there was consent and concurrence on the part of the prisoner to the operation. Of course, it is always difficult to say exactly what the full meaning of expressions made of by a foreigner is. The one expression he used which is consistent, perhaps, with his being mixed up with it is that he "saw her when it was done," but that may mean when it had been done, and if that one expression is eliminated all the other are declarations upon his part that he did not consent and never consented, and that he only knew of the operation after it had been performed. With regard to the entry of £21, whether he ever paid that himself or not, it does not appear test he provided her with it for the purpose of the operation. He denies it, and I do not think it would be safe for us to infer that he had done so without more evidence than we have had. This is a case in which there has been gross immorality, but one must not confuse immorality with crime, and I do not think it would be safe for me to let this case go to jury upon the evidence before them. (To the jury.) Gentlemen, you must take it from me that your verdict in this case should be Not Guilty, because that is the only safe verdict to give.</p>

               <p>It was stated that prisoner stood committed to Maidstone Assizes on a charge of murder, the death having taken place at Bromley, and an application was made to His Lordship to intimate his view to the coroner, who was present, as to the advisability of allowing bail.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice <hi rend="smallCaps">A. T. LAWRENCE</hi>: I think that the circumstances of this case are very special, and that the coroner might well have regard to those circumstances, and therefore do that which is unusual in the case of a charge of murder, but not without precedent, and admin prisoner to bail.</p>

                  </hi>, medical officer, Edmonton Union. I practise at Lower Edmonton. On August 15, about 10 a.m., I saw Astley Cooper at the Edmonton Infirmary. He was suffering from a fracture of the small bone of the left leg just above the ankle joint. All round the joint was bruised and swollen, and subsequent bruises developed up the left leg and the left side. He had a small contused wound over the left eye. Subsequently large bruises on the right arm and forearm developed. He was in a sick condition and suffer<lb/>ing from shock. He was irritable and very obstreperous when we set the leg. I think his age was about 73 or 74. He gradually got worse and died on September 8 at 4.45 a.m. On September 9 I made a post-mortem examination and found the head and brain normal and external bruising up the side, where he had apparently fallen. The right lung was firmly adhering to the chest wall, and there was old chronic phthisis on the upper half of the right lung; The upper lobe of the lung was in an advanced stage of fibroid phthisis. The lower lobes of both rungs were edematous; they were in a very con<lb/>gested state, and serum or water from the blood oozed forth owing to the weak condition of the heart. It was edema of the lung, or a watery condition. There were two or three small patches of fibroid pthisis in the left lung; in the right pleural cavity there was some pas and mucus. That was in the right lung corresponding to the part which was adherent to the cheat. That was due to the diseased condition of the lung tissue. The heart was rather small, valves healthy, the walls thin, especially those of the right ventricle, in which there was an old ante-mortem clot. The heart was more or lass small and somewhat atrophied. The walls on the right side of—the heart, which drove the blood to the lungs were very thin, and, owing to the failure in the circulation, towards the last a blood clot formed before death. The liver was in an advanced stage of cirrhosis. The spleen was normal and the kidneys small and slightly atrophied. They were the changes one would expect to find in an ad<lb/>vanced stage of cirrhosis of the liver. The stomach was normal and also the intestines. The large gut contained a quantity of hard focal matter. Death was due to heart failure, due chiefly to the diseased condition of the lungs and the liver, but I regard the acci<lb/>dent as probably accelerating his death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I use the word "probably" advisedly. He was an old man, and I have described the condition of his internal organs. Taking all things into consideration, I am of opinion the death was probably accelerated by the shock and accident. I am not going to say that it was certainly accelerated by the accident, because if any<lb/>thing untoward had happened, seeing the condition of his organs, he might have died without it. The probabilities are that he would have gone on as he had been going on for some time longer, but it is quite possible, had anything untoward happened, that his condition was such that he might have died without the accident.</p>
               <p>By the Court. Supposing he had had a shock from anything else, or caught a chill, or influenza, or anything of that sort, then his</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210088"/>
               <p>condition was such that be might have died. That is assuming some other substitute for the shock which he got. It is difficult for me to say whether his death would have occurred at the time it did if all shocks are eliminated. In my judgment the death was hastened and accelerated by the shock, but his general physical condition was a very serious one, and his organs were very diseased. I can go so far as to say that the blow which he received, and the fracture of that small bone of the leg from which he suffered would not in any ordi nary sense kill a man. It was a more serious thing for him than for a more healthy man. He showed very little recuperative power from the time he came in. His condition gradually grew worse the whole time he was there.</p>

                  </hi>, son of prisoner, 5, The Avenue, Bush Hill Park, Enfield. I am in errand boy, and was with my father on August 14 between 10 and 11 p.m. He was driving a pony barrow in Percival Road. A man named Joseph Kitchener was with us. My father was drunk. As he drove down the road I noticed a black shadow in the road between five and 10 yards off. I said to my father, "Look! What is that?" He said, "It is a man," and polled on one aide. The man stopped and turned his bead round, my father pulled on one side and the man walked into the lamp and was knocked down. Father pulled up and Kitchener jumped off and said, "It is all right; keep going." My father kept going. At the time of the accident father was driving between eight and nine miles and hour. The pony was trotting.' I asked him if I should go and get another pail of mixture because the cornchandler was shot and he said, "No." We went to the cornchandler's to get some food for the horse, and he was about. I asked my father if be would put another pony in to go to my uncle's and get some food. My father said he would drive that one to my uncle's. He drove straight there. We went to get a sack from one of the sheds and father fell down and uncle suggested that father should stay there all night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There are five or six lamps in Percival Road and between the lamps there are some trees, which at some places shade the lamps from the road, so that that part of the road is dark. One of the lamps near where the accident happened had a broken mantle that night My father tried to avoid the man, but each thing he did the man got more in his way. My father had been driving from Baker Street, Enfield, which took about 20 minutes. After the acci<lb/>dent he drove to my uncle's, which is some two miles away. I gave my evidence before the coroner's jury. They heard all the evidence. A good deal was said about the lighting up of the road. The jury thought it was an accident.</p>

                  </hi>. 33, Brushfield Street, Spitalfields, market porter. On the night of August 14 I was in the pony barrow which prisoner was driving. He was drunk. When we were about three—parts of the way down Percival Road I saw a man crossing the road</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210089"/>
               <p>within five or ten yards. The boy cried, "Look out, father; there is a man!" We all halloaed out, "Hi! hi!" but it was too late; we were on top of him and we knocked him down. The barrow may have been going 10 or 12 or eight or nine miles an hour. I got out and the old man was lying in the road in the centre. He seemed all right, and I said to Sanders, "Go on home." He drove on, and I went back to the old man, who seemed to be boozed. I saw Police-constable Jarvis, and a woman came up and said, "I will go and fetch my husband and another fellow." Then I went back to the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was with prisoner all the way from Baker Street, which it about a mile and a half away. There was a lamp on the off-side of the cart alight. The road where the accident took place if very dark, from the obstruction of the trees. There are very few lamps. When the boy told his father there was somebody is the road he pulled to the near side, and the old man walked to the near side; the prisoner then pulled still more to the near side. The old man was struck by something on the off-side of the cart, Neither the father nor the son realised that the man was hurt.</p>

The accident occurred Just opposite Bertram Road. The road is 26 ft. 2 in. wide there. The lamps are 100 yards apart. On the same side they are 200 yards apart. The tress are lime trees, about 12 ft. high and they have been lopped.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I know the coroner's jury added a rider to their verdict calling the attention of the local authority to the lighting of the road.</p>

I went into the road on hearing a shout, and found Astley Cooper lying in the roadway apparently unconscious. He lived at 82, Percival Road. There was a slight out on his eye. I took him to 88, Percival Road, and then to the hospital on the ambulance, and after wards to the Edmonton Infirmary. When I got into the road I saw the barrow some distance off just turning into Lincoln Road, driving its furious rate. (Witness marked the spot where the accident took place on the plan.) I saw the old man lying close to the tree. I did not notice anything the matter with the mantles of the incandescent lamps.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was a dark night. The foreman of the coroner's jury knew the road perfectly well. There is a pavement for foot-passengers on the road.</p>

On August 15 I was on duty at the station when prisoner was brought in. I cautioned him, and he made this statement: "While driving through Percival Road, at 10 40 p.m., on August 14, 1907, I saw a man in the road I shouted to him, but before I could pull my pony up I had knocked him down, but thinking I had not hurt him I drove on. I was drunk at the time, and my pony is a verv fast trotter. He can do 16 miles an hour." That is signed by "Alfred Sanders" and myself. Prisoner was then charged with causing bodily harm to Cooper, he being then alive. In reply to that charge he said, "I was drunk; that is how the pony got away with me. I admit I was travel<lb/>ling too fast. I know I knocked someone down and ought to have stopped. That is what you get through getting boozed." I did not notice anything wrong with the lamps in the part of the road where the accident happened; I was there 10 minutes after the occurrence The trees are 18 to 20 yards apart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The trees affect the lighting in some degree, but very little.</p>

"I am going to arrest you for causing grievous bodily harm to Astley Cooper with a pony and barrow at Percival Road last night." He said, "I was drunk. I was driving. I am sorry for it." I took him to the station, and heard him make that statement to Prewer. When charged he said, "This is what you get from being boozed."</p>

I say prisoner in Southoury Road and said I was going to take him to Enfield Police Station where he would be charged with causing the death of Astley Cooper by driving over him with his horse and barrow on August 14 at Percival Road. Prisoner said, "This will mean time, I suppose. It is a very bad job for me. It would not have hap pened if I had not been drunk, and I should have stopped if Kitchener had not said, "It is all right, Alf." When charged at the stations he made no reply. The trees in Percival Road are small lime trees, clipped.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I do not agree with the coroner's jury that it re<lb/>quires better lighting.</p>

                  </hi>, assistant to Messrs. Straker, Ludgate Hill. On August 7 I took an order from the man I recognised at the police court as Newton for the engraving of some diet and the printing of the heading of some letter paper for Messrs. Lewis and Lewis. He produced a letter dated April 30, 1906, written by Sir George Lewis to Mrs. Violet Fraser, and gave the name of Richards, 13, Edward Street, Bath. He asked me to engrave three dies the same as that heading, to match the paper, and to supply proofs in two days. I handed the matter over to Mr. Goatcher, the manager. Newton left 10s. on account. On August 9 Newton returned for the order, and, after some conversation, I referred him to Mr. Goatcher.</p>

I followed him to the Burlington Hotel, Cork Street, which he left at about half-past seven with the prisoner Fisher. Until August 17 I followed Newton daily He was living at the Burlington. Fisher was in his company daily and was also staying at the Burlington. On August 17 they de parted by the Great Northern Station, King's Cross, for Harrogate They wore both at the booking office window, and I could not say who took the tickets, but I believe Newton. I saw no more of them To Mr. Marshall Hall. The Burlington is a respectable hotel so far as I know.</p>

                  </hi>, 72, Dean Street, Soho. I am an em<lb/>bosser and print letter paper in the course of my trade. I do not do engraving; I get it done outside. On September 17 prisoners came to my place. Only Newton spoke. He told me he wished me to engrave him a die and emboss it on some paper. He handed me a specimen, purporting to he written by Lewis and Lewis to Mrs. Fraser. He asked me to match the paper. I said I could not do that, and I could not supply more than 50 sheets. He asked me how soon I could let him have the paper, and I said it would take three days. I afterwards said I would do my very best to engrave the three dies and let him have 50 sheets in the evening of the next day, September 18. I said, "Am I speaking to one of the firm?" and he said, "Yes, certainly." Fisher heard what was said but took no part in the conversation. I had an impression that Fisher was under the influence of drink from the frivolous manner in which he con<lb/>dieted himself and his mannerism generally. Next day I received the paper and the dies from the engraver, and by half-past seven I had sons of the paper ready. At that time Fisher called and said, "Has the other fellow been?" I answered him "No." He was quite sober on this occasion. He said, "Have you got the paper ready?" I said, "Yes, but I have only got 35 sheets"—because they were not all dry." So he said, "Very well; make out your bill and I will pay." I said. "Then I will make it out to Lewis and Lewis." He said, "Certainly, I am only one of the clerks." Then I said, "What if the name of the gentleman I took the order from?" He replied, "Oh, that is young Mr. Lewis himself." I gave him the parcel con<lb/>taining the dies and the paper and he went away. He paid me 38s. So far as I can see, the dies and paper produced are the same as I supplied. Some days later I communicated with Messrs. Lewis and Lewis by telephone, and afterwards swore an information at the Marlborough Street Police Court. My assistant, Alfred Horrell, was present at all these interviews.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Marshall Hall. I think my shop is 27 ft by 24 ft. Horrell was sitting working at his 'bench. I was very ill at this time, but quite capable of understanding what was said. I believed Newton on the Tuesday when he told me he was a member of the firm or Lewis and Lewis. I say that I made out the receipt to Messrs. Lewis and Lewis in the presence of this man Fisher. I can only write with the left hand, and it tales some little time. When Fisher came on the Wednesday he asked me to make out the bill, and there was nothing to do but to hand the paper over to him. A mes<lb/>senger boy could not have had it unless he had brought a memo<lb/>randum. Nobody has ever suggested that I was party to the con<lb/>spiracy because I made out these dies. I was told I ought to have been more careful.</p>

                  </persName>, New Scotland Yard. On September 25 I received a warrant at Marlborough Street Police Court for the arrest of two men by description. At 10 minutes past five I saw Fisher standing on the steps of the Burlington Hotel. At quarter to six Newton alighted and went in. I sent for assistance and then said to Fisher, "I believe your name is Fisher." He said. "Yes." I asked him to come outside the hotel, told him who I was, and that I held a warrant for his arrest on a charge of conspiracy to chest and defraud and I read the warrant to him. I handed him over to a detective officer and in about five minutes arrested Newton and took him to Vine Street Police Station. There I read the warrant to both of them. Fisher said, "I do not quite understand it." I then explained that the allegation against both of them was that they had been together to an embosser's in Dean Street, Soho, and represented themselves as coming from Messrs. Lewis and Lewis and had obtained three dies and some notepaper similar to that used by the firm. Neither of them made any reply. In the room occupied by Newton at the Burlington I found the three dies and a quantity of notepaper headed with the names and address and telephone number and tele<lb/>graphic address of Messrs. Lewis and Lewis, of Ely Place. I also found the letters which are now exhibited.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Marshall Hail. On the way to the cells, Newton, pointing to the cell where Fisher was, said, "That man has nothing to do with it." Every document produced was found in Newton's room. Nothing was found on Fisher.</p>

                  </persName>, Bart. I am head of the firm of Lewis and Lewis, solicitors, Ely Place, where the firm has been established for eighty years. In April, 1906. I was directed to pay Mrs. Violet Fraser a sum of £300 by instalments. Mrs. Fraser is the lady photo<lb/>graphed in the postcard produced in a group of three, Newton being also one of the group. I paid her £100 down and I wished to pay bur the rest in monthly instalments of £50, but she broke her engage<lb/>ment and I felt bound, as I had agreed, to pay her the money, and the whole of it was in fact paid by July 26. Upon that date I paid her a further sum of £200, four annual sums of £50 paid in advance. No other money was due to be paid from my firm until 1910. (The attention of Sir George Lewis was particularly called to Exhibit No. 11, which is as follows: "Ely Place, Holborn, E.C. Dear Madam,—Replying to your letter of the 29th and., we are now in a position to inform you that the matter we have had in hand for you has now been definitely and finally agreed upon, the arrangement being that on or before January 1. 1908, our client will pay you the sum of five thousand pounds (£5,000), this being in final and absolute settle<lb/>ment. We shall be obliged by your signing and returning to us at</p>

We trust that we may rely on your discretion not to mention our client's name in reference to this transaction or to discuss the business in any way whatsoever. We regret to hear your expenses have been so unusually heavy; never<lb/>theless we cannot entertain your proposition of making you an advance in anticipation of the payment of the £5,000. We would in your own interests most strongly advise you against applying to people who would only charge you some extortionate rate of interest, and would in all probability with to ascertain the source from which the money in question is coming, etc., etc., and in view of all the circumstances we should be compelled to refuse any information whatever. We therefore are not in a position to countenance or assist you in any such transaction.—Yours truly, Lewis and Lewis. Mrs. Fraser, Hotel Kaiserhof, Wiesbaden, Germany.") Exhibit No. 11 is typed upon paper resembling the paper of my firm and purports to be signed by Lewis and Lewis. That letter did not come from my firm. The sig<lb/>nature is a forgery, and the contents of the letter are a forgery from beginning to end. The signature resembles the signature of my firm, and I think might deceive anybody. Exhibit No. 12, purporting to be signed by me, "George H. Lewis," is also a forgery. The whole letter is an invention. The signature resembles mine, and would deceive anybody. In August, when I was away on vacation, Mr. Poole, one of my clerks, received a communication from Messrs. Straker, and we received back from them the letter given by Newton as a specimen, under the order of the judge, who granted an interim injunction. I took every possible proceeding I could to prevent the possibility of anybody being defrauded: I wrote to the newspapers, and took the most active measures possible. I communicated with the City Police and Scotland Yard, and subsequently received some information from Hallam as to paper having been obtained from him. I subsequently attended with the witnesses at the Marlborough. Street Police Court and obtained the warrants.</p>

                  </hi>, of Messrs. Dangerfield and Blythe, solici<lb/>tors, Craven Street. My firm acted for Mrs. Fraser about 12 months. In the month of July of this year Mrs. Fraser called upon me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marshall Hall objected to the admission of evidence as to what took place at the interview in the absence of Newton and Fisher Mrs. Fraser not being in the dock. For the purpose of proving a conspiracy the prosecution could not prove acts by one of the people who was alleged to be a party to the conspiracy unless it was first established that there was a conspiracy between these three people.</p>
               <p>The Recorder held that there was evidence in the letters written by Mrs. Fraser that she was engaged in a conspiracy to obtain money. There was sorely plenty of evidence that she was conspiring.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marshall Hall did not mind whether she was conspiring or not. The only man on his trial was Fisher, and the only tittle of evidence against Fisher was that he made a statement to Mr. Hallam to enable him to get tome papers.</p>
               <p>The Recorder. Do you or do you not concede that there is plenty of evidence Before the jury that Mrs. Fraser was engaged in conspiracy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marshall Hall. Yes, with Newton, but no evidence whatever that she was conspiring with Fisher.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210096"/>
               <p>The Recorder. That will be entirely for the jury. If the jury believe this man Fisher took a certain part in carrying out that conspiracy, surely anything said or done by any of the conspirators in pursuance or in furtherance of the conspiracy it, by a well-known principle of law, evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marshall Hall. For that purpose only. That is whore I think the mistake is—only for the purpose of implicating an accused person. On my friend's admission Fisher never even knew Mrs. Fraser. If it could be proved that Fisher and Mrs. Fraser were together for the purposes of this information then, my lord, I agree that would be some evidence.</p>
               <p>The Recorder. I am surprised to hear you raise that argument, Mr. Marshall Hall, because I think a little consideration will satisfy you that you may have several conspirators unknown to one another in different countries, who have never even heard of one another.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marshall Hall. What is in issue here, as far as I am concerned, is not that Newton and Fraser did not conspire: that is admitted; he has pleaded guilty; but whether Fisher conspired.</p>
               <p>The Recorder. That is for the jury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marshall Hall. It can only be for the jury upon evidence and there is abso<lb/>lately no evidence here to connect Fisher with Mrs. Fraser; in fact there is an express admission by my learned friend in opening the case that to the best of his knowledge Fisher never saw Mrs. Fraser in his life.</p>
               <p>The Recorder. As you put it to me I do not agree with you at all. There is evidence of conspiracy between the man who has pleaded guilty and Mrs. Fraser, in the carrying out or which certain forged dies and papers were necessary, in the procuring of which Fisher took part, and whether the part he took was a criminal part is certainly a question for the jury. The mere fact that he did not know Mrs. Fraser would not exclude the evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marshall Hall. There is some evidence that Newton and Fisher are together, but it is no evidence that Fisher conspires that Mrs. Fraser behind Filbert back made some statement of which Fisher had no cognisance. I press that point after great consideration.</p>
               <p>Mr. Muir. I press your lordship also after great consideration.</p>
               <p>The Recorder. Mr. Muir, you will have the benefit of the evidence. It is stated sometimes that there is a difficulty in getting cases reserved here, but that statement is inaccurate. If, Mr. Marshall Hall, you seriously press the point hereafter I shall reserve it.</p>
               <p>The Witness. After what your lordship has said may I ask your lordship whether I should answer a question which may be prejudicial to this lady con<lb/>cerning what took place when I was acting as her solicitor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Muir. Your lordship is acquainted, of course, with the case of R.v. Cox and Railton (14 Q.B.D. 153), which lays down the principle that where a solicitor is con<lb/>sulted in connection with part of a crime no privilege is attached to such consultation. What was done here was the production of a letter and if your lordship will allow me to put the question you will see at once what took place.</p>
               <p>The Recorder. I think that is so.</p>
               <p>Witness. I have not the slightest desire to refuse to answer anything.</p>
               <p>The Recorder. You desire to press this as part of your case.</p>
               <p>Mr. Muir. It is an essential part of the conspiracy to raise money.</p>
               <p>Witness. The letter of June 3, or one exactly like it, was produced to me at that interview by Mrs. Fraser, and purported to be signed by Lewis and Lewis. She asked me whether it would be possible to raise a loan in anticipation of the payment of £5,000 mentioned in that letter. I said I thought not, because the letter showed that it was to be a voluntary payment, and stated no security but was re<lb/>vocable at will. I got into communication with a Mr. Lawrence, and subsequently spoke to Mrs. Fraser about a possible loan. I left London on August 12, and this took place before I went away. Mrs. Fraser told me she had seen this gentleman, whom I knew as Mr.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210097"/>
               <p>Lawrence, and Mr. Lawrence had told her he Would mike her a loan provided that Messrs. Lewis and Lewis would undertake to pay me £1,000, and that I would undertake to pay the £1,000 over to this gentleman. I heard nothing more of the transaction. I said to Mrs. fitter with reference to the terms of the letter of Messrs. Lewis and Lewis of June 1, that I thought it obvious Messrs. Lewis and Lewis would not give any such letter at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marshall Hall. For the purpose of borrowing money, can you imagine anything more useless and inane than that letter?</p>
               <p>Witness. That is exactly what I said.</p>

                  </hi>, accountant, 119, Victoria Street, Westminster, and 20, Bedford Street, Strand. The letter of June 3, purporting to come from Messrs. Lewis and Lewis, was shown to me on June 26 by Mrs. Fraser, whose photograph I have seen. There it no doubt about it being a likeness of the lady. She asked me whether on that letter I could arrange an advance of £300, There was no suggestion as to repayment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marshall Hall submitted that what took place on June 26 could not be evi<lb/>dence against Fisher in respect of conspiracy of September 17 and 18.</p>
               <p>The Recorder: As I explained to you, people come into a conspiracy at different periods. A conspiracy may last for years, and one man may not come into it until the last year. As long as a conspiracy is continuing a man may come into it. Of course when a conspiracy is at an end anything said with regard to it is mere historical statement.</p>
               <p>Witness: I supposed the letter was from Messrs. Lewis and Lewis. She came again the following day, and I agreed to get the money for her, subject to inquiries. She came earlier than I anticipated and I had not completed my inquiries. She seemed much annoyed and wanted the money there and then. She never got the money. I saw this ease reported in the papers, and communicated with Messrs. Lewis and Lewis.</p>

               <p>The jury having retired, returned the following verdict: We find that Fisher conspired with Newton to obtain this paper for an un<lb/>lawful purpose, but for what purpose is not proved by the evidence.</p>
               <p>The Recorder. Was it for a fraudulent purpose? The Foreman. For an unlawful purpose.</p>
               <p>The Recorder. That is a verdict of guilty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Elliott submitted that the finding of the jury amounted to a verdict of not guilty, as the finding could not be allocated to any par<lb/>ticular count in the indictment.</p>
               <p>The Recorder pointed out that the second count charged Newton and Fisher with unlawfully conspiring to forge and utter, knowing the same to be forged, divers writings purporting to be letters signed by the firm of Lewis and Lewis and by Sir George Lewis, Bart., with intent to defraud. Did the prisoners conspire together to forge those papers?</p>
               <p>The Foreman. No, my lord, not the earlier ones, not those of June. We have not considered those at all.</p>
               <p>The Recorder asked whether with reference to the fourth count the jury found prisoners guilty of conspiring to defraud Mr. Cogswell and Mr. Blythe?</p>
               <p>The Foreman. No, my lord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Muir. "Or any other person or persons unknown?"</p>
               <p>The Foreman. Our opinion is that we hare nothing to do with Fisher before September 17.</p>
               <p>The Recorder. Was Fisher's intention when he went to Hallam's to use these papers for the purpose of defrauding somebody or not?</p>
               <p>The Foreman. Certainly; they were obtained for an unlawful pur<lb/>pose.</p>
               <p>The Recorder. Do you agree that the object was to defraud some<lb/>body?</p>
               <p>A Juror. The evidence does not prove that.</p>
               <p>The Foreman. We simply say that Fisher was party to obtaining the papers for an unlawful purpose, but for what purpose is not proved by the evidence.</p>
               <p>It appearing that the jury were not agreed, the Recorder directed that they should again retire. <rs id="t19071021-38-verdict-1" type="verdictDescription">

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210100"/>
               <p>woman with a child in her arms. She was standing outside her bed-room window on the ground floor, No. 82, and was in an excited condition. I asked her what was the matter, whereupon her hus<lb/>band rushed out of the house—the prisoner. He said to his wife "You called me a thief," and ran as though to strike her. I stepped between them and stopped him, advising him to go indoors and behave himself, and let his wife and child come in. When he got to the door he put his hand behind him and brought something out, giving me a blow on me left side of the face, which caught the top of my ear and tore it, saying at the time, "Take that." I then got hold of his shirt with my left hand, and felt for my truncheon. I saw he had a hook (produced), which he raised again. I caught his wrist and struck him with the truncheon, when he dropped the hook. He then stepped back in his own doorway, and somebody slammed the door and bolted it, I do not know whom. I blew my whistle and another officer came. I tried to open the door but it would not give. I felt a bit faint, and my eyes were blurred. When the other officer came somebody opened the door, and we searched the house, but failed to find prisoner. We concluded he had gone out at the back, through some French windows. I came away, and told a Thames sergeant to keep observation at the back. I then went to the station and was examined by the surgeon. When I saw prisoner he seemed very angry; he might have been drinking, but I should say he was sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was in uniform during the occurrence. I have not been on duty since this happened. I hit prisoner twice with my truncheon. He might have staggered back to the door after my blows; I could not say. There is a lamp about 10 or 15 yards away from his house. There if also one nearly opposite the door belonging to the fire station. It is a very light corner at that spot.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Prisoner had the hook with him; he did not go inside for it. It was after I received the injury that I used the truncheon.</p>

                  </hi>, fireman, Wapping Fire Station. I was on watch on September 29, between one and half past. The station is opposite 82, Red Lion Street. I heard a disturbance at the time mentioned, and on looking out saw Mrs. O'Connell, whom I knew looking through a window. Shortly after a policeman passed by and spoke to Mr. O'Connell. The latter then walked a few yards up the street, and the policeman closed the shutters and doors. Pri<lb/>soner then came out aid called for his wife, saying, "She called me a thief." Then he went to strike her, but the constable intervened, saying, "You cannot do that," or "You must not do that; get away home." Prisoner then stood outside the door and picked up one of his children, squeezing him and saying, "This is my son," or some<lb/>thing like that. All at once he put down the child, turned round and struck the policeman. The latter then caught hold of O'Connell and they had a short struggle, the officer appearing to be hitting prisoner; I could not see what with. Prisoner broke away and went</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I know prisoner's house. The fire station is opposite, about 18 ft. away at one part. From where I was pri<lb/>soner's house would be about 30 or 40 ft. I first heard Mrs. O'Connell it ream, on which I opened the window and looked out. I made a statement to Sergeant Gooding. I could not see what the constable struck prisoner with. He may have struck him three or four times.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. (After statement before the magistrate read.) I am not aware of any distinction between my evidence now and before the magistrate.</p>

On September 29, about 245, I saw Police-constable Barnes at Shad well Police Station, and in consequence of what he said I went to 82, Red Lion Street, Wap<lb/>ping I searched the house and the adjoining backs, but did not prisoner. At about quarter to seven I went back, after inquiries, and going into a house I found prisoner under a bed. I pulled him out and said, "Jerry, I want you." He said, "Oh, dear, have I killed him? I feel so bad; I must have been drunk." I said, "No, he is very seriously injured, and I am going to arrest you for felo<lb/>niously wounding Barnes." I searched him, and he pointed to some blood on his shoulder and shirt, and said, "That is the policeman's blood." I arrested him, and on the way he said "This is what drink does; I only came out yesterday morning. It looks like going back. I hope he will get over it. I ought to make a hole in the water, but I cannot drown. "Later on at the station I showed him a stevedore's hook, saying he would be charged with feloniously wound<lb/>ing Barnes with it. He said, "That is my hook; I do not recollect much of it."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner appeared to be sober when arrested; be appeared to be recovering from a passion. He might have been drinking.</p>

                  </hi>, divisional surgeon, H Division. On September 29, just before two, I saw Constable Barnes, and found him suffering from a lacerated wound on the left ear and tearing down the cheek. He is better now, and will be able to take up his duty at once. I subsequently attended prisoner, when he was suffering from contu<lb/>sion on the left side of his head, and an abrasion in each shoulder blade. He had certainly bad some drink on the previous day. The hook (produced) was shown to me; it had red stains on it, apparently human blood. They answered to the tests for mammalian blood. The effect of the injury will now be merely disfiguring. The wound was very close to being a dangerous one.</p>

He frightened me so much that I screamed. I ran after him, but he was halfway down the street. A policeman then came up, with whom I went to the station to report it.

We got a crowd round, and I heard them say, "What has it to do with you? Let him go. "I held him for a minute and then released him. It was dark, and I could not see if he had anything in his hands. He ran away again, but four or five minutes later I saw him in the custody of an officer. I went to the station and told them I had seized the prisoner first I offered to show the officer the place where I had held prisoner.

I afterwards went with Mr. Kirby to No. 2, Fitzroy Street, and from what he told me I searched the area, where I found a bank book and a bag containing the articles which prosecutrix said she had lost. I returned to the station and told prisoner in Kirby's presence what had occurred between him and the latter. Prisoner said, "I don't member having slipped down anywhere."</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I was going along a street where a crowd was running, and I joined in the chase and got in front, when this men (Kirby) got hold of me, and the people said, "You have got she wrong man, let him go," which he did. They all ran after the second man. Then the policeman in plain clothes came up and took me to the station. When we got there we saw the lady who lost the purse, and one of the officers says, "Is this him?" She says, "Yes, that is the man who took my bank book with £100 in it. "When I saw her she looked half drunk. Then I was charged with this affair, which I know nothing at all about. I was not in the locality where she lost her purse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I said at the police court that prosecutrix had met me in a mews two or three days before. I did not see who the crowd was running after. I ran with the crowd, and got in front because I was a better runner; they were all children. I was only four or five yards in front. (To the Common Serjeant.) There were two or three in front of me. I did not try to dodge Kirby when he stopped me; I slipped down.</p>

                  </hi>, 8, Long Lane, E.C. On August 19 I was in my warehouse, when prisoner and a companion came in to see me. Prisoner told me they were getting subscriptions for a waterside regatta in connection with stevedores. He produced a large document with printed heading, which I thought was a waterman's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210104"/>
               <p>license. I told him I was busy and had no time to spare, but said that he could call again when passing. On Friday, the 23rd, he called again with another man; I cannot say whether he was the same companion as before. I was sitting at my desk. On my right there was a table with papers and £3 10s. in gold and 1s.6d. in silver. I last saw that when my clerk came and told me that two men wanted to see me very particularly. Between that time and the entry of prisoner, with the other man, nobody came in. Prisoner stood on my left hand and (the other man about a yard and a half away on prisoner's left. Prisoner made two or three salaams, and said he was sorry to trouble me seeing I was busy. I expressed some annoyance at his calling, it being a quarter to five, and I was just finishing the mails, so had no time. I bent for<lb/>ward again to my desk, and out of the corner of my eye I saw the other man vanish out of the door. Prisoner made some remark which I did not hear, and also went quickly out, which aroused my suspicions, so I looked round and saw the money had gone. I followed him through the warehouse and through two sets of folding doors, down the first flight of stairs, and at the bend I saw him with his hands on the bannisters, taking several steps it a time. He looked behind, and seeing me following increased his speed. When I got to the bottom he was out of sight. I then went to Snow Hill Police Station and gave information. A few days later they sent for me, and from among about a dozen men I identified prisoner. I did that before I got up to the line, because prisoner looked over his shoulder when I went into the room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not identify the companion the second time. On the first occasion the two men stood in the lobby of the ware-house together. I do not think they came into the warehouse. Only the prisoner spoke that time. On the second occasion they came up together and came to the table together. They came through the door at the same time; it is a fairly wroe one; the table was between prisoner and myself. On the first occasion the other man volun<lb/>teered the remark that it would be a grand advertisement for me, which I took to mean if I gave the subscription. The other man did not speak on the second occasion; he may have been a different man altogether. The affair took place in a few moments. Prisoner was looking towards me with his back to the door. He was within easy reaching distance of the money. When I went after prisoner I did not say anything about the money to anyone. (Mr. May came into Court.) I cannot remember that that was the man who came on the first occasion. I am sure he did not come on the second occasion.</p>

He was detained with another man, and I told them they would be put up for iden<lb/>tification as two men who had been to an office occupied by Mr. Robinson, at 8, Long Lane, and who stole £3 11s. 6d. Prisoner said, "I know nothing about it." Mr. Robinson at once identified</p>

               <p>him from amongst 13 men, but failed to identify the other man. When charged, prisoner said, "I know nothing about it. I have never been to the place in my life; I do not know those gentlemen." He gave a correct address.

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I live at 51, Riley Street, Ber<lb/>mondsey. I have always borne a good character and have never before been in a police court. I have been collecting money off and on for the regatta for the last 16 years. Last Saturday week I had my big race on the Lea, and I always got subscriptions every year from various people. On the 19th—I believe that is the date—I called on Mr. Robinson. Mr. May (my son-in-law) who came into Court, was with me. I went back again to Mr. Robinson on the Friday by myself. I previously left my son in the Minories. I did not notice anyone was following me when I went to Mr. Robinson's private office. I was standing in the warehouse about a minute whilst speaking to the clerk. I do not know who the man was who came after me; I wish I did. What his business was I do not know. He was standing in the room while I was showing Mr. Robinson my list, and all at once he came near the table and then rushed out of the office. I had not seen any money myself there. When I went out I only walked downstairs. It was rather, darkish on the staircase, and I put both hands on the banisters. When I got downstairs I stopped three or four minutes where the office is, then I went on to Smithfield Market and saw my son-in-law. That is all I know about the matter. When I said I had never been to the place in my life, I was thinking of another Long Lane in my neighbourhood. When I thought about it, I admitted I had been to Mr. Robinson's place. I do not remember saying that I had never seen Mr. Robinson in my life.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There are not necessarily two of us who go together for subscriptions; not once in (50 times. My son-in-law occasionally comes with me. Cooper has never come with me. I have not seen him for five or six weeks. Mr. Robinson could have caught me up when I went downstairs if he had liked. There was no occasion to run downstairs; I had done no harm. If I had known that anyone had taken money off the table, I would have been the first one to have caught him. I have only heard about a man named Cooper. I do not know him. He has never lived in my house.</p>

                  </persName>, Willesden. I have made a plan to scale showing Aldershot Road and Edgware Road and Hanover Road. The red circle on the plan is waste ground. This is plan No. 1. I produce a second plan showing the piece of waste land and a section of Hanover Road, showing No. 71, and the foot-path on the south side of the water land. Aldershot Road, Kilburn, in one mile 600 yards from this place. The direct road to Edgware would be up the Edgware Road. That is on the way to Watford, by road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. To go to Watford by train you could go to Willesden Junction or travel to Queen's Park. It is five miles 1,020 yards from the corner of Aldershot Road to Edgware. The shortest way from Aldershot Road to Willesden Green Station would be up Willesden Lane. You could go by Chevening Road, crossing the N. L. Railway at Kensal Rise Station, and so up Hanover Road and Sidmouth Road, but it would be a long way. A person going that way to Willesden Green Station would not go across the waste piece of land at Hanover Road, where there is a footpath. One could do it, but one would be going back towards the Harrow Road, away from Willesden Green Station altogether. One would go across the waste piece of ground, but not where it is shown as a footpath.</p>

                  </hi>, 147 and 149, Sutherland Avenue, Maids Vale. Prisoner was in the service of myself and wife from March 23 till July 23. Before she left we noticed she was getting stouter, and my wife said, "You appear to be rather stout," and prisoner ex<lb/>plained it by saying she was suffering from illness. My wife sug<lb/>gested it would be as well for her to see our medical man, and she agreed, but as at that time we were busy we suggested she should see him later on, in August. Nothing more was said about her stoutness. I had warned my wife previously not to say anything I identify this teacloth handed to me as my property. It has our joint initials, "H.L.A." Prisoner would constantly have access to such articles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. She was a satisfactory servant and a respect<lb/>able, hardworking, good girl. We did not actually tell the girl the date when the doctor would see her. I think that was most probably</p>

               <p>arranged between my wife and myself that we should leave the matter over.</p>
               <p>Re examined. The fact that she was to see the doctor was men<lb/>tioned and agreed to by her. I think that conversation was quite early. When we engaged her she had rather a long loose cloak on, and it was when she came into service that we noticed her stoutness.</p>

                  </hi>, 17, Aldershot Road, Kilburn, wife of David Young Prisoner took a furnished bedroom at my house on July 23, I think. It was a small back room just over the kitchen. I noticed that the was pregnant, but I did not speak to her on that subject. She told me the suffered from dropsy. She came into the room and told me she was suffering from dropsy and wanted a rest, when I first saw her. Previously she had left an address at Sutherland Avenue for me to write to her, as I was out when she called about the room. She continued to occupy the room till August 3, but during that time she went to Watford. That was on the Wednesday, July 31. She told me she was going to her young mans sister's, and that that was where she made her home when out of a situation. She case back on August 2 between 10 and 11. She went out in the evening. I was in my kitchen on Saturday, August 3, about 10.30. I was waiting to send breakfast up to a gentleman, and was sitting at needlework, and I distinctly heard the sound of a baby's cry coming from the bedroom which prisoner occupied. My daughter was in the front room cleaning, and the also heard the noise. I went to the bedroom door and knocked. Prisoner said, "Who is there?" I said, "It's me." She said, "You cannot come in; I am washing and dressing." I heard her go out about an hour after<lb/>wards. She ran down the stairs. It is not a very long flight, but she ran very fast. She was out about an hour, or a little longer. Then she came in and asked me if Carter Peterson's had been for her boxes. She had told me on the Friday that she was leaving on Saturday. Carter Peterson's came while she was speaking to me in the kitchen; they took her boxes, and she went afterwards between one and two. She was only carrying an umbrella. She told me she was going to Guilford Street, Russell Square. After she had gone I went into her room and found the sheets were stained red.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I remember the dates distinctly. Somebody came and asked me whether she had left my house during the time she was there and that brought it back to my memory. That was before the police court proceedings. I did not mention anything shout it at the police court. I did not see prisoner at all on the evening of August 2. When I heard what I took to be the baby's a cry and knocked at her door I got an answer at once, perfectly clearly She went out soon after 11. Anybody going downstairs would probably be seen by me or my daughter at that time. As a matter of fact, we did not see her go out. If she had had a child the night before I should expect to find stains of blood on her sheets. If she had had a child in that room between 10 and 11 on the morn<lb/>ing of August 3 I should have expected to find something more than.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210108"/>
               <p>I did find. I said at the police court that I thought I might have made a mistake as to the cry of the baby. There are babies a few doors down from my house. It was fairly warm weather, and it would not be unusual for people to have their windows open. Pri<lb/>soner was a well-conducted girl while with me.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I was not mistaken in thinking that she was pregnant.</p>
               <p>To the Judge. On the Saturday she walked about and talked quite naturally. She stood at the end of my kitchen table for about a quarter of an hour talking.</p>

                  </hi>, daughter of last witness. I knew prisoner as Miss Jacobs. She was away for a night or two before she left our house. When she returned on August 2, between 9.30 and 10 p.m., I opened the door. It was a wet night. She went straight to her room. On Saturday morning, about 10 a.m., I was upstairs in the front bedroom. Prisoner's bedroom was on the floor beneath, two or three stairs down. I heard the cry of a baby coming from her room. I saw mother go and knock at the door, and I heard the prisoner speak. Prisoner went out about an hour afterwards and came back between one and two. I could not be certain of the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was not at the police court. I had seen In<lb/>spector Pollard before the case was on there and he did not ask me to attend. I was sweeping the room out on the morning of August 3 and had the window open. There is certainly one and there may be more babies within a few doors of us. I do not remember the time I let her in on any other evening. On August 2 it raised, beginning at eight p.m. It was not so late as 10.30 when she re<lb/>turned. My mother was not in bed when she came in. She gees to bed at all times.</p>

I went across a piece of waste ground there and found a brown paper parcel close to the fence of No. 71. There was long grass there. I opened one end of the parcel, which was tied with tape. There was a shawl also. When I undid it I saw a child's feet and legs. I took it away and handed it to Police constable Cull.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The parcel did not appear to have been dis<lb/>turbed. There was an indentation in the grass where it had been lying. It may have been there some time for all I know.</p>

The outside covering was a pink woollen shawl and a sheet of brown paper was on one side of it. Inside there was a large piece of cotton wool sawn on to. a muslin curtain with broad white tape sewn on to each corner; two pieces of waterproof cloth, of which I produce one; and this teacloth, which was in the mouth of the child—a part of it. There was this piece of tape round the neck. There were a pair of scissors and a piece of lead pencil with silk string attached. There were also the body of a child and the after-birth. A piece of broad white tape was tied tightly round the neck of the child. It was tied at the back with a double knot and bows. I was present when Dr. Roberts made the first examination of the body.</p>

                  </persName>. About three o'clock on Saturday, Sep<lb/>tember 7, I was in the company of Sergeant Cole and Detective Rum<lb/>bold, when we saw prisoner walking along Russell Square towards Oxford Street. I stopped her and said, "Miss Jacobs!" She stopped and looked at me and said, "Yes, sir. "I said, "We are police officers and are making inquiries respecting you. The body of a newly-born male child was found in a field at Okehampton Road, Kensal Rise, on August 13, and an inquest was held on it, and a verdict of wilful murder returned against some person or persons. unknown." She trembled and turned white. I said to her, "You had better be careful as to what you any in reply to any question that I put to you." She replied, "I understand."</p>
               <p>Mr. Curtis Bennett objected to the statement made by prisoner being given to evidence on three grounds: That the remark of the officer, although unintentional, was in the form of a threat; that the officer did not tell the prisoner that she need set reply unless she liked; that the officer ought to have told her that whatever he said might be used against her in evidence. He cited <hi rend="italic">Male v. Cooper</hi>, 17 Cox Cave, J.); and <hi rend="italic">R. v. Thompson</hi> (Coleridge, L. C. J., and Cave, J.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence ruled that the remark of the officer was a caution, not a threat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curtis Bennett then submitted, on the second point, that no statement made in answer to questions from a polios officer was admissible in evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence: You have not got from him yet that he pot any questions.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined (on point of Law). The journey in the cab took 25 minutes. She did not speak from Russell Square till we got to the Euston Road—about a quarter of an hour's conversation. I did not put any questions to her in the cab.</p>
               <p>By the Court. After she said, "I understand," I said, "In July last you were seen walking past Queen's Park Station, and you ap<lb/>peared far advanced in pregnancy." After that I put her in a cab. She seemed distressed and I did not speak to her. I described what took place just now as a "conversation." Detective Rumbold a also called it a conversation. But I did not speak to her. The question I was going to put to her was that I was going to take her to Kilburn Station and charge her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence said he could not infer that any questions had in fact been put.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210110"/>
               <p>Mr. Curtis Bennett on the second and third points cited R. v. Baldry (Cave J)</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence asked if there were any authority for saying that the omission to state that anything said by accused might be used against her rendered her statement inadmissible.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curtis Bennett said he could find no actual authority beyond the statement of Cave J.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence said that was a comment upon the statement, "You had better tell the truth," which was totally different to "You had better be careful" He could not exclude the evidence.</p>
               <p>Sir C. Mathews said he would take one more answer and would then invite his lordship's ruling lordship's ruling.</p>
               <p>Examination continued. After she said, "I understand," I said "At the end of July last you were seen walking past Queens Park Station, and you appeared far advanced in pregnancy." She replied, "That cannot be true, as I had a miscarriage in February last." Then a cab was called and I put her in it, and Rumbold and I got in. I told her I should convey her to Kilburn Police Station, where she would be detained and examined by a doctor. I had no power to have her examined without her consent, nor bad anyone. I had not time to ask her consent. She cried, and said, "Oh dear, oh no; do not do that"</p>
               <p>Sir C. Mathews asked his lordship's ruling as to whether the statement that fo<lb/>llowed was admissible.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence said under the circumstances they had no right to admit it.</p>
               <p>When charged at the police station prisoner made no reply.</p>

                  </hi>, detective, X Division. I was present when pri<lb/>soner was charged. A matron was sent for, and in the meantime prisoner was in my company and made a statement to me. That was about three hours after we arrived at the police station. When she started talking to me I said that whatever she told me I should' be compelled to take down in writing and it would be possibly used against her. She made a statement to me after I had given her that caution.</p>
               <p>Sir C. Mathews asked his lordships ruling that that statement was admissible, time having elapsed since the threat of the doctor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curtis Bennett submitted that the effect of that threat had not been removed.</p>
               <p>If one statement went, the other must go too.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence upheld the objection.</p>
               <p>Sir C. Mathews read the third statement of prisoner: "I felt ill and turned back. I had no idea' my confinement was so near. I went across some fields for a quick cut and suddenly felt pains of labour, and before I could go any further my child was born and I fell to the ground in a dead faint. I heard the child make a peculiar noise and I remembered nothing more for some time. No one was near. It was a dark and lonely place. I screamed. The child was under my clothes and I am sure it was dead. I do not know how I got into the road. I think I must have lain there two or three hours, for when I reached Aldershot Road it was past 11 o'clock The landlady's daughter opened the door. I intended telling the landlady, but she had gone to bed, and the next day I was shamed to tell her. God help those who find themselves in my position, friendless and alone. I had no intention to hurt my child. I felt</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210111"/>
               <p>so ill I thought I should have died. I did not tell the police I put something in the child's mouth or tied the strings round its neck. I have no recollection of what happened at the time. I felt so ill and frightened. Please grant me legal aid, as I want to call wit<lb/>nesses at my trial." The learned counsel said that was the state<lb/>ment which would go to the jury, together with the first part in which she stated that she wished to be confined at Watford, where all her other baby's clothes were. She wanted to have those for her baby, and had with her a few things which would be of assistance in her confinement, two pieces of mackintosh and other things. The doctor who would have been called would express the opinion that it was strongly probable that the child was born alive, but he could not say affirmatively that it had an existence separate from the mother. Under those circumstances he submitted that the best course would be to allow the prisoner to plead guilty to concealment of birth, which he understood the was prepared to do.</p>
               <p>Prisoner then pleaded guilty to concealment of birth.</p>

                  </hi>, 286, Waterloo Road, builder. On September 13, about 5.15 p.m. I was standing outside No. 12, Westminster Bridge Road. Prisoner was standing outside the opposite public-house with a woman. They were having a jangle. Prisoner was standing with his hand resting on the sill of the public-house window; the woman was standing in front of him with a baby in her arms. I saw her strike him with her open hand on the side of the face. He walked about twenty yards towards Westminster Bridge, and she followed, using very bad language. I did not hear what she was saying, but presumed it was bad language from the tone of her voice. He stopped and waved his hand, which I took to be telling her to go away. She walked towards the "Oxford" public-house again, and he followed her. She came right past the "Oxford," and turned round and met him again. She went to hit him on the face, but caught him on the chest with her open hand. They went on jangling, and then all of a sudden he stepped back and brought his arm right round and hit her in the face with his clenched hand. The whole affair took ten minutes, walking up and down and everything. Her head went back and she fell right down, baby and all. It seemed to me that prisoner stooped down over her. Then he went out of the crowd and went into the end door of the public-house, remaining there a few seconds, not possibly long enough to get a drink. Then he came out and stood round the side front facing Dodson Street. A constable came up and an ambulance was sent for. Prisoner walked away.</p>

                  </hi>, 18, Westminster Bridge Road, shoemaker. On September 13, at about 5 p.m., I saw prisoner and a woman quarrelling for about twenty minutes. She was calling him nasty names. She was drunk. Prisoner was not drunk, but had had some drink. Prisoner told her to go away several times. At last she hit him in the face twice with her fist. He said, "I don't want no say with you; you go away." He walked away and leaned up against the "Oxford" window. She came up again and made for his face, but hit him in the chest. She used very bad language. I heard what she said. Then he gave her a blow in the face and she fell on the back of her head. I could not say whether he hit her with his fist or the flat of his hand, but he did not hit her hard. I said before the Justices, "I think it was a blow with the flat of the hand he gave her." That is what I think.</p>

                  </hi>, house surgeon, St. Thomas's Hospital. I did not see Ellen Fitch till some hours after she was brought into the hospital. I saw her shortly after 8 p.m. She was quite un<lb/>conscious and in a state of deep coma. There was a lacerated, irregular cut on the back of the right side of her head. The edges were bruised and dirty, and it went down, to the bone. It was evi<lb/>dently caused by a heavy fall. She died about 2.30 the next morn<lb/>ing from the pressure of a clot of blood, which was outside the brain, but inside the scalp on the left side, due to the injury to the back of her head. A fall on the pavement would cause such an injury. When I saw her, in spite of the fact that her stomach had been washed out, she still smelt strongly of drink. That state would make her fall more heavily. There was no mark of injury on the face. If a blow struck her it could not have been a heavy one.</p>

                  </persName>, wife of prisoner. At the time of the occurrence I was living at 86, Church Street, Deptford. It took place on Septem<lb/>ber 6 between 10.30 and 11 a.m., shortly after I got out of bed. I was partly dressed and was sitting on the side of the bed with a baby in my arms. My husband asked me if I would go into the country with him, and I said I could not go with no underneath clothing and no boots. He hit me a thump in the ribs and took my breath away. Than he put his knee in my stomach and started using a razor. I screamed two or three times before he used the razor. Before that we were both calling one another names. I aggravated him so that he told me he would "do me in" before the day was out and used a foul expression. There was a knock at the door and my husband got up and opened it, and it was Mr. Francis, who was our landlord. I walked downstairs to the street. I saw a police-officer and told him who cut my throat. Then I was taken to the hospital. I identify the razor produced as my husband's. It has no handle.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. You could not provide a home for me and I took up with another man. He died and left me with a baby six weeks old. You continually annoyed me to go back and live with you. I did not want to. I know I have been very tantalising to you and aggravating.</p>

On Sep<lb/>tember 6 I was in the back and heard Mrs. Sexton call her husband a shocking name. They appeared to be quarrelling. Then I heard Mrs. Sexton cry out "Murder!" two or three times, but I did not take say notice the first time, and it was quiet for a time. Later on I heard the cries again and went to their room and knocked at the door. Prisoner came out and I said, "What are you doing?" His wife said, "He is murdering me, Mr. Francis." She was smothered in blood. I said, "I will go and get a policeman." I did so, and called him in, and she ran down into the street. I first saw the razor (produced) at the bottom of the stairs. It dropped out of prisoner's right hand.</p>

From what she said I took hold of prisoner. I called out to Police-constable Tack, "Look out; he has something in his hand." I heard some<lb/>thing drop, which turned out to be a razor blade, the one produced. It had fresh blood on it. When charged he said, "The baby is the cause of all the dispute."

After I had seen the woman in the hospital I saw prisoner again at the police-station, Deptford, and told him I should charge him with attempting to murder his wife. He said, "I think you are doing wrong. She done it herself. But, you please your self." When the charge was read to him he said, "That's good." His hands were covered with blood and he had a patch of blood on his left trouser leg slightly above the knee. The blood did not come from any cut on the hand.</p>

The following morning he came into the bar and said to me "I have been looking for you." I said, "Did you take that money yesterday?" He said, "Certainly." I asked him if they gave him a receipt. He said they were going to forward it. on to me. The cheque I gave him was one I changed for a customer. I told prisoner to take it to the bank and have it cashed, and then take the money to the brewery.</p>

On the way to the station he said, "It is not felony it is misdemeanour. I shall walk out of it. I know nothing about any money, and was drunk." When charged he said, "How can you make it stealing?"</p>
               <p>Prisoner, in defence, said that from Poplar he went straight to the bank in Lombard Street and there changed the cheque for money. Coming back to Aldgate he met some cabmen he knew and was asked to have a drink. He had 15s. of his own money and they had two or three drinks. Being asked how he came to be up there at that time of day, he told them the business he was on. There was a lot of people in the bar, and when he recovered himself he found he had no money whatever, his own 15s. having gone as well, hit allegation being that he had been robbed.</p>

I got up and followed the accused through several streets up and down shouting "Police!" until the constable came. Both men were con<lb/>cerned in it. I have no doubt as to the identity of the prisoner I was not drunk. Prisoner was also pointed out to the police by a lad named Jacob Lazarus. Prisoner did not really deny it at the time.

I chased him through several streets, and even<lb/>tually I saw prisoner coming back on the opposite side of the street, and the previous witness said to me, "That is the man that was running, officer."

Prosecutor came up and said, "That is the man that snatched my watch and chain." Prisoner said, "Is that all? Are you sure about your watch?" Prosecutor put his hand in his pocket and said, "Oh, no, not the watch; I have lost the chain." The chain was completely torn off; there was only the watch left.

Prisoner was in there with a female. I had some conversation with him and some drinks. I left between half-past seven and eight. When I got outside the public-house I was "claimed" from behind, and prisoner rifled my pockets. I had between 15s. and 16s. I raced prisoner down to the next turning, where I got tripped up, by whom I do not know. A constable came of shortly afterwards. I did not see prisoner till he was brought into the station, where I identified him out of a lot of men. I had not known him before that night.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. I left work at one o'clock. I did not meet you in the afternoon between one and two. I was not in the public-horse in the afternoon. I cannot tell how I spent my time up till seven o'clock. I left my shop mates between two and half-past. I was not in the "Queen's Head" public-house until five o'clock with two or three women. I am sure that I saw you outside the "Britannia" and that it was you who robbed me. I did say at the station, "I am not going to make a charge against an old comrade unless it is necessary."</p>
               <p>Re-examined. When I came out of the public-house I did not see this man following me. All I know, is that ha put his hand into my pocket and I followed him down.</p>

I told him I should arrest him on suspicion of being concerned with others in robbing a man a little while previous. He said, "What man?" I said, "You will be put up for identification." He was taken to the station, placed with eight other men, and identified by prosecutor. When the charge was read prisoner said, "That is a lie; he cannot prove it." Prosecutor charged prisoner with stealing 15s. or 16s. On the prisoner was found 9s. 6d. in silver and 2d. in bronze. This was at about quarter-past eight. The complaint was lodged about six o'clock. Prosecutor might have had two or three glasses of beer, but he was sober.</p>

Prosecutor told me he had been in the Artillery and had a pension of 6d. a day, so I said, "Are you going to charge an old comrade?" He said he would not charge me unless it was necessary, but the Inspector said, "You have done it now." On the Monday morning prosecutor told the magistrate he had lost between 17s. and 18s. I have no witnesses to prove that the man was in the public-house that afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>, 48, Cookham Buildings, Shoreditch. I am a barman employed at the "Queen's Head," Commercial Street. Prosecutor, in company with a lot of women, was in the house between half-put one and five o'clock. I do not know him as a customer; he is a stranger to me. I remember him because he was making a fool of himself is the bar. He was not drunk at that time, but he was in the house later in the evening two or three times with prisoner's wife and a number of men besides. Towards the end of the evening he was troublesome and I had to order him out. I have known prisoner about six weeks. I know nothing about this robbery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. When prosecutor and prisoner left in the after<lb/>noon they went out together. I have a good recollection for faces. I have been at this house six weeks. Before that I was working for Ridley and Co. in Stamford Street.</p>

Prosecutor said, "I am not going up against him." That was after prisoner had been given into custody. He asked me to nave a drink and asked, "Is that right, that the prisoner's people are well-to-do?" I said, "They are not well-to do. but they are all respectable people. Then he said, "Her husband has robbed me of 15s. If you can make that amount up I shall not go on with it." I said, "No, I do not want to get myself into trouble." Thereupon a man who had been listening gave prosecutor 2s., as he said he had not enough money to go home with, and he then left.</p>

               <p>Mr. S. T. Evans, M. P., who, with Mr. R. D. Muir, appeared on behalf of the prosecution, stated that there had been a consultation with the counsel representing prisoner—Messrs.

               <p>Mr. Elliott confirmed this statement, and Mr. Evans further said that, though the prosecutor accepted prisoner's undertaking, there was no question of an honourable settlement, and the indictment could remain on the file, so that if the matters complained of were repeated, the trial of the indictment would be pursued. <rs id="t19071021-57-verdict-1" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I have pleaded guilty to this charge. Prisoner never entered the church or stole anything; he didn't go near the church; he walked across the field, and said he did not want anything to do with it. He advised me not to do it. I never saw him sell any of the spoons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner advised me just before we broke in; I was intoxicated.</p>
               <p>To the Common Serjeant. When we came out of the church we met prisoner again; he was walking slowly; we then bad the spoons in our possession, and when we showed them to prisoner he advised me to put them back. The other man advised me not to. I went into a shop and sold a dozen the other two men were with me. I got 15d. for them. I rejoined the others and gave Bage the money. I carried the other five dozen spoons, and took two more dozen to another shop, but the man wanted an explanation of where I got them. I left the two dozen there and never went back for them. That shop was in Peckham. I told the others that the shopman wanted a note, and Bage wrote one and asked me to take it back, but I would not, so he took the rest of the spoons and sold them. Before that prisoner jumped on a car and left us. Bage had all the money; he bought a pair of boots with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner (not on oath). I think I have proved myself clear of breaking into the chapel or stealing the property. I advised Goddard not to do it, but he was too drunk to listen; I told him he would spoil everything and be sorry for it.</p>

                  </hi>, 38, Albion Road, Dalston, timber merchant. In 1902 I wished to purchase a vault in Abney Park Cemetery and was in communication with prisoner about it. He had done something for my father and mother's tomb. He called at my office in May, 1902, and I went with him to the cemetery on the Saturday morning. He said he had a vault, which was formerly the property or Jeremiah Colman, mustard-maker. He said he wanted £45. At the cemetery he pointed out the vault, which had Mr. Colman's name on the tomb outside. I agreed to purchase it there and then, and he came back to my office, where I paid him by cheque (produced) on London and South Western Bank. The receipt is produced. At the time I believed his statement that the vault was his property. He said he would forward the grant on Monday or Tuesday, but it did not come. I wrote him the letters (produced), the first on May 9, asking him to forward transfer of vault, to which I had no reply. I never saw his premises until after the transaction. I wrote to his business address, 88, Rectory Road, Stoke Newington. I wrote again on May 12, saying unless I heard by the 14th I should communicate with Mr. Colman. I received the letter (produced) May 13: "I cannot get transfer till the letter part of the week, but will bring it over at once on arrival." I did not receive it. On the 24th I wrote saying that unless I had it by Tuesday next or the money back I should take other proceedings. I then received the letter of May 26: "I shall be at your office on Friday next with grant of vault. Sorry for delay." I wrote again on the 27th, saying I was surprised at his conduct, but would wait till the day he mentioned, and again threat<lb/>ened proceedings. A telegram was sent by me on May 30, saying I had waited at my wharf all day expecting him to call. He never did, nor write to me. A little while after I went to see Mr. Colman, and eventually purchased the vault from him. I then communicated with Abney Park Cemetery, explaining everything, and the next I heard of prisoner was when he was arrested.</p>
               <p>To the Prisoner. When I paid you the cheque you said nothing to me about wanting the money to pay Mr. Colman's agent. You asked for an open cheque, and said it being Saturday the money</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210122"/>
               <p>would be useful to you. I went to the bank with you, but I did not instruct the cashier to pay you. I went with you in order to pay some money in.</p>
               <p>To the Common Serjeant. Prisoner did not bring a letter from Mr. Colman asking him to find a purchaser, nor say that there was such a letter, nor that he was acting for Mr. Colman. Having pre<lb/>vious transactions with prisoner I naturally thought I was dealing with a straightforward man.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I never heard of Mr. Colman's agent till I went to see Mr. Colman. I made two or three inquiries about prisoner after this, and heard that he was a shifty customer, but I did not wish to take police action in case he might wriggle out of it and bring an action for false imprisonment.</p>

                  </hi>, chairman of Colman and Co., Limited, mustard manufacturers. I live at Gatton Park, Surrey. In 1902 I wished to sell a vault at Abney Park. I had not seen prisoner before the police court proceedings, as far as I know. In 1902 my estate agent (now dead) had correspondence with a Mr. Dunkley, who I understood made an offer for the vault of £32, which I was ready to accept. I never received the money, so cancelled the agreement by writing. In May of 1902 Mr. Lines called on me, and I sold him the vault in September.</p>
               <p>To the Prisoner. It is possible that you wrote to me about the vault. My agent at Gatton Park would have written you in reply; it is very unusual for me to sign a letter myself. I nearly always sign my letters from Cannon Street. I did send my agent to see you. My agent would report to me, and I know that telegrams passed between him and "Albert Dunkley."</p>
               <p>To the Common Serjeant. We understood prisoner had a pur<lb/>chaser, and that he would complete the purchase and then transfer it to his customer. When Mr. Lines called and gave me certain information I wrote and asked Dunkley to complete, and ultimately I think about September 1—I wrote saying I considered the trans<lb/>action at an end.</p>

                  </hi>, 158, Great Titchfield Street, tailor. In August, 1905, I saw the prisoner and had a conversation about a grave in which my uncle was buried, in Abney Park Cemetery. Pri<lb/>soner agreed to repaint it for £2, which I paid him, and the grave was repainted. My wife was buried in Abney Park, but there was no stone over her grave, so I asked prisoner what he would charge for one. I had a printed circular from prisoner's place of business; it may have been the same as the one produced. The letter produced was sent me by prisoner, where he offers to paint the monu<lb/>ment for £2. I paid him £1 18s., as he allowed 2s. discount because he wanted the money. In regard to my wife's grave, he offered to put up a stone, and showed me two photos, which I said I would submit to my daughter, who selected the one she liked, and then I saw pri<lb/>soner again. He said the stone would be about £4, I think. I paid</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210123"/>
               <p>him £2 on account. (Receipt produced.) On December 18 he called and showed me a memo, from the Cemetery Department, Town Hall. Marylebone. Lane, saying that the cost of purchasing grave would be £2 11s. Prisoner said this ought to be paid, and he would take it from me to the Court House and get the grant, as perhaps next year it would be a little more, so I gave him £2 11s., which I under<lb/>stood he paid away. He called again about December 30 and asked for £1 to pay his workmen, which I gave him. (Receipt produced.) I never saw him after that. I wrote one or two letters, but received no answer. I believe I wrote to Fleetwood Street, Church Street, Stoke Newington, one of his addresses. I went to Abney Park Ceme<lb/>tery and saw my uncle's monument was painted. My daughters went to the Marylebone Cemetery, Finchley. On May 9 I received a letter, "I am sorry I did not see you at Abney Park Cemetery. Your stone will be fixed May.18 without fail." I suppose he had heard I was at the cemetery on the 18th. I heard nothing more till prisoner was in custody.</p>
               <p>To the Prisoner. You did not come and tell me that the Maryle<lb/>bone Council refused to take the money until you showed them a drawing of the headstone and copy of the inscription. You had the words My daughter says the stone is not fixed at Finchley Cemetery.</p>

               <p>(Defence.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">PRISONER</hi> (not on oath). Some years ago Mr. Colman purchased a vault in Abney Park Cemetery for the interment of a child and erected a tomb on same. I have restored this tomb for him several times. About five or six years ago he had the child removed to Norwich to be reinterred. I wrote to 108, Cannon Street to ask him if he would sell the vault. He answered that he would be pleased if I could find a purchaser, stating that it cost him about £100. Soon after a gentleman called at my works, Mare Street, saying he was Mr. Colman's agent. I asked him what he wanted for the vault; he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210124"/>
               <p>said £40, and left his address, Gatton Park, for me to communicate. A week or two after I telegraphed offering £35, to which he agreed. I tried several customers but could not tell. I had just done some work for Mr. Lines, and knowing his family grave was full, asked him if he would buy this one. He came and saw it and agreed to give £45. He wrote me cheque for same, and I asked him to leave it open as I wanted to pay the agent, and for the grant transfer. He said, if that was the case he would accompany me to the bank, which he did, and cash the cheque, four £10 notes and £5 in gold. I want to impress on the jury the reason I have not paid the money to Mr. Colman for the vault. I am wrong here I know, but I cannot help that. In June, 1900, my father died giving me a small legacy, and an eighth share in the residue of the estate (prisoner read a long statement about his share in the will. etc., the gist of which was that the money was not forthcoming when he expected it, and he had got into difficulties thereby. When he received money he cleared off his debtors with the exception of Mr. Lines). I am now ready to com<lb/>plete the work for him. I am perfectly solvent, and have money owing. I have been at Abney Park Cemetery 34 years, and have never had a complaint from the cemetery since I have been there. I am perfectly willing to come to an agreement for the return of the money. I have never had a conviction. I have nearly 100 testi<lb/>monials from City people, starting with Mr. Winston Churchill.</p>
               <p>To the Common Serjeant I could not send to my place for Mr. Wentworth's stone as I have been in prison three weeks and cannot get in communication with anybody. I have no works now. I can<lb/>not tell you where the stone is.</p>

               <p>(Friday, October 25.)</p>
               <p>On taking his seat the Common Serjeant said he had read the de<lb/>positions; there seemed to be nothing to negative the defence put forward, and he did not think it worth while to go on with the case. It could be left on the file of the Court so that it could be brought up again, if desired.</p>
               <p>Concerning the conviction of misappropriation, Police-sergeant Sharp said that prisoner had been carrying on similar frauds for some time, but there had been no actual convictions against him. Sentence,

                  </hi>, Rose Cottage, Chequers Lane, Potters Bar, gamekeeper to William Gundray. Edwin Sharp is my assistant. On the night of October 2 I was with Sharp at about 11.30 p.m. in what is called the big wood at the back of North Lodge, Enfield, near a meadow called Pond Meadow. We had a dog, and in consequence of its growling I turned on my electric torch in the direction of Pond Meadow and saw three men in the act of taking up a net. I went up to them and said, "What are you doing here?" Cooper immediately struck me on my head with a stick cut for the purpose. I closed with him, and while we were struggling on the ground I saw Williams making off with the nets, so I said to Sharp, "Go for that man!" He followed him. Kenny came to Cooper's assistance and commenced kicking me on the body and legs, and when I was being overpowered I called for Sharp. Just before he arrived Kenny dealt me a severe blow on the head with a stick, rendering me un<lb/>conscious. Afterwards Williams came and struck me on my arm</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210126"/>
               <p>with a stick, and Cooper and Kenny threw stones. I kept Williams there till we got more help. I had blown a whistle for help. Augh<lb/>ton came up. We detained Williams, but the other two had gone away. Williams did not want any holding because I had knocked him down. On the ground there was this net (produced) about 50 yards long, and this frame for stretching out the net. There was also a dog belonging to Williams and some stones which had been thrown at me. I picked them up in the field. There were two rabbits, still warm. This stick (produced) was found by the side of Williams.</p>
               <p>To prisoner Williams. The stick was not 20 yards from you when I picked it up, but close to you.</p>
               <p>To prisoner Cooper. I saw you with a stick. I did not knock you down when I first saw you. You were the first man who struck me. I did not find these stones on a flint heap. I had never seen you before. Two other men were taken in charge at Tottenham Police Court, Walter Reed and Edward King. They were put among other men and I picked them out and they were charged.</p>
               <p>To prisoner Kenny. I did not swear that a man named King assaulted me nor a man named Reed.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Justice Lawrence. The two other men arrested were dis<lb/>charged by the magistrate. I did not swear to them being the men who assaulted me.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I am quite certain of the men. Pond Meadow was pasture land, and there are no stones in the meadow. I went there the next day and found none except those which have been pro<lb/>duced.</p>

                  </hi>, assistant keeper to Mr. Gundray. On the night of October 2 I was with Boxford. I saw three men taking up a net. Boxford walked towards them and I went behind him. He turned on his light and the three men drew back and he closed with Cooper. Williams went to get away and he told me to go after him, which I did. Williams was taking away a net and a few rabbits. He got as far as the fence and I pulled him out and struck him. I heard Box<lb/>ford calling for help and went to him, leaving Williams, whom I had pulled out into the meadow. Kenny and Cooper were on the top of Boxford. I struck the first one, Kenny. They were knocking him about. Kenny came for me and struck me on the right arm. We struggled and Kenny got away. Then Williams came up and struck me on the right shoulder. I knocked him down and he stayed there. Kenny ran away. I did not see Cooper then; he went away in the dark after I left him with Boxford. A whistle had been blown, and when Aughton came up Cooper and Kenny had both gone away. A stone was thrown at Boxford, I could not say by whom. All three men were together at the time. The net, these sticks, and two rabbits were found there, and these stones were picked up. The big stick was found close to Williams. He had struck me with a stick.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210127"/>

               <p>To Kenny. At the Enfield Police Station I did not pick anyone out, nor at Tottenham.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Justice Lawrence. I saw no one but these three men. I am sure that Kenny is one of the three.</p>

                  </hi>, farm bailiff, North Lodge Farm, Enfield. On October 2, about 12.30, I heard some dogs barking and a whistle blown just as I was going to bed. I went towards Pond Meadow and there I saw Williams lying on the grass. I helped to find the short net and the stick used. This stick was lying about four yards from Williams. I did not find the stones. The two rabbits were in the bag. The police and the doctor were sent for.</p>

I told him I should take him to the police station for night poaching and for assaulting the keeper Boxford. He made no reply. On the way to the station he threw this stone (produced) away. He took it from his right-hand side coat pocket. He was taken to the police station and seached, and this small flint was found in his right-hand coat pocket. When charged he said, "Oh, did I assault him?" meaning Boxford. The divisional surgeon was sent for. Williams was suffer<lb/>ing from a wound on his head and so was Boxford.</p>
               <p>To Williams. I saw you throw this stone away, and picked it up immediately, not the next day. It is not true that I went with my lamp to try and find it and could not.</p>

                  </persName>, Southgate. At 3.30 p.m, on October 3 I was with Detective Summers in West Street, Edmonton, and saw Cooper go into No. 47. I followed him and said, "There is a warrant for your arrest for night poaching last night" He said, "Oh." He was partly dressed. I asked him if he lived at 47 and he said, "No, next door." I took him to 45 where Detective Summers was. He had the warrant and took it out of his pocket. Cooper said, "I do not want to hear that; I know all about it. Give me my boots." He was charged at Enfield Police Station and made no reply.</p>

                  </persName>, Enfield. With regard to King and Reed, whose names have been mentioned, early on October 3 I re<lb/>ceived information that a poaching affray had taken place, and also a description of the two men who had got away, by telegram. I made inquiries and arrested two well-known poachers, who I know had been poaching that night, (but not with this gang. They were Reed and King. They were detained at the police station and subsequently charged. I afterwards took them before the Magistrate and had them discharged. No evidence was offered against them. Neither Sharp nor Boxford swore to them as being the men. It was merely an arrest by myself on suspicion. On October 3 I received two war<lb/>rants</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210128"/>
               <p>from the Tottenham Bench for the arrest of Cooper and Kenny. I went to the front door of No. 45, West Street, Edmonton, having ascertained that Cooper lodged there. I knocked and was told he was not in. Afterwards I saw him brought back by Court. I took out the warrant and he said, "I do not want you to do that; I know all about it." When charged he said, "All right." On October 4, as. I was taking him to the Wood Green Petty Sessions, he said, "My ribs are very bad. Someone must have kicked me as well as hit me on the head. I never hit anyone. It was the other man who struck them. But if I had not been there I should not have got this." He was remanded. On October 7 Williams and Cooper were charged at Enfield Petty Sessions with assault. Cooper said, "Williams nor me never struck anyone; it was Kenny that done it." At 45, West Street, when I arrested Cooper, I found this 50 yards net hanging on a peg in the room he occupied. I said, "You have a net here, Jack." He said, "Yes, I am making that for someone." I said, "I will take possession of it for the time being." He said, "You will not have it; it belongs to another man. He has paid me 15s. for it, and he has got to give me another 10s. before it becomes his property." On October 8 I arrested Kenny at his house. I had been there many times, but that was the first time I could see him. I took the warrant out of my pocket. He said, "I do not want you to read that; I know all about it." I read the warrant, and he replied, "All right; I suppose we shan't get much." On the way to Enfield police station he said, "I shan't know anything about it. "When charged he replied, "All right." On October 7 I went to the Pond Meadow to see if there were any stones of this kind about and could find none. The hay has been taken off this season.</p>
               <p>To Cooper. I arrested King and Reed. I saw you at the end of Baker Street, close to Silver Street. Neither King nor Reed are 6 ft. high. I know them.</p>
               <p>To Kenny. When I read the warrant you did not say you knew nothing about it.</p>

                  </hi>, divisional surgeon, practising at Pot<lb/>ters Bar. On October 3 I was sent for to the police station and examined Boxford. He was suffering from a lacerated wound of the scalp about two inches long, which I dressed. After an interval of some days I examined him again and found a bruise on the leg. The wound on the scalp might have been caused by a stick like the one produced. The wounds were not serious, but it is impossible to say what may have followed. Williams had a very similar wound on the scalp which I dressed. I saw no others.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business at 14, New Burlington Street, W. I am chairman and managing director of S. F. Edge, Limited, 1907; chairman and managing director of De Dion Bouton, Limited, and sole world's selling agent for Napier's. I also hold the world's record at Brooklands. I am therefore much interested in motor car manufacture. I have known prisoner a great many years; in fact, since when at school. I knew him when he was with Mr. Napier two or three years ago. I know his handwriting very well. I have seen a great deal of it. I have had no grudge against him and was very sorry when he left Napier's. I asked Mr. Napier why he left, and he said he left of hit own free will. There is no reason why he should have a grudge against me. I received a letter dated August 22, through Mr. Cook, Mr. Napier's solicitor. It is addressed from 43, Larkhall Rise, Clapham, S.W., to me (letter read). I did not reply to it, but handed it to my solicitor. These letters and postcard (produced) I obtained from Mr. Napier's solicitor. The postcard ran, "And after I have shown that white-faced, adulterous cad up, I will kill him." Looking at these letters and at the card there was no question in my mind that it was in Sultzberger's hand-writing. The writing is somewhat different, either disguised or</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210130"/>
               <p>written in great haste. I took a serious view of the matter and sent the letters and postcard at once to my solicitor to find out what was the best thing to do, and proceedings were taken before a magistrate for the defendant's arrest.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Sultzberger has a very good character, so far as I know. I know nothing against him. Anything I can say about him is to his good. I took Police Court proceedings in September, the information being sworn on the 19th. I got the letters about two days before that. My telegraphic address is "Notrifier, London." On September 11 I do not remember receiving a telegram signed Sultzberger to this effect: "Confirm my letter August 22 in Napier's hands." Telegrams would be opened in the office and would not necessarily be brought before me. The way I came to go to Mr. Napier's solicitor was that Mr. Napier asked me if I had had a letter from Sultzberger, and said that he had had one. I said I should like to see it, and he said Mr. Cook had got all the letters. I at once telephoned or wrote to Mr. Cook. Two days afterwards I applied for a warrant. I thought if the man would write such a postcard it was dangerous, and he should at once be put under restraint. I knew prisoner's brother and himself. They are respectable people. Undoubtedly there are mechanical differences in the writing of the postcard and that of the letter. It seemed to me the postcard was written in haste or disguised. It is somewhat different from any of his I had seen. Mr. Gurrin was not called at the police court. He is to be called because I wish the truth ascertained. I have gone at desperate speeds on motor-cars, but I never thought I faced death. I took this postcard seriously.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I drive myself, and do not feel there is any risk.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business at Acton Vale and am a director of Napier and Sons, Limited, motor manufacturing company. Defendant entered my service in 1899, starting at a small salary and eventually rising to £5 a week. He conducted himself respectably and to the best of his ability. He left in 1905 of his own initiative. I have received a dozen letters perhaps from him since he left, some of the earlier ones stating he was not able to get employment. I received a letter from him on August 22, 1907, con<lb/>taining an enclosure to Mr. Edge, which I did not forward. I re<lb/>ceived another letter on the 24th from him, stating that he had failed to stamp the letter to Mr. Edge and enclosing one. I was daily associating with him there. Many years ago I had an employee named Munn. I do not remember seeing the effusion referred to. I know prisoners handwriting. The letters are all his, and I believe the handwriting on the card is his.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have never heard anyone apply the term "adulterous" to Mr. Edge; it has no application to him. "White-faced, adulterous," is not an apt description of him. There are marked dissimilarities between the handwriting on the postcard and the letters. I should say the postcard was written in a great hurry</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210131"/>
               <p>I have never noticed such dissimilarities in his writing before. Since he left we have been friendly.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. The terms "mongrel waster" and "dishonourable cheat" also do not apply to Edge.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Justice Lawrence. Prisoner did not leave my service in consequence of anything to do with Edge, and I know of nothing to explain the letters. Schofield is still in my employment.</p>

                  </hi>, Bath House, Holborn Viaduct, specialist in handwriting. Four letters and a card have been put before me, which I have examined. All four letters are written by one person. To the beat of my belief the card is written by the same person who wrote the letters.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I do not profess to be infallible. I have my re<lb/>port in writing in my pocket. (Photographs of the postcard were Banded to the Jury.) There are some things which are different in the postcard, but I should not describe them as "marked dissimilari<lb/>ties." The "t's" are differently crossed. The terminations of me capital letters on the card go to the left; in the letters they gene<lb/>rally go to the right—I think invariably. It is not a marked pecu<lb/>liarity. No writer does anything invariably. It looks as though the card had been written under very strong excitement. I have seen similar cases before where excitement altered the general ap<lb/>earance of the writing. In the letter the "W. H." in "W. H. white" are distinct; in the postcard they run into one another and the "W" is different. There is a difference in the terminations of the "e's." The "E" in "Esq." on the letter is different from that of the postcard in to far as it is an independent letter, but it is not unlike it in design or size. The downstroke of the "q" touches the upstroke on this letter; in the postcard it does not, but otherwise the "q's" are very much alike. The figure "5" on the postcard is different in appearance from that on the letters. The "d" in "Road" is not the same as in the letters, but it appears to be somewhat like it I think the word "Putney" is deserving of comparison on the letters and card, and also the "W" beginning the address. Also the figure "4." The "5" is not very good. I do not say it is a "nasty knock." Then there is the "R" in "Rusholme Road." The "S.W." is rather different, but the "S" is similar in being of the printed form, but it is not connected with the next letter. I refer to the "S" in the words "September 6th." There are two ways of Baking the final "d" on the postcard. There is a "d" on this letter in "Limited" which is not unlike the "d's" on the postcard. It is not a facsimile. On the postcard the "h" goes considerably below the "C" in "Charles" and it does not in the letters, but the "C" is not altogether different. The "S" on the card is rather dis<lb/>torted. But is not quite different; it is somewhat different. I do not find the same crossing of the "t" on the card at in the letters. There is a difference in the signatures. The "g" is different and also the final "r," but, on the other hand, the "r's" written in the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210132"/>
               <p>same letter differ. The appearance of the writing on the card sug<lb/>gested to me that it was written in a hurry. I do not say it was dis<lb/>gussed. I cannot find any particular letter on the card which has a marked similarity with the writing on the letters. In the whole of the word "Putney" one finds in the letters a certain peculiarity which is reproduced in the admitted specimens; also the "K" and the "W." There is a peculiar throw-back at the end of the name "Sultzberger" which appears in one form or another at the end of every one of the signatures. Those are the main things I have pointed out in my report. Those are the things which struck me as being quite sufficiently alike to justify me in thinking the writing was the same.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. The swing-back at the end of the signature on the card is in all of the letters. In this new letter placed before me of July 23 to White I observe the formation of the "S," the cast back of the "r," and the word "Putney," which are similar to those on the card. The whole design of the "P" is very similar, and so is every letter to the end.</p>

                  </hi>, accountant to Napier and Sons and other firms, 73. Basinghall Street. I have known defendant a good many years and know his handwriting well. I should say the letters and the card are all in his handwriting. The letter of July 23 which has been produced was written to me by him. I received the letter of September 6 on the morning of the 7th, I think. By "waster" I took him to mean Mr. Edge. I received a postcard on the evening of the 7th with the postmark "Clapham" upon it, dated by the post-master" 7th September." It says, "And after I have shown that white-faced, adulterous cad up I will kill him.—Charles Sults<lb/>berger." I believe that to be in Sultzberger's writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I do not think I have ever seen any writing of his which more closely resembles that of the postcard than the letters now before me. Mr. Edge's company had the sole right of selling Napier's cars, but I took the words "mongrel waster" to refer to Mr. Edge. I do not know they referred to a man named Rain-forth who was in Mr. Napier's employ. I do not think Rain forth has any influence over Mr. Napier beyond business matters. In the letter of July 23 the "heaven-sent treasure" was Rain forth. My correspondence with Sultzberger did not refer principally to Rainforth.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Rainforth is not a member of the Edge Compact. The words in the same letter, "What an object-lesson this case will prove to our Socialistic friends" obviously cannot allude to Rain forth.</p>

               <p>Detective sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">TOM ANDREWS</hi>, W. Division. I executed a war<lb/>rant for defendant's apprehension at 43, Larkhall Rise, Clapham, on September 19. Before I read the warrant I told him I should arrest him. He said, "It is absurd." I read the warrant, and he said, "Well, I have not done so. This is most extraordinary." The war<lb/>rant was that he "Feloniously and maliciously sent and uttered and caused that the same should be received knowing the contents there—of a writing threatening to kill and murder one Selwin Francis Edge." Defendant continued, "This is most extraordinary. I have a copy of the letters I sent to Mr. Edge and to Mr. Napier." We went to Clapham Police Station. When the charge was read over he said, "I cannot understand the moaning of it."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I arrested him about 10.15 p.m. He went to a market of letters which he said were copies of those he had written. I saw they were numbered consecutively. He gave me one copy and I saw the others. There were letters which followed on after<lb/>wards. I looked at the bundles and satisfied myself that that was correct. This copy was found on him at the station when searched. I saw him take it from the bundle. The numbers are 63 and 54. I did not examine the other letters. So far as I could judge, he was thoroughly and genuinely surprised when I read the warrant.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I was born an English-man and have lived in this country all my life. I was formerly clerk to Mr. Napier for over six years. Since I left him I have only had short engagements. The letters of July 23 and August 22 and 24 are in my handwriting. I did not write this postcard handed to me, nor did anybody write it on my behalf. I knew nothing about it until I saw it at the police court. The statement made by Serjeant Andrews as to what happened when he arrested me is per<lb/>fectly correct. I took from a bundle, which contained copies of the letters I had written, the copy which he produced to-day. The term "mongrel waster" in my letter of September 6 to Mr. White referred to Rainforth. He made a suggestion, to which I refer in that letter. Mr. Napier acted upon that suggestion, and that was the cause of my resigning my position. The suggestion Rainforth made was to transfer away from me practically what constituted the buying, which I had been doing previously, which was the moat onerous of my duties. Previously I had Had a free hand—of course, under Mr. Napier's advice in the more important matters. I left in July, and I think Rainforth went there the previous March. I left, after seeing my brother. He advised me to leave. I left with<lb/>out giving notice. I offered a week a money. Mr. Napier had previously told me that Rainforth was not to interfere with my work in any way.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. In my letters which have been put in there is no reference to Rainforth by name, but I called him "that heaven-sent treasure." In other letters his name does appear. "Mongrel-waster" had no reference to Edge. Edge would be in daily contact</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210134"/>
               <p>with White and Napier. Rainforth would have to do with White. He was in touch with all the chief employees. The first part of the letter of September 6 refers to Edge. "The dishonourable cheat" means Edge. I am sorry. The words, "Those who touch tar are sure to be defiled," refer to Rainforth. As to what follows, "So I am afraid Mr. Napier's name will suffer accordingly," I cannot say how Mr. Napiers name was to suffer through Rainforth. (To Mr. Justice Lawrence.) Rainforth told a lot of lies in order to gain his end. (Cross-examination continued.) Rainforth had great influence although he only came in after the business was practically made and built up. There was a very great change due to him. The pas<lb/>sage, "What an object lesson this case will prove to our Socialistic friends," referred to Edge. I admit that those letters are rather con<lb/>fused. This begins and ends in reference to Edge, and in the middle it deals with Rainforth. As to the "lesson" to be inflicted, it was upon Mr. Napier, who had not treated me fairly. The words "lying mongrel" refer to Rainforth. I made a mistake in saying I would publish the correspondence, and I did not do so. I do not remember when I posted the letter of September 6. I think about lunch time. I should say the person who signed the postcard must know me The postmark is from the same postal district as the letter. The person would certainly know where I live. It wan a plot or a very bad joke. I cannot suggest anybody who would be likely to perpe<lb/>trate it. (To the Court.) One or two people knew there wan some correspondence with White. I do not think I told anybody the terms of the letter written to White, but I am not sure. (Cross-examination continued). I have observed that the postcard ap<lb/>pears to be a continuation written by somebody who knew the contents of the letter which had gone before. It struck me as very curious. I cannot say I had any confidant. From my side nobody knew the contents of the letter of September 6. I was going to inflict a lesson upon Mr. Napier, with respect to Mr. Rainforth. The prospectus had a bad effect upon me, because I had lost money in these industrial companies. I do not mean companies connected with motor-car manufacture; they are too risky. I sent the letters to Edge under cover to Napier because there had been correspondence between Napier and myself which has not been read, and in one letter to me there was a statement which, in my opinion, was entirely opposed to what the prospectus said. In one letter I stated he had obtained money improperly from the public. I did not send the evidence to "Truth," "John Bull," and "Motor Finance," as I threat<lb/>ened; I thought better of it. I thought there had been evil prac<lb/>tices. There was a covert threat against Edge in one letter, but Napier told me he had not forwarded it to Edge, and I took no steps to send a copy to him. On second thoughts I decided to drop the matter. I never said, "Do not forward that letter to Edge." but Napier sent my penny stamp which I enclosed back. Napier said be would not be the medium of communicating such an abominable letter. The expression I used, "fallen among thieves," was a general</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210135"/>
               <p>one. My mind was terribly upset. The words, "with what scorn I remember the charming effusion that contemptible creature wrote to Munn" refer to Edge. I did not write the postcard. On that night I was not excited; I was low-spirited. I cannot remember what I did, but I certainly did not write the postcard. That is a thing which one would not forget. Whatever resemblances there may be in the writing suggest to my mind that the person who wrote it had my writing before him. I could not dare to make a suggestion as to any<lb/>one having a feeling against me.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. The postcard is not stamped. I have never posted anything unstamped as far as I recollect. I have never written like the writing on the postcard. There had been considerable cor<lb/>respondence between Mr. Napier and myself with regard to the state<lb/>ments in the prospectus, and since 1905 with regard to Mr. Rainforth. Rainforth was made the buying agent. He also suggested that two or three of my junior clerks should leave me and he put under him. I had no reason to call Edge white-faced or adulterous. When I heard it at the Police Court it struck me as absolutely ridiculous. How Mr. Edge took it to himself I cannot understand. I had no intention of doing any physical injury to Edge or anybody else. I should be afraid to.</p>

                  </hi>, brother of prisoner. My brother has been depressed from want of employment He has often said to me he did not know what would become of him. He has not had money trouble because he has money of his, own, and I was in a position to help him if he had wanted it. I think what has been the trouble with him is that he has had nothing to do. I think his promise can be relied upon, and I am prepared to become his surety.</p>

                  </hi>, Heath field Cottage, Strand-on-the-Green, timber merchant. On July 12 last prisoner came to see me. He was introduced by Mr. Orange, one of our customers, who informed us he had let him a shop. Prisoner said he wanted some shops done up, and that he was a member of the firm of Alexander the Great Tailors, Cheapside. I referred him to my partner, as I simply attend to the clerical work. We eventually accepted the order, and sup<lb/>plied prisoner with goods, value about £25. They were shop fittings,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210137"/>
               <p>such as a pay desk and various other oddments required for a tailor. The terms were cash on delivery, but we did not get the cash. About August 12 I called at the shop in Chiswick High Road, saw prisoner, and asked him why the goods had not been paid for. He stated that his father was away motoring on the South Coast, and on his return a cheque would be forthcoming. As I was leaving I glanced up and noticed the name of Bradfield over the shop. I went back to prisoner and asked him why that name was up; he said it was a custom of Alexander the Great to open shops in other names, so as to prevent undue competition from neighbouring tradespeople. I told him that it seemed very peculiar, and I was not satisfied, and would make inquiries at once. I communicated with Mr. Orange, but he was away. In the shop there were a few rolls of cloth; that is all the stock I noticed. After I had made inquiries, I simply com<lb/>municated with the police right away; that was about 10 days after August 12. I was away for a few days, and when I came back pri<lb/>soner had left the shop; it was common knowledge in the place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It is not uncommon for a man to carry on busi<lb/>ness under a name not his own. I did not know that the work in question was being done for the father of prisoner. I do not know where estimate for the work was sent to; it may have been sent to Mark Alexander, "care of Scott, the Great Tailors." When prisoner called I simply asked him who he was and where he came from. We were informed on the telephone that Mr. Grange had let the shop to Alexander the Great Tailor; therefore we were satisfied; that was good enough for us. I say that I should not have taken the order, in the way I did if that statement had not been made. I could have put inquiries through the trade agent and got personal references. I deny that the credit was given to Mr. Mark Alexander. We know Alexander the Great Tailor by repute, and his name is good enough for us. I do not know whether there are other Alexander the Greats in other places. I do not know Mr. Miliffe; I met him for the first time at Acton Police Court.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw prisoner before his interview with my partner. That was at 8, Linden Arcade, in the presence of Mr. Orange, the owner of the shop. I asked him what firm he belonged to. He said he was a member of the firm of Alexander the Great tailors. I looked at the shop and saw what was to be done and took particulars, for estimating purposes. I sent the estimate to the address which he gave me—Mark Alexander, care of Scott Brothers, New Kent Road. Prisoner did not tell me what his Christian name was; simply Alexander; but I had reason to suppose it was Mark Alexander. Prisoner came again and asked us to reduce the price, as it was too high; I told him I could not; I would rather lose the order. Then he told me to get on with it, and we asked him whom we were dealing with, He said Alexander the Great Tailor. He said they had branches all over the country, and that very likely he should be having some more shops done, and should be glad of an<lb/>estimte</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210138"/>
               <p>for other work. I certainly believed he was a member of that firm.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The heading (produced) with the address. 24, New Kent Road, I have never seen before. I do not know how the estimate was addressed; that would oe done by one of the clerks; but I know it was sent to Mr. Mark Alexander, care of Scott Brothers, not to Scott Brothers. I was satisfied with the fact that Mr. Grange had let the shop to prisoner. I asked Mr. Grange about it, and he thought everything was satisfactory. The work we did for prisoner would not be of much value unless it was used for the shop.</p>

                  </hi>, 211, High Road. Chiswick (builder), owner of the shop, 8. Linden, Arcade. I put the house in the agents hands to let after which prisoner came to see me. (Mr. Degville objected to this evidence as not being connected with the charge. Mr. Sands said it was most most material as showing the number of representa<lb/>tions the prisoner was making. The Recorder thought it was admis<lb/>sible, and he could not exclude it, as it was in regard to the sane premises) Prisoner wanted to take one of my shops and said be had given the house agent references, and that he was a member of the firm of Alexander the Great Tailors. I let him the shop, which I should have done without reference almost, thinking he was a member of Alexander the Great Tailor. I was out of town when the shop was fitted up. I left on August 1, and did not return until the 29th. When I came back I visited the shop, and saw there was a name on the facia, "Sidney Bradfield."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. In the references that were given to me there was nothing about Alexander the Great, nor was there any reference in the agreement to that name. It was on my recommendation that Mr. Fry did up the shop for Mr. Alexander. I am told now that Mr. Mark Alexander signed the agreement for the letting. It appears that Mark Alexander is the prisoner's father. I have had no rent; he should have paid £7 10s.; that was due on September 29. I have retaken possession of the premises. I never spoke to Mark Alexander in my life; he was not my tenant; it was this man, the prisoner, who represented himself to be Mark Alexander. I cannot say that my memory is very good, but I have not suffered from loss of memory; I do not remember saying so at the police court. I have not discussed this matter with anyone.</p>

                  </hi>, 172, Clerkenwell Road (printer). On Saturday, July 13 last, prisoner came into my shop and said he was the son of Alexander the Great Tailor. He said he admired the speci<lb/>mens of the printing in the window, and he wanted a card printed very nicely, as early as possible on the following Monday, as he was going to attend a Conservative meeting in Chiswick. He also said that Alexander the Great was opening shops in different locali<lb/>ties, and it was the custom to open them under a different name in each place. I printed a card in the name of Sidney Bradfield, 8, Linden Arcade, Chiswick. Prisoner asked me if I could deliver the cards before six o'clock on Monday evening to "Scott Brothers, New</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210139"/>
               <p>Kent Road." He said that that was another branch of the firm of Alexander the Great. On Monday evening prisoner called and took the goods away himself, and I personally left some at Chiswick at to ironmongers, within one or two doors of the shop which prisoner opened under the name of Stanley Bradfield. The value of the goods was £5 6s. 9d. The reason I supplied them was that the prisoner told me he was a son of Alexander the Great.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner did not say he was the son of Mark Alexander. There was an envelope produced at the police court with an address on it, but I do not remember whether it was "Mark Alexander," or "Mr. Alexander." (Envelope produced.) There it no "Mark" on this envelope. The name is "Mr. Alexander, care of Scott Brothers." Very likely the name of Mark was mentioned. I knew that Scott Brothers trade as "great tailors." I called there after I submitted the sketch of a heading; that was after the prisoner called on me. Prisoner told me he might get me to do a lot of printing for Alexander the Great at the different branches, and after doing the heading for Stanley Bradfield, he asked me to submit mother sketch for a heading for Scott Brothers, and I did so. I should not have executed the order without references, unless the name of Alexander the Great had been mentioned, and I understood that he was acting for Alexander the Great. I am certain that that name was mentioned.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. At the police court I said, "I had an impression you were a son of Alexander the Great Tailor, and you said so." I have not been paid for the work I have done.</p>

                  </hi>, 17, Bolton Gardens, Chiswick, tailor. On August 10 I was engaged by prisoner to do some work at 8, Linden Arcade.</p>
               <p>Mr. Degville objected to this evidence as the witness earns on the scene long after the transactions referred to, and therefore it was not evidence on the counts against prisoner at all.</p>
               <p>The Recorder: It is evidence that prisoner was holding himself out as a particular person.</p>
               <p>Mr. Degville: He may have had a guilty intention in the prior act, but guilty in<lb/>tention is not proved by the subsequent act. It wee held in the case of R. v. Holt—I am quoting from Archbold 1900 edition, p. 583: "On a charge of obtaining money by false pretences from A., evidence of a subsequent obtaining of money by the defendant from B., by the same false pretences, was held not admissible." It is R. v. Holt Bell, 280; 30 L.J. (M.C.) 11.</p>
               <p>The Recorder: "And where the prisoner was indicted for obtaining eggs by false pretences, he having falsely represented by advertisements in newspapers that he was carrying on a bona fide dairyman's business, whereas in truth and in fact the business was a bogus one, evidence that on occasions subsequent to the transaction the subject of the charge be had obtained eggs from other persons by means of similar advertisements was held admissible."</p>
               <p>Mr. Degville: That is another case decided, I submit, on a different ground. There you had exactly the same transaction. Here there is a wholly different one.</p>
               <p>The Recorder: The only point is that he is at different times representing himself to be a son of this Alexander the Great. That is a false representation. It is clear on the general principle of law that you can show a man is holding himself out to be a particular person, and you can show he is falsely representing both before and after.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210140"/>
               <p>Mr. Sands: Of course, it would be evidence on the third and fourth accounts for obtaining credit by fraud, to show the nature of the whole transaction.</p>
               <p>The Recorder: That is one of the things in issue. The jury must be satisfied that it was done with intent to defraud.</p>
               <p>Examination continued. Prisoner told me he was the son of Alex<lb/>ander the Great Tailor, Cheapside, and he was engaging me on the latter's behalf. He told me he should engage me to be manager of the shop. As far as I remember he told me his fathers name was Mark. I was at the business from August 10 till the 31st. I saw somebody there—I did not know that it was Mark Alexander, but I saw a person there whom I afterwards found out was Mark Alexander This person used to run errands and rub the windows. I heard that man Mark Alexander give evidence at the police court; it was then I knew who he was.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Degville objected to questions as to the business which was carried on. The Recorder upheld the objection.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner told me when he engaged me that his father was Alexander the Great Tailor and was away on the touts coast motoring. I have heard several people have been told that I have seen Mr. Fry several times, but I have not said anything about this case to him; the same applies to Mr. Grange. I should say the reason I became manager was because prisoner told me he was the son of Alexander the Great Tailor. I do not think I should have staked my security had not I known he was connected with some firm. I had to place a security of £5. I do not know what has become of that; I have asked for it, but I have not got it back. I have had £5 worth of goods which I took from the shop; I could not get the money, so I took the goods. I only got a receipt for £410s. in regard to my £5. Prisoner told me when he engaged me that they were opening different shops in different localities under different names. He said there was one in New Kent Road in the name of Scott Brothers and another one somewhere else, and he said this shop was to be "Sidney Bradfield." He showed me a card. He told me his brother was manager of Scott Bros., and I believed at the time that it was a branch of Alexander the Great. I shut the shop up in Chis<lb/>wick. Prisoner came down in the afternoon and asked me if there were any orders or any deposits, and I told him no. He said, "I want you to pack the remaining cloth up; I am going to take it to some other shop and bring some fresh stuff on Monday." As I knew prisoner had no other shops and was not connected with any firm, and as he was going to take the cloth away and dispose of it as he did previously, and was not coming back, I shut up the shop and waited for two or three personal friends in Chiswick who had paid deposits on goods which they never got.</p>

I said, "Are you Mr. Alexander., trading in the name of Sidney Bradfield, late of 8, Linden Arcade, Chiswick" he said, "Yes," and I then read the warrant to him, and he said, "I am not the one you want; you want Mark Alexander, my father. I gave the order, but I deny it was by false pretences." He was taken to the station and charged, after which he said, "Now I wish to make a statement." He then made this statement: "That warrant is simply made out 'Alexander'; no Christian name was mentioned. The owner of the business, who is the sole responsible person con<lb/>nected with it, and who signed the lease is Mark Alexander, my father. I merely placed the order at his instance and on his behalf. I was merely acting as his agent. The goods were shop fittings, comprising office fittings which had been put into the shop and were not removed, and to the best of my belief, are still there. I have no knowledge of obtaining fittings by false pretences. As to the West London Joinery Company, they were doing similar work on the premises. I was instructed to arrange with them to add an office at an agreed price of £25 odd. My brother was with me at the time and I deny having mentioned the name of Alexander the Great. I have never been connected with them in any way, and ever represen<lb/>ted myself as such. I have had various shops of my own and traded under my own name as Alexander.

                  </hi> (prisoner on oath). I am a tailor by occupation and a son of Mr. Mark Alexander. Until a short time ago my father was carrying on business as a tailor at St. John's Street, Clerkenwell. In June, 1907, I went to the house agents at Chiswick and asked for orders to view, which I gave my father. My father asked me to call. He is getting old and is not so active as he might be; he is also rather deaf. I told the agents I came on behalf of Mark Alex<lb/>ander, 4, Guilford Place, and the order; to view was made out to that person. First of all they asked what was the nature of the business. I said tailoring. They said, "Anything to do with Alex<lb/>ander the Great?" I said, "No, not such a big firm." I gave my father the orders to view, and he went down and viewed. Subse<lb/>quently he asked me to go down for him to see Mr. Grange, the landlord, which I did. Mr. Grange said he would be pleased to accept Mr. Alexander as a tenant, provided he had the usual refer<lb/>ences, and they proved satisfactory. There was no mention of Alexander the Great at all. The agreement was signed by my father, Mark Alexander, and the cost was paid by him. Later on, I ordered a large pay-desk, which was required for the shop. As the shop</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210142"/>
               <p>fitters were already fitting up the shop, and there was a man on the premises, I suggested that it should be done by them as they were on the spot. I saw Mr. Bailey on the premises and explained to him what was required, and asked him to send an estimate to Mr. Mark Alexander, care of Scott Bros., great tailors, New Kent Road. I never said anything about Alexander the Great or Cheapside. My father was over there a lot and I thought it would be more convenient for him to go there, as, if it arrived during the day, he might miss it. When the estimate arrived about a week afterwards my father said, "Do you want a run," so I volunteered to go down to Chiswick to the works of the West London Joinery Company and see if the estimate could be reduced. He wanted the work done cheaper if possible. My brother went with me, and was with me during the whole of the interview. I cannot remember the date of this. I saw Messrs. Bailey and Fry, and told them that Mr. Alex<lb/>ander thought the desk was too expensive, and asked if they could reduce the price. They said they could not, and I told them to com<lb/>plete the order as per the estimate for £25 odd. I said, "Do you require references?" They said, "I suppose Old Grange had refer<lb/>ences." I said, "I believe he had references, and am given to under<lb/>stand they are satisfactory." They said, "If it is good enough for him, it it good enough for us." They then showed me over the works. There was no mention made of Alexander the Great Tailor. My brother told them he traded as a great tailor in New Kent Road. The pay desk would be of no value to us except for the work in the shop. We could have got plenty of other firms to do the work. I had no interest whatever in the business. Mr. Fry and Mr. Bailey met me at Linden Arcade one morning, and Mr. Fry asked about the account. I said as soon as my father comes back from the south coast I will do my best to get a cheque. He said, "You had better hurry up; if I do not have my money I will have your body." They both had a long conversation and Mr. Bailey said something about swindling, and both went off together. In regard to Mr. Miliffe's goods, I told him to send them to Mr. Mark Alexander, care of Scott Bros., great tailors, and gave him an envelope addressed there. (Same produced.) I told him they were for that gentleman. and never referred to Alexander the Great Tailor. He asked me if I knew a cutter employed at Alexander the Great, I said I did not know. I have myself had four shops and traded as a tailor. There were some arrangements being made for financing my father in this business by a Mr. Jacobs, but afterwards the thing dropped through. At the time these orders were placed, I thought the money would be forthcoming. When these arrangements fell through, my father wrote letters to all of them explaining that owing to the withdrawal of financial support he could not meet his obligations, and would they be good enough to accept the property back. (One of the letters produced and read.) The value of the goods Mr. Jeeve took from the premises was about £15. He returned four lengths, after he had a picking of it himself.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210143"/>
               <p>Cross-examined. I never mentioned the name of Alexander the Great to any one of these our witnesses. The letter produced is in my father's writing. I took £4 10s. deposit from Mr. Jeeve, and 10s. was deducted from one of his week's wages, making up the £5. I was not managing the business at the shop. I only went down now and then on my father's behalf. I only stopped about ten minutes. Mr. Jeeve was supposed to be manager. I should say my father was there a good deal. I told Mr. Jeeve he was to take orders from my father. I suppose I told him my father was the owner of the busi<lb/>ness; he knew it. He saw my father there a lot. My father did not clean windows nor run errands. He traded at 128, St. John's Street, Clerkenwell, at one shop for 30 years. He had gone out of business; not exactly retired. At the time this transaction commenced he was living at 4, Guilford Place; he had two rooms there but he prac<lb/>tically had the run of the house; a friend kept it. I do not know what rent he was paying, nor about his private affairs at all. I had left business in June, and at that time I was negotiating for a busi<lb/>ness abroad—in Shanghai. I had my own shops at Charterhouse Street, Charing Cross Road, Gray's Inn Road, and Finsbury Park. After that I was managing a shop up to June last. My brother's place is "Scott Bros., Great Tailors, 24, New Kent Road"; it is a very prominent tailor's shop; nothing to do with Alexander the Great. The story of the prosecution as to the misrepresentations is quite incorrect.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">LEVY</hi>. I am a brother of the prisoner. He had his name changed to Alexander by deed poll. I went with prisoner, on July 12 to see Messrs. Fry and Bailey. My brother said he called on behalf of Mr. Mark Alexander who, he said, was his father. There was a discussion about the estimate. Prisoner said it was rather too much. There was no suggestion that he had anything to do with Alexander the Great Tailor at Cheapside. My father pre<lb/>ferred to call himself Alexander as he thought Levy was too distinct a Jewish name. Prisoner asked Mr. Fry or Mr. Bailey whether they required a reference for Mr. Mark, and one of them said, if he was good enough for Mr. Grange it would be quite all right, or words to that effect. My brother introduced me as "The Great Tailor." I closed my business up a fortnight ago as it did not pay. The bill heading produced refers to my business. The estimate referred to was addressed to Mr. Mark Alexander, care of Scott Bros., great tailors. I started my business 2 1/2 years ago.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I know the estimate was sent to my father be<lb/>cause it came to my address and my father opened it in front of me. We talked the matter over together. I know Mr. Miliffe. He sub<lb/>mitted some sketches to me which I have not paid for, as I did not give him an order. They were not satisfactory.</p>

               <p>of shops than I had, and I am rather deaf. My son had not the slightest interest in the business. I asked him to go to the shop-fitter's on my behalf. I received the estimate and I left it to my son to see if he could get a reduction on my behalf. I signed the three years' agreement and provided the references, which were most satisfactory. There was no reference to Alexander the Great Tailor.</p>

I was expert<lb/>ing to get money from Mr. John Jacobs, 57, Gower Street, my brother-in-law, who is a retired tailor. As to what has been said about my cleaning windows and running errands, I may have put a duster on a window. I do not call that cleaning windows. I take full responsibility for anything my son has done on my behalf.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. When these goods were ordered of Mr. Miliffe I had no money, but I had a certain credit. When the fittings sup<lb/>plied by Mr. Fry were ordered I had money to pay for them at the time. I did not pay for them because that is not usual; it was not due.</p>

                  </persName>. I am a retired tailor. Mark is my brother-in-law. I know him as Mark Alexander. His right name I think is Mark Levy. I promised him financial support in this business up to £50 or £100, or even more, if I should think it would be of real benefit to him. I subsequently withdrew that support because when I went to look at the premises in Chiswick there were so many small tailors. When I saw the place it was nothing but a lot of empty benches and shops, and I decided not to lose my money in it. I said I would advance him, but after I saw the shop I refused to do so. I did not tell him to take the shop. I did not approve of the situation.</p>

                  </hi>, Museum Chambers, Bury Street. I have known the defendant since June of this year. He was introduced to me by a firm of solicitors whom I have known for many years. He called on me at my office and told me that he was in touch with a large number of music-hall artistes, and that those artistes were con<lb/>stantly requiring advances on their contracts; he stated that he was short of capital, and wanted somebody to find money to advance to them; he did not want to go to a professional money lender, because he found from experience that they took his clients away; he pro<lb/>posed that he should introduce the artistes, that I should find the money on the artistes contracts and promissory notes, and that he should guarantee the amount advanced and the interest. The con<lb/>tacts by which the artistes assigned their contracts to Gordon were to be re-assigned to me by Gordon. He proposed that three-quarters of the profits should be retained by me and one quarter by him. He made a proviso that the instalments should be collected by him, personally, and handed over to me every week. I agreed to those terms. I identify the cheque produced, dated June 27, as one which I gave to Gordon. He told me that a music-hall artiste name Nation desired to borrow £25; that Nation had various valuable contracts with the Moss Empire group, and that those contracts would be deposited with me with Nation's promissory note. A few days afterwards he told me that Nation had not been able to obtain those contracts with the Moss Empire people owing to pressure of work. He told me that a music-hall artiste named Vanetta required a loan of £25 and I handed him another cheque for that amount. He told me it would be necessary to go into the country to see Vanetta, and five or six days afterwards he told me Vanetta would not agree to the terms. He said that an artiste named Jack Wayo required a loan of £25,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210146"/>
               <p>and asked to be allowed to apply the money. I think as regards the terms, I said he was to settle rate of interest with Vanetta. He told me that Wayo worked with his wife, Eva Hope. He asked whether he might apply the "Vanetta" cheque to make the loan to Wayo, and I agreed. It was understood that Wayo's promissory note, his contracts, and his wife's contracts, together with an assignment of those contracts to Gordon, and a re-assignment by Gordon to myself, should be handed to me. The promissory note produced, dated June 29, was brought to me by Gordon on or about June 29 (Witness identified other documents which were handed in.) I received payments of money from defendant which purported to come from Wayo and Hope, on four occasions, amounting in all to £10 Defendant approached me again and said that Frank Bernard, a music-hall artiste, desired to borrow £20, and that he would give his promissory note for £27, repayable in two instalments of £13 10s. each, and that he would charge his contracts as security in the way arranged in the previous instance. I agreed. At that time I believed that Wayo and Hopes promissory note and memor<lb/>andum of agreement were genuine documents and that the money borrowed for Wayo and Hope had been advanced; I then handed the cheque now produced to Gordon, and he handed me the receipt produced, dated July 10, 1907, signed by him. He also handed me the promissory note dated July 11, 1907, and the agreement of July 11 between Frank Bernard and Gordon, Douglas and Co., and the assignment dated July 14 from Gordon to me. A payment was due on August 12. Shortly after that I saw defendant and spoke to him with reference to it. I asked him why it had not been paid. He said the money had not been received. A day or two after that I mentioned the matter to him again. He said he had received an instalment of £4 from Bernard, but he did not hand that sum to me. Subse<lb/>quent to defendant's arrest I saw Bernard and he paid me £3 10s. The cheque now produced was originally given in connection with a loan to a man called Hooker (or Booker?) on July 12. A few days after that defendant told me that Hooker had obtained the money elsewhere. He said that Erhorn, who was musical conductor at the Hippodrome, required a loan of £30 on a bill of sale. He told me that Erhorn lived in a six or eight-roomed house in Hampstead, and that his furniture was worth about £100, and incidentally remarked that the piano was a "Collard" and he himself would give £30 for it. I agreed that the £25 cheque for Hooker should be appropriated to Erhorn's loan, and gave him a cheque for £5 to make up the £30. At that time I believed his statements as to Mr. Erhorn's house at Hampstead and his furniture. I also believed that Bernard's pro<lb/>missory note had been filled up with the correct figures for the money that he owed me, and that the money had been advanced. I believed that all the documents I received from the prisoner were genuine. After I had parted with those cheques he gave me a receipt. "Re<lb/>ceived of R. C. Power the sum of £25 re Hooker," which I had origin-ally</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210147"/>
               <p>given him when I gave him the cheque to make the advance to Hooker. A few days afterwards, when I allowed the cheque to be used for Erhorn, the word "Hooker" was struck out and the word "Erhorn" inserted, and defendant initialled the alteration. He gave me the bill of sale with reference to Erhorn's case, I think, on July 31. I can swear it was in July, and I believe it was the 31st. The date on the endorsement on the bill of sale was certainly July, and to the best of my recollection the 31st. That bill of sale was ultimately handed back by me to Gordon. The document purported to be a bill of sale executed by Erhorn on his furniture at 50, Huntley Street, W.C., and I believe the signature was witnessed, but I am not sure. As I had been told that he lived in a house at Hampstead, noticing that the address of the furniture was 50, Huntley Street. I went up that street myself. It is a small street running parallel between Gower Street and Tottenham Court Road. After finding out that the address was Huntley Street I found that the bill of sale had not been registered. It was endorsed with the time of the day and the day, and signed by Gordon's clerk.</p>
               <p>To the Common Serjeant. I had got the bill of sale in my posses<lb/>sion at the time I made these inquiries. I then saw Gordon and spoke to him about this bill of sale. I cannot fix the day, but it was between August 1 and the 8th. I wrote to him, and also spoke to him on the telephone. I asked him how it was that he had told me that Erhorn lived in a six or eight-roomed house at Hemp<lb/>stead, whereas I had found that he lived in two rooms in a tenement house in a small street near Tottenham Court Road. I also asked him why it was that he had handed me a bill of sale unregistered, having stated that the bill of sale had been registered. (To Mr. Ker<lb/>shaw.) He stated that he had said that Erhorn lived near the Hemp<lb/>stead Road, and that he had instructed his clerk to register the bill of sale, but his clerk had been on the drink for several days, and, presumably had not carried out his instructions. On my pointing out that the time for registration had expired, he undertook to obtain another bill of sale from Erhorn. He afterwards (I believe on August 10) banded me a bill of sale dated August 10. That would be about four or five days after I had had the conversation with him. I received two payments from him in reference to the Erhorn loan, £2 5s. on July 31, and £2 5s. on August 7. I believe July 31 was the day on which I received the first bill of sale. Defendant also came to me with reference to a loan to a man called Edwards. He told me that Edwards required, a loan of £20 on his contracts and promissory note as in the previous cases; I agreed to lend the money, and gave him a cheque. When I gave him the cheque I believed that all the previous transactions that I have spoken to this afternoon were genuine, and that the moneys had been advanced. I went with Gordon to cash the cheque and handed him the notes out<lb/>side the bank. He gave me a receipt: "Received of R. C. Power the sum of £26 loans to Morgan and Edwards." Morgan was another artiste who had £6. Subsequently he came and told me that Edwards</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210148"/>
               <p>required £30, and would take no less than £30. I objected to carry<lb/>ing out the transaction, but defendant told me he had already ad<lb/>vanced £8 to Edwards, and I said, "Very well, then I will do the whole"; I gave him another cheque for £10 to make it up, and he handed me a receipt: "Received of R. C. Power the further sum of £10 re Edwards and Edwin," etc. May Edwin was Edward's wife. He afterwards banded me a promissory note for £45 and said that that was the amount that Edwards promised to repay. They pro<lb/>fessed to have received £45, according to these documents, and to repay the sum in weekly instalments of £5 from August 12, the first payment to be made on September 2. Nothing was payable under that before these proceedings were commenced, because I see that there is an examination of one witness on August 31; that would be two days before the first payment was due. I think the information was laid about August 25 or 26. At that time I believed the defen<lb/>dant to be in London; the last time I had been in communication with him was about a week or ten days before then. The witness identified two letters as being in defendant's handwriting.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was introduced to Mr. Gordon for the purpose of advancing money to music-hall artistes under the name of Gordon, Douglas and Co. I did not know that the prisoner had not got any money. When I first met him he said that he was short of present working capital, and if he did not find someone to lend the money the music-hall people would go somewhere else and get the money I then asked him if he was registered as a money lender, and I suggested that he should register himself. I did not say anything about "the benefit of the business." I know that money lenders have to be registered under the Moneylenders Act. I was not registered, and did not want to be. I did not approach Gordon, he approached me. At the first meeting I assumed that he was registered. The music-hall contracts and promissory notes were to be made payable to Gordon, Douglas and Co; they were to collect the money and hand it to me weekly. The agreement was that I was to have three quarters of the profits for advancing the money, and Gordon was to have one quarter. Had the business been carried on successfully I presume that there would have been an arrangement for auditing at fixed periods, but no such arrangement was made as to how or when the division of profit was to be made, whether on each trans<lb/>saction or all together. I cannot say whether an account would have been taken at the end of six months and losses set off against profits, because no arrangement was made. I should have expected Gordon to carry out his guarantee; how it was to be carried out would depend on circumstances. Whether Gordon would have to bear his share of the losses would depend upon the guarantee; he guaranteed principal and interest. I do not remember saying at the police court, "Yes, I did agree to share the losses and the profits with Mr. Gor<lb/>don." I remember being asked, "Did you, or did you not, look to Mr. Gordon to pay his share of the losses as well as the profits," and I said, "Yes." I say that Gordon undertook to guarantee the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210149"/>
               <p>capital and the interest of these loans. I made no agreement with Gordon to share the losses. He guaranteed the capital and interest; presumably, under that guarantee he would be responsible for the loan. I was not particularly anxious to do this business. The letter produced is in my writing. I do not think the date "June 25" is mine, it is written across. It may be about the right date. I cannot say whether that refers to the first loan I did. Nation's was the first loan I did. Mr. Gordon guaranteed all the loans; I took his guarantee for what it was worth. According to my ledger the last instalment I received from defendant purporting to come from Nation was on August 7. That did not clear up the whole. The particular receipts were: July 2, £3; July 9, £3; July 16, £3; July 25, £3; July 31, £3, and August 7, £3. I cannot remember whether the promissory note set out that the instalments were to be £3 a week, but apparently I received £3 a week from Gordon up to August 7. About that time my business relations with Gordon, Douglas and Co. ceased; I cannot find any trace of any other business transaction since then. I do not think there have been any meetings since I ceased doing business with Gordon at my solicitors office, but there was one meeting at my flat. Myself, the defendant, my solicitor and his clerk met at my flat about August 15 or 16. I told Gordon I had made con<lb/>tain discoveries and asked him what he was going to do. I had dis<lb/>covered that the money had not been advanced to Erhorn and Edwards. I do not think I knew of Bernard at that time. I did not discover that Wayo's promissory note had been forged for days after that. If this meeting took place on August 15 I could not pos<lb/>sibly have heard of Bernard. I should think it was about August 21 I first heard of Bernard. Mr. Gordon first of all said, on his oath, that he had lent the money to the music-hall artistes, then, on being pressed, he stated that he had lent only £10 to Edwards out of the £30, and £10 out of the £30 to Erhorn. He stated positively that he had lent the money to all the rest of the artistes in full. I remember Harry Pleon. He has told me by letters and telegrams that he has not received any money from Gordon. I lent Gordon £25 to lend to Harry Pleon. Harry Pleon denies that he received a halfpenny. I have not received a halfpenny for that money. I do not know that be lent Way £8; Way has told me, since these proceedings com<lb/>menced, that he obtained £6. I know that he lent About £15; I was present when it was done; I advanced £20 on July 4. I attended at my solicitor's office and Gordon brought up this man; the transaction took place in the presence of myself and my solicitors. I have never received a halfpenny from About, and he has absconded from the country. I will swear that Gordon handed him the £20 in my presence; I do not know whether he got it beck after-wards. On August 15 I met the prisoner in my flat together with my solicitor and his clerk; he told me about this money which he had not lent; I do not remember him making the statement that he owed me £250 under his guarantee; there was general discussion as to the position. I went into these accounts with Mr. Gordon and agreed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210150"/>
               <p>a sum of £250 as the amount outstanding, principal and interest I asked Gordon what he was going to do. I had discussed these loans with my solicitors; it was afterwards discussed at my fist on this occasion when defendant was there, and he stated that he had a charge on a reversion; he produced this charge, which was for £250, signed by a man called Sharp to Gordon. I did not take that charge to clear up the £250 which he owed me; I took it as security for the repayment of loan. I did not take it as a discharge, nor did I give a discharge. I took it for what it was worth. My solicitors have been to Somerset House; they have stated that Sharp is entitled to a reversion; but they do not know that it is a good security. I did not try to get another charge on an action which Mr. Gordon had pending in Copenhagen. I have heard him talk about Copenhagen and about sundry claims he may have had there; I have never asked for a charge on them. I did not know of another action he had in the name of Weaver. With regard to Erhorn, I will swear that Gordon did not tell me that he lived "somewhere near the Hampstead Road"; he said, "Somewhere in Hampstead." I did not mistake "Hampstead Road" for "Hampstead." I say the first bill of sale was a forged bill of sale. The bill of sale produced (Erhorn's) is not in the prisoner's writing. The attestation is but not the body of it I gave Gordon £20 on August 2 to lend to Edwards, and another £10 on August 12 to make up £30. I had one or two discussions with Gordon about it; he was so long a time getting the loan com<lb/>pleted that I wanted the first £20 back; Gordon said, "I have lent him £8," then I gave the cheque for £10 to complete it. Wayo's signature is the only one about which there is a doubt as to its being genuine. The first payment on Edwards's loan was not to be made until September 2. I had taken an assignment from Gordon before September 2; Edwards's matter was included in the assignment. When I laid the information I believed Gordon to be in London. I do not remember uttering any threat to Gordon; I do not think I spoke about the matter except to my solicitors. I know Mr. Morgan; I do not think I mentioned the matter of the information to him. In the course of conversation with one or two people I might have re<lb/>ferred to possible proceedings, but not in the nature of a threat, and not to very many people. I only went to the police court once be<lb/>fore they issued the warrant; I do not think two applications were made for it before it was granted. I do not know why Mr. Gordon went to Hull; I believed he went to try to get out of the country; he had letters in an assumed name at the Post Office. If a music-hall artiste went to Gordon and he had some money of mine in hand, and the business was not good enough, he would not hold that money to lend to somebody else without my consent previously obtained. Each transaction was a special transaction in itself. He had no authority to lend any money without asking my consent. He was not supposed to have money in hand. On each individual transac<lb/>tion he came and said the particular artiste wanted money, and the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210151"/>
               <p>money was to be applied to that specific transaction. The suggestion as to the method of carrying out the transactions came from Gordon; he himself proposed the guarantee. He gave me the guarantee in every instance. My solicitors first introducd Sharp's security to me; they advised it. I had an interview with a man named Anthony. He asked me to lend him £100 and I refused. Mr. Gordon rang me up on the telephone and told me this man was going to call on me. He said, "Do not have anything to do with him, he will not pay you"; but that had no influence with me. I had already refused to have anything to do with the transaction.</p>
               <p>Re examined. There is no foundation for the suggestion that the assignment was given in discharge of defendant's liability; it was ss further security for the money for which he was liable on his guarantee. Defendant had no discretion in making loans; they had to be submitted for my approval, and in each case the purpose for which the money was given was placed on record. (The witness identified several receipts as being in the defendant's hand-writing.) I required receipts in that form in each case. At the time I accepted that security Gordon had only paid £10 to Edwards and £10 to Erhorn, but he denied that the other money had not been properly applied. It was abouts week after August 15 that it was brought to my knowledge that the promissory note purporting to be signed by Wayo was alleged to be not a genuine document. I am attending here merely as a witness, the prosecution being taken over by the Crown. There is absolutely no foundation for the suggestion that I am a partner with defendant, in the business of Gordon, Douglas and Co. The document now before me is an indenture between Gordon, Douglas and Co. and myself, signed by the defendant as Gordon, Douglas and Co.; and with regard to any losses that might take place in those transactions the defendant was in no way liable except under the guarantee he gave me in each case to be responsible for them.</p>

                  </persName>. V Division. Acting on in<lb/>structions received, I kept watch on 7, Selincourt Road, the address of the prisoners. It is not a lodging house; they occupy an upstairs flat. At 10.55 on September 12 I saw prisoner Walters leave 7, Selin, court Road with a parcel. I followed her to the pawnbroker's. At two o'clock on the 13th I went with other officers to 7, Selincourt Road. I placed two officers in the yard and entered the first floor window by means of a ladder. I found the three prisoners occupying the flat, Baker and Walters in the front room and Chapman in another room. Baker got out of bed and asked what the meaning of it was. He was then told to wait. I said to the female prisoner, "I believe you pawned a coat this morning." She at first denied any knowledge of it. Then she hesitated and looked at Baker, and Baker said to her. "Go on; tell them where you got it from." Chapman, who had come in from the other room, then said, "I gave It to her to pawn. I bought it for 5s. with a vest. The vest I pawned." I then said to Baker, "Do you own everything in this flat?" He said, "Yes; everything is mine. I paid for it." I said, "Can you account for the possession of the table-cloth that you have on the table?" He said he had bought it off a man. I said it was part of the proceeds of a burglary in Aboyne Road and they must all consider themselves in custody. I searched the flat and found in a cupboard in the back room a jemmy and a cold chisel. In a drawer in the back kitchen I found 62 pawntickets. I found an overcoat on the door of Chapman's room. There are two large pockets stitched in on the inside and also a pocket lengthened for the purpose of holding the jemmy. Pri<lb/>soners being afterwards charged made no reply.</p>

I have since visited the premises and find that the jemmy pro<lb/>duced just fits the marks on the door, which also show the impression of marks which have been made by a file.

                  </persName> said he had made inquiries as to the pawntickets found at the flat, and they related to 26 burglaries. Amongst the property were some communion cloths and table coven stolen from the Presbyterian Church at Tooting, as far back as November, 1905. Chapman and Baker have been associates for years. Baker had some years ago a public-house in the Walworth neighbourhood. After that he had a greengrocers business, but that went down and' finally he became a bookmaker's tout. Then he went to live at Toot<lb/>ing with his married sister and there made the acquaintance of Mrs. Walters. Chapman was formerly a greengrocer in a small way of business, but has done no work for a long time. He has been con<lb/>victed of gambling and drinking, but no offence involving dishonesty, that being due said the witness to his good fortune. Both man were the associates of well-known thieves. Prisoners were watched for some seven or eight days in order to get two others who were known to be concerned with tnem, but the police found it was not safe to go on any longer and had to do what they did. If there had not been a force there would have been a fight, and they went in at that time of sight in order to avoid that. Chapman had been living with a prosti<lb/>tute, who had had to leave him because of his violence.</p>

                  </hi>, 7, Melbourne Mansions, Qusen's Club Gardens, setress On October 7, about 10 minutes to 12, I was going home to my flat, along by St. Andrew's Chnrch, when the two prisoners attacked me. I heard footsteps behind me the whole way. When I got to the church I heard one of the prisoners say, "Now is the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210156"/>
               <p>time."Then prisoner Rolfe got hold of me with both his hands and said, "Give me your purse." I said, "No." Then another man gave me a knock on the side, and, as I was failing, Rolfe bent my fingers back and wrenched the purse out of my hand. I screamed, pulled myself up, and went after them. When I got to the corner of Perham Road. Rolfe was in custody of policeman Allen. The prisoner Tumbull is the same build as the man who knocked me down, but the latter had a moustache. I had a bruise on the hip for some days afterwards. I fell on my left side, and the other man had me on the right side. (To prisoner Tumbull.) I did not say you struck me. I said it was someone like you. When the man struck me I did not see anyone pass at the time. As I was falling I looked round to see who struck me and I got a glimpse of a man of your build, and if you had a moustache I should have been able to swear to you at the police court. I had a good glimpse because there was a lamp in front of me. Rolfe could not have hit me because he had hold of me with both his hands. (To the Common Serjeant) I have never seen either prisoner before. In my purse there was one sovereign, sixpence, and, I think, 6 1/2 d. in coppers. I got my purse and the money back.</p>

                  </persName>, 16 T. On October 7, at 11.50. I was in Vereker Road, when I heard a woman screaming. I went in the direction and heard footsteps approaching from where the screams came. I could not see who it was, but I got back, in a dark place of the road. Prisoner Rolfe then came up on the other side, running as hard as he could. I ran across and seised him and asked him what he was running for. He made no reply. I took him back to where the screams were coming from, where I saw Miss O'Connor. She said. "That is the man," and he at once produced this purse from his pocket and said, "My mate's gone the other way. I did not b—g well see you over there or I would have went the same way as my mate." I took him to North Fulham Station, where he said before being charged, "My mate went the right way and I went the wrong way and got b——g well caught. I had no money or grub and meant having something, and I got it. We would soon have spent that quid" He said no more when charged At six p.m. on the 13th (Sunday) I saw Tumbull detained at North Fulham Station. I told him the charge and he was put up for identificstion. He said, "I was with Rolfe when the lady was assaulted, but when he took her purse I ran away." After being charged he made a state<lb/>ment, which he signed. He said the lady failed to identify him be<lb/>cause he had his moustache off the following day. That was on the way to the cells.</p>
               <p>To prisoner Turnbull. It was about seven on the Sunday evening when Miss O'Connor failed to identify you. On the next morning I asked you when you had got rid of your moustache.</p>

               <p>Rolfe confessed to a previous conviction on May 23, 1905. Several other conviction were proved. In regard to Turnbull, it was stated that up to October, 1906, ho had borne a good character. After that time he disappeared from home for five or six months and he had not been traced during that time. He then got employment as a porter with Messrs. Wooland's, being there about three months, when he was discharged for losing money belonging to the firm. He had since been charged with gambling in the streets.</p>

                  </hi>, North Finchley. On October 24, between five and six p.m., I was walking along Essex Road. I stood and looked up a court for a moment, when I received a terrific blow on the back of my neck, which I have suffered from a great deal since. The next thing was I found I was being pushed up this court by the back, and then founds hand pulling my watch out of my pocket. The man pulled me right round by my chain, then I saw his face for the first time. He pulled three times, and the third time the swivel gave way; then he ran away with the watch in his hand. I never loss sight of him for a moment. There was a policeman on the oppo<lb/>site side who caught him. I cried out, "Stop thief!" and ran after Him. My watch has not been recovered; its value is about £20. I have no doubt that prisoner is the man who took it, When he was arrested a man came along and pushed himself into the crowd to where prisoner lay on his back, and I saw him searching prisoner's chest all over. I thought he was helping the policeman, and had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210158"/>
               <p>no idea that he was helping himself. As soon as prisoner was ready to get on his feet, the same man jumped up against the policeman to try to get prisoner out of his hands, then he got into the crowd and I lost him.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. I had no one with me, whether of good character or had. There was no second man there at the time; you were the only man.</p>

I rushed to the top of the street and saw prisoner running across Essex Road followed by prosecutor. On seeing me he tried to turn and I caught him. Prosecutor complained that prisoner had stolen his watch. whereupon the latter struggled to get away very violently and fell on the road. I eventually secured him and took him to the station. Before being charged he said, "He made a mistake; where are his witnesses?" No reply when charged.</p>

He told the Magistrate that he saw me take the watch off the old gentleman and put it in my coat pocket Now he tells you that I put it up my coat; three different statements.

                  </hi>, Umfreville Road, Hornsey. I am a shop assistant employed in the Green Lanes. On October 4, about half-past nine in the evening, I was in Endymion Road. I had my bicycle with me, and saw a man standing at the corner. He asked me would I like to earn sixpence. I asked him what for. He said "Would you like to change this cheque for me at Bassett, the baker's round the corner?" He said it was for Dr. Constable. The cheque was for £2 7s. 6d., and was endorsed Samuel Constable. I took the cheque, and as I was going round the corner I looked at it and thought it suspicious, and I took it in to my master and afterwards fetched a constable. We went together to the bottom of the and, and Kirkby was standing there talking to another man. When we drew near to him he walked away towards Finsbury Park, in the opposite direc<lb/>tion. I pointed him out to the constable as the man who had given me the cheque. Kirkby said he knew nothing about it. We went to Dr. Constable's house, and afterwards to the police station, where prisoner was charged.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. I lost sight of you when I went into my master's shop.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I have no doubt prisoners is the man who gave me the cheque.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. Endymion Road is not a particularly dark road. There are shops, and the light from them is sufficient.</p>
               <p>To the Recorder. This was a Friday night, and the shops were still open at half-past nine. There are no shops in the Endymion Road, but there are in the Green Lanes. There are no lamps at the bottom of the Endymion Road, but the corner shop in the Green Lanes runs up the Endymion Road a few yards, ana that was well lit up and enabled me to see the man who gave me the cheque, and that man I say was the prisoner.</p>

                  </persName>, 561 Y. About 9.45 p.m., on Oc<lb/>tober 4, I was called to Dr. Constable's house in Endymion Road, where I saw the witness Coglan and Dr. Constable, in consequence of which I went to the corner of Endymion Road, where I saw the prisoner and another man, the latter running away; the prisoner walked away. I went after him. Coglan said, "That is the man who gave me the cheque." Prisoner said, "What are you talking about?" I said to Coglan, "Are you certain?" Coglan said, "Yes," so I said to prisoner, "You will have to come with me to the station." He said, "I know nothing about the cheque." When</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210160"/>
               <p>searched at the station a book was found on the prisoner which had "Con Sam., 47, Endymion Road," written in it. There are other addresses in the book in pencil. Some newspaper cuttings were also found on him.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. You did not walk in the direction towards me, you walked towards Wood Green. The other man ran towards Finsbury Park. I did not speak to you until you had left the other man You were standing against the post, nearly opposite Endymion Road, when I first saw you. I walked alter you; it might have been a dozen paces. I did not call after you. You might have been per<lb/>fectly oblivious to my being behind you. It is not dark at Dr. Con<lb/>stable's; you could recognise anybody easily. It is rather dark about 10 yards away from the doctor's house. I first saw the witness Coglan at Dr. Constable's, Coglan first pointed you out to me at the bottom of Endymion Road. The boy must have lost sight of the man who gave him the cheque unless he kept him under observation The other man running away did not at the time strike me as a sus<lb/>picious proceeding.</p>
               <p>To the Recorder. I did not see the face of the other man.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. When you got to the station it might have been 20 minutes before you were searched. In the charge-room there is a desk, and three or four constables were standing talking. You were sitting on a chair. I did not see you write that name and address on the book at the station. I did not say at the police court, in answer to you, that you could not possibly have got your hands down; I said you could not have got your hands in your pocket with<lb/>out my seeing you. You did not write down the name and address while waiting in the charge-room. I had my eye upon you the whole time. You were feigning to be aaleep.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical practitioner residing at 47, Endymion Road. Before this happened I knew nothing of the prisoner. I saw him in custody for the first time on October 4. The cheque (produced) was brought to me by the boy Coglan. It is not drawn or signed by me. I had no account at the Lambeth brines of the London and County Bank. I know nothing about the cheque.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I live at Westerfield Road. Tottenham. On the evening in question, in I was in the Green Lanes, walking home, about 20 yards from Endymion Road, I met a man who asked me to direct him to Fintbury Park Station. I told him the way and left him. I did not see whether he walked</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210161"/>
               <p>or ran—he went in the opposite direction. After I had walked about 30 yards the constable came up to me with the boy. The constable asked him if I was the man, and the boy said, "Yes." The constable said to me, "Do you mind coming with me as far as the doctor's?" I said I had not the slightest objection; I knew nothing whatever of the matter. The boy, in the presence of the constable, stated that I asked him if he would like to earn sixpence, to which as had replied, "Yes," and that I had then handed him the cheque to cash. The constable had the cheque in his hand. I want with him to the doctor's house. I do not know what had previously psssed between the doctor and the constable. There is a braes plate at the doctor's house; that is where I got his name from which I wrote down in the police station on the cover of that book in pencil.</p>
               <p>To the Recorder. There are other names and addresses written in pencil in my handwriting in that book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I allege that the boy's identity of me is wrong, and that I am not the man. I wrote down the doctor's name in the book, as far as I can remember, in the police station, from what I could see on his brass plate, because Dr. Constable had not put in an appearance there, and I was wondering why. I am not well acquainted with the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>To the Recorder. As far as I remember the brass piste is on the wall of the house.</p>

                  </persName>, recalled. The brass plate is well in the dark on the door. The name is almost obliterated; it would be hard for anyone to read the name now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination of prisoner continued. The man that went away from me asked me the way to Finsbury Park Station. He want one way and I went the other. I did not look to see whether he walked or ran. The way I was going was my way home. The boy Coglan is entirely mistaken in saying that I was the man. I never had the cheque in my possession. The object I had in writing down the doctor's name at the station warn because I heard Dr. Constable say, I think, that he would not put in an appearance; but I believed afterwards that he said he would not put in an appearance that night.</p>

He took the left-hand portion of the second floor front room for a period of 12 months, she tenancy-to. date from August 1 at a rent of £3 10s. a month, payable monthly. On August 1 he paid two weeks' rent than due, £1' 15s., for which a receipt was given. The room let was occu<lb/>pied by prisoner end another man (whom he said was his partner), named Gloede. There was a brass plate on the front door with "Thomas Raynes and Co." on it, that name being also painted up an the door. While the prisoner was there I saw a lot of beddiag come and one or two cases. I went for my holidays at the end of August and returned about the second week in September. When I retorted the prisoner had gone away without giving any notice, a months rent being owing.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. All the arrangements for your becomings tenant were made with Messrs. Taylor and Co. and Lee, Son, and Gardner and not with myself personally. I came back about September 14 or 15. The prisoner stated that he was arrested on September 11. Re-examined. I saw the prisoner sign the agreement.</p>

                  </persName>, clerk to Mr. Charles Fox, Harrow Road, bedding manufacturer. In July last my employer had a stall at the furniture exhibition at the Agricultural Hall, Islington, of which I was in charge. About July 12 prisoner alone came to our stall. He said the cushions we had on show caught his eye. I asked him if we could do anything for him. He said, "Yes, we could send in samples of cushions in three qualities. "There were six sets—18 cushions in all I took the order. He said he would be shipping in a few days and he would include them in the ship. No mention was made as to where cushions were to be shipped, but they were to be delivered at Hatton Garden. He gave me a card having upon it, "Thomas Rayess and Co., merchants, 40, Hatton Garden. "He explained that he was a shipper to all parts of the world, mentioning South Africa, the United States, and Melbourne. He said if he did business with us it would be a large business, and it remained entirely "between our<lb/>selves and his agents abroad whether we did business at all or not; if our samples were right then he could do a his business with us. He said it would be at least 300 or 400 sets. I believed what he said, viz., that he was carrying on business as a shipper. I reported it to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210165"/>
               <p>our principal, Mr. Pattinson, and our firm executed the order. The receipt for the goods supplied, signed "T. Raynes and Co.," corre<lb/>sponds with the goods ordered and supplied, the price of them being £1 15s. A few days afterwards he called again at the stall and brought another gentleman with him, whom he introduced as his Australian man." I cannot remember his name even if he gave it. On that occasion I showed them both some more of our goods and asked if we could send any in. Prisoner gave an order for some feather bolsters end pillows, Which came to £2 Os. 6d. I asked him if he had received the other goods and he said, "Yes, and we are shipping them." I think he said he shipped them that morning, and, with regard to the other goods, he said he would be sending out and we must send them up the next day and he would include them. I said I would report to our firm, and, to the best belief, the goods were sent the next day. The receipt for them is dated July 18.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. You did not introduce the man who came as your Australian agent, but as your "Australian mad." No terms were arranged with me, but we were to give you our rock-bottom prices. I did not ask for any port-mark.</p>
               <p>To the Recorder. No mention was made of terms at all to me; that had to do with the counting-house. All I had to do was to sell the goods and send the order into the firm, and they exercised their discretion as to whether they should execute the order or or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner with Mr. Charles Fox, of Har<lb/>row Road. When our clerk, Woodman, came back from our stall at the Agricultural Hall I had an interview with him. He showed me one of the prisoner's cards. I authorised the sale and despatched of the first lot of goods, believing that he was carrying on a genuine business as a commercial shipper. I also authorised the sale of the second lot of goods, and also in respect of other orders that came by tele<lb/>phone.</p>
               <p>To the Recorder. There were no terms arranged on which these goods were sold, only the usual shipping terms; but when there large parcel was ordered they delivered on the Friday evening and Saturday morning end we were to have payment on Tuesday morning. The usual shipping terms are ten days. On August 14 I received a letter (Exhibit 7) brought by special messenger from the prisoner. I thought that represented a genuine business. The goods supplied, amounting to £44 17s. 1d., were quoted separately. There would be discount for cash in ten days.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. I understood that the first order was a sample order that was going to be sent out. They were sold on shipping terms. The last lot of goods was delivered on August 16, about 32 days after<lb/>wards. Being a sample order, we are not so strict as we usually are in pressing for payment. The £44 worth of goods were delivered on the assumption from the telephone message that they were to be paid for the following Tuesday. The heading on the stationery used by</p>

               <p>Re examined. The first two orders for £1 15s. and £2 0s. 6d. were sample orders.</p>

                  </hi>, clerk in the employ of Charles Fox, of Har<lb/>row Road, bedding manufacturer. I have had the conduct of the de<lb/>tails connected with the orders given to my firm by Thomas Raynes and Co. I saw to the dispatch of the goods. The £44 worth were sent on August 16. On the 19th I sent in a statement of account. On the 27th I received a telephone message from the. prisoner asking for a repeat order goods supplied on August 16. I know it was he because next morning when I called on him he said. "Was it you I was talking to on the telephone last night" When he telephoned I told him that we had not had a cheque for the first consignment, and he said that the money had been kicking about his office ever since the goods had been shipped waiting for us. When I called on the 28th prisoner said that the order was very urgent, and unlets the goods were down there in the morning he would have to cancel it I told him he could have the goods immediately I had the cheque for the first account. I asked if it would be convenient for him to give me a cheque and he said, no, he always paid by hard cash, and if I went down on Saturday he would pay me for both accounts. I told him we could not execute the new order unless we were paid for the old. He said he could make it convenient to pay, but it was not worth his while to go down to the bank, and that if we could not send the goods off he would have to cancel the order. He then asked his clerk to hand him a foreign telegraph form, on which he wrote, "Raynes and Co.," or "Raynes, Melbourne." He then wrote some<lb/>thing on the cable form and informed me that our second order was cancelled. He told me the evening before that the first consignment of goods, amounting to £44, had been shipped, but he did not say where to. The second lot of goods were not sent. I called it his office on the Saturday, the 31st, and he told me he had just paid a large carriage account, he was quite out of money just then, and if I would call back at one o'clock he would pay me. I called back at one o'clock and the office was closed. I did not call at the office again after that. On September 6, from information I had received I went to Taylor's Repository, St. George's Road. Southwark, where I saw part of the bedding that was supplied on August 16, the other" part having been sold by auction on the previous day.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. No terms were arranged with you before these goods were supplied. On August 16 everything you owed for had been delivered. Previously to that date I had never spoken to you, or seen you, or communicated with you. The goods ordered by you on August 27 were ordered by telephone.</p>

On August 17 the prisoner deposited a number of mattresses at our warehouse, and he came two days afterwards about fetching them away, saying that he wanted them to go to Taylor's Repository, near the Elephant and Castle. In compliance with his request we sent two van loads of mattresses from our yard, and one van was sent to his office. He saw the men start to load and then went away and one back again. On August 20 an invoice was given to prisoner for 18s. 9d. for cartage and storing, of which he only paid 10s.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. I should think that a man who could not give me in amount of 18s. 9d. was not worth much.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer, employed by Charles Taylor ad Sons. The prisoner called, I believe, on August 19, and handed me his card. He said that he had got this bedding for shipment to Australia; owing to some alteration in the tariff rates he was unable to send it over there; he had no place to store the goods; he had to sell them and stand the loss. He wanted an advance, and we ad<lb/>vanced him altogether £20. The goods fetched £27 4s. He bought certain goods at the sale, and we ultimately paid him £1 9s. 7d. in cash.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. You mentioned the question of tariff, but I could not speak as to the exact words. I understood you to mean that these goods were thrown on your hands in consequence of the altera<lb/>tion of the tariff. You said they could not be sent out without suffe<lb/>
                  <lb/>ing a very severe loss.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer in the department of the Commonwealth of Australia, the office of which is in Victoria Street, Westminster. The new Commonwealth Tariff was laid on the table of the House in Melbourne on August 9, 1907, announcements with regard to which appeared in most of the London papers on August 12 through Reuter's. In the new tariff there is no mention of bedding.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. The duty on yarns is now 5 percent, and on piece foods or articles containing wool the duty is 30 percent. The tariff embraces from 800 to 1,000 articles. The full details would reach this country about September 20 by mail. The tariff has affected many people in this and other countries and some people may very likely have goods thrown on their hands in consequence.</p>
               <p>To the Recorder. I do not think wool mattresses are exported to Australia in any quantities.</p>

He was accompanied by a friend, whom prisoner told me was a buyer from Australia. Prisoner also gave me a small card with "Thos. Raynes and Co." on it, and said that he traded at 40. Hatton Garden. They selected a dozen fire screens and four curb fenders of me value of £14 12s. for which they were going to ray on August 10. On July 19 the goods were sent for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210170"/>
               <p>and handed to a messenger. On July 24 I received communication from the prisoner, saying that he would call, and on that day he called at my office at Birmingham accompanied by the same person as before. He said that he had had a cable from Australia and hey Wanted to buy some firescreens. He said they must have them at once. They selected over £120 worth of goods, which it was arrange, I should be forwarded to the prisoner's address at Hatton Garden, but they were not in fact forwarded that day. On the 26th I got a tele<lb/>phone message from the prisoner. He said my not sending the screens had caused groat inconvenience, would I send some at once I replied that I wanted a cheque for £50 He said he would send me on a cheque that night for £50 if I would send part of the goods as he wanted them very urgently. Following on that conversation £18 worth of goods was despatched to the Midland good station, to be forwarded to London to await further instructions from me. I was going to wire the address if the cheque came all right As the cheque did not come the goods were detained at the Midland Station in London awaiting instructions to deliver. I never received pay<lb/>ment for the goods that were delivered.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. Looking at Exhibit 28 I understood the firm named thereon to be your father's. I was not trusting anyone 00 that card. There were no goods supplied in consequence of your visit to Bir<lb/>mingham. You said you were buying agent for five of the biggest houses in Australia. I trusted you for the first lot of goods, which were invoiced to you.</p>
               <p>To the Recorder. He would be a del credere agent. He said he was buyer for some of the largest houses in Australia, and if there was a decent order I was to send the invoices forward and he would give information to a bank and get a cheque sent me. I should not have sent the goods out there until I had the cash.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. In the case of the goods delivered I entrusted them to you and invoiced them to you. As you did not send the cheque I handed the matter over to my lawyer, and a writ was issued. Jadg<lb/>ment may have been obtained against you. I have a receipt in the railway book at home to show that the goods were signed for A card like Exhibit 13 was what I trusted you on. As to Exhibit 28, you told me you travelled for your father. When vou gave it me you said. "I remember vou nine years ago in Glasgow, when I travalled for Thomas Raynes, of Sheffield, who is my father, but his trade has not been looking up very much, and I have to look out for myself; I am trading now as Thomas Raynes and Co., and have nothing to do with my father's.</p>
               <p>To the Recorder. At the first interview he gave me both hm own card and his father's.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. As to your £14 worth of goods delivered you told me you were buying samples for Australia and your friend was the buyer for the house.

On July 19, in consequence of instructions received, I called at 40, Hal<lb/>ton Garden, on Thomas Haynes and Co. I saw the prisoner, who introduced me to a man whom he described as his Melbourne agent. As the result of conversation I agreed to send a type-writing machine to the prisoner on trial or "appro." The typewriter was sent and signed for by "Thomas Raynes and Co. The net price was £21 17s. On the same day as this typewriter was delivered the prisoner asked me to let him have a machine to send to Melbourne. I told him we could not supply him with a machine for Melbourne as we already had an agent there. That ended the matter. The typewriter delivered to the prisoner on July 19 was returned on the 26th. On the 25th pri<lb/>soner had another conversation with me in which he approved of our machines, and said he wanted another one, the latest model. On the 26th a new machine was sent to him, the receipt for it in the delivery book being signed "T. Raynes." An account for this machine, £21 17s., was delivered but never paid. I identified the typewriter produced by Mr. Abrahams at the Clerkenwell Police Court as the one delivered to prisoner.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. The typewriter supplied to you on trial was duly re<lb/>tained. I did not understand that the gentleman I saw in your office was your partner; I did not know anything about him; he was simply introduced as your Melbourne agent.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at "Seacombe," Marine Parade, Clac<lb/>ton-on-Sea. I am an inspector in the employ of the Oliver Type<lb/>writer Company. In consequence of a telephone message from the prisoner I authorised the delivery of a new typewriter to the pri<lb/>soner. I identify the typewriter produced by Mr. Abrahams at our typewriter. Its value is about £23.</p>
               <p>To the Prisoner. Before seeing you in the police court I had never seen or spoken to you before. I have not applied for your ac<lb/>count. That is our collector's business, not mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to H. Abrahams and Co., of 23, Cloth Fair, shipping merchants. I saw the prisoner about July 10 last. He did not come alone. A man named "Gloede" came first and said he was a partner and had a lot of job goods and wanted to sell them. He said he traded as "Raynes and Co.,"Hatton Garden. We ourselves are exporters and buy job lots for export to Australia and South Africa. Gloede asked me to go to Hatton Garden I went with my brother to the office of Raynes and Co. either the next day or the afternoon of the same day, I think, about July 11. I there saw Gloede and the prisoner. He showed me some clocks, barometers, and watch chains. There might have been one or two other lines which I did not take much interest in. I did not buy anything. I told him they would not suit our requirements. I re<lb/>ceived a letter dated July 19 (Exhibit 32). Following that letter</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210172"/>
               <p>the prisoner came on July 20 to our premises. Gloede was with him. They said they came from Hatton Garden. They told me they were going about the provinces buying job lots and they knew'where thousands of pounds' worth were lying and they would be able to sell them cheap, and he brought in some fire screens and curbs that day I understood from Gloede that he came from South Africa and Raynes said that Gloede had plenty of money and that was the reason they were going round buying job lots in the provinces. He showed me some fire brasses, screens, and curbs. They were then in the front warehouse. When I came out of the front office I saw them there. I could not say who brought them there. I bought 12 fire screens and three fenders, for which I gave him a cheque for £6 4s. He showed me four fenders in all. He never mentioned what had been paid for these fire screens and fenders. On August 1 I saw him again He brought an Oliver typewriter and wanted me to buy it. That was the typewriter produced at Clerkenwell Police Court and identified by the witness Mellish. I did not buy it. He took it away. He wanted either £16 or £18. He came back again and said that he had got some pressing engagements that he wanted to meet and would I advance him £6 until the end of the month. I did so. He did not redeem it within the month. I saw him again on September 3 and said, "What about taking the typewriter away?" He said, "Well, I have been so busy; I will take it away the next day." It was never taken away.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. I come from Australia, and I buy in London for Australian and South African interests. I have known you for a considerable time, about three or four years, as an agent, manufar<lb/>turer, and merchant, dealing with buyers who are in the South Afri<lb/>can and Australian trade. During that period we have done con<lb/>siderable business together thousands of pounds' worth.</p>
               <p>To the Recorder. That was when he was representing various manufacturers in Sheffield, as well as representing his father.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. I have given you orders for a very considerable amount of goods, which might run into thousands of pounds. The goods I ordered of you were shipped to my clients in Australia and South Africa.</p>
               <p>To the Recorder. I paid for them; they were ordinary business transactions.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. It may be the case that you are well known amongst South African and Australian buvers. All the goods purchased by me from the firm of Thomas Raynes and Co, 40, Hatton Garden, have been sent by me to Australia. Your invoices for goods were accepted by the people in Australia. As a merchant and as a man dealing largelv in the Australian trade, I know something of this new tariff Several lines of goods have been affected by it—about 800. There are merchants in London who are having to dispose of good even under cost price, but they would be cancellations of orders that they may have received on account of the tariff having affected that par<lb/>ticular line.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210173"/>
               <p>Re-examined. I had no knowledge that these goods were not paid for. With regard to the previous transactions in 1904, up till 1907, the goods did not come from the prisoner at all—they came direct from the people whom he represented. I did not have goods from him personally until this occasion.</p>
               <p>To the Recorder. He was travelling for certain firms, and I gave orders for the goods supplied and paid for them. They were shipped to Australia. If I had known that these goods had been obtained at a much larger price and not paid for I should not have had anything to do with them.</p>

                  </hi>, salesman, employed by J.H. Dawson, manufac<lb/>tirer, 85. Fore Street. I remember prisoner coming to the office on July 29 with another man who, he said, was his partner and who I should say is a German. Prisoner said he was Thomas Raynes and Co., South African and Australian merchants, 40, Hatton Garden, and gave me his card. He said he wanted to buy some shears for the Australian market and gave an order to the value of £3 13s. He gave directions that they were to be packed marked "T.R. and Co., Melbourne." The pencil marks on the card are the memorandum of his order. The order was executed that day, and despatched to 40, Hatton Garden, with an invoice of which a copy is produced. He arranged to pay on the following Saturday, August 3, by cheque. On August 1 he gave a further order for shears, £3 6s. 3d., and for combs £5 8s. On August 3 a messenger called with this letter: "Dear Sir, Kindly hand bearer the parcel of combs purchased this morning, together with invoice, and also duplicate and triplicate invoices for shears already delivered." I did not see the messenger again until I saw him at the police court. His name is Knight. The shears were sent that day to Hatton Garden with a further statement of account, amounting to £12 7s. 3d. Application has been made for payment, but no money has been received, I believed that "T. Raynes and Co." were earning on a genuine business as South African and Australian merchants.</p>
               <p>Asked by prisoner whether the lines he bought were not job lines and accumulations of stock, witness said that only the second parcel of shears was a clearing line.</p>

                  </hi>, 34, St. John's Lane, Smithiield. I am a porter by occupation and was employed casually by prisoner when he was at Ration Garden. Besides Raynes there was a short, stout gentleman, a German. I remember being sent by him to the Agricultural Hall with a card in an envelope for a Mr. Pratt, who gave me some parcels, which I took to 40, Hatton Garden. Afterwards I took the parcels to Joseph Abrahams, in Cloth Fair. Prisoner gave me 2s. for the job. I remember also going to Dawson's, Limited, 85, Fore Street, where I took delivery of some combs which I brought to Hatton Garden. After lunch I went with prisoner and his partner to several places in the City with a parcel of combs, which they took inside</p>

                  </hi>, traveller for the Williams Typewriter Company, 57, Holborn Viaduct. On August 28. upon the instrue<lb/>tions of Mr. Stapleford, I went to Thomas Raynes and Co., 40, Hat<lb/>ton Garden, where I saw prisoner. He asked if he could have one of our No 6 machines out for inspection. I returned to the office and afterwards took to him such a machine as he wanted, No. 41,906. The price of the machine was £22 10s. The practice is to leave a machine 10 days for inspection. I next saw the machine at the police court I called at Hatton Garden on September 2 and again on September 4, but found no one in the office. The machine has never been paid for.</p>

In consequence I instructed the last witness to call at 40, Hatton Garden, and I subsequently autho<lb/>rised the despatch of a typewriter on trial. On September 4 Jury called upon me again and made a communication and I gave him the invoice produced for £22 10s. The machine was sold for cash and I was informed that a cheque would be brought to me in a few minutes. I did not see this machine again until after proceedings were commenced I am familiar with the Australian trade. There is no trade from this country to Australia in woollen bedding.</p>

                  </hi>, 45, Benn Street, Clapham. In August last I was employed by prisoner ns shorthand clerk and typist. I think I was engaged on Augusi 23 at a salary of £I per week. I started on a Friday and prisoner paid me 6s. 8d. for the two days of that week and £1 for the following week, so that I received £1 6s. 8d. altogether I consider I was still in his service up to September 3, when he was arrested. I understood that the office had been shut up because no rent had been paid. When I went there prisoner told me he wanted somebody to keep the office really, as he was out and about in the middle of the day. Occasionally he dictated one or two letters to me, which I took'in shorthand and reproduced. They were business letters, but I could not say to whom, as there were so many of them. They seemed to be principally asking for samples and catalogues I believed it was a shipping business, but I never knew any goods shipped during the time I was there. I did not see any correspond-eance</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210175"/>
               <p>from South Africa or South Australia or America. There were no cables coming in. There was no cash book, day book, or ledger. I saw neither cheques nor bank pass book. I did not direct the at<lb/>tention of the defendant to the fact that, apparently, no business was carried on except that of obtaining goods from other people. I saw a German there, Fritz Gloede, whom I understood to be prisoner's partner. I think it was on Saturday, August 31, that prisoner had the typewriter sent home to his private address, Eden House, Clap<lb/>bam. He afterwards asked me to bring it back to the City. He did not tell me he was going to sell it without reserve. I did not know he had not paid for it. I remember calling at the office of the Wil<lb/>liams Typewriter Company on September 4 by prisoner's direction. I did not think it a strange proceeding that the machine should be taken to prisoner's private house and afterwards brought back to the City. I did not take any particular notice. When I told the Wil<lb/>hams Typewriter people that a cheque would be sent along I did not know prisoner had no banking account. I imagined that he had.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner: I went once to Poplar Docks to fetch a large cask marked "T.R. and Co." It was taken to Messrs. Abrahams, in Cloth Fair, and from there it went to Dowgate Docks and left with the wharfinger. I believe it contained steel rabbit traps. While I was at Hatton Garden I saw neither pass-book nor cheque-book.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. The traps were, I believe, obtained from Side<lb/>bottom's.</p>

                  </persName>, E Division. On September 11, at nine o'clock in the evening, I went to Eden House, Benn Street, Clapham, accompanied by another detective officer, and there saw prisoner. I asked him if he was Thomas Raynes. I said, "You have been trading as Thomas Raynes, and I hold a warrant for your arrest for conspiring with another man to obtain a quantity of mat<lb/>tresses from Messrs. Fox." He replied, "Is that the only case?" I said, "That is one of them." He said, "That is all right. You will not get my partner because he has gone abroad." I thoroughly ex<lb/>plained the warrant over again, and he said, "I shall whack Fox easy." In reply to the charge at the Gray's Inn Road Station, he said, "All right." Some of the letters and documents exhibited I found at Eden Place and others at Hatton Garden. I found a num<lb/>ber of English and foreign telegraph forms and two lists of boats sailing to Australia; also a number of unpaid invoices amounting to £265 18s. 4d., and three receipts amounting in all to £4 13s. 3d. I found a letter-book, but no books relating to the receipt and disposal of goods. I found no correspondence with Australian, South African, or American firms. I found no cheques or pass-book. There was a quantity of stationery headed Thomas Raynes and Co. The sta<lb/>tionery was the principal thing on the premises. There was also a list of manufacturers to be written to, a lot of it in Jury's handwriting.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. No goods were found in the office, but there were some cases of goods found in the basement.</p>

               <p>Prisoner, when called upon for his defence, complained that while charged with conspiracy with Gloede he was also charged individually in the same count, and that he thought seemed hardly fair.</p>
               <p>The Recorder informed prisoner that what had been done in re<lb/>spect of the indictments was in accordance with established practice but if at the commencement of the trial prisoner had said he would he embarrassed by having to deal with conspiracy at the same time he might possibly have put the prosecution to their election as to which charge they would have proceeded with.</p>
               <p>Prisoner subsequently addressing the jury, contended that there had been no false representation.</p>

               <p>Sergeant Moss, Birmingham Police, proved the conviction. That case, he said, was similar to the present, obtaining credit by false pretences, and the sentence was 18 months' hard labour. Prisoner was supposed to have a business in Birmigham, and obtained £40 worth of goods from a manufacturing jeweller. He was eventually arrested at Grimsby, where he had opened a cheap auction room.</p>

               <p>Mr. Pierson and Mr. Symmons defended Hemming. Mr. Wildey Wright defended Tracey.</p>
               <p>After Mr. Bodkin had opened the case, the Common Serjeant said that it was not desirable to try separate conspiracies concerning one or two men only, and he would probably have to make the prosecution elect.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wildey Wright said that his lordship had anticipated his objection.</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant. Of course, I cannot at present make the prosecution elect, but if it turns out that they are charging separate offences against A and B and B: and C and so on, that will not support any count charging all, nor will it be right to put to the jury all those different unconnected offences at the same time. I cannot tell what the evidence will be, but merely from the case as opened it indicates that there may be that difficulty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bodkin. If in a case that is presented there is evidence that three, say, of five peraons are acting fraudulently in relation to tradesman A, and in relation to tradesman A two other peraons are acting independently of the first three, is not that evidence which would show that the five persons were acting in aocord?</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant. I cannot say it would. I do not know. In some cases it would and some it would not. But if the three people with fraudulent intent try to defraud various people, and two other people defraud the same persons, alone, that would be no proof that they all five were acting together. I do not wish to send' to the jury separate charges against separate defendants, because they are all put together. We have got into difficulties in one case, I know.</p>
               <p>(The evidence was then proceeded with.)</p>

                  </hi>. 24, Margarita Villas, Oakley Street, Chelsea. I and my sisters are the owners of 10, Anderson Street. Chelsea. In June last year the house was to let and I received a call from Mr. Padbury (Marment). He asked to look over the house for a friend of his. I told him the rent was £60 a year and taxes. He said a friend of his, whom he had known for 16 years, would be a good tenant. I gave him the key and leave to look over the house. He called several times and Mr. Lee (Warren) came on one occa<lb/>sion. Marment said that Lee was a traveller and would be a good paying tenant. He said he would get the references and draw the agreement up. Marment brought the references, of which I read one, and he took them away again and said he would give me copies, but I never had them. He said they were his property. I do not remember the name on the references, but should remember if I heard them. The paper produced is what I wrote on: "10. Clarendon Gardens and 112, Lindcroft Road, Dulwich; Mr. W. H. Padbury." Marment produced letters which appeared to come from these ad<lb/>dresses. We arranged to pay half the fees for the agreement: he said they would be 10s. 6d. each. The account produced I received from him, amounting to £3 18s., deducted from the £5. the month's rent, which left £1 2s., and I received that from Padbury in cash I signed a copy of the agreement produced for Padbury to keep. Lee then took possession of the house; I believe on the day after the agreement was signed—about June 5. I wrote to Marment say<lb/>ing that he had only put a 5s. stamp on the agreement, but had charged me 7s. 6d. He replied saying it did not matter; he would call and pay the half-crown: "The landlord's part only cost 5s.; I was thinking of the tenants when I charged you 5s. "I never re<lb/>ceived the 2s. 6d. from him. The July rent was paid (£5) by Lee in cash; after I had called and asked for it; some time after it was due. On September 13 I received the letter produced from Lee saying he would call and pay the rent on Tuesday or Wednesday next. On the letter is the name of "H. and F. West, manufacturers' agents, dealers in fancy goods." I think that letter referred to the September rent; it would be due on the 6th. The first month's rent was paid a month in advance. The next month was also to have been in advance, but I think you will find the agreement has been altered. Lee called and paid the September rent in the course of the week. He said, "I daresay you will think it strange, there is a brass plate on the railings, but I have bought a business." I saw the name "West" on the plate. I think the October rent was paid; I brokered for the November rent. On November 17 I received a letter asking if the rent had been paid up to that month, if not they would see it Was done—"a reply by bearer in writing will oblige us. We want this to send to Mrs. Lee, as, of course, you have heard what has hap<lb/>pened. We are very sorry, but will do our best to put the affair straight as far as you are concerned, to the end of the term.—Yours faithfully, H. and C. Padbury." I sent an answer, but no rent was paid to me after that, except what the brokers got. It was paid</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210179"/>
               <p>when the brokers went in. On February 10, 1907, I received a letter from Lee asking to be allowed to move his goods on giving an under-taking to pay all arrears of rent by £1 weekly instalments. The arrears were about £3, I think. Lee brought the letter and I gave it to my sister to see if she would care to agree to it. Lee came several times the same evening to know if he could take the furniture away. I told him I had not seen my sister and could not give him a decided answer. The next morning I went to 10, Anderson Street at 5.30 a.m. and saw a pantechnicon with four men moving the things out of the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Warren. I did not give you permission to move the goods. I did not say when I saw you moving, "You are moving rather early," nor did, you say, "Yes, Miss Cripps, we are moving; you gave me permission." You have not paid me £30.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Marment. When you called first and references were spoken of, you said you would write to them yourself. I did not write to them because I took your word. The name Padbury on my notes about the references is not intended to mean that Padbury was oat of the references. I thought you were going to let me have the names of the references. I did not look at the names on the two letters, because I thought I was going to have the letters. You did tell me that Lee was living in a much larger nouse than the one he was going to take. When Lee took the goods away I telegraphed to the broker to go to the new, house, but he could not get in, as the doors and windows were nailed down. There was £25 paid in regard to 10, Anderson Street. I distrained in November, as soon as it was due. I know nothing about the people who wrote the re<lb/>fernces.</p>

                  </hi>, 29, Benhill Road, Camberwell, clerk to Nicholl, Menisty and Co., solicitors, who are agents for No. 3, South Street, Chelsea. The owner is Lady George Campbell. In June, 1906, the house was to lei, and Marment—Parbury we knew him as—called about it. presenting a card similar to the one produced: "Messrs. H. and C. Padbury, surveyors, land agents and builders, 17, Montpelier Place, Brompton Road, S.W." In reply to his inquiry we told him we had some houses to let on a short tenancy, including 3, South street. Prisoner said he could find a suitable tenant for this house—the rent was £6 a month. I said we should require the usual re<lb/>ferences, which he said he would be able to give. I think this hap<lb/>pened on June 7, but he called on several occasions afterwards. He mentioned the name, as far as I can remember, of E. Lee, as tenant. The letter (produced) was handed to me by Padbury. I see my hand-writing upon it. It is a reference in favour of Lee, signed "C. Warren." I also received the letter of June 12 another reference—signed by H. and C. Padbury. We agreed to accept Lee as tenant on the terms in the agreement (produced) of June 15, 1906, between Lady George Campbell and George Lee, of 34, Clarendon Gardens. The rent was to be paid monthly in advance. We wrote on June 13 accepting George Lee as tenant of 3, South Street, from June 24,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210180"/>
               <p>and Marment sent us an account of his charges. £2 10s. dated June 11 Padbury paid the first month's rent in advance from which the. £2 10s. was deducted. The agreement (produced) was sent to Padbury, and we received it back signed George Lee, witness "H Padbury, surveyor." The address of Lee was blank when we sent it It came back as "34, Clarendon Gardens, Mania Vale." The original was signed by Lady George Campbell. (Agreement was read.) The next rent was due on July 24; it was paid in July; I do not know by whom. We had a letter from Padbury of September 30: "17. Montpelier Place" is run through at he top and "10. Anderson Street" put in. It complains of the water pipes being broken, etc. which he had to put in order, paying 16s. for same. Another letter was received September 26 with the heading, Montpelier Place struck out: "Temporary office, 10, Anderson Street, Kings Road, Chelser." It is from H. and C. Padbury, and says that Mr. Lee during Mr. Lee's absence had instructed them to look after his interests, and as they understood some rent was due, and they would see him during next week they would send cheque for balance. We believed the references to be genuine. On October 5 we wrote Messrs. Pad<lb/>bury, saying our application for rent to Mr. Lee had been returned, the envelope being marked not known," and asking if we could look to them for payment. On October 6 we had a reply saying, they would send the two months' rent due on September 24, one day next week. On October 29 we received an account from Padbury showing a net balance due to us of £5 4s. My impression is that the money was brought with that letter. We received another letter on November 22, with the address, "21, South Parade, Fulhan Road," complaining that the party serving notice on No. 10, North Terrace, was very objectionable and insulting, and asking that he should be allowed to serve it. The letter also says that the rents of 10. North Terrace, and 3, South Street, would be duly paid on December 13. Padbury had let 10, North Terrace, for us I answered on November 29, and wrote again on December 3. (Several letters received and sent, dealing with 10, North Terrace, and 3. South Street, were proved by witness in regard to giving up Posses sion. etc.) The letter of December 18 to Padbury was returned through the poet. The last letter we received was on January 31. enclosing key of 10, North Terrace, snd saving he could not get the key of 3, South Street, as he could not find the late tenant: the rent owing he would send as soon as possible, etc. After the £5 4s. paid in October nothing further was received. About the end of January our agents took possession of 3, South Street. There was three or four months' rent due then. I cannot remember any further message from Padbury.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Warren. I do not know who the tenant was of 3, South Street. I do not say you were. You did call once with the rent in some other matter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Marment. I know you as H. Padbury. of the firm of H. and C. Padbury, land agents and surveyors, Brompton</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210181"/>
               <p>Road. I cannot say that I appointed you one of our agents. In regard to these houses, we were employing one agent in the imme<lb/>diate locality, and our client told us to put it in several hands. You called on us and said you could introduce tenants, and we dealt with you I do not know if that would be held to be appointing you agent for us. I was not instructed to employ only three agents. You told me you had a reference from a man named Warren, who had known you a number of years. I do not recollect whether you said you did not know the tenant. I did say that if you sent a letter saying your partner knew him that would be as a reference, but I did not know the firm, I only knew of Mr. Padbury. You called to pay the first £6 rent and 5s. stamp on the agreement, less £2 10s. It is usal to stop commission out of the first month's rent in a letting of that kind. I remember that a young man about 27 years old came and paid one of the rents. I do not remember him saying he was one of the tenants; I treated him as being a tenant. Three months' rent in all was paid for 3, South Street.</p>

We put before him two or three houses in the usual way, one being 24, Gratton Road, West Keusing<lb/>ton, giving him the keys. He returned soon afterwards and said he would like to take the house. He left two references, and the terms were arranged at £50 per annum on a three years' agreement. Mr. Sherlock, a fellow clerk, was present then and made a note of the references. We subsequently wrote to one of them. Warren men<lb/>tioned that he wanted a larger establishment owing to having two daughters coming home from Germany.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Warren. To the best of my belief you paid the rent for the Gratton Road House and you gave up possession when asked. I believe you paid half the money for the agreement. I went into the house two or three times, but only into one or two rooms, and they appeared to be well furnished.</p>

                  </hi>, house agent, Maclise Mansions, West Ken<lb/>sinton. I am agent for 24, Gratton Road, West Kensington, and have been for several years. The owners of the house are the Com<lb/>bined Estates Company, Limited, 11, Great James Street, Bedford Row, the manager of which is Mr. Bradley. The house was to let in February this year. Prisoner Warren came to see me then, giving the name of Gunn. I was told by my clerk that he had given refer<lb/>ences and I dictated two letters to them, receiving the reply produced from H. West, 10, Anderson Street: "In reply to yours of yesterday's date. I beg to say that during the time Mr. T. Gunn has been my tenant he has always been prompt in his payments, and I have no besitation in saying you will find him respectable and a reliable tenant," etc. A reply was also received from the other reference; I to not remember the name. (Another reference was read.) I sent</p>

               <p>those references to Mr. Bradley, who gave me instructions to accept. (Agreement produced.) I did not actually see Mr. Gunn sign the agreement; my clerk Skinner did. The rent was paid when it fell due up to March 25, and I think I made an allowance for non-occu<lb/>pation. When the next rent was due (June 24) I sent a letter round demanding the money. It was not forthcoming on the 25th, so I distrained.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Warren. I believe you sent round on June 24 asking to give you time for payment, and I told the messenger I would not. I believe your house was furnished. I was paid the rent when I distrained.</p>

These goods I sent, value 12s., enclosing account. Then I received another letter on the 17th, "Mrs. Howlett would be glad if Mr. Jones would forward as per enclosed tab, to arrive Saturday morning, four nice ducks, not trussed, for presentation to Mrs. Howlett's daughter. No eggs will be required this week," etc. "To be called for at the Parcels Office, Addison Road Station.

I received the letter produced of July 17, 1907, 24, Gratton Road, Kensington, from Mrs. Howlett, asking us to send a side of real Welsh mountain lamb to be sent to Addison Road Station. (A similar letter to that spoken of by previous witness.) We sent the lamb and the invoice with it. (Produced.) We then received a further letter giving a similar order for goods to present to her daughter (as in the last case). We did not send that, but wrote a letter saying we could not execute it without bankers' refer<lb/>ences or payment for the first order, etc. We believed Mrs. Howlett was an honourable person and intended to pay, but we never received anything. There was no answer to that letter. We send a large quantity to London, especially Kensington. The class of customers there is rather above the average as a rule.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arnold Ward said he was going to Hamming's case to prove that Frinton House was obtained under conditions concerning which no charge was made.</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant. It must be evidence against somebody. Mr. Arnold Ward. There is no charge in the indictment, but there is evidence of obtaining the house by fraud against Hemming.</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant. We will not have that. We will not have evidence to show a man's motive until we have something either for or against him. It is no good saying we give evidence that Hemming is a very bad man, but we cannot give'evidence on the charge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arnold Ward. Will you let us call that later?</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant. I do not say that I shall; we will not have this now. It may come later or not. I only say it is not evi<lb/>dence now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arnold Ward. In the next case there is no charge against Warren or Marment; the prisoners concerned are Hemming and Sword.</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant. We are not going to charge another case which is not connected with the prisoners, unless you like to strike out all the evidence you have got and say you abandon the case which at present is opened.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arnold Ward. We will go to a witness who gives evidence against several prisoners in several cases.</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant. Do that if you like.</p>
               <p>(Wednesday, October 30.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Bodkin said that, as the learned Judge thought it undesirable that there should be charges of conspiracy in the indictment in which all the prisoners were not involved—i.e., in addition to the general charge of conspiracy to defraud and to obtain houses, there were subsidiary conspiracies of two or more of the prisoners—as the pro<lb/>secution did not desire to in any way improperly hamper the defen-dants,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210184"/>
               <p>and as the evidence had only affected Marment and Warren upon the charge in reference to the houses, he proposed to discharge the Jury from giving a verdict in regard to the other three prisoners, who would then have an opportunity of being tried before another jury, and that the case should now deal solely with Marment and War<lb/>ren. (Reg. v. Gordon referred to.)</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant. In this case it was apparent upon the opening that this was a prosecution which involved nominally and, on the face of it, a general crime committed by the five defendants and, rightly enough, they were indicted together. In such a case, also, it is right to include separate acts which are connected with the general conspiracy as charges against all the five, or against any, if they are acts which form part of the story of the combination. Further than that it is not right to go. It is clearly wrong and contrary to prac<lb/>tice to include in one indictment charges against one, two, or more of one crime and others with another crime, even when one of the parties in the first crime is also charged as a party to the second. It is unfair to the defendants; it is improper, if not unfair, that two separate, independent crimes alleged against different defendants should be brought before the Jury on one trial which involves a mul<lb/>titude of issues; it makes it very hard, if not impossible, for the Jury to try it. If counsel for the prosecution say there really is a substantial case on which I could ask the Jury to convict all the prisoners of one crime, I should act upon that. Here that assim ance is not given, and the Court is left to act upon that which is ap<lb/>parent—namely, that in one case there are joined together indepen<lb/>dent charges against different defendants. Five people are charged with one conspiracy which there is no substantial ground for alleging against the five, and then, having brought those five together, as if they were engaged in one crime, different crimes are alleged against different people. That is a misuse of the process of a criminal court, unfair to the accused, embarrassing to the Jury and to the Court. I have no doubt, as is suggested, there is power even at this stage to sever this charge, to break the indictment into different parts, and confine the attention of this Jury on this occasion to one part (which ought to have been the whole of one indictment), leaving the other counts to be dealt with on a future occasion; but that is a coarse which generally ought to be taken at an earlier stage. It would not be the right course for the Court to take on this occasion, because it it is time that it should be stated, not only that such procedure on the part of the prosecution is erroneous, but that it is wrong and it ought to be discouraged and treated in a way which will stop the repetition of such a proceeding as far as the order of one Court can discourage it. Therefore the course I shall take is one which I have no doubt is within the power of the Court, and that is to quash the indictments which charge offences not involving Warren and Marment. With regard to the general charge of conspiracy, of course, that remains to be dealt with, and if there is no evidence against the other three defendants they will necessarily be acquitted.</p>

On April 2 we reoeived a further order which we did not execute, as we do not allow an account to run over a month. We made several applications and have not been paid; took proceedings in the county court when the summons could not be served as it was stated that no such person existed and substi<lb/>tuted service was ordered.

He said, "I do not know how they make that out. I always pay my rent. I do not owe any rent. They cannot touch you if you pay the rent. I have paid my rent at Gratton Road, or my wife has. I do not owe any rent there. There is a lot of furniture in the house and if I owe any rent they can distrain and it will be paid out. At Anderson Street she knew I was going." I said, "The charge is for obtaining leases and houses by false references, and there will be further charges for obtaining goods by fraud in the name of Howlett at Gratton Road." Warren said, "I do not know how you can confuse me with Howlett. He is only a lodger in the house. If the people come from the coun<lb/>try for their money they will be paid out."</p>

He said, "We always pay our rent. Where does the false pretence come in?" I said, "Your references were false." He said, "That may be, but I do not admit that they were." I told him that there would probably be other charges pre<lb/>ferred against him for obtaining goods by fraud. He said, "Yes."</p>

A man was there, an ex<lb/>convict and a prostitute; not Mrs. Howlett. (To Marment.) I did not know you prior to your arrest. (To the Judge.) I knew Warren by a number of names from the correspondence we have seen.</p>

                  </persName>, T Division. On August 15, at six p.m., I conveyed Warren from Brixton Police Station to Walton Street, and there read the warrant. He is charged under the name of Padbury. He said, "That agreement is not my agreement at all; it is Warren's. I was simply an agent in the matter, and I have not</p>

               <p>seen Billy Hemming since they left Anderson Street, when he called there four or five times with Walter." On August 11 I searched Warren, and found a quantity of memoranda, addresses of firms, and a book containing the names and addresses of tradesmen in the pro<lb/>vinces, some of whom appear in this case; also business cards, "H. and F. West, manufacturers, agents, and dealers in fancy goods, etc., 10, Anderson Street, near Sloan Square, S.W.," and bills relating to goods supplied to Mrs. Howlett. On the same day, at 11 p.m., I searched 24, Gratton Road, and found in a desk and other places in the front basement two books containing names and addresses of tradesmen, and an entry, "H. C. Marment, 51, Lancaster Road, Not<lb/>ting Hill." in the handwriting of Marment; another book containing names and addresses of tradesmen in Warren's handwriting; note<lb/>paper similar to Exhibit 87, and other patera. I saw two men in the house, but no woman. In the desk was agreement by Thomas Donelly, of 10, Anderson Street, for lowing 24, Gratton Road. There was also the lid of an egg box labelled, "J. B. Jones, 'Craven Arms,' Shropshire." I found also book (produced) with several entries in Marment's handwriting referring to "C. W." (Wirren) "2s. 6d." and various items of payments of small sums to "C. W." and others adding up to £3 7s. 2 1/2 d. Before that is "H. Padbury cash" and at the end of the book are "H. Padbury" and "C. Warren." In the agreement between Elizabeth Cripps and George Lee, "Henry Pad<lb/>bar, agent for George Lee" is in the handwriting of Marment; the signature "George Lee" is written by Warren. (Witness iden<lb/>tified a large number of letters and agreements as written or signed, by Warren and Marment in the names of Padbury, Lee, and West.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Marment. I have not made inquiries at 51, Lancaster Road. In the book I find entries, "September 7, 1906, Mr. Lee to Padbury £110s," and "£4." I did not know you before arrest.</p>

                  </persName>, T Division (called at the request of Marment and cross-examined by him). I have known Warren now for about 10 years. He was not interested in an estate office in Gower Place for three years. He was in Antill Square in 1901. We lost trace of him from 1901 to the end of 1902. I have seen Marment with Warren in December. 1906, near Anderson Street, and on several occasions since last October I have seen Marment at 2, Cedars Road, Walham Green. I followed Warren from Gratton Road to Marment's address and saw them meet there—a house kept by Haig at 2, Cedars Road. I have seen Marment visit that house several times, and I have followed Warren carrying poultry there from 24. Gratton Road. I have seen Marment with Warren at 2, Cedars Road three times—once when Marment was locked in the front room.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, not on oath). I am charged with conspiring to obtain houses, not to live in, but for the purpose of obtaining goods with intent to defraud. Taking 3, South Street first, I was trading with a partner as H. and C. Padbury. Surveyors and land agents, 17, Montpelier Place, Brompton Road, in April, 1906. In May or June I saw Mr. Waite at the agent's for Lady Campbell; they had from 20 to 30 houses to let there. There was no rent made, and we had to make a rent. My partner, C. Padbury, brought a young man of 27 or 28, named George Lee (not Warren, as represented by the prosecution), whom he knew very well. I showed Lee No. 3, which he thought would suit. We made the rent £6 a month, payable in advance, to include rates and taxes, which for that neighbourhood is very cheap, but the houses were coming down in 12 months. He gave me a reference to Warren, who was in business in 1903, 1904, and 1905 at 1a, Gower Place. I collected the first month's rent so as to get my commission, which is usual for an agent to do, and Lee paid his next month's rent to Mr. Waite and got a receipt. They were only there for another six or eight weeks and the house was vacant. I had nothing to do with the house, but I took a certain amount of trouble, as I wished to keep on with the estate to let to builders, as the houses were coming down and I knew there would be development. I think that house has nothing to do with this case. As to 10, Anderson Street, I have known Warren since 1891 as an estate agent, sometimes seeing him frequently, sometimes not for years. I met him accidentally in Chelsea, and he asked me if I knew of a house at about £50 or £60 rent near Sloane Square. I told him of this house and then saw Miss Cripps to learn the rent. which was £60, and also to get my commission for letting it. Warren had just left a house, where he was a tenant with Lee, in Camden Town for three years, at £65. I said Miss Cripps wanted references, and he said, "There are plenty of references; everybody knows we pay our rent. It must be in the name of Lee, as the furniture belongs to Mrs. Lee and she is the responsible party." That is why the house was taken in the name of Lee. There was five months' rent paid and three months' owing. According to what Miss Cripps told me, she could have had her money if she had chosen to distrain; there were plenty of good there. Mrs. Lee had a top back bedroom not used, and she offered for me to come and board and lodge at 20s. a week, which I did. She said, "Possibly, Warren and you can do some business together." Hence we started H. and F. West, which was to be a postal business for the sale of jewellery and fancy goods by advertisement. Very little came of it because we had no available capital. It is proved by that cash book that I paid Mr. Lee on Sep<lb/>tember</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210189"/>
               <p>7 £1 10s. for board and lodging, and on September 14 £4. As to Kallaway, I ordered the goods for Mrs. Lee. She wanted credit for a month, or two and, therefore, that promissory note was given. As far as I know, no application was made for that money, or I should have seen that she paid something on account, if not all of it. I admit I wrote nearly all the letters during that time. At the end of October I had a disturbance with Warren, left, and have never seen him since. The officer has made a mistake as to that. Had that house been got for the purpose of getting goods, we would not have been satisfied with one lot when we might have got 20 or 30. As to the set of drain rods, there was a builder living there with his wife, daughter, and son, and the drain rods were for him. I wrote the letter and that is all. There are only two lots of goods I am inte<lb/>rested in. As to the houses, they are bona-fide tenants and the rent was paid in both cases.</p>

                  </persName>, H Division. On October 7, about nine p.m. I saw prisoner in Hanoury Street, Spitalfields, in the com<lb/>pany of Turner and two females. I kept them under observation and followed them about from public-house to public-house, nine or ten in all. In the fifth public-house one of the females left and pro<lb/>secutor and the other female came out together with the prisoner, who was carrying two quart cans of malt liquor, which he took to a house in Ferrol Street. The female went with prosecutor to a beer-house close by. In about 10 minutes prisoner entered the same bar and afterwards left the house with Turner. He went to another house in Commercial Street. From Commercial Street he went to the "Weavers' Arms" in Han bury Street and met the female, who had already got there from another direction. They remained there till closing time, when they all came out—the prisoner, the prosecu<lb/>tor, the female, and a strange man. They went to Old Montague Street and stood talking at the corner. All at once I saw prisoner strike Turner in the face and hit him against a shop. He hit him five or six times about the face and chest, and then walked sharply away to a little court in Old Montague Street. Turner, the female, and the strange man then went into Whitechapel Road and prisoner came through a court and walked along on the opposite side of the road. They came to a coffee stall and stopped, and prisoner watched them. The strange man walked away and I went over and had a look at him. He appeared to be a half-drunk seaman himself, and I took no more notice of him. A few minutes after Turner left the female at the coffee stall and went towards Fenchurch Street. I pulled him up at the corner of Fenchurch Street and saw he had not a watch chain, which he had had up to the time he left the last public-house. I said, "I am a police officer; have you lost any<lb/>thing?" I communicated with another officer, and he arrested the prisoner and I arrested the female. They were taken to Commercial Street Police Station, when prosecutor said he would not charge the female but would charge the man with assaulting him and stealing his watch chain. Prisoner said, "I am as innocent as you are," to me. When searched, only a few coppers were found on him. Prose<lb/>cutor gave evidence at the police court the next morning. He had two black eyes and three teeth loose. His ship sailed the following day and he went with her. I was in plain clothes in the vicinity for the purpose of preventing this class of offence—robbing drunken seamen. There is a terrible raid on these sailors.

               <p>him. I was some distance away, but I am quite sure, because I passed them a minute or two before. I told prisoner I was a police officer, and should arrest him for being concerned with Jenny, the woman, with assaulting and robbing Turner. He said, "All right; I know nothing about it." At the station, when the charge was read over to him, he said, "I am as innocent as you are." I followed them because the woman is notorious and makes her living by get<lb/>ting these drunken seaman robbed by bullies.</p>

                  </hi>. On Saturday evening, October 5, as I was going home from work between seven and eight I went in a beerhouse called the "Britannia," at the corner of Commercial Street, for a glass of ale. Prisoner was there and I got into conver<lb/>sation with him, and I stood him a drink. As soon as I got outside the door I was leaped on from behind, and prisoner took the money from my pocket. I never saw him before till then. I had between 15s. and 16s. I chased prisoner to the next turning and saw him go into a lodging-house, and then I was tripped up. A police-con<lb/>stable came up and I stated my case. On his advice I went to the station and reported to two plain clothes officers, and gave a descrip<lb/>tion of the prisoner. I waited at the station about half an hour, when they brought prisoner in and I identified him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Prisoner. I left work at one o'clock on Satur<lb/>day and had a drink with my shop mates, leaving them at 3.30. I went for a ramble round and to get a few tools as my firm is moving into the country. I was not in the "Queen's Head" between 1.30 and five. I met you soon after six in the "Britannia." You were in the public-house before me. We had three drinks. I ran after you and saw you run to the door of a lodging-house. You say I knew you before, and that we were in the army together. I have never been in the army. When you were charged you said, "Are you going to charge a comrade that fought side by side with you?" I had been friendly with you and had no quarrel.</p>

They had two or three drinks and were talking about the army. Prisoner went out first and Bond afterwards, and then there was a shout outside. I went out and found a crowd there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Prisoner. You and prosecutor walked in the bar together. I think you went out just before him. As he opened the door I heard scuffling. He came back to me two minutes after<lb/>wards and said the man he had been drinking with had robbed him.</p>

I said, "I shall arrest you on suspicion of being concerned with others in assaulting a man a little while previous outside the 'Britannia' public-house." He said, "What man?" I said, "You will be put up for identification." He said, "All right." At the station he was identified by Bond at once, and then I charged him. He said, "That is a lie; he cannot prove it." I searched him and found 5s. 6d. in silver and 2d. bronze on him. Bond was sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Prisoner. When I arrested you you were on the footway outside the "Queen's Head" talking to Agnes Davey.</p>

I was with him in the public-house from 1.30 till five and then I went home and went to sleep. I came back and met prose<lb/>cutor again and had a drink with him. Then I left him and walked over to the "Queen's Head." I saw no more of him till I was taken to the police station, when he charged me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Bond charged me because he did not know who had robbed him, and I had been with him all the afternoon. I swear I am innocent. The 5s. 8d. found on me I had earned in Covent Garden that morning. I could prove Bond was in the "Queen's Head" that afternoon. I know he had money on him in the after<lb/>noon but not at seven o'clock.</p>

We were friendly so far as I can recollect. I had worked with Davidson for five days. I did not work with the other man. I had spoken to Limburgh occasionally.

                  </persName>. I arrested prisoners, and Lim<lb/>burgh said, "That is quite right. It was only done for a lark." Davidson said, "I only done it for a lark; I was frightened when I saw him go up." The building is about 57 ft high. The crane is on the top and reaches out over the canal and is used for unloading coal from barges and then conveying them into the portholes on the various floors. Fitzgerald fell about 57 ft. into the barge below. It is a hydraulic crane and the men did not understand it. Somebody went to the top of the warehouse to try to reach him. They happened to touch the rope and let it out. That released his arms and he was powerless. The neckerchief gave way and he fell. I have made inquiries and find both prisoners are respectable men. They both visited Fitzgerald in the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>, crossing sweeper. I am a cripple. On Octo<lb/>ber 8, about 20 minutes to six, I was in the "Princess Royal." Great Western Road, Paddington. Prisoner was in there and forced his conversation upon me. I was not anxious to talk to him and did not want to have anything to do with him at all. Afterwards I went into the urinal. Prisoner followed me in and knocked me about, striking me on the head and about the body. I had never seen him before to my knowledge. After he had done that he went down my pockets, took what money I had and one of two watches I had in my possession and then ran away. When I came out of the urinal I saw him at the end of the mews, about 30 yards away, and endes<lb/>voured to catch him, but could not do so, and some young lads gave chase to him. The watch he took was a metal watch of the value of about 10s., and had been given me to repair. I am a watch-maker and do repairs in my spare time.</p>

When he saw me he turned back into the Cornwall Road and then into Alden Road Villas. I afterwards met Church, the cripple, whose face was bleed<lb/>ing profusely. I found prisoner lying on the ground. I told him to get up and told him the charge. He said, "If I had not fallen you would never have caught me." He complained of a pain in the arm. That might have been caused by someone falling on him, but there was a great crowd round and I could not see. When charged at the station he said to prosecutor, "I never knew you had a watch." When pro<lb/>secutor produced a little black watch prisoner said, "That is the watch you had in the public-house." I did not hear him say anything about having thrown the watch away. No watch was found.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gill, who appeared for the prosecution, said the representatives of Sir John Bennett were anxious to recover the pawntickets relating to the pawning of their property, and he believed his Lordship had power to order restitution with regard to them as being the proceeds of the property remaining in the hands of the accused.</p>
               <p>The Recorder said that no doubt the pawnbrokers would be ready to assist in the recovery of the property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attenborough, representing the pawnbroking interest, under<lb/>stood that the application was made only with regard to the tickets The things were not all pledged with one pawnbroker; 20 pawn<lb/>brokers at least were concerned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gill said it was not suggested there was any fault on the part of the pawnbrokers, and no doubt the parties would be able to come to terms.</p>

                  </hi>, 45, Sirdar Road, Notting Dale, knife grinder. On October 4 I was in London Street, Tottenham Court Road, between five and six in the evening. I was sitting on my knife grinding machine at work when the prisoner and three companions, who had been on the opposite side of the road, came towards me. Prisoner ran across, and, picking up the nandles of my machine while I was sitting on it, ran me across the road. I got off my machine and said. "You ought to be ashamed of yourself to interfere with an old man like me, getting his living." He said, "You old bastard, I will break your arm for you." He then seized me by the right arm with one hand, placed his arm under my armpit and promptly broke my arm, gave it a sudden jerk—with the ju-jitsu trick. I then spoke to two constables and told them what had occurred, giving the prisoner into custody. He and his companions had gone into a public-house round the corner. I was taken to the hospital and the arm set. The prisoner had been drinking, but he could not be drank, or he could not have run me across the road. I never saw him before. I am 69 years old.</p>
               <p>To the Prisoner. The wheeling of the barrow was a rough joke. You were laughing and making a noise. The other men never inter<lb/>fered with me.</p>
               <p>To the Common Serjeant. I have no idea what it was really done for.</p>

               <p>parallel with Tottenham Court Road. I was with another officer when the prosecutor came up, and from what he said I went to the "Globe,' which is at the corner of London Street and Whitfield Street. The prisoner was immediately pointed out to me by the prosecutor who said, "That is the man who broke my arm. I was sitting in my barrow in London Street grinding some tools when pri<lb/>soner and three others came along, and prisoner wheeled my barrow from one side of the road to the other. I remonstrated with him, to which he replied, 'You old bastard, I will break your arm,' and he immediately put his arm underneath my own and broke it." I told prisoner who I was and that I would take him into custody. He said, "I could easily break your b——y arm if I thought fit to, but I know better." I took him to the police station, and when charged he said, "I must go through it, but I do not remember it." He also said he was there. He had been drinking, but he was sober. He knew what he wan doing. Before being committed at the Court I heard prisoner say, "I admit the wheeling, but I do not remember anything else."</p>

                  </persName>, house surgeon, University College Hospital. I saw Bishop when he was brought to the hospital and examined him. I found a fracture of the left humerus. I set the arm. There was no sign of external violence. I advised the man to go to the infirmary as we do not take cases of that nature. The arm was broken cer<lb/>tainly. I also found that the bone was very thin, partly on account of his age, and partly on account of the very badly nourished condi<lb/>tion of the man; the bone was atrophied, and a very slight amount, of violence might have caused the fracture. I should say it would set, but it is one of the bones in the body which are liable not to set well.</p>

                  </hi>, 127, Bemerton Street, King's Cross, coster. I am 19. On the evening of October 13 I was in the "Swan" public-house, in Caledonian Road, about 9.30. On coming out I saw pri<lb/>soner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210198"/>
               <p>with a lot more. He asked me where I come from. I told him I come from Bemerton Street, and then they started paying me with their hands. I had not done anything to make them pay me. I ran away and Harmond held a revolver up in Charlotte Street and fired twice. I ran into Copenhagen Street, and then I heard three more shots, after which I ran into the "Rothbury "public-house and told the governor there were a lot of boys shooting at me. He said, "Wait there; I will fetch a constable to send them away." The con<lb/>stable came up and ran after these boys. I came out of the Rothbury again and got into the Caledonian Road to the corner of Richmond Road, where I saw the constable with prisoner and another one, and I recognised prisoner as the one who fired at me. I do not know the name of the other one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Prisoner. I do not know that the revolver was broken. I have not told anyone that I did not think that it was you who shot at me. I have spoken to you at Brixton, but did not tell you that.</p>
               <p>To the Common Serjeant. I come from Bemerton Street. I do not belong to a band of boys who go about; there are only four of us who go together. We all live in the same street. Some of us live in Bemerton Street and some in Gifford Street. We defend our<lb/>selves if we are interfered with. I do not know there are a lot of boys who are likely to interfere with us.

I saw him go out and followed after, then I saw him running in front of about 50 or 60 lads. He ran up Charlotte Street, and as they were running I heard the report of firearms. Shortly after I heard another report. I did not see who fired. Then Church<lb/>wood ran into another public-house.</p>
               <p>To the Common Serjeant. Churchwood and I had been together all the night. This occurrence was about 9.30. I did not knock prisoner or any boy down or have any quarrel with a boy. Two or three of us got hold of the prisoner and punished him with our hands; that was after the shooting. Mayer is the fellow prisoner was with at the time. Before the shooting there were a lot of boys round Churchwood. They asked him where he came from. He ran away. With that they all started on him, but he got through the crowd. Prisoner told me that I had a glass in my hand, but I had not; that was when we were hitting him after the shooting. I go to work at one o'clock in the day and do not get home before half-part 12 at night.</p>

               <p>they dispersed in different directions. I followed the prisoner and another one and overtook them at Richmond Road, Caledonian Road, and informed another constable of what I had seen. The prosecutor and witness then came up and pointed out the two youths, one the prisoner and another one dealt with at the police-court, saying that the prisoner was the lad that had shot at them a short time pre<lb/>viously. I took him into custody, and while he was detained at the station he made a statement: "I did not do all the shooting, some was done by another man. I bought the revolver this morning in Petticoat Lane. I gave 2s. for it." On the way to the station an<lb/>other constable took a revolver from prisoner's pocket.</p>

It is a six-chambered revolver. I could not say they had been lately discharged. The spring is broken and you cannot discharge it now. It was probably faked up for the sale and the spring has gone wrong afterwards. Very probably it went wrong during the firing.</p>

                  </hi>, Buxton Street, Whitechapel, painter. On September 15, at half past twelve in the morning, I had some refresh<lb/>ment. I had just had a little job to square up, and I stopped and squared it up. I mean I was going up to pay the landlord and square off the back rent, but he was shut up. I went into the urinal in George Yard. One part of the yard runs into Whitechapel Road. I went in to use the urinal, and a gentleman got hold of me and knocked me down. He took hold of me and took my money and everything out of my pocket. There were two or three of them. They took me by the throat and felled me on the floor and nearly throttled me. My head was cut and the blood was running down at the back; there was a little hole at the back. I had 27s. on me; a sovereign in a purse and other little silver. I also lost my keys and knife and tobacco box, which I have never seen since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I do not know the urinal very well. I have, I believe, been there once before. It leads from Commercial Road and runs into Whitechapel Road. I have heard it is a good place for a robbery. I do not go round there more than I can help. I do not know whether it is very dark there, but there is not much light. I believe there is a light there, but I am not sure. I had had a drop of beer, and I was not thinking about anything. I know they got me by the throat and strangled me. I felt it for over a week. I cannot say how long they had hold of me; I was fairly done over by the throat, and could hardly speak the next morning. I believe there is a way out on each side of the urinal, but I have not been in there since. I have no idea how long it was before the police came and took me away. I lost myself altogether. I know I found myself in the station afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>, 215, Wentworth Street Buildings. I am 11 years old. I remember the night of September 14. About a quarter to one on Sunday morning I was going home to my house. I had come from my father's shop and was going to bed. As I went down I hap<lb/>pened to see this fellow there holding a man's neck. I was in Went<lb/>worth Street then. Another boy was taking the money out of pro<lb/>secutor's pockets. I only saw two of them, but I think there were three. It was dark at the time. When they were finished with the man they got hold of him and knocked him down. I could see him go against a wall on his head. I think they knocked him down, because he went over very sharp. (Shellford was produced in court.) That is the man they knocked down. As I was going home I saw a policeman coming and then the boys walked out. Then the police-man ran after prisoner and hit him in the jaw and took him to the police station. I was not in the lavatory. I did not say anything to the policeman. The next time I saw prisoner was in Commercial Road Police Station. I went there with my brother to tell them what had happened.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210201"/>
               <p>Cross-examined. I never saw prisoner knock prosecutor down. I walked right by, and as I turned round I saw the policeman run along and the man going down. I was a little distance from the urinal at the time. I know prisoner was holding the prosecutor's neck, because as I was walking by I saw this fellow, and I looked in and saw them doing it. I know this urinal; it is a dark place. Nobody has spoken to me about this case since the occurrence.</p>
               <p>To the Common Serjeant. I never lost sight of prisoner when he ran away.</p>

                  </persName>, 325 H. On Sunday morning, September 15, I was on duty in Wentworth Street. I was about to make use of the lavatory at the top of George Yard. It comes round in a circle, with one door in Wentworth Street and the other in George Yard. You can almost look through. There are four re<lb/>cesses. Just as I was entering into the doorway in George Yard I saw the prisoner had the prosecutor by the throat and tripped him up. I did not go into that door, but rushed to the other and two confederates ran away. This man was about to make away also when I struck at him and knocked him down, and took him back to the urinal and showed him what he had done to the prosecutor. With the assistance of another constable I took prosecutor into custody for being drunk and incapable; he was very drunk. I also charged the prisoner with assaulting him. At the time I saw a little boy there, and he said, "That is the man, governor, what done it." There was another witness also, but he is not here. I had a sum<lb/>mons granted by the Magistrate, and went to the address he gave, but failed to find him. I did not notice anyone else in the street, only some scavengers sweeping up in the road. They were about 10. yards away, and when they saw me they came nearer. When arrested prisoner said, "It was not me, governor. What is this for? What do you want to hit me for? It is your place to take me to the station, not to knock me about." When charged he said nothing. I found on him 3s. in silver and 3d. in bronze. It was about 10 minutes between my entering the urinal and getting to the station.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The missing witness came to the station and told the inspector what he saw this man do. I told the Magistrate to the best of my recollection what occurred; that he had the prosecutor by the throat, and the other two ran away, and as prisoner was about to run I struck at him. I may have added a little more to-day. What I said was near enough. There were three men in the urinal. Prisoner had got about five or six yards away before I hit him. I do not remember prisoner asking me what I meant by it, and did not say to him, "I wish I was a Magistrate. You have robbed the man." Prisoner may be a newspaper boy. I do not know. He gave his busi<lb/>ness as a newsvendor.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I am a newsvendor selling papers in the streets. On September 15 I was passing along Went-worth</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210202"/>
               <p>Street, having just come from Aldgate. I went to see if a shop was open where I could buy a sandwich. I had got about 20 yards past the urinal when this constable came up and hit me on the jaw. Then he said, "Come back and see what you have done." On the way back he said, "I wish I was a magistrate for half an hour." He was outside the urinal then. He did not say anything about my having robbed anybody. Then he went back to the prose<lb/>cutor and said to him, "This is one of them, ain't it?" The prose<lb/>cutor said, "I do not think so." On the way to the station when we had got nearly to the bottom of Wentworth Street he handed me to another officer and went back and locked the prosecutor up, and fetched this little boy to the station. There were plenty of people around. The other constable asked me what I was locked up for. I said, "I do not know." There was a light in the urinal. Before the constable came up three fellows ran by me. I was walking, and never made any attempt to run. They are swearing my life away, them people.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was living at Rowton House when this oc<lb/>curred. It was 12.30 as near as possible when I left Aldgate. The magistrate would not let me speak at the police court; only a little. I did not say then that I left Aldgate at about five to one; I said 25 to one; between 12.30 and 25 to one. I did not see the boy Liensky till I got to the station. It is untrue to say that the boy said at the urinal that I was the man. The prosecutor was too in<lb/>capable to know what he was saying.</p>
               <p>After the jury had considered for a short time.</p>

All at once two men rushed up, and one got hold of my arm, and the other got hold, of my arm the other side. One put his hand on my back and the other got hold of my throat and threw me down. The marks are there now. One knelt on</p>

               <p>my chest and one on my throat. I am still under the doctor. Prisoner was on the left. He said, "Go through him." I could not speak. I saw prisoner's face clearly, as it was right against a large arc lamp. They pulled at my watch chain and broke it away. Of course, I did not know that till afterwards. Some people then came round the corner and disturbed them, when up they jumped and gave me a kick in the back as they left me. I clutched this man with my left arm, and he dragged me through the mud a little way. My cheek was bleeding, and he had blood on his collar. I then got out a whistle which I carry in my pocket and started blowing it as soon as I got my breath. He bolted away to a big arc lamp that stands opposite the church. He bolted to the left, the other one to the right. There was a lot of people, who came off the tram or electric 'bus that finishes just there—it is a narrow way to go through—and, as prisoner saw he had no chance, I suppose, he doubled back round the lamp and passed me again. I kept blowing and managed to holloa out "Stop thief!" Just as he got to the turning I saw some<lb/>one bob out and catch him; they missed, and he ran on again. He was caught, I do not suppose 100 yards from the place where he knocked me down. A Mr. George Clover caught him, who happened to come out of the turning. I never lost sight of prisoner till he was caught. When I came up prisoner said, "I was only trying to help the old man; it was not me." I said, "A good job for you one of my sons is not here, he would kill you." After a time a policeman came on the scene; I gave prisoner in custody and went to the sta<lb/>tion. They led me back to the place where I was robbed and I pointed it out. There was this jewel lying in the mud. I went home, and some time afterwards Mr. Clover found the chain in the mud where he had captured prisoner and brought it to me, saying, "I have found the chain; it was lying in the mud." I am quite sure prisoner is the man. When I was on the ground prisoner said to the other man, "Choke the old b——, it don't matter."</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. I did not see you pull the other man off; nothing of the kind. I did not say to the crowd, "I do not care if you are not the man, we will make you suffer," nor tell them they could all come up and have a few shillings. "I said, "The scoundrel, he has nearly killed me."</p>

                  </hi>, contractor. On October 6, about 10 to 12, I was going home, when I heard a police whistle and cry of "Stop thief!" I then saw prisoner running towards me. I tried to stop him, but he dodged round, and I ran after and stopped him about 50 yards further on. I saw something bright in his hand like a chain. I held him till the constable came. Prisoner said, "It was not me." I said, "Oh, that's all right." He said he was running after someone else, and I asked, "Was it somebody invisible?" I could not see anybody in front. He was sober. Prosecutor came up and we went to the station. I afterwards came back to the spot where I had caught prisoner and found the pieces of chain (produced).</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). About half-past 11 I was walk<lb/>ing towards home and saw a gentleman on the floor with a man on top of him. I took it for a fight and went and dragged the man off. The gentleman got up, and the blood would come off the collar in that way. When I had dragged the man off he knocked me down and I lost sight of him. The crowd stopped me, and when prosecutor came up he said, "We don't care if you are the man or not, we will have you and make you suffer for it." He said to them, "You can all come up and earn a few shillings each."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have no fixed abode. I have not been living in Whitechapel. On the night in question I was walking home. I had just crossed, and I had been along with a friend who promised to give me a night's lodging, which he gave me. I do not know Bow Church. I did not follow prosecutor up along Mile End Road. I ran after the man whom I dragged off prosecutor for about five minutes; then I lost sight of him. No one stopped me; I stopped myself.</p>

                  </hi>, 81, Poolesden Road, Custom House, steve<lb/>dore. On August 9, 1907, I was unloading cement from the s.s. King Craig in the Victoria Docks. I went into the fore hold to get a spare 'tween deck hatch, and had taken one from where the prisoner was working. Prisoner said, "Who authorised you to take that hatch?" I said, "It is a spare one, Jim—we want to work a bit easy—secure of danger." He swore and said, "I will burst your nose." It wee not a hatch he was using, and was there for our use. I then went with my mate to pull up a cask of cement with my hook in my hand, when prisoner let go at me with his fist as hard as any man could, on the left jaw; then struck me between the nose and eyes. I dropped my hook, and he picked it up, held me by the wrist and hit me on the skull with it where it has been sewn up. I took his own hook away from him. He stuck three holes in my back with my hook, making wounds in my body. He struck me again in my forehead, drew me to him as I fell away, and struck me again. The foreman came down into the hold and shouted out, "Stop that fight<lb/>ing." I was holding my jaw. I was not attempting to hit prisoner—it would not do to strike the prisoner. He sat astride of a cask and giggled at me and said, "What a pretty sight—what a pretty object you look." My mouth was full of blood. I was trying to get my bottle of tea to rinse my mouth out. He then came over to me and said, "Look whet you have done to my shirt," and let go at me smack in the same place between the eyes and on the jaws with his fist as hard as he could, knocked me to the deck, lifted me up, and before I could get on my feet let go at me again. The foreman kept singing out to stop the fighting, and the prisoner went over to his own side to work with his mate. I was washing my eyes and face to go to the hospital, and the prisoner came over again and said, "I may as well put you out of your misery," and hit at me with a large iron crow<lb/>bar, similar to that (produced). I turned my head, and it struck me on the right side. I fell down and became unconscious. I was then led up the ladder and led to the hospital. I wanted to go home to my wife and family—we ere nine in family—and the doctor allowed me to go, but I had to come back at dinner time; I lay in the hos<lb/>pital 10 days, and have since attended as an out-patient. I cannot walk properly, and do not think I shall ever get my strength bank again.</p>

                  </hi>, 230, Victoria Dock Road, stevedore. On August 9 I was working on s.s. King Craig in No. 1 hold, at about one o'clock in the morning. I saw schubert go on the lower hold and pass a hatch on. I pulled the hatch up and laid it on the deck. Weekes then walked over and asked Schubert who told him to take the hatch. The latter gave some answer, and Weekes then struck him twice in the face with his fist. I then saw blood on Schubert's face. I was about three or four yards from him. Schubert had not hit Weekes or attempted to. Schubert had a hook in his hand, which prisoner pulled away and threw on the deck. Then the foreman came down and told them to knock off fighting. After that we went on working again; Schubert meanwhile was wiping the blood off his face. Then I heard him scream, and I saw Weekes strike him, and knock him on the deck, at the same time saying something. I was standing in the 'tween decks with Cave at that time. Prisoner hit Schubert twice with the crowbar. I went out and picked Schubert off the deck. He was in a very bad state, with blood running off his face. I did not see him strike prisoner at all, nor attempt to.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was working on the port side. The hatches are always shifted all round. Schubert did take a hatch from the starboard side where prisoner was in charge. I did not hear pri<lb/>soner tell Schubert to bring back the hatch; that he had improperly taken it away. Schubert did not make a dig at prisoner with his hook when the latter went over to him. He had the hook in his hand. It is usual for stevedores to have their hook in their hand when working; if not working they slip it in their belt. When Schubert was struck he put his hands up. There was a sort of struggle about the hook. I heard prisoner say he had a cut on the shoulder from the hook, but not till afterwards. I saw his finger bleeding. Prisoner did wrench the hook out of Schubert's hands, which he put on the deck, and I took it up and put it in the wing. Schubert did not have a hook in his hand after the struggle. I did not hear prisoner say, "Is it manly to hit a man with a hook!" I heard him shout out something which I could not hear. There were some railway buffers lying in the wings. Schubert did not fall upon them. There was no cask of cement near him. Schubert did not grab at an iron bar after he had fallen; there was none there. There was a crowbar there, which prisoner picked up and hit prosecutor with; then Fisher took it out of his hand.</p>
               <p>To the Common Serjeant. There was only two or three minutes after the foreman came down until prisoner hit prosecutor. They re<lb/>mained outside when he went into the fore hold.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I cannot walk far. I have heard of Bingo Street; it is somewhere round where I live. I think I went there last Thursday with my two sons, but I was not pushing a truck there nor anything else; I had only my walking stick. I do not know Mrs. Kane or Mrs. Golding and did</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210207"/>
               <p>not find them watching me at that time. I went with my sons to a wood place to buy wood, which my son and another chap took home on their back. There was no barrow. Mr. Cave was the foreman on our side of the ship, like Weekes on the other. We help each other with the hatches. There is no rule that we shall not take a hatch from either side. I did not tell prisoner I would not return the hatch. I said to him, "Jim, there are two more down that hold useless." We take each other's hatches and help each other. During the day I gave them hatches myself. When I had laid the hatch down prisoner said, "I have a good mind to bash your f—g nose." I said, "You don't want to talk like that." Then he hit me; the first time he burst my nose, and the next broke my lower jaw. He did not say he would have to take the hook away from me. I did not say when he went to take the hatch, "I will stop you, you tricky sod." Prisoner did not say, after the struggle, that it was un-Eng<lb/>lish or unfair to hit a man with a hook. He did not say, "I will learn you to use a hook." When he had done giggling he came over again, and I said, "Well, Jim, what is this for?" With that he let go again at me in the same place, and I fell on the deck. I did not fall over the irons; they were in the wing, about 6 ft. away. I can<lb/>not fight; I am too good-hearted for that. When I went to the hospital I did not crawl through the railway trucks; we went between the trucks. There is a gangway which they make for people to go through. I was in too much pain to notice the policeman at the gate; but I could hear what he said. I could not open my mouth to speak to him. I did not tell him I had met with an accident.</p>
               <p>To the Common Serjeant. I have not been able to work since this happened.</p>

                  </hi>, stevedore. I was working on the King Craig on the night of August 6 and 9. About 1.30 in the morning I was in the forehold, when there was a dispute about a hatch. I heard someone shout, "Oh! oh!" I turned round and saw Schubert bleed<lb/>ing in the mouth, and Weekes with his shirt, torn and blood on it. They were struggling for a hook. Confield, the foreman, came down then, and they parted. After the foreman had gone I saw Weekes come and hit Schubert in the jaw and knock him down. I had not seen the latter do anything previously to that. Then prisoner hit Schubert again with a crowbar. I was about six or eight yards away from them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The thing was done too quickly for me to inter<lb/>fere. I did not see the first part of the affair. I do not know whose hook it was, and I did not see Schubert snatch it out of his belt. I did not hear prisoner say, "Do you think it is a manly thing to hit a man with a hook?" nor "I will learn you to use a hook." There was iron of some sort lying near, but Schubert did not fall on it, nor on a barrel of cement. I did not see Schubert grab at a crowbar.</p>

               <p>1 hold. About one o'clock I saw prisoner and prosecutor struggling with a hook, and the latter called out, "Let go, Jim." The foreman came down and parted them, and they went on with the work. Schubert's nose was bleeding. Soon after there was a breakdown on deck, and we were all sitting down, when Weekes came over from the starboard side and knocked Schubert down with his fist. I heard Schubert say, "What have I done to be served like this?" Prisoner then picked up the bar and hit Schubert twice with it. Then Fisher took the bar away from prisoner. I was about 12 ft. off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. We were not all in a bad temper that night; I had no row with Fisher. I did not see Schubert get hold of the hook in his belt; he had not been using it on prisoner. I think I said before the magistrate that prisoner said, "I will learn you to use a hook." He said that before he struck with the bar. Schubert did not fall over a bundle of irons; they were about 12 ft. away. I cannot remember whether I told the magistrate that he fell close to the iron rods.</p>

When I came back the two men were struggling with the hook. Then they were parted by the foreman; soon after prisoner came over and hit Schubert twice with a crowbar, after which I took hold of the bar and said, "Good God, Jim, are you going mad altogether?"</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I cannot say that the mischief was done with one hook. I did not hear prisoner say it was unfair to fight with a hook. Schubert did not try to grab a crowbar when he was knocked over. I believe there were two crowbars lying about. I did not try to prevent the affair; I was a bit scared myself.</p>

                  </hi>. On August 91 was house surgeon at the Seamen's Hospital at Albert Docks. In the early morning Schubert was brought there and I examined him. On the left temple he had a wound about two inches long; not a serious one. His left eye was badly confused, also his left cheek; his left jaw was broken, he had three flesh wounds over his left shoulder, and two of his ribs were broken. He was also suffering from pleurisy. The injuries were consistent with being caused as to the face by a fist, and as to the ribs by a crowbar. I sent prosecutor home, but next day he was admitted ino the hospital, where he remained about 10 days. I ex<lb/>amined him yesterday, and found that his jaw was injured per<lb/>manently. My opinion is that there is an adhesion between the lung and the chest wall. He is suffering from nervous depression.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner may be able to work in three months. I said before the magistrate, it might be a month, but have changed my opinion since seeing him yesterday. The injury to the ribs would not be caused by falling over a cask. I might have said at the police court that they could be so caused. The injuries could not have been caused by falling on a bundle of irons.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I live at 90, Portland Road,. Tidal Basin, and have been employed by Pennell and Son, stevedores. On the night of August 8 and 9 I was ganger on the starboard side of the ship in question. I had three men under me. There is a rule that the hatches are to be kept on their right side. I saw Schubert take the three hatches which were on our side, and requested him to leave them alone, saying, "Who gave you the liberty of taking the hatches?" He made reply that he meant to work easy, he didn't care who worked hard, and defied me to take the hatches. Schubert knows perfectly well that he should not take hatches from one side to the other. I bent down to take the first hatch up, and Schubert stood on the end of it. He said, "You tricky sod, you are always on to me," whereupon he struck out with his hook. I pulled myself back, and he caught me on the shoulder, cutting it. The shirt (pro<lb/>duced) I was wearing then; it is torn and has blood marks. I re<lb/>treated from him, and he came a second time. I could not get away, so held up my hands to protect my face, and received a blow on a finger of the right hand with the hook. I closed with him, and we had a very severe struggle. I got hold of the hook and threw it in the dock wing. I had a hook in my belt which Schubert took out. Then the foreman came down, to whom I said, "Look what he has done to my shoulders and hands." Schubert was not injured with the hook. We resumed our work, and after a few minutes I asked Schubert whether it was the work of an Englishman—a manly thing—to use a hook on me. He said, "What would you do if you could not fight?" He came towards me with my hook, and as I thought he was going to use it I struck him with my fist as hard as I could. I do not think I said I would learn him to use a hook; in fact, I am sure I did not. Prosecutor fell backwards over a cask of cement on to a bundle of irons. (Witness indicated how prosecutor fell.) He then got on his knees and reached for a crowbar which was lying there. I also did so, and we both got hold of it together. I eventually wrenched it from him, and gave it to Fisher. The latter did not rush up and take it from me, nor say, "Jim, have you gone mad?" I never struck Schubert, and had no illwill against him. I have known him about eight years.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210210"/>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am well able to take my own part. I am not champion bantam-weight. I have never fought in public, and I swear that I have never trained a fighter. All I know about fighting is what a minister taught me when I went to his Bible class. That is about 18 years ago. I have had about three fights in the docks; you have to fight for your bread there. The rule as to the hatches is always observed. I never allow otherwise when I am in charge. I have been in charge since I was 18. I noticed blood on Schubert's face after the scuffle. We were pulling like maniacs for the possession of this hook. I did not go to the doctor about my injury; I went home and my wife attended to it. I did not use the expressions which Schubert says. Cordfield did not take my hook away. I did not giggle at Schubert. I was excited and tired alter the scuffle; I was not in a fury. I thought Schubert was going to kill me when he came at me. I only struck him once. The cask of cement would be about 2 1/2 ft. high, or more, and about 2 ft. behind Schubert. The irons were all over the deck; they were about 16 in. wide and about 6 ft. in length. They were lying about two high on the deck. I never struck prosecutor with a crowbar.</p>

Prisoner said, "I want that hatch." and went to take it away. Schubert said, "You cannot have it," and struck him with a hook. Prisoner dropped the hatch and staggered back. He put up his h'and to protect himself from a second blow, and received a cut on the right hand. He then got the hook from Schu<lb/>bert and flung it on the starboard side. After that prisoner said, "Is this a manly action to strike a man with a hook?" I could not catch what prosecutor said. Prisoner then knocked Schubert into the wing. In a few minutes the latter got up and walked up the hold. While on the floor he grabbed for a crowbar, which prisoner got hold of instead, and then Fisher took it from him. I was there all the while. Prisoner did not strike Schubert with the crowbar. I went with the latter to the hospital, and saw an officer at the gate, but there was no conversation with him then.</p>

On the night of September 30 I there saw the cornets and the music. Both belong to the Salvation Army, and are the property of General Booth. I saw the hall shut up that night, and the next day, about one o'clock, I was called by the police. I then found that the hall had been forced open, and missed the cornets and euphonium and the music. The value of the instruments and the music is about £7 15s.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been married to prisoner seven years and have five children; He has always been a good husband to me. He it employed by the North London Railway Company as a carriage cleaner at Richmond, coming home at eight in the morning and sleeping till the afternoon. Latterly he had become jealous of me and accused me of going about with men; from the way he carried on I think he was not in his right senses. A little drink affects his head. On October 4 he came home as usual at eight in the morning; he came down from bed earlier than usual—between 12 and one. In the afternoon he suddenly attacked me, pulling my head up from the back and saying, "I will give you deceiving me; you have always got a pack of men in the house." We struggled; I felt his left arm going across my neck; he had a razor in his hand; I got it away from him. I screamed for help, and Mr. Gill came. Prisoner shouted twice, "Give me that razor." There was no ground for my husband's suspicions of me. I had always lived happily with him; he was one of the best of husbands and fathers.</p>

She had an incision across the throat, another along the right side of the lower jaw and one or two cuts about each hand; the wounds were not very serious.

                  </persName>, house surgeon, Richmond Hospital. On October 4 prisoner was brought into the hospital; he had a wound in the throat and several small cute on the hand. Subsequently Mrs. Bedwell was brought in; she was suffering from shock and had wounds on the right side of the lower jaw and on the throat and hands and fingers. Prisoner remained in the hospital about a fort<lb/>night. On his admission he seemed in a state of great excitement; he spoke about people watching him and following him. On the third day after admission he became very violent and had to be held down. In my opinion, when he was brought in, and for the next few days, he was insane and not responsible for his actions.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, not on oath). Last July I came back from Chatham after doing a week's training. I had a few words with my wife about the condition of the house and other domestic matters; I found some pawntickets in the house, and as my wages were not very large it caused me to worry a great deal. I had been weeks without any proper sleep, being on night duty. I perhaps had a glass or two more to drink than was necessary. With regard to my accusations against my wife, I think it is only a lot of imagination in my mind. I think, if I had seen Dr. Cockerill in time this would never hsve happened.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the "Prince Albert" beerhouse, Hill Rise, Richmond. On Saturday, October 12, prisoners came in about a quarter to five. I identify them. About 5.30 p.m. I went upstairs to have some tea, leaving prisoners in the bar. The room where I had tea has a door with a window in it, through which I can see what goes on in the public bar, but not in the private bar. The till was kept on a shelf under the bar and contained somewhere about 5s. There was a 2s. piece, a 6d. and a quantity of coppers. Whilst I was at tea the younger prisoner got up and went out He was away about two minutes and directly he came back off went the pair of them. Hearing the door of the private bar open and shut I ran downstairs, and shortly afterwards a little boy came in with the till in his hands. In consequence of what the boy told me I ran to the door and saw prisoner Sullivan hurrying down the hill. The boy afterwards fetched a policeman.</p>
               <p>To prisoner Sullivan. There was no one in the house but you and O'Callaghan.</p>

On the afternoon of Saturday, the 12th, I was near the "Prince Albert" public-house and saw the younger prisoner coming down the hill with the till under his arm. He went into Smith's back yard. I did not follow him, but kept my eye on him. He came out without the till. I afterwards got the till, which I found in a tub in Smith's back yard, and went with it into Mr. Brown's public-house. Mr. Brown and I afterwards followed the men down the Hill Rise. When I came out from the back yard I saw the elder prisoner outside the beershop. He was afterwards joined by O'Callaghan, and they walked away together. In consequence of what Mr. Brown said to me I afterwards fetched a policeman.</p>

I followed them, and, Mr. Brows coming up, gave them in charge. I found on Sullivan 4s. 4 1/2 d. is bronze and 1s. 6d. in silver, and on O'Callaghan 5d. in bronze Before they were arrested both prisoners went into a shop and bought some tobacco and cigarette papers.

                  </hi>, clerk to Messrs. Hobson, Richards and Co., auctioneers, 79, Coleman Street. My firm had in 1895 the let<lb/>ting of offices at 43, Moorgate Street. Tyler applied for two offices on the firs: floor. After reference to Messrs. Dore and Sons, Limi<lb/>ted, our principals, Tyler took the offices at £110 per annum, which was paid in the autumn of 1901. I would not say that Tyler himself always' brought it in. At that time I understood Tyler went to South Africa. In September, 1904, we distrained on Tyler. After he went, to South Afrioa, as I understood, the letting still remained in his name, Dacre Tyler, till March, 1905. When he left he said he had left certain things on the premises and we communicated with Harris' st. 80, Lombard Street. On the payment of the rent alter Tyler bad gone away I should see Harris. A man named Adkins, who had a power of attorney for Tyler, paid the rent for a time. After that we got it from whoever we could on the premises. We have fot it from Harris. I do not know Perryman. I have never seen him to my knowledge.</p>

                  </hi>, medical man, practising at 53, Upper Berkeley Street, and 80, Lombard Street. I let part of my premises at 80, Lombard Street, in 1902 to a man named Herbert Smith. I am not prepared to say that the photograph handed to me represents him, but to the best of my knowledge it is his photograph. It is No. 211. I only had one interview with him. Before an agreement was entered into references were asked for by my solicitor. Those two references are 191 and 192; 191 is headed "Kalgoorli Gold Mining Company, Limited, registered offices, 43, Moorgete Street," It is a letter dated July 15, 1902, from C. W. Perrvman to my solicitors, Janson, Cobb and Co.; 192 is headed, "Gold Coast Property Owners, Limited, registered offices, Dashwood House." It is dated July 15, 1902, signed George Harris. After those references, the agreement, 190, was entered into between Herbert Smith and myself for premises at £80 a year. It is signed in the name of Herbert smith, and witnessed by my lawyers. I saw something in a news<lb/>paper. I have now handed, to me document 193, which is headed "80, Lombard Street; to Dr. Henry Seife Bennett," dated May 10, 1905. I have no recollection of getting it. The whole of this busi<lb/>ness was transacted through my lawyers. I received it from my solicitors and gave it to the prosecution. I must have seen it before. I produce that document as coming from Messrs. Janson and Cobb. It is signed George Harris. At that time I was contemplating taking proceedings for the rent, and bed given notice to quit to Herbert Smith, 194. At the bottom is written, "I acknowledge receipt on behalf of personal legal representatives of Mr. Herbert Smith. Signed George Harris." Smiths death is first disclosed in 193, dated May, 1905. The notice was December, 1904. I eventually received my rent. About Midsummer, 1905, the premises reverted to me. There was some difficulty in getting the last quarter's rent I understood</p>

               <p>it was paid from Moorgate Street. I believe during the latter part of the tenancy the place was only re-presented by a young woman, who departed, and it was with the abject of getting my rent that she was followed to Moorgate Street. I did not see her at the police court. I do not think I ever saw her. I do not recognise any one of the defendants. (The Misses Oyler entered the Court.). I do not recognise those young ladies.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Marshall Hall. I had an interview with a man I believed to be Herbert Smith, whose photograph I have re<lb/>cognised. I have certainly seen that face before. I cannot remem<lb/>ber that he told me the purpose for which he required the offices. There are still bankers and stockbrokers in Lombard Street.</p>

                  </hi>, widow of the late Herbert Smith, who lived at 11, Cedars Avenue, Walthamstow. I have lived there for 20 years. My husband was engaged in the tea trade in Mark Lane and had offices there. He became bankrupt about 1888. At two different periods after that he worked for his brother. He became ill in June, 1903, and died on October 22, 1903, in St. Bartholomew's Hospital The last day he went to work for his brother was June 22 or 23. He went to no business after that date; he was too ill. He passed through the City once, about July 7, on his way to the seaside. After<lb/>wards he returned home and then went to St. Bartholomew's Hos<lb/>pital. I have seen Ferryman twice since my husband's death. I believe my husband allowed him to trade under his name. My hus<lb/>band never carried on any business connected with stocks or shares. I saw Perryman at his office, 43, Moorgate Street. On both occasions he requested me to go and see him. I have seen Harris once, after my husband's death. On his death I telegraphed to Perryman, in<lb/>forming him, and received in the evening a letter from Harris enclos<lb/>ing £4 10s. in postal orders on Perryman't behalf. He said Perry<lb/>man was away from town and that they had arranged to send me the money. They knew my husband's death was impending. That was on October 22, 1903. Shortly after Christmas, 1903, I got a notice about some rent, and either wrote to Perryman or sent my son. At Perrvraan's request. I then went to 43, Moorgate Street and saw Harris, I think. I told him who I was and what I came about, and was ushered into Perryman's private office. Before going into the office I noticed a placard on the wall, "Herbert Smith, Stock and Share Dealer" or "Broker," or something of that kind, and five or six other businesses, or callings, underneath. My husband's name way in large letters. I think it was a registered letter I had from the solicitors on Christmas Eve saying would my husband give up the offices in the following June. The letter was addressed to Mr. Herbert Smith. I have not the document here. I saw Perryman in his office. I told him I wished him to take my husband's name out of the business, but he merely condoled with me on my husbands death. Nothing special transpired on that occasion. I merely said would he take my husband's name out, and he said he would. He said he would see to the rent. The premises in respect to which the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210221"/>
               <p>rent was claimed were 43, Moorgate Street I got this letter (pro<lb/>duced) in June, 1904, signed George Harris. That is the only one I have been able to find. I destroyed all the others when the name was taken down from the door. It it from 43, Moorgate Street. With reference to the sentence in it that he would rather tee me before I wrote to the bank, I had had a notice from the London City and Mid<lb/>land Bank. After I got it I wrote to Perryman and then got this letter, dated June 10, 1904. I then wrote letter 229 on June 27, 1904, to Perryman. The enclosure I forwarded was a further commu<lb/>nication about the rent of 43, Moorgate Street. Perryman made an appointment, and I went up to the office. I did not notice whether my husband's name was still up on the premises. I saw Perryman and asked him to take my husband's name out of the business. He said the business was my husbands. I said I was not aware of it, and he said, "Oh, yet, it was, and I have lost a lot of money by it." Then he said, "You being the widow, it really belongs to you." I declined to have anything to do with it, and said I would consult my brothers. He then said, "No, you are not to tell anyone anything that transpires in this office; it it strictly private." Then I said, "Well, take my husband's name out of the business and do not let me be troubled in any way again. Do not ask me to do anything or sign anything, or do anything in the matter." He assured me he would not, that it was finished, and I left him. I said, "Do not let any disgrace or dishonour be attached to my husband's name in any way whatever," and he assured me there should be none. Afterwards I heard the plate was taken down from the door and I thought the matter was settled, but in the following February I received a visit from the representative of Janson and Cobb in reference to 80, Lom<lb/>bard Street. I do not know that at any time my husband was the tenant of that office. (Letter 230 read.) The business was his brother's tea business. Harold was his brother. He is in the tea business still. The photograph shown to me is of my late husband.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Marshall Hall. My husband had two brothers, Percy and Harold, "Vernon" was not another brother; I do not know who he is. I was married about 20 years. My hus<lb/>band told me of some of his business. I believe Harold dealt in stocks and shares, but nothing whatever to do with my husband. I did not know my husband carried on a tea business in partnership with Harold. Harold was originally his servant—he was nine years younger. My husband taught him the basined. From 1888 to 1902 my husband worked his tea business from home, taking orders through the post Then he did some outdoor business for Percy, who is a house agent. I should not think it took my husband a great deal in the city. He used to go out every day and come home about nine. My husband's signature is attached to Exhibit 190, the agree<lb/>ment which Dr. Bennett produced. The date is July 29, 1902. I knew Pern-man had an office at 80, Lombard Street. My husband baa offices from Dr. Bennett, but they were at 43, Moorgate Street. I have got them confused between 80, Lombard Street and 43, Moor-gate</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210222"/>
               <p>Street, perhaps. My husband had one office only. That is all be told me about. My husband did not tell me everything he did. I telegraphed the news of my husband's death to Perryman because he asked me to keep him acquainted with the state of his health. I sent the telegram to 43, Moorgate Street. I knew my husband was in the habit of going there. It is not a fact that nearly all the money that my husband made in the last few months of his life was made by odd jobs that he did in stocks and shares; he knew nothing what<lb/>ever about stock and shares and never dealt in them. It was not £4 15s. 9d. I received, but £4 10s. It was for funeral expenses. I suppose, certainly not for rates of 43, Moorgate Street. I under<lb/>stood it was to help me in my trouble. The rates of my private house were about £6. My husband died on October 22. He was quite incapable of drawing cheque No. 92313 for £4 15s. 9d., as suggested to me. on that date. Matthews, of Matthews, Matthews, and Good-man were his cousins. Their office is at 32, Queen Victoria Street. I do not know anything about his doing business with them. Cowan and Sons, of Queen Victoria Street, were printers. I believe my husband did business with them. My husband passed through the City on June 22; he did not tell me he was going to the City to get money to enable him to go to the seaside He was away from home. He went to stay with a relation. Scarlet fever broke out in the family, anile, therefore, he could not return home, but went to the seaside from there. I did not want to take the fever home to my two children, so I could not see him at all. I believe Perryman gave him some money and told him he looked very ill and had better go to the seaside. I believe he gave him £5 or £2. I do not know exactly the sum. I wrote four years ago to Perryman with regard to taking my husband's name out of the business—Christmas, 1903, and I believe I asked him to do so each time I saw him. In June, 1904, I wrote. "I think it would be better not to trade under my husband's name." That was a mild way of putting it. There had not been an arrangement. I did not know that the business was carried on under my husband's name and that I was to be interested in it. If I could have afforded legal advice I should have taken it and compelled Parkman to take my husband's name down, but I had not the money and therefore I was obliged to let it remain until he chose to do it. I know nothing of Tyler; I never heard the name until I heard of his arrest. Janson and Cobb sent a registered letter to my husband for the rent of 43, Moorgate Street, not knowing he had passed away Perryman took offices in my husband's name at 43, Moorgate Street long before my husband died. My husband allowed him to trade under his name there. I do not think he had a share in the busi<lb/>ness. I think he had very little. Perryman gave him something when he thought he would, and very little it was. I told Perrvman I thought it averaged £I a week. I do not feel very friendly towards Perryman. He tried to ruin me. I have a good deal of ill-feeling towards him now. He tried to ruin me by trying to get me to take over the business. My relations with my husband were not the hap<lb/>piest.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210223"/>
               <p>My husband told me some things he did. He could not keep much to himself. I got it out of kern. He did not complain that his home was very unhappy in consequence. It was poverty that made the home uncomfortable. The detective, Maclean, called on me in reference to this matter. I did not tell the police I felt very bitter against Perry man. I told the officer that he had tried to make me take over the business. I had not the remotest idea of taking it over, and I was very unhappy that he should suggest it to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. J. Wellesley Orr. I only saw Harris once. My husband used to leave home about 8.45 a.m. and return at 9 or 10 p.m.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I did not get any part of the £26,000 that went into Herbert Smith's banking account. I only know that he allowed Perry-man to use his name. My husband said something about 80, Lorm-bard Street, but then he went to 43, Moorgate Street. He said Ferryman had an office at 80, Lombard Street. My husband's name imp not up there, I think. In the letter which enclosed the £4 10s. Harris condoled with me and said that Ferryman was away from town and that it had been arranged, as they knew my husband's death was impending, to tend me that money. Nothing was said about rates nor about a share of the business; it was purely a private matter. My husband was incapable of signing cheques quite six weeks before hit death.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Justice Lawrence. Before my husband went to the seaside he was staying with a relation about a week. Before he went to that relation he had been living at home. He was always pushed for money. He has lost a lot of money. He had £800 from hit father in the tea trade and lost that. Between the time that he lott hit money in the tea trade and the time that he was taken ill he was not in well-to-do circumstances. He was in very bad circumstances.</p>

                  </hi>, house agent, 87, Grosvenor Road, Highbury. The late Herbert Smith was my brother. He failed in 1888, and before he came into my permanent employment I gave him some employ<lb/>ment for a short time. He was in my employment continuously from May, 1902, till he what taken ill in June, 1903. Hit hours were from nine or 10 a.m. till seven or eight p.m. He came every day to my office. He acted at canvassing clerk. I gave him 4s. a day and a commission on business results. He was taken ill on June 22 and never came back to work.

                  </hi>, clerk to Messrs. Dore and Sons, Limited, tailors, 43, Moorgate Street. The upper part of those premises is let in offices. I know the name of Dacre Tyler at being the ostensible tenant of those premises. I could not identify him. I recognize George Harris. I have seen him at those offices. I never remember</p>

               <p>him personally handing rent to me. We received rents through our agents, Hobson. Richards, and Co. I have seen Perryman at the office and have known him by repute as Herbert Smith. He has been pointed out by various people. In 1900 there were some companies' names up—the Raudepoort Gold Mines Company, or Gold Mining Company, and the Hannan King Brownhill Gold Mining Company. About May, 1902, the name on the door was changed to "Herbert Smith, Mining Market Review." There was no description of the business. The companies' names had been taken away. The name of Herbert Smith remained there until the expiration of the tenancy in March, 1905.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. J. Wellesley Orr. I saw Harris in the office fairly often. I have handed him letters. I knew nothing about the firm. Some letters were addressed to Harris. Some were ad<lb/>dressed straight to him, and not c/o the firm.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Marshall Hall. I have had Perryman pointed out to me at various times by different people both as Perry<lb/>num and as Herbert Smith. At the police court I said, "I would not swear to having seen Perryman, but I believe I have." I understood he was Perryman, but he was pointed out to me as Herbert Smith at various times before these criminal proceedings.</p>

                  </hi>, waiter at Pimm's Restaurant, Cheapside. I recog<lb/>nise Perryman and Harris, and have known them by those names. I do not recognise Tyler. I have two nieces named Jessie and Annie Oyler. Some years ago they were out of employment, and I spoke to Perryman about Jessie, It might have been three years ago, and he said he would try to get her employment. Some time later he asked me if she was still out of employment, and when I said "Yes" he told me to send her to a certain address, which he wrote down on piece of paper. I believe it was in Moorgate Street. I do not think I spoke to Perryman after that about Annie. I got employ<lb/>ment for her at the Cellular Underclothing Manufacturing Company. I do not think Annie was ever employed at 80, Lombard Street. In the early part of 1907 Jessie again wanted some employment, and I asked Harris if he knew of an opening, and he said he would see. I approached him again on the matter, and he said he thought be might start her in a few days. I wrote down the address and gave it to my niece. It was Tokenhouse Yard or Buildings, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Marshall Hall. The detective Ottaway has been to see me. He told me the name of Perrvman in the first in<lb/>stance. Before that I called him "Mr. Fatty," of course not to his face. There are hundreds of customers whose names we do not know for years. I identify him as "Mr. Fatty" and as Perryman. He never had a conversation with me on business matters.</p>

                  </hi>, Spitalfields Market, waitress. In 1903 I was seek<lb/>ing employment and spoke to my uncle Dulieu, and after some little time he gave me a slip of paper with an address on it, Herbert Smith, 43, Moorgate Street. I went and saw Harris there, and said I had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210225"/>
               <p>come about the situation, and had been sent there by my uncle. He said, "Step inside." I took of the situation there and then at 10s. a week. I was employed by Harris, who I then took for Herbert Smith. I was employed to address envelopes; nothing else. I sat facing a window with my back towards the door. I got the addresses for the envelopes from lists provided by Harris, I do not remem<lb/>ber whether they were people living in London or the country. Miss Mabel Long was also employed there, and no one else that I can remember. She was in and out all day. There were two rooms in the offices. Miss Long shared one with me when she was there and Harris used the other. No one else used it. I saw no one else there but Harris. People could get into that other room from the corridor without my seeing them. I knew Harris as Herbert Smith, but I heard others call him "George," so I called him George. He answered to that name. I do not remember ever ceiling him Herbert Smith. I remained there about 12 months. My salary was increased up to 12s. a week. Shortly before I left Harris sent me across to 80, Lombard Street, to the Lombard Financial Corporation. I saw Mist Mabel Long there. I did not do any work there and do not know what I went for. I stayed there doing nothing. I may have read a paper or something. I had that arduous duty about a fort<lb/>night or three weeks, and left because I was ill. Alter a rest of two or three years I wanted further employment in March of this year. I left there about the spring of 1904. My sister Annie was looking out for a situation when I first went to 43, Moorgate Street, and she went with me there. She was employed at 80, Lombard Street, and was in the office at the time I was. We were at 80, Lombard Street together. I did nothing and she did nothing. In March, 1907, I went to my uncle Dulieu, and from what he said I went to 2, Token house Buildings and saw Harris and asked for Mr. Tyler. I did not see Tyler then, but shortly afterwards. I told Harris I had come about the situation and he said, "Wait for Mr. Tyler." I saw Tyler and went with him to offices at Pinner's Hall, two offices on the ground floor, an inner and an outer. It is possible to get into the inner office without going through the outer one. I was in sole charge of that office, and addressed envelopes from lists to people in the country, about 200 a day. I left them on the table and do not know what was done with them. My salary at Pinner's Hall was 12s., and my hours 10 till four. Tyler arrived before me in the morning. The letters were attended to before I got there. Tyler was in the office every day, but he would go away. Harris would come there daily, sometimes with Tyler and sometimes alone. I had instructions from Tyler that if anyone came for him and he was in I was to tell them he was out, which I did. People did not come very often. Tyler was seen by clients sometimes. I do not remember any of their names. Tyler would tell me to admit some people, giving me their names. The name on the office was "William Tyler and Co." There were no books in the office. There was not a letter book. There was a copying press, but I never saw a single letter</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210226"/>
               <p>copied in the place. I was there about two months. Then I asked for more wages and Tyler said he could not give them to me. Harris said, "Would you care to come with me if I gave you more?" and I said, "Yes," and went with him to 2, Tokenhouse Buildings, re<lb/>ceiving 15s. a week for addressing envelopes from lists provided by Harris to people in the country. There was an inner and an outer room in those offices, and one could get into the inner room without going through the outer one. The names up were, "The Financial Guardian" and "Raudepoort Gold Mining Co." I do not know who "The Financial Guardian" was. If anyone called about it Harris would see them. He went by the name of Harris. There was an<lb/>other young lady in the office, Miss Long, and one day a gentleman came in dressed up at though ill, and she said that was Herbert Smith. Then I asked, "Who is George?" and she told me. No one Asked for anyone by name at the "Financial Guardian." They asked if anybody was in who had to do with "The Financial Guar<lb/>dian." Miss Long and I were there together about three weeks, and then she left, and I have not seen her since. I do not know her hand-writing. I do not remember anybody asking for anyone but Harris. Harris used to use the letter books. Tyler used to come daily and stay half an hour or an hour, and longer sometimes. He came with Harris. Ferryman used to come there and ask for Harris, and if he was in he would go into him. If not he used to go outside and wait. People could go into the inner office without my seeing them. Perry-man only came now and again. I saw no circulars whatever at 2, Tokenhouse Buildings, and I did not put any circulars into envelopes there. At Pinner's Hall I did. I never opened one to see the name. Tyler gave me the circulars to put into envelopes. They were already folded. I never heard the name of H.K. Ablett at 2, Tokenhouse Buildings. I have heard the name of George Martin. Somebody came and asked for George Martin. Harris was in the office at the time and he saw him. I referred him to Harris, saying I knew nothing about it, and Harris saw him. I never heard the name of J. Wood at 2, Tokenhouse Buildings. I never saw circulars at 80, Lombard Street. I never saw any gentlemen there at all, nor did I ever hear the name of Fraser. I saw no man employed there. I was still employed at the time of the arrest at the beginning of June this year.</p>

                  </hi>, 117, Commercial Road. In 1903 I was engaged by Harris at 43, Moorgate Street as clerk at 8s. a week, my duties being at 80, Lombard Street. I was there about 12 months, from nine a.m. to four or five p.m., and occasionally took the letters to 43, Moorgate Street, Mabel Long generally taking them. There were sometimes callers seen by Long. I do not know what was said. If she was not there and anyone knocked I did not answer the door. I never saw Fraser nor heard his name mentioned. Harris came once or twice and saw Long. I never hoard what he said. There were</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210227"/>
               <p>ledgers at Lombard Street, but I never looked at them. I and my titter were paid at 80, Lombard Street. (The Judge stated that the witness manifested hostility.) I made a statement to Ottaway. I said that Long brought my wages from 43, Moorgate Street—Miss Long told me to. I Have no recollection of laying that upon the door of one office was painted, "Mr. Fraser. Private." I never mentioned Fraser's name. I did not say that no books were kept there. I did not say that several persons called and complained of not receiving money due to them and that I told them Mr. Prater was out. I did not look to see how the letters were addressed. I did not tell the police inspector they were addressed to Fraser, of the London and Financial Corporation.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Marshall Hall. Ottaway asked me some questions and wrote something down, which he read over to me. He did not ask me to sign it I did not say that people complained of not receiving money. I have told you everything I know.</p>

                  </hi>, 2, Tokenhouse Buildings, auctioneer. On February 24, 1903, I let offices in 2, Tokenhouse Buildings to James Wilkes Hawkes at £75 a year under agreement (produced), witnessed by George Harris. I received the rent sometimes by cheque and sometimes by cash, very often from Harris. The name put up was the Rand Roodeport Company. I saw Hawkes at the police-court In taking the offices he referred to Perryman. Ferryman said he thought Hawkes would make a good tenant, and, at far as the rent was concerned, that would be all right, he (Perryman) would pay it Cheque (produced) for £56 5s. of January 16, 1906, payable to me, is signed "C.W. Perryman"; that is for three quarters' rent to Christ<lb/>mas, 1906. Receipt to J.W. Hawkes is my handwriting. On March 20, 1906, I wrote to Perryman for the rent to 2, Tokenhouse Buildings, and also to his private address. I wrote again on March 29 and April 20. I received cheque of March 24 for £18 15s., signed "C.W. Perryman." At Christmas, 1906, I lei another room to Perryman. £80 was the proper rent, but I let it to him for £40 temporarily, he to do all repairs and give it up at a week's notice. I produce cheques of February, 1907, for £10 and April 10 £10 rent for that room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Marshall Hall. Hawkes is a real person. Perryman had an office from me some years before at 4, Tokenhouse Buildings, and, not knowing Hawkes, Perryman promised that he would see the rent paid—I do not say that he guaranteed it, or that I had a legal claim against him.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I have known Perryman about ten years—I had not seen Hawkes before I let the premises to him. I think Hawkes made some payment in cash.</p>

                  </hi>, 79 £, Gracechurch Street, solicitor. I have known Tyler more than 15 years. On June 25, 1906, he and Perry-man saw me about an office which my firm had to let. I had also tome office furniture. They agreed to take the office at £40 for the remainder of the year, and to take the furniture for £10. They</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210228"/>
               <p>took possession and then, owing to a difficulty with the landlord as to under letting, the offices were given up. On October 24. 1906, Ferryman wrote from 2, Tokenhouse Buildings, stating, "You will see that the office affair has been settled up long ago. You asked Mr. Tyler to terminate his tenancy, which he did, releasing my guarantee." I wrote to Tyler, on July 16, "I think that you might get Mr. P. (Perryman) to pay up to £5—that was for the furniture.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Marshall Hall. The tenant to whom I had let my offices had the brokers in. Perryman instructed me to settle Memorandum of Articles of a company for which I sent a bill of costs and which he declined to pay. A small sum was subsequently paid. Tyler was very angry at having to give up the offices, and offered to lose £2—the money agreed for the furniture.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Smith. I had had business relations with Tyler for nearly 20 years, and in his absence for six years in South Africa I held his Power of Attorney and received moneys on his account. I have attended to many legal matters for him.</p>

                  </hi>, at present living at Portland Mansion, Clap<lb/>ham, and an actress. About the middle of April I was introduced to the firm of Tyler and Co. by a friend, and acted as lady clerk to them in April Rind May. I had bad office experience. I was engaged by Mr. Tyler at a salary of 12s. a week. I was to do typewriting and attend to the office generally, and the office hours were to be from half-past ten to half past four or five. For about a fortnight I was the only lady clerk, and then a Miss Ruby Reece came. I typed letters and addressed a lot of envelopes and circulars, arranged them and got things in order a bit. All these things had to be straightened out and that took nearly a day. The letters were dictated to me by Mr. Tyler. The number of circulars I dealt with might have been anything between 300 and 500. After I had done the envelopes</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210229"/>
               <p>they were repacked in boxes. I saw some printed circulars like those (produced) on the table and deck in the office. I did not see any-thing done with them. I did not notice that different persons who came into the office took them off the counter. Sometimes Tyler was there before I was. My instructions were to take the names of callers if they would give them and any message. On one occasion I recollect that I said Mr. Tyler was not in when he was in. That was because the caller had refused to give his name. Tyler did not re<lb/>main in the office all day; he came in and went out. I did not keep say books of account nor did I see any. There was no pries copy letter-book, but there was a copying press. So far as I know it was never used. I have seen prisoner Harris at the office. I think be only came about twice, not many times, I know. I was there altogether four or five weeks, and only remember seeing him two or three times at the outside. Only on one occasion he gave instructions about letters he wanted typed. During the absence of Tyler, at the request of Harris I paid cheques into the bank. Harris asked me to endorse the cheques. I recog<lb/>nise the list produced as one from which I got the names and ad<lb/>dresses. I did not notice at the time that they were mostly people living out of London, but I see now that it is so. The list is called the "London and Provincial Investors' Register." Several names are struck out, and against these are the initials "G.A." (Gone away.)</p>
               <p>To Mr. Marshall Hall. I said before the magistrate: "I do not know Pernyman." I do not know him.</p>
               <p>To Mr. F.E. Smith. Tyler came to the office every day with one exception. The letters I wrote were mostly written in longhand and I copied them. A few boxes of the addressed envelopes were taken away by Mr. Tyler. The others remained in the office. I have scratched out one or two of the names where the letters have been returned.</p>

He became the occupier of them in September, 1906, at £120 a year. The name up was Gibbs and Tyler, or Tyler and Gibbs, I forget which, and there were two names on the first floor windows, I forget what they were now; they were the names of companies. The £30 rent for the Christmas quarter of 1906 was paid by cheque drawn by "C.W. Perryman" on the London City and Midland Bank, Victoria Street. It is endorsed "W.H. Tyler." Since the arrest of Tyler at the end of May Perryman has called at the office to inquire if there were any letters for him. I referred him to the housekeeper, who always sorted the letters and gave them to the various tenants.</p>

               <p>you will accept for prompt cash." I replied asking the price that Gibbs and Tyler offered, and, in reply to a telephone message, said that Lord Kilmorey would sell a founders' share for £50 net cash. I prepared to transfer from Lord Kilmorey to Gibbs and Tyler and sent the transfer with the certificate by Miss Cecil to Gibbs and Tyler's office with instructions not to leave the transfer unless she got the money. She brought back 10 £5 notes. Some of the notes were produced at the police court.</p>

                  </hi>, Messrs. Pope and Westlake, stockbrokers, George Street, Bath. In May, 1907, we were desirous of purchasing a founders' share in Fullers Earth Union, Limited, for a client. On April 23 we received a letter from Perryman offering to sell a founders' share at £125 net. We replied offering £70, and Perry-man wrote back that he would take £90, to which price we even<lb/>tually agreed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Marshall Hall. We circularised a great many people in respect of these shares. Perryman's name was on the list of original holders. When we sent out the circular the dividend had not been declared, and we anticipated a very great rise in value It was a good gamble. We were willing to give £85 or £90 for a share; and if Perryman could have got a share for £50 and sold it for £90 that would have given him a good profit, the ordinary idea of good business being to buy cheap and sell dear.</p>

                  </hi>, manager of the London and Provincial Investors' Register, 13, Finsbury Street. It is a part of our business to supply lists of probable investors in town and country. They are mainly made up by searching the shareholders register at Somerset House, who are classified according to their addresses and the charac<lb/>ter of their securities. I know Tyler and Harris. Harris was ap<lb/>parently acting manager and confidential clerk of the "Financial Guardian." Besides supplying lists I did some business for him in the way of printing and folding, addressing and stamping circulars I was always paid in cash, com, or notes. I have been doing work of this kind for the "Financial Guardian" for about 18 months, the amount of money received being £159 16s. 4d. It was either in the name of George Harris or the "Financial Guardian." Harris never pretended to be the principal. I have known Tyler a year this month. Harris introduced him as a friend in a line of business similar to his own. What Harris was it is difficult to say. We get a lot of cus<lb/>tomer from that particular style of business which deals in shares, outside stockbrokers' business, and they all vary in detail. Harris's business was apparently that of dealing in shares, judging from the circulars printed. I also did work for Tyler—printing, addressing, folding, enclosing, stamping. Including stamps, the work done amounted to £389 18s. 3d. We sometimes had envelopes ready directed from Tyler and Co., small parcels, but not large numbers. We did not supply him with lists of shareholders. In April of this</p>

                  </hi>, manager of the Argus Printing Company, Temple Avenue, Tudor Street. I know defendants. I got to know Perry man about eight years ago, and the company has been doing printing for him since that time. He was then connected with the "Mining Herald, in old Jewry, which we printed. Harris was the "second" (clerk) in the "Herald" office. Perryman paid the ac<lb/>count by cheques. Afterwards Perryman was to be found at Herbert Smith's in Moorgate Street. I also saw Harris there. The photograph produced is not the Herbert Smith I was introduced to. He was dark, about 27 years of age, and had a black moustache. This would be about 1902. I was introduced to Herbert Smith by Perryman. I printed circulars for Smith. We did not set up the type. The formes were sent and we only did the machining. We had the formes from Bleach, printer, of Sumner Street. Harris gave orders as to how many to print, and the accounts were paid by cheques drawn by Herbert Smith, until the guarantee by Perryman in Sep<lb/>tember, 1904. I asked Perryman for the guarantee because we were not getting paid. The original was handed to Messrs. Lewis and Lewis. I had nothing to do with it after I had passed it into my directors' hands. After the guarantee Perryman always paid—by cheque. In all £931 4s. was debited to Herbert Smith. We also did printing for Messrs. Chalmers and Cox, for which Harris gave the orders. We had £55 from Cox. Chalmers and Cox were introduced by Perryman. I should not have given them credit otherwise. If they had not paid I should have looked to Perryman. We also did printing for A.W. Fraser, of Lombard Street. Fraser used to pay by cheque. In all the account was £376 9s. 6d., and in this case also Harris used to bring the orders. I never had conversation with Perryman about Lombard Street and Fraser. The printing was of the same character—circulars; but I never read them. We did not do any printing for "The Financial Guardian." We did printing for Tyler and Co. to their order. Tyler was introduced, I think, in 1905. His account was £304 4s. I had no conversation with Perry<lb/>man about Tyler and Co. The delivery note produced shows that in March of this year I was directed to deliver some circulars of Tyler's to "The Financial Guardian." The cheques produced from August, 1905, to August, 1906, are drawn to my company by Perryman. Mr. Perryman's guarantee did not become operative until January, 1905. The company afterwards brought an action against Perryman, Messrs. Lewis and Lewis acting for them. Judgment was signed, and Perry<lb/>man was served with a notice in bankruptcy at the suit of the Argus Printing Company for £351 14s. 9d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Marshall Hall. Perryman introduced a very large number of customers, and the accounts had been duly paid, but in September of 1904 there was money due from Herbert Smith which I could not get. I then went to Perryman and told him I had got into trouble with my board of directors for giving credit to Smith,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210232"/>
               <p>and I that my board objected to giving credit on any printing orders over a certain amount, and it was then that Perrynian gave me this so-called guarantee: "My dear Paikinson,—I am sorry to learn there is a balance due your firm on the three accounts introduced to you, and I will make it my business to see that they are stirred up to settle. In any event, you need not worry that the accounts will not he eventually promptly settled, because I will myself be answer<lb/>able for them, and if they are not paid before the end of the year I will pay them myself." Therefore the obligation with regard to pay<lb/>ment did not arise until the beginning of 1905. I do not know that an action was brought against Perryman and judgment obtained and that a bankruptcy petition was subsequently heard and dismissed, the allegation being that Mr. Perryman was trading as Herbert Smith. I do not know that in the bankruptcy proceedings the company recovered nothing as against Mr. Perryman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Leycester. I understood that the business at Moorgate Street was managed by Herbert Smith and that he had some money in it. He introduced three accounts to me—Chalmers and Cox, Fraser, and Herbert Smith.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I received from Herbert Smith £931 4s. 7d. in all. Perryman introduced about six accounts to me.</p>

                  </hi>, 43, Broke Road, Daltton, printer. I have known Perryman and Harris for about 17 years in connection with the "Financial Observer," of which I did the printing for about 18 months, getting the copy at a rule from a lady clerk at the office at Jewry Chambers. The money was usually left out for me. I have seen Perryman there, but I looked to Harris for the money. I met Tyler at the office of the Rand Roodepoort Company, 43, Moorgate Street. I used to work for the company. The name of Herbert Smith what afterwards put up at 43, Moorgate Street. I have seen Perryman and Hawke a there occasionally. I have printed circulars, for Herbert Smith, the copy being handed me by Harris or a lady clerk. Perryman approached me in 1905 about starting another paper called the "Financial Guardian" and asked me if I would print it and take an office for it, which I did at 27, Sun Street. I got the type on the hire system. Perryman paid me the rent of the office and the type. The paper was only set up twice—it was never printed or issued. The manuscript consisted of cuttings from the financial papers, which I received from Harriet or a lady clerk. Cir<lb/>culars</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210233"/>
               <p>(produced) in the name of H.K. Ablett and George Martin were printed by me at Sun Street in quantities of 2,000 to 4,000. I delivered them to 2, Tokenhouse Buildings, and received payment from Harris or a lady clerk generally in cash. I think Harris ap<lb/>proached me first and asked if I would put up the name of Herbert Smith at Sun Street and take in letters. This was in February, 1905. I asked Perryman if I should do so, and he said, "Yes." The name was put up, and I received letters and took them to 2, Tokenhouse Buildings. If callers came I was to tell them Smith was away, which I did. Bundle of circulars (produced) of the London Financial Cor<lb/>poration, 80, Lombard Street, were printed by me. I received in<lb/>structions at 43, Moorgate Street, from Harris or a lady clerk, or from Perryman. Bundle of circulars of Chalmers and, Cox, 2, Token-house Buildings (produced), were printed by me, on the instructions of Harris, Hawkes, and, I believe, Perry man, at 43, Moorgate Street I have known Hawkes for 10 or 12 years, when he was on the "Finan<lb/>cial Observer." I took him for one of the firm at 43, Moorgate Street; 115 cheques (produced) are all drawn by Perryman to me between November, 1891, and October, 1906. In November. 1906, I was subpœnaed to give evidence in a case. against H.K. Ablett. I saw Perryman about the Court. I told him that I was subpœnaed. I do not recollect what he said, but he mentioned to me that I was not to say that he was H.K. Ablett.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Marshall Hall. As I had seen Ablett I should think there was no necessity for anybody to say that Perry<lb/>man was not Ablett. I think the photograph (Exhibit 211) is like Herbert Smith, whom I have seen once or twice. In March, 1905, I moved a quantity of account books and old financial newspapers, amounting to about a ton weight, and sold them as waste paper. I may have got cheques from Herbert Smith for work done at 43, Moor<lb/>gate Street. The bundle of 115 cheques handed to me contains a number payable to my father and brother, who both worked for Perry<lb/>man. I believe Perryman has paid me in respect of work done on Chalmers and Cox circulars—I cannot swear to any circular. I have, often got changed poet-dated cheques for Perryman, which were made payable to me, and handed him the money. He has also on several occasions lent me money by cheque.</p>

Hawkes and Tyler frequently called at the office. From July. 1902, to June, 1905, I lived at Closely Mansions, Cray's Inn Road. I have frequently visited the offices of Herbert Smith, 43, Moorgate Street. I have seen Smith there, and knew him formerly. I have also visited 2, Tokenhouse Buildings, and seen Harris and Perryman there. I told Perryman that I was looking for lodgers, and he asked me if I would take in any letters or parcels for H.K. Ablett. I agreed to do so.</p>

(Witness produced copy of the account opened in the name of Henry Keith Ablett, showing total credits £212 10s.) I have the signature book, which shows "H.K. Ablett" as the form of signature. I could not say that the signature "H. Smith" in Exhibit 228a is in the same writing. (Tracing of signatures in the accounts of the London Trad<lb/>ing Bank were put to witness.) I should say the signature "H.K. Ablett" here was the same as in our book. (Copy of account of Alex, Robert Fraser was proved by witness, containing a number of pay<lb/>ments to "Parkinson, Argus," a great number to Harris, and one to Martin on October 31, £110; on to Long on October 7, £50. (Signature of "A.R. Fraser" in signature book was identified by witness, who said that some lithographed signatures on some cir<lb/>culars were apparently the same.) I prepared a portion of the par<lb/>ticulars of payments out from the account from the books of the bank, which is correct.</p>

                  </hi>, clerk to the Middlesex Banking Company. 89, Leadenhall Street, produced a certified copy from the bank books of the account of George Martin. He identified George Martin as prisoner Harris. The account was opened on April 9, 1906, and last operated on on May 17, 1907. Martin's address was 2, Tokenhouse Buildings. The account showed cheques drawn to Perryman £15 12s. 6d. and £15 10s. on August 31, 1906; also cheques to Bleach in December, 1906. There was a cheque of Mr. Lever £10, April 23, 1906, paid into the account. There was also an account kept at his bank in the name of W. Tyler and Co., Pinner's Hall, opened on October 15, 1906. (Witness produced certified copy of the account, showing numbers of notes, where cheques were cashed over the counter, drawn by W. Tylet and Co., also the details of pay<lb/>ments into gold, etc.) The account was last operated on on May 27, 1907, the date on which Tyler was arrested. The balance £33 was taken by the bank for charges. There were a great many cheques drawn on the account which were cashed into notes or gold. Cheques from Mrs. Pittet £15, and Mr. Read £100, were paid into the ac<lb/>count on October 24, 1906, and April 16 respectively; also a cheque for £50 drawn by Read on April 22. Defendant Tyler was the per<lb/>son who had that account.</p>

                  </persName>, White House, East Thorpe, Kelve<lb/>don, Essex. In January this year I got a circular like the one pro<lb/>duced, which I read through, and believed the statements therein. I sent £5 in response, I think. I received letter (produced) from Wil<lb/>liam</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210236"/>
               <p>Tyler and Co., acknowledging £5 as deposit on the purchase of five Rio Tin to shares, and enclosing contract for same. The con<lb/>tract was: "We sell you on our usual terms five Rio Tin to shares at 93 1/4. I received the letter of February 5 from William Tyler and Co., saying that owing to a set-back in the market yesterday the cover became exhausted, and that it would be necessary to send another £5 to make 2 per cent, cover, etc. I next had a letter saying they had had no reply from me, and presuming I did not wish to continue the shares, enclosing contract. I replied, saying that I did not feel I could risk another £5, etc. I then received another letter from them advising me to send further money for the purpose of a fresh speculation. I sent them £10 more, which they acknowledged as being £5 on 2 percent, cover on purchase of Brighton "A's," and £5 deposit on Rio Tintos, also sending contracts at the day's prices. On February 21 I received another letter saying that, regarding Brighton "As my cover had been exhausted, and presuming I wished to continue had debited the Rio Tinto's, which had risen, with the £5 necessary to continue. I am not sure what I replied to that, but I got a further letter as follows: "With regard to Rio Tintos which you have opened, we shall be glad if you will let us know whether you will leave the closing in our hands. If you decide to leave it to us you might rely upon us doing he best for you in the matter." My answer was: "I will leave the closing in your hands; hoping you will do full justice to me. You do not mention the Brighton 'A.' Is it quite gone?" Further correspondence took place, in the course of which they asked for £4 7s. 6d. in order to keep my interest going. I replied, "I am unable to forward another sum of £4 7s. 6d. at pre<lb/>sent. Would it be possible therefore to retain the Rio Tintos even if I forego the Brighton 'A,' or must I close up both accounts?" The account (produced) I received from Tyler and Co., showing a balance in my favour of 12s. 6d. I had not heard about contango before that account; I do not know what it arena. They wrote me again saying that unless I was prepared to pay the difference due they would have to close; and I wrote telling them to do so. They acknowledged, and said they had closed my account; afterwards send<lb/>ing me their account, giving the purchases and prices, and showing amount necessary to balance £41 5s. I sent them £3 as instalment, saying I would send another £9 in a few days. On March 25 I had another letter from them asking for a further remittance as they had a heavy account to deal with. The acknowledgments (produced) are from Tyler and Co. for £3 15s., for 30s., March 28. and £20 on April 9, making the amount paid up £25 5s. I think that was the last I sent I got another letter on May 29 asking for more, but that is all I could manage. Some little time later I saw something in the news<lb/>papers, and did not think it wise to send more. I remember getting a circular (produced) from the "Financial Guardian" last year, in consequence of which I sent £5 deposit on the purchase of five Rio Tintos, which was acknowledged the letter (produced). I never got anything back from the "Financial Guardian." When I got the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210237"/>
               <p>circulars from William Tyler and Co. I had not any knowledge of what they were, but I thought it was a proper place; that they would do what they professed to do. I had no idea they were connected with the "Financial Guardian."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. F.E. Smith. I had had no other expe<lb/>rience on the Stock Exchange. I read the whole of the circular of October 13 through, and I thought I was actually buying the shares I thought I was getting the value of them for my £5, and thought I was buying five shares at a value of about 98; but I suppose I was making a mistake. I did not ask at any time what the actual value was. I thought I understood the circular, but evidently I did not. It said something about the shares rising and failing. I knew when I sent the money that my liability was to be limited to the £1 per share deposit. I think I pencilled notes of my replies to letters, without actually keeping copies. (Mr. F.E. Smith put several letters to wit<lb/>ness with a view to showing that she was wrong in her dates, and varied her notes in the actual letters sent.) I was willing that the loss on the Brighton "A" should be covered by the rise in the Tintos. When Tyler and Co. asked me to leave the matter to their discretion I suppose I understood that I was taking the chance of whether the shares rose or fell. I was willing at that time to leave it to their dis<lb/>cretion, and to go beyond the original risk—I believe so. I knew that if I had not varied the original arrangement there would have been no more money due.</p>

                  </persName>, Frederica Road, Chingford, widow, said she had received a circular on October 24 from William Tyler and Co. She had never bought any stocks or shares before, but on reading the circular, which she thought she understood, she deter<lb/>mined to send some money for some Rio Tinto shares, and sent cheque for £15. Later on witness received a letter (October 29) ad<lb/>visinga her to increase her interest as the shares were almost sure to improve, etc., but she did not send any more money. A further cir<lb/>cular was sent her, dated November 7, in which the United States Steel Corporation was mentioned, and setting forth the great advan<lb/>tages of securing an interest therein. Witness read this through, but told them they must settle the account for the Rio Tintos before she sent more money. She wrote on January 7 this year requesting a settlement, but got nothing. In consequence of what witness saw in the newspapers she wrote closing the stock, but got no answer. About a fortnight later she wrote again, having obtained advice, and told them they (Tyler and Co.) were only a bucket shop and did no business. No reply was obtained. I had no other communication with Tyler and Co. I have had back no part of my £15. I con<lb/>sulted a friend, a Mr. Thomas Clay, with reference to this matter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. F.E. Smith. I had had no previous deal<lb/>ings in stocks. Some shares have been taken for me by friends. I knew of the transactions, but I understand, being a foreigner, that shares are a different thing from stock. I have had dealings in Industrial shares. When I was in Croydon I took shares in a com<lb/>pany,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210238"/>
               <p>Williams and Wilcocks. I have not indulged in a little specu<lb/>lation from time to time. I did invest in Meters, Limited. That is what you rail Industrial shares. I arranged that for myself. I knew by this time how to do it. When I first started I did not know Williams and Wilcocks was earlier in date than my investment with Tyler. What I mean is that I do not understand about stock on the Stock Exchange; shares are a very different thing. When I received the circulars from Tylers I did not know it was a "bucket" shop, or I should not have sent the money. With shares I know you get your dividend quarterly or half yearly, or yearly, but with the Exchange it is a very different matter, and I understand that dealing with a "bucket" shop is a very risky thing. I knew that on the Stock Ex<lb/>change you get your money very soon, but I do not think I knew that if I dealt with a firm that was not on the Stock Exchange that was a "bucket" shop. When I entered into this deal with Tyler I did not think I was making an investment in Industrial shares. I knew it was a speculation in differences. I looked at the prospectus, which tells you it is perfectly safe and you never lose anything.</p>
               <p>Mr. F.E. Smith. But, you remember, the statement about not losing anything is qualified by the words, "should the quotation re<lb/>main the same." You took it with a grain of salt, did not you, with your experience.</p>
               <p>Witness. I knew I should not keep the holding long. I know, of course, that £1 would not buy a £97 share, and I knew I was having, a deal in differences which might turn out well or might turn out badly; at the same time, I saw on the papers it was very likely to be a good thing. I thought from the prospectus it would turn out well. I would not, of course, have given any money for nothing. Assuming that I would be paid. I was perfectly prepared to have a gamble. I suppose that would be the object everybody bets on the Stock Exchange. I did not think I was only gambling in differences be<lb/>cause I was to have a dividend on my money as well. I supposed that stock dealers would have the stock if they wanted to sell it. If they were going to pay a dividend they must have it. I understood from the circular that "should the quotation remain the same". I should make this profit, and that if, on the other hand, the quotation fell I was exposed to risk. As to whether I understood the prin<lb/>ciple on which this speculation was based, I understood that as soon as the dividend was paid I would claim it, and I knew it was only a few days before I could claim it. I expected Tylers to settle when it would be paid; they did not do anything at all.</p>
               <p>Re examined. I considered I was entitled to the dividend and to the additional profit of the rise on the strength of the following pas<lb/>sage in the circular: "Investors will see that by buying at once they are making an absolute certainty, should the quotation remain the same, to receive a dividend two and a half times as much as their deposit. More than the amount of the dividend will in all pro<lb/>bability be gained by an investment now, for every advance in the quotation makes a further profit for the buyer, who is at the same</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210239"/>
               <p>time protected from any loss or liability over the original deposit of £1 per share." I wrote to close the transaction when a profit was shown and could get no answer.</p>

                  </hi>, Bank House, Chingford. The last witness spoke to me about Tyler and Co., and in the beginning of 1907 I called on them at Pinner's Hall a good many times. Twice when I went there was somebody there; at other times the place was locked. I usually went about half past five. Afterwards went between two and three, and found a young lady, whom I took to be a typist. I tried several times to find Tyler. There was no sign of business, no books, or papers. I afterwards wrote to him about Mrs. Pittet's business, and received a reply, dated February 25, to the effect that the matter would be looked into. I wrote again on March 4 and got this answer. "We are in receipt of your favour of yesterday's date, and in reply beg to say we have looked into Mrs. Pittet's account and find we had 15 Rio Tinto shares open for her, which were closed last November as per instructions, when they were quoted ex div. We also note that we have not settled with her, but apparently the matter has been overlooked. We will make up the account and forward it to her next pay day." That was the last I heard from Wm. Tyler and Co.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Chestnuts, Footstone, with my husband. I received a circular, dated February 14, 1906, headed "Canadian Pacific Bonus," and dealing with an issue of Canadian Pacific shares. Believing the statements in the circular, I filled in an application form, enclosed a cheque for £150, being at the rate of 3 per cent, on £5,000 nominal stock, and sent it to the "Financial Guardian." The circular was signed "H.K. Alblett," and in due course I received a contract note. Correspondence followed. I was under the impression that after the stock was ex div. my account was still in credit. On April 26 I went to Tokenhouse Buildings, where I saw a person I now recognise as the prisoner Harris. I asked, if Mr. Ablett was in. He said "No, he is out of town." I asked when he would be in, and Harris replied that ha would be back on Monday, it being then Thursday. I said I did not know whether I should call again, and I came away. I gave him my name. I do not recollect that he asked any other question. The same day I consulted my solicitor, Mr. Hall. I never got back any part of the £150. A writ was issued, but Mr. Ablett was said to be in Paris, and Mr. Hall did not think it worth while to continue the action.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Leycester. I had had no experience of Stock Exchange transactions. I have never invested money. I know that when people invest money they get certificates for their shares or bonds. I understood these shares ware held on the cover system, 3 per cent cover being deposited. If the shares had dropped in value more than 3 per cent. I should, of course, have lost my money.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210240"/>
               <p>but they did not drop. As to the bonus, I suppose these people had information. I did not know whether it was secret or not. I thought I was to have the bonus. I thought on the circular I was entitled to it. I thought I was to have both the dividend and the bonus. I never considered whether those payments would affect the price of the shares. I did not at the time know when the dividend was due, but I thought it would be paid soon. The circular is very misleading. I thought the bonus was a thing that was paid every year. As to whether I thought there was a possibility of my losing my money, I am afraid I did not understand very much about it then.</p>

                  </hi>. Examined by Mr. Bodkin. I am a solicitor, a member of the firm of Cooper, Walker, and Hall, 7, Birchin Line. Towards the end of April. 1906, I was consulted by Mrs. Butcher in reference to the "Financial Guardian," and on her instructions wrote a letter to Ablett (Exhibit 73). The next day I got Exhibit 74 in reply. I wrote another letter, stating that the cover had pot run of as they had said. Before writing that letter I had carefully looked through the official list with regard to Canadian Pacific stock. In answer to that I got Exhibit 76. I wrote another letter offering to take up the stock less the amounts paid or take £150 in settlement I got no reply and commenced an action against Ablett, claiming the return of £150, or, in the alternative, £150 damages for breach of contract. I was not able to effect service, and an order was made for substituted service, and I sent a writ with a copy of the order by post to Ablett. In reply I got a letter signed "George Martin," initialed "J.R.," stating Ablett had nothing to do with the business and had gone abroad without leaving his address. (Exhibit 81.) The documents were returned. After that I advised my client not to waste any more money over it, and the action was abandoned alto<lb/>gether. I have not received any part of the £150.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Wellesley Orr. When Mrs. Butcher con<lb/>sulted me she brought me a circular. I saw it was the usual cover transaction. I think my information that the cover had not run off came from the daily paper. I know the daily paper only gives the closing quotations. A different price might have ruled in the middle of the day. I did not take in the "Financial News" and I did not have a tape, and consequently I looked at the "Daily Telegraph" to verify what Mrs. Butcher told me. I called at Abletts office twice and found the typewriter girl there. I could get nothing out of her, and. therefore, I wrote. The second time I called she said, "It will be all right; Mr. Ablett will attend to it." She did not seem to understand much about it and treated me in an offhand way. The claim for "breach of contract" was a formal thing. In issuing Mayor's Court summonses we have to comply with the usual regula<lb/>tions.</p>

                  </hi>, Elmcroft, Bedfont, no occupation. In April this year I received circulars 16 and 17 from W. Tyler and Co., pointing out the advantages of buying at once shares in Rio Tinto. I deter<lb/>mined to buy 100 shares and sent a cheque for £100 to Tyler and Co., filling up the yellow application form as directed. That cheque has been paid by my bankers. In reply I got letter No. 18, and a volume giving the history of the Rio Tinto Mine. I also got the contract for the sale of the 100 shares. (Exhibit 19.) I was an invalid and did not read the terms of business on the back. I posted the letter, enclosing the cheque, before the last post for London, which goes out between seven and eight. I had crossed the cheque. I got a letter from Tyler and Co., dated April 18 (Exhibit 21), and determined to buy 400 more Rio Tinto shares. On April 20 I for<lb/>warded two cheques to W. Tyler and Co., one for. £50, which I crossed, and another for £350, which was uncrossed. Both have been paid by my bankers. I got back Exhibit 23, dated April 22, and on the 24th or 25th I got Exhibit 24, which is dated April 24, which latter refers to the fact that my letter enclosing the two cheques did not reach them till the Monday morning. I received a contract for the Rio Tinto shares, dated April 23, selling to me 400 Rio Tintos at 92 3/4 cum. dividend for the end April account. On the back there are some conditions printed, but I did not read them. It is very unusual for any contract note sent by a broker to bear any conditions at all. I watched the quotations in the financial papers and then wrote to Tyler and Co. I said I considered Rio Tintos were rising up to the time that the dividend was payable. I noticed that from the tape quotations. I received Exhibit 28, stating the cover had run off on the 24th. I received no other letters from Tyler and Co. I came up to London on April 29 with the intention of going to Tyler and Co.'s, but went somewhere else, and, in consequence of what I heard there, instead of going to Tyler's I went to my soli<lb/>citor's and afterwards to the Guildhall Police Court. At the time I received their circular I believed Tyler and Co. to be dealers in Stock Exchange securities, but not that they were members of the Stock Exchange. In parting with my money I understood I was giving £1 cover for every £100 of stock, and that would cover the number of shares I purchased from Tyler, and that the control of those shares would give me the right to the dividend that was approaching quickly. I was going to Tyler and Co. with reference to the pay<lb/>ment of those dividends.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. F. E. Smith. I did not consider I was running any risk. I thought the real question was the payment of the £3 dividend on the 30th. I thought I was certain to get the dividend and make more than I had invested. After the payment of the dividend I thought the shares would rise to their original value. The dividend did not come from Tyler and Co., but from the com<lb/>pany. It was no speculation because the dividend had already been declared. I did not contemplate the shares falling more than the £3 a share, which was the dividend. I should only have drawn for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210242"/>
               <p>the £3 dividend, and then if I wanted to carry it on to another ac<lb/>count I should have arranged to pay the contango. If I did not like to pay the contango I should have sold, and if the shares had fallen 10 points I should have lost. I understood that if the quotation fell I point Tyler and Co. could close the contract unless I deposited fresh cover, but I was entitled to have their advice on the point. Except as regards the dividend, if the market fell, subject to the question of advice, I should not have a grievance against them. I thought I was buying the shares and not making a bet on "differ<lb/>ences," because I was working for the dividend. I did not read the "terms of business" on the back of the contract. I was an invalid and did not take the trouble to read them. I considered I was buying the shares or else how could I obtain the dividend? Unless those shares were bought no dividend could have existed. Contracts are read on the face of the contracts. If I had read term 3, "It is fully understood that the stock or shares represented by this contract will sot be taken up or paid for by either party," I should still have thought I was buying the shares because the original circular sent me was the guiding thing. Possibly, if I had read term 5 I should have known what Tyler and Co. were claiming to have the right to do under the contract. I received a letter from them on April 25 stating my cover had become exhausted. I did not consider that if the cover was exhausted the dividend was lost, too. The market had risen. On one letter of theirs I wrote in red ink, "Returned, as the contents are untrue." I meant it was untrue that the quotation had fallen. I cannot say from memory on what days their statements were false as to the quotation. I followed the course of the market in the shares each day with exact care.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. "An absolutely secured and certain dividend" is in large type on the circular, and I understood it was so. There are also the words, "There is no liability at all above the amount of deposit, and there is no question but that the above dividend will be paid. This dividend is not a speculation." That is in large type, and that is what I understood. I saw the words in large type, "Our clients' interests and our own are identical," and thought they were probably a very good firm. The circular says, "We advise our clients as to the exact position of the market and what they should do in order to retain their previous interest," and thought it very likely they would send me a letter to that effect.</p>

                  </hi>, cashier at the London Joint Stock Bank, Pall Mall. Exhibit 22, a cheque by Mr. Reed for £350 was cashed by me on April 24 across the counter into six £50 notes and £50 in gold. The numbers of the notes were 97427 to 97432. I think it was cashed a few minutes part one. A man named Harris brought it to the bank to be cashed. I recognised him in King's Arms Yard, the Old Jewry Police Office, and told Inspector Ottaway that he was the man. I afterwards recognised him in the police court. The cheque being for a large amount I asked him what the payees were, and he said they were brokers. I asked him if he was one of the firm, and he said</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210243"/>
               <p>be was simply a clerk. The cheque was properly endorsed and all in order, and I could not refuse to pay it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. F. E. Smith. I do not know the time the cheque for £100, dated April 19, was presented. The Middlesex Banking Company, through whom it was paid, is not a clearing house bank; it would come through the Metropolitan Bank. It was drawn on the 15th and paid on the 17th. Probably it would have got to the Middlesex (Bank on the 16th and be presented by them to the London Joint Stock Bank on the 17th. The proceeds would get back to the Middlesex Bank on the same day, the 17th. Assuming the cheque got to us about 12 o'clock, it might have got to the Middlesex Bank directly after they received it if it came by post. They would pay it into the Middlesex Bank at 10 or 11 o'clock. With regard to all the Middlesex Bank cheques which are held by the Metropolitan, directly they are cleared in the hands of the Metropolitan the Metro<lb/>politan would communicate to the Middlesex that their balance is so and so. At the close of business on the 17th they would know every<lb/>thing was paid.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. W. Wellesley Orr. When Harris said they were "brokers" I gather he meant stockbrokers. I am sure he said he was a clerk and that he was not a partner in the firm.</p>

                  </hi>, clerk in the Bank Note Department of the Bank of England. I produce six £50 bank notes, 97427 to 97432. No. 97431 bears the stamp of the Finsbury Pavement Post Office. On the back of Nos. 97428-9-30 there is the endorsement "W. Tyler, 54, Old Broad Street, E. C." These notes were cashed at the Bank of England into gold, 97,428 on April 24 and 97,429-30 on April 26. The handwriting of the three endorsements is, in my judgment, the same. No. 97432, endorsed "W. Tyler," was cashed into gold on April 25. The handwriting is different. When a note is cashed into gold at the Bank of England it is usual to ask the person to endorse it, or one of a series cashed at the same time.</p>

                  </hi>, solicitor, 61, Cheapside. Mr. Reed con<lb/>sulted me on April 30 this year year, and in consequence of what he said I made several visits to Tyler's office, Pinner's Hall, on April 30, May 2, May 3, and May 10. I went three times on April 30. The first time the office was shut up with a note pinned on the door, "Back at 2.15." I went and had lunch and went back again and saw Miss Louis. I waited some time and then came back again later in the afternoon. I asked to see Tyler, and the reply was that he might come in at any minute or he might not be there again that day; it was very uncertain. I told the lady what I had called about and wrote my name down for her and what I wanted, and showed her the letters. On May 2 I called about 10.25 am. I tried the door and it was locked. I made a noise on the outside but did not get any answer, so I left. On May 3 and May 10 the same thing occurred. I was never able to see Tyler. I represented the prose<lb/>cution at the very commencement as solicitor for Mr. Reed. I got possession from Inspector Ottaway of a press letter copybook of W.</p>

               <p>Tyler and Co, of the dates January lo April, 1907, and went through it page by page, and found what purported to be press copies of a number of selling and closing contracts. In the opening contracts the prices are not filled in at the same time as the typewritten form is filled up. For the most part they are filled in in ink. The closing contracts appear to be filled in by the typist on the machine all at the same time. The press copy of the opening contracts is typewritten in typewriting copying ink, but the prices at which Tyler's sell are filled in in ink or coloured pencil, with about six exceptions. There were 63 contracts. In five the price was blank; six appeared to have been filled up at the same time; 46 were filled up in ink after<lb/>wards; and in six the type is altered or it is typed in at a different time, as it appears to me. With regard to the closing contracts, there are about three or four cases where the price was not filled in at the same time, out of about 60.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. F. E. Smith. I went six times to Tyler's office. The longest time I stayed was 20 minutes, when I was talk<lb/>ing to Miss Latus about the £500 my client had lost. I went there at 10.25 on all three days, and at 2.50 and 3.45 as well on the first day. The closing contracts are filled in in type. I did not advertise for persons who wished to bring claims against Tyler.</p>

                  </hi>, surveyor, Witham, Essex. About February 20 last year I received a circular (Exhibit 82) signed George Martin, purporting to be from the "Financial Guardian, Share Department," of which George Martin was the manage. It recommends the pur<lb/>chase of Canadian Pacific shares and states that the purchase of the shares would carry a bonus of about £16 a share. I wrote letter 83, and afterwards letter 84, with a cheque for £30 to George Martin, which was endorsed "George Martin" and paid by my bank. I got Exhibits 85 and 86, the contract showing "£1,000 Canadian Pacific stock at 175 1/2 cum bonus. (Signed) George Martin. Cover deposit £30, 3 per cent. Cash received." And then there is added, "With limited liability." Account No. 88 it headed, "Account end of March. J. T. Lever in account with George Martin," and shows that I, holding £1,755 value of fifty Canadian Pacifies, and charged con<lb/>tango on that amount at 5 per cent, per annum for 13 days, coming to £3 2s. 6d. Exhibit 89 is the cheque I paid that account with. I received Exhibit 90 and afterwards called at 2, Tokenhouse Build<lb/>ings and asked for Mr. Martin. Harris came forward and said, "He is not here." He did not think he would be in all day. I said I had come purposely to see him and wanted to settle my account. He said. "He is in Manchester; you cannot see him." He promised me a settlement for next settling day. Canadian Pacific stock was higher than that at which I purchased it. From the first moment I had bought it it had not gone down at all; it had gone up. When I said I wanted to settle my account I meant I wanted to close it I said there and then, "Harris, I would like to close at once. I would like to close the stock at once," or something of that sort. I believe I said, "The stock shows a good</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210245"/>
               <p>profit; it is well up; close it at once." He agreed to close. I saw a couple of girls also in the office. I do not think they were doing anything. One of them was rather a rude young lady—the one exa<lb/>mined here the other day. It was early in the morning I paid my visit. I went back to Witham, and next morning received letter 91 signed "George Martin" dated April 19, 1906. Contract 92 was en<lb/>closed, showing that the "Financial Guardian" Share Department bought from me under-noted shares to close Canadian Pacific £1,000 stock 177 7/8 cum. bonus, I having bought at 175 1/2. I got no cheque or remittance. I then wrote 93 and got answer 94. Letter 93 pointed out that the papers said 183 1/2. I got my price from the "Daily Telegraph." On April 21 I got a circular from the "Finan<lb/>cial Guardian" about Rio Tintos. I sent cheque No. 96 for £10 for 10 Rio Tintos, which was paid by my bank. I got an acknowledg<lb/>ment and a contract for the shares at 65 7/8. I had had nothing on ac<lb/>count of Canadian Pacific's and wrote letter 99, and got letter 100. The next pay day would be somewhere about May 12. I went up to 2, Tokenhouse Buildings and asked for Martin, and Harris said he was not in town. I told him I wanted a settlement of my account. Harris said I might expect a settlement for certain the next pay day. He said they had been hit very hard and had lost about £2,000 and same of their clients were pressing them hardly. I waited till July 6, when I wrote letter 101, to which I got no reply. I waited again a long time and then called at the office, about three times altogether, and saw Harris. He said something to the same effect as before. Then I wrote letter 102 on October 27, and, not getting any reply; I gave my solicitor instructions in the matter. I never had any part of the money. My solicitor took proceedings on my behalf. When I parted with my money, having read she circular, I thought the "Financial Guardian" was a paper; I did not know they were bucket-shop people. From first to last I was not able to see Mr. George Martin.</p>
               <p>Crocs-examined by Mr. Wellesley Orr. I did not understand this was a speculation or a cover transaction. I did not expect to get the scrip, but I would much rather have taken up the shares than lose too money. I was prepared to find the value of the shares. I dis<lb/>puted the price at the time of closing the shares, but I was claiming the difference shown upon the contracts. The amount of the profit was put down at £118 15s. That was done by my solicitors. I was not angry when I did not get any satisfactory reply in April, but I could not think they were treating me fairly. I was a double fool to invest with them again. I did not know whether Rio Tintos have gone steadily up or not. It was a bad investment for me. I have not got the money. If they had given me £40 I would have been de<lb/>lighted, but they would not pay anything, and they never have paid anything.</p>

               <p>recover £148 15s., being £118 15s. profit upon 50 Canadian Pacific shares and £30 amount paid as deposit. An appearance was entered Minton, Slater, and Co., for the defendant, and an affidavit (pro<lb/>duced) of George Martin, denying liability, was filed. The claim was based upon contract notes of the defendant, showing that the 50 shares were bought at 175 1/2 and sold at 177 7/8, being £2 7s. 6d. profit on each of the 50 shares—£118 15s., together with £30 deposit. The action was put in the Short Cause List before Sutton, J. Counsel appeared for defendant, and we obtained judgment, with costs, amounting to about £44. We got no money, and within a fortnight of the judgment the defendants were arrested. Notice of appeal was given, but was never entered.</p>

                  </hi>, 12, Waverley Road, Folkestone. In December, 1905, I received circular (produced) from Financial Guardian and Mining Market Mirror, Share Department, offering Golden Rhodesians. I did not purchase. I afterwards got circular (produced) signed "H. K. Ablett," offering Canadian Pacific shares, and on February 16,1906, I sent cheque (produced) for £30, which is endorsed by "H. K. Ablett," and has been honoured. I received con<lb/>tract note showing that 50 shares had been purchased for me at 176 5/8. On March 1 I received letter (produced), and on March 2 sent another £30 as further cover. I afterwards sent a bundle of cheques (produced) for small amounts for contango amounting to £61 in response to fortnightly accounts (produced), signed "H. K. Ablett." I wrote for the money several times, and on March 4, 1907, I received letter (produced) from George Martin, stating that Mr. H. K. Ablett had been away some time, and he would try to get into communica<lb/>tion with him. On March 25 I received letter and account (pro<lb/>duced) showing a debit balance against me of £21 0s. 3d. The ac<lb/>count shows a charge for 167 days contango from October 11 to March 27 amounting to £54 15s. 3d. I replied, and on March 27 I received a letter signed by "H. K. Ablett," stating that I had been credited with bonus to the extent of £110, and the account would be made up later. I received nothing from the "Financial Guardian." I thought it was a genuine firm.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Wellesley Orr. I believed that I was buying the shares with the £30, and that according to the circular "there was no further liability." I sent the second £30 because I thought it was needed to keep them going. I did not know the market price of the shares. I do not know what "taking up a share" means. I did not write that I had already bought the shares and there was nothing more to pay. I have not taken legal proceed<lb/>ings. I intended to do so, and I believe I said so in the last letter I wrote.</p>

                  </persName>, City, On May 9, 1907, I kept observation on 16, Great St. Helen's, saw Tyler leave, and followed him to W. Tyler and Co.'s office, Pinner's Hall. I went in and saw Claire Latus in the outer office, the door to the inner room being open, I said, "I have called on behalf of Madame Pittet, of Chingford. I want to see one of the principals." She said, "Mr. Tyler is not in." I said, "Can you tell me when he will be in?" She said, "No, he it in and out all day. Madame Pittet had better write." I said, "Madam Pittet is tired of writing, that is the reason I called. I will come back later." I kept observation on the office, and two or three minutes later Tyler came out. On May 27 I received warrant for Tyler's arrest, saw him in Tokenhouse Yard, and told him I held a warrant for his arrest for obtaining money by false pretences. I took him to the Chief Office of Police and read the warrant, which related to £15 obtained from Madame Pittet. He said, "They can charge me if they like, but I do not think they can do it." A little later he said, "I know nothing about the business, although I am nominally responsible." I then searched the office at Pinners Hall; Latus and Reece were there. In the outer office were two fixed desks, a stool, a copying press, two packets of headed notepaper, 92 prints of the Rio Tinto mine, a bundle of folded circulars (produced), many hundreds of addressed envelopes, and several lists of investors. There were no books of account whatever. I then went to the office of Gibbs and Tyler, 16, Great St. Helen's. The names up were "Malayian Property Syndicate" and "Malayian Para Rubber Estates, Limited"—not the name of "Gibbs and Tyler." I found a number of cheque books, mostly used, on the Middlesex Bank, signed "William Tyler and Co."; memorandum book containing pay<lb/>ments in and out to "George." Pass book of W. Tyler and Co. with the London and Provincial Bank. In the memorandum book was written "7348 Wall," which is the telephone number of the "Financial Guardian." I also found circulars and notepaper of W. Tyler and Co.; press copy letter book of Gibbs and Tyler; cheque for £86 14s. 6d. by W. Tyler and Co. to Perryman. (The witness gave evidence as to the handwriting on a number of cheques.) I then returned to the police-station and saw Tyler. I said, "I have searched your office, but I have failed to find any books of account. I want you to tell me where they are." He said, "If you go to 2, Tokenhouse Buildings and see George Harris he may give you some." I asked for a letter of authority, which he gave me, as follows: "Dear George,—I have been arrested and am going to Moor Lane, Detective Ottaway is coming up to see you."</p>
               <p>To Mr. F. E. Smith. I cannot say whether I cautioned Tyler be<lb/>fore this—I certainly cautioned him afterwards.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210248"/>
               <p>To Mr. Orr. I cautioned Harris after he had pretended to make a search at the office for the books. I went to 2, Tokenhouse Build<lb/>ings and said to Harris. "Tyler is in custody; he has been arrested upon a charge of obtaining money by false pretences in connection with the business at Pinner's Hall. I understand that you. have some books belonging to him here." I then produced Tyler's letter. Harris said, "I do not think that there are any here." He then went into the private office, came out almost immediately, and looked in a cup<lb/>board, and said, "There does not appear to be any here." I said, 'I am not satisfied with the way in which you have searched, you have books here, and I want them before I leave." He them went to the cupboard and produced letter book of Tyler and Co. I said, "How is it that you have got Tyler and Co.'s letter book here." He said, "Tyler brought it up to ask a question on a point of law" I said, "Who is the tenant of these offices?" Harris said, "I do not know, but I think George Martin." He brought four press copy letter books of the "Financial Guardian "out of the cupboard. I knew him as Harris. I then returned to the police office with Tyler's letter book and told Tyler that this was the only book I had obtained from Harris and that I did not recognise the writing a a his or his lady clerk's. I asked him whose writing it was. He said, "I do not know." I said, "It is strange you do not know whose writing this is if this is your business."</p>
               <p>To Mr. F. E. Smith. I now recollect that I cautioned Tyler be<lb/>fore I went to 2, Tokenhouse Buildings.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Bodkin. On May 28 Tyler was brought up before the Alder<lb/>man, the hearing was adjourned, and by June 11 I received warrant for the arrest of Harris. I found a number of documents at Tyler's house, including those from Smiles. On June 11 I arrested Harris in Lothbury.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Orr. I cautioned Harris at 2, Tokenhouse Buildings, when I made inquiries as to the books of Tyler and Co. I did so because I was satisfied he was not speaking the truth.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Bodkin. I read the warrant to him. He said, "You have made a great mistake." Later I told him he had been identified as the person who cashed a cheque for £350 on April 24 on the London Joint Stock Bank, Pall Mall, which had been sent to Tyler and Co. He said, "Tyler asked me to cash the cheque, and I afterwards paid him the money." I then went to 2, Tokenhouse Buildings and found a number of books, papers relating to William Tyler and Co., Herbert Smith, Chalmers and Cox, and the "Financial Guardian," and to another bucket shop, "A. M. Noble." On the door was painted "Rand Roodeport Mining Company" and "Gold Coast Property Owners, Limited," and on a piece of paper stuck up at the side of the door was written, "The Financial Guardian and Mining Market Mirror." On the same landing was a room with "C. W. P." on the door, of which the key was in the other office. I found it empty except for a rolled top desk which belonged to the landlord; the place was covered with dust and apparently unused; there were no books.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210249"/>
               <p>In the offices I found no account books of any kind—only letter books. I also went to an address given by Harris as his private address at 179, Dames Road, Forest Gate. I there found a postcard and a letter signed "Mabel," which I showed to Harris and said, "I understand these are from a young lady typist of yours?" He said, "Yes—Miss Long." I found writing of Long's in the letter books and Tyler and Co., of the Lombard Financial Corporation and of Herbert Smith. In Tyler and Company's books it is her and Harris's writing only.</p>
               <p>(Friday, November 1.)</p>

                  </hi>, recalled. On June 27 I had a warrant for the arrest of Perryman. I saw him in Old Jewry, and asked him to go to the police-office there. I read the warrant, which charged him with conspiring with Tyler and Harris to obtain money and valuable securities by false pretences. He said, "Who had the temerity to lay this information." I said "Upon my information the warrant was granted." He said, "A police officer is not a very substantial person to obtain redress from." I searched 2, Tokenhouse Buildings, and found three letter-books containing letters signed by Perryman, letter-books of the "Financial Observer," a bundle of cheques, and files of the "Mining Market Mirror and Mining Herald." Perryman had no other down to June, 1907. I found cheques on his account at the London City and Midland Bank in favour of Bleach; to George Harris, endorsed by Harris; to George Martin, in the handwriting of Perryman; to C. George, endorsed by Harris, and in his handwriting; one cheque drawn to Barnes; a number of cheques payable to Herbert Smith and H. Smith, endorsed in Harris's writing; one to H. Smith, endorsed by Perryman. I found the cheques all together. There were a number of counterfoil paying-in slips in the handwriting of Mabel Long and Harris. The body of some of the cheque is in Mabel Long's handwriting. I also found cheques payable to Hawkes, some endorsed by him and others by Harris; also letter-books of Herbert Smith, containing letters written from 43, Moorgate Street, and 27, Sun Street, many in Perryman's handwriting, and containing a great many accounts in Perryman's handwriting; one letter-book commencing with Herbert Smith, at page 270, is continued in the name of H. K. Ablett, signed by Harris. I found a large number of circulars in the name of William Tyler and Co., H. K. Ablett, G. Martin, Chalmers and Cox, A. M. Noble, and Lombard Financial Corporation (signed by a stamp in the name of A. R. Fraser). I found letter from Mrs. Butcher, addressed to Ablett; green paper memorandum list of customers in Perryman's writing, showing that they had been dealt with by Martin or Ablett, including the name of Mrs. d'Alters, dealt with by Ablett, and Mullins, dealt with by "G. M." (Martin); paying-in book of George Martin with Middlesex Bank, in Harris's writing. Some of the circulars are altered in Perryman's writing. In one of H. Smith's letter-books 30 consecutive pages are in Perryman's writing. There</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210250"/>
               <p>were also a bundle of receipts to C. W. Perryman, lists of country investors in the Aerated Bread Company and others, invoice of Dalby, Walsh and Co. for supplying same. Rubber stamps "George Martin," "Herbert Smith," "The Rand Roodeport Gold Mining Co.," etc. The signature of "Alexander R. Fraser" in the signature-book of the Economic Bank and upon the circulars is Mabel Long's handwriting.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Marshall Hall. I did not search 2, Token-house Buildings after the arrest of Perryman. I have produced all the documents which I think important in this case. At Pinner's Hall I found nothing belonging to Perryman except the furniture. I found on Perryman some cards of 41, Charing Cross Road. He said it was an old address; that he used to live there. I did not search 41, Charing Cross Road, nor did I find any documents relating to it. Excepting in Harris's office I found nothing at 2, Tokenhouse Buildings; there was nothing in the room marked "C. W. P." I found 42 cheque books containing several thousands of cheques. I have only produced one cheque filled up by Mabel Long, dated Oc<lb/>tober 8, 1906, to Allen for £65, and another to Nixon and Arnold of June 18. There may be others. I have only seen postcard and letter of Mabel Long's admitted handwriting. I have been told she is in Calcutta. I did not find at 2, Tokenhouse Buildings thousands of circulars from outside brokers—I found a very few from persons unconnected with the prisoner's businesses; there were, perhaps, half a dozen from Martin, Bull and Co., and Mackenzie. (Witness admitted the payment of several sums to customers, referring to the accounts in Perryman's handwriting.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. F. E. Smith. When I called on May 9 at Tyler's office I was not asked my name by Miss Latus. When arrested Tyler did not say, "I am responsible"; he said, "I am nominally responsible." I cautioned him when I was asking him with regard to the account books as to where they were. When I arrested Tyler I found certain testimonials and certificates of character at his ad<lb/>dress in Great St. Helens. I took possession of these with other papers and have handed them over long ago. I made a schedule of all the documents found upon him, and they will be on the charge sheet. I went afterwards to Tyler's residence in Harvest Road and made an examination of the papers there.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Marshall Hall. A bundle of Stock Exchange accounts was found at Tokenhouse Buildings. The majority of them were in the name of Perryman.</p>

                  </hi>, solicitor, practising as Minton Slater and Co., at 9. Wool Exchange. I acted for the defence in the action of Alex<lb/>ander Forrest Harper against the "Financial Guardian," and entered an appearance for Henry King Ablett, who was sued as the "'Finan<lb/>cial Guardian' share department." I was instructed by George Harris. I never saw Henry King Ablett. The affidavit (produced)</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210251"/>
               <p>was, I believe, filed by my clerk, whose name is Mayo. It was pre<lb/>pared on the instructions of Harris. I do not know who swore it It purports to be sworn by H.K. Ablett. I do not know in whose handwriting the signature is. I do not know Harris's hand-writing. I do not know who went with Ablett to have it sworn. Neither I nor my clerk went with him. The ordinary course was not followed in this case. Harris called for it and took it away. The affidavit (produced) is in answer to interrogatories sworn in the same action prepared on the instructions of George Harris. It purports to be sworn by H.K. Ablett, at Budge Row. Neither myself nor my clerk was present. To my knowledge I never saw Mr. Ablett. There was a man at the office I thought was Ablett, and I was told afterwards he had gone away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence. How do you explain that when the affidavit was sworn neither you nor your clerk was present?.</p>
               <p>Witness. He gave instructions, and asked to have the affidavit, and said he would get it sworn. I do not think it is unusual for a solicitor to let his client take a document to swear before a Commis<lb/>sioner without either himself or clerk attending with him. I did not know where he lived; his place of residence was left open. I do not think it is unusual for a solicitor to act for a gentleman in an action whom he has never seen at all. If the manager comes I do not always see the proprietor of the business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence. If that is the usual practice I advise you not to follow it in the future. If you do you will certainly get your<lb/>self into trouble.</p>
               <p>Further examined. I filed the affidavit (produced) in the action of Lever v. the "Financial Guardian." My client in that case was George Harris. I understood that George Martin was at that time proprietor of the "Financial Guardian." I never saw George Martin for the purposes of business. He instructions for that affidavit came from George Harris. The affidavit purports to be sworn by George Martin. I have not had the opportunity of comparing the signature to see whether "George Martin" is in the same handwriting as that of "H.K. Ablett" in the other affidavits. There is a resemblance certainly, though no two letters are alike, but I cannot say they were written by the same person. I have known Perryman about 10 years, and at the time of these actions was conducting business for him. I did not introduce Harris to the Middlesex Bank when he opened an account in the name of George Martin. I gave the name of George Martin as the name of a client. I had not seen George Martin, but I had seen his representative. I did not know at the time that George Martin was George Harris.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence directed that all the papers produced by witness should be sent to the Law Society.</p>

Since then there had still been an account, but smaller. For Fraser the amount of work done was £376 19s. 6d.; for Chalmers and Cox, £345 17s. 4d.; and for Herbert Smith, £931 4s. 7d.; and including Perryman's later account, the total work done was upwards of £6,000.</p>

I have examined the exhibits in the case of Mrs. Butcher, and find she purchased on February 16, 1906, £5,000 Canadian Pacific Stock (250 shares) at 177 1/2 cum bonus. I produce a copy of the "Stock Exchange Weekly Intelligence," which shows that the stock was quoted ex dividend on February 22, the dividend being $3 per share less tax. The letter from Ablett of March I says that the quotation has fallen away entirely owing to the general fall in securities dealt in in New York. I have taken the tape prices in the "Financial News" as issued by the Exchange Telegraph Company. The opening price on March 7 was 173 3/4, to 174 1/4, and on February 28, 175 1/2. The fall between February 16 and February 28 is in part accounted for by the fact that the shares had become ex dividend. A person who had bought cum dividend would be entitled to be credited with the dividend, which would ultimately be collected and handed over to the purchaser. Under these circumstances the three points cover on the transaction would not have run off. I take the date February 28 because the letter from the defendants contain<lb/>ing the first intimation that the shares bad fallen is dated March 1. I start from their own date. Mrs. Butcher did not send any more money. The letter signed by Ablett of March 5 asserts that "The price did fall to 173"; also that if the price fell "naturally you would be obliged to have them closed to obviate the necessity of sending more money, in the first place; and, secondly, because you were guaranteed from any further liability." In a letter of April 18 Ablett asserts that the shares were closed in default of continuance to cover</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210253"/>
               <p>them, and in a subsequent letter he says: "The cover ran off before the Canadian Pacifics were quoted 'ex dividend,'" and "when the dividend was deducted the quotation fell to 174 1/2, the figure at which you ran off. Subsequently, on March 1, they dropped to 175 3/4." They did, as a matter of fact, but that was ex dividend. The stock being 174 1/2 ex dividend, left still three points cover. There is no allegation in the correspondence that the cover had run off before March 1. Messrs. Cooper, Walker, and Hall, Mrs. Butcher's solicitors, wrote to Ablett, asking the price at which and the date on which the cover ran off, and Ablett replied on May 3 that "when the quotation for Canadian Pacifics fell to 174 1/2 the deal ran off, as the cover became exhausted, and on March 6 they fell to 173 1/2." Mrs. Butcher offered to take up the stock, but that offer was not accepted. It is clear that on the dates Ablett mentioned the cover had not run off, if credit is taken for the amount of dividend to which Mrs. Butcher was entitled. In the case of Mrs. D'Altera of the purchase of £1,000 (50 shares) Canadian Pacific Stock, at 176 5/8 cum bonus, she re<lb/>ceived a letter in precisely the same terms as that addressed to Mrs. Butcher. On March 2 she sent £30 further cover, and from that date onwards was regularly charged contango. When she was asked to produce more cover her cover had not run off. She could have closed at a price which would have left a balance due to her, because she had £60 cover. At the end of May dividend would have been paid. The dividend was paid in April, and allowing two or three weeks for collection, there would have been due to her on my showing a balance of £75. Assuming that they still claimed the right to hold £30 cover, the stock being still open, there would have been a balance due to her then of £45, after charging her with carrying-over. When the new issue was made the shareholders got one share in every five at the price of £160, which was equivalent to a profit of $12 per $100 share. The "Stock Exchange Weekly Official Intelligence" shows the price at which the stock was made up.</p>
               <p>Mr. F.K. Smith protested against the admission of the document Mr. Cash was called as an expert accountant, and could not give evidence on a weekly report.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice A.T. Lawrence said he had been informed that the document was usually accepted, but any criticism of it would certainly be looked into Prisoners were representing themselves as having been doing an honest business, and it was only possible to test that by seeing whether, if it had been done honestly, it would have resulted in a credit to the customer.</p>
               <p>Witness. If Mrs. D'Altera had closed her account at the end of May and had taken away her cover she would have had to receive about £75, of which she had herself furnished £60. There is no ac<lb/>count giving her credit for dividends earned. In the case of Mr. Lever £1,000 Canadian Pacifics were bought at 175 1/2 on March 15. When they were closed he was entitled to a balance, and Harris several times promised a settlement. Ultimately an action was brought and £148 recovered. On April 24 he bought some Rio Tinto shares at 65 7/8 cum dividend. It does not appear that the transaction was closed. There is not material enough to show what should have been done in the case of Mrs. Pittet. In regard to Mr.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210254"/>
               <p>Keed's case that was a cheque for £100, sent on April 16. Exhibit 19 shows receipt of that cheque, being 1 per cent, cover on 100 Rio Tinto shares at 88 1/4 cum dividend. (Witness produced figures showing the prices of the shares at different times of the day, showing that 88 1/4 was the highest price of the day.) There were two more cheques sent by Mr. Reed, one £50 April 20 and one £350 posted April 24. The opening price on the 22nd was 90 1/2—91. On April 24 a contract was sent by Tyler's for 400 Rio Tintos at 92 3/4 cum. dividend. That was the price at 11.9, 11.45, and 12.2, and after that the price for buyers fell away, so that on the following morning the cover had run off, 91 3/4 being the opening price—in fact, it had run off at 4.9 on the previous day before the contract was sent off. I should say that the cover on the first 100 shares had run off on April 18, because at 310 on the 18th they fell to 87 1/4 (Witness particularised the rise and fall of the prices at this time, showing that the cover had run off before Mr. Reed purchased his shares. He saw no way in which de<lb/>fendants' figures could be justified.) Mr. Reed lost the whole of his £500 in dealings in Rio Tintos between April 16 and April 24, during which period there was practically a steady rise from 85 1/2 buyers to 94 1/2 buyers.</p>
               <p>(Monday, November 4.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Muir stated that the witness Mr. Case, who was under exami<lb/>nation when the Court last adjourned, had been taken suddenly ill, and read a medical certificate to that effect. The learned counsel further stated that he proposed to complete the other evidence the prosecution had to offer, and then counsel for the defence would elect what course they would ask his Lordship to pursue.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marshall Hall stated that he should propose to apply for an adjournment on the ground principally that he should ask that the prosecution called all their evidence before the defendants case was opened.</p>

                  </hi>, recalled. (To Mr. Muir.) I have had an opportunity of inspecting the bundle of certificates (Exhibit 204). I recognise Mr. Perryman's handwriting upon a great number of these documents. On page 10 there are some alterations, but I could not state in whose handwriting the bulk of the writing is. That refers to a purchase of Brighton "A" stock. On page 11 there are some more additions in ink—some figures and words. I think they are also in Mr. Perryman's handwriting. On page 12 there are several additions in ink. On page 23 there are four words at the bottom of the page, one word being knocked out. The four lines on the top of page 27 are, I think, in Mr. Perryman's hand-writing. On page 29 there is an alteration at the bottom of the page, some words being struck out and other words written over the top. Page 30 I think is all in Mr. Perryman's handwriting. On page 31 there are three words in the last line in pencil. On page 35, about the centre of the page, there are two lines with some alterations in ink. There are alterations on pages 36 and 58 also in ink, in, I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210255"/>
               <p>think, Mr. Perryman's handwriting. On page 59 there are alterations in ink and pencil; also on page 60. On page 70, in the right-hand corner of the bottom of the page, there are three names in pencil. (To Mr. Marshall Hall.) There are 14 pages altogether and 81 pages in the bundle.</p>
               <p>Mr. Muir stated that this Exhibit was found at No. 2, Tokenhouse Buildings.</p>
               <p>Witness (continuing). Exhibit 217 is a letter purporting to be written by Perryman on notepaper headed, "2, Tokenhouse Build<lb/>ings, April 23, 1907," to Messrs. Pope and Westlake, offering to sell founders' shares in the Fullers Earth Union at £125 net, for reply by return. Exhibits 219, 220, 223, and 224 are letters relating to the same matter, Exhibit 224 being a cheque with An endorsement on the back in Perrymans own handwriting in hit own name. I do not recognise Exhibit 225 as being in Perrymans handwriting. It is signed "p.p.C.W. Perryman."—"G.H." it looks like. The letter of May 2, with no year appearing on it, but which was this year, 1907, is a letter from Perryman to our bank requesting our bank to hand the bearer of the letter a cheque book and Perryman's pass book. This request was complied with, the bearer of the letter giving a receipt for them. This letter, to the best of my belief, is in the same handwriting as Exhibit No. 225, and it is signed in the name of "C. George." I did not see the person who got that cheque book. "C. George" is in the same writing as "G.H." on the other letter. (To Mr. Justice Lawrence.) The body of this letter is in Perryman's handwriting. (The documents were handed to the Jury.) (To Mr. Muir.) I only know Harris by sight. I have seen him in our bank—the London City and Midland Bank, Queen Victoria Street, where Perryman has his account. I have seen Harris in the bank while I have been at the counter, and I have received credits from him to the credit of Perryman's account. I have not seen him often, as I am not always at the counter; he may have gone to any of the other counters. The credits I received from Harris for Perryman's ac<lb/>count were latterly, I should think, in gold, the amounts ranging up-to £100; the greater part of it was new gold invariably.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marshall Hall stated that he understood the witness had been recalled on the question of handwriting on certain documents, and he had had no notice of any further evidence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Marshall Hall. I have never seen Perry<lb/>man write. I have been at the bank 15 years, and I have seen Perry<lb/>man's signature a lot. While I have been at the bank my only con<lb/>tact with Perryman's writing was the honouring of cheques drawn by himself, and perhaps an occasional letter such as the order for the cheque book, which, of course, I never saw actually written, but which I believe to be in Perryman's writing. With reference to the papers I have picked out, they might correctly be described as "picking needles out of a bundle of hay." In my opinion, they are in the handwriting of Perryman.</p>

                  </persName>, recalled. To the best of my belief the writing in these opening contracts—figures being inserted—are in the writing of Harris and Miss Long. In the "Financial Guardian" contracts figures have also been inserted, as in Tyler and Co.'s con<lb/>tracts, after the contract note has been copied; they are apparently written by the same person. I find in the other letter books of Fraser, Herbert Smith, and Chalmers and Cox that figures have been inserted as in the other cases. "Herbert Smith" is amongst these, and "Chalmers and Cox," but I could not speak as to whose writing the figures are in. In my opinion, the handwriting on Ex<lb/>hibit 50 is Miss Longs. That is the account of Miss Griffiths. I find a similar handwriting in Tyler and Co.'s letter book. There is a great similarity between "R" in Exhibit 50, in the name of "Alex<lb/>ander R. Fraser," and in the words "Rio Tinto" in these accounts, which I think are in the handwriting of Miss Long. Exhibit 19 (a bundle of contracts) is an instance of the price being typed out of alignment. Exhibit 25 is an instance of the price being inserted in ink. Although the rest of the document is typed. Nos. 39, 44, and 45 are instances of the price being out of alignment. In 61, 65, 85, 95, and 111 the is inserted in ink. In my opinion, the signature "H. K. Ablett" in No. 111 is Miss Long's, to the best of my belief. The initials are "S. G." or "G. G." Exhibit 225 is a letter in Harris's handwriting; the receipt upon the letter 225 is also in Harris's handwriting, and also "C. George." I found a little black memo. book (Exhibit 109) at 16 and 17, Great St. Helen's, the office of Gibbs and Tyler.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Marshall Hall. I have been through the bundle of Stock Exchange accounts produced on Friday, and I find a large number of Perryman's Stock Exchange accounts, carrying-over notes, etc; also some in the name of Herbert Smith. (To Mr. Jus<lb/>tice Lawrence.) These were found at No. 2, Tokenhouse Buildings. Mr. Muir stated that subject to the completion of Mr. Cash's evidence that would be the case for the Crown. Mr. Marshall Hall submitted that the defendants' counsel should not be called upon until the evidence for the prosecution was closed.</p>
               <p>This submission was supported by counsel for the other prisoners.</p>

                  </hi>, recalled. I understood his Lordship to say he wished to have the prices from February 16 to February 22, when Canadian Pacifics became ex dividend, and I have the "Financial Times" for the following days. On the 22nd the stock became ex dividend for the first time, and there is a drop of practically 3 points between closing price the night before and the opening price on the 22nd—closing price 177 1/2 and opening price, marked ex dividend, 174 1/2—5. It is rather less than 3 points, so that apart from the drop of 3 points ex dividend the cover had not run off at all. The</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210257"/>
               <p>lowest previously was 176 to 176 1/2. Exhibits 209 and 178 cover a period from May 1, 1902, to June 30, 1907, of Mr. Perryman's ac<lb/>count with the London City and Midland Bank. The total payments into that account during that period were £36,225. The amount for the two years, July, 1902, to June, 1904, was £23,864. There are some quite small balances carried forward included in that figure. In the credits the payments are largely in round figures. I have also examined the account of Herbert Smith with the London City and Midland Bank, Aldgate branch, which covers a period from May 2, 1902, to October 22, 1903. The total payments in were £13,034 17s. 6d. (Table CS 6.) From October 5, 1903. that account was overlapped by an account in the same name with the London Joint Stock Bank, Finsbury. Those two accounts show total payments to the credit of Herbert Smith from May, 1902, to July, 1904, of £26,074 4s. 8d. I have also examined the account of Chalmers and Cox with the London and Trading Bank (Exhibit 216), extending from August 19. 1903, to September 28, 1906. There is very little in the account after January, 1905. The total paid into that account was £2,701 5s. I have also examined the account of H. J. Ablett with the London Trading Bank (164), which begins on July 3, 1905, and the last operation was on May 26, 1906. The total sum paid into the credit of that account was £2,302 5s. I have also examined the account of Henry Keith Ablett with the Economic Bank (164B) from April 5 to April 8, 1905. The amount paid in was £200. I have also examined the account of George Martin with the Middlesex Banking Company (34). commencing on April 9, 1906, and contain<lb/>ing till May 17, 1907. The total credits were £2,549 4s. 10d. I have also examined the account of William Tyler and Co. with the Middle<lb/>sex Banking Company (11) from October 15, 1906, to May 27, 1907, with total credits of £6,836 7s. 7d. I have also examined the ac<lb/>count of Alexander Robert Fraser with the Economic Bank. (Mr. Marshall Hall submitted that there was no evidence to connect any of the defendants with the banking account of A. R. Fraser. Mr. Jus<lb/>tice A. T. Lawrence. There is quite sufficient evidence to make it admissible at this stage, certainly against some of the defendants. Whether it affects Perryman or notes a matter which I do not express any opinion upon.) A. R. Fraser's account was from February 2, 1903, to November 30, 1904 (226A). Excluding Mr. Perryman's ac<lb/>count, the total of the credits to the accounts of Herbert Smith. Chalmers and Cox, Ablett. Martin, Tyler, and the Lombard Corpora<lb/>tion (that is, the A. R. Fraser account) amount to £45,762 19s. I have compared those accounts with each other to see if I could trace payments out of one into others, and have tabulated the result of my examination on various exhibits. The first, CS 5, is in the nature of a summary. In CS 5, 1 are given the particulars, the dates and the number of the notes, which were produced to me by Mr. Hudson, which were drawn out of the Herbert Smith account in the London City and Midland, and which appear in Mr. Perryman's account in the sense given on the statement.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210258"/>
               <p>To Mr. Marshall Hall. I suggest that the identical notes have been traced out of Smith's account into Perryman's account, by their numbers.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Muir. Taking CS 5, with regard to the £1,680 in notes, I find from the exhibit that notes to that amount, the numbers of which are given, were drawn out of Herbert Smiths account with the Lon<lb/>don City and Midland Bank, and that notes with those numbers were paid into Perryman's account with the London City and Midland Bank to the amount of £1,580. I have traced those notes by their numbers out of the one account and into the other. In the same way I traced notes out of the Smith account with the London Joint Stock Bank, Finsbury, notes to the amount of £190, and by their numbers I traced £150 of those notes into Perryman's account. They are the identical notes. I have seen the notes and the numbers. In the same way I have traced out of Chalmert and Cox's account with the Lon<lb/>don and Trading Bank notes to the amount of £360 by their numbers, and £285 of that to the account of Perryman at the London City and Midland Bank. Taking one as an example—November 10—you will find in Exhibit 226 that £50 was drawn out in notes, a £20 note and £30 note, from Herbert Smiths account. I have seen those two notes. In Exhibit 209, which is Perryman's account with the London City and Midland, there is a credit on November 10 for £60. Mr. Hudson produced to me the statements from the Bank of England.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marshall Hall said there was a missing link with regard to the notes, as Exhibit 212 A did not break up the notes further than October 22. There wers no details with regard to November 10, and what the witness said was not strictly evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Muir said the only document he had of the credits going into Perryman's account was 178 A, which went from January 4, 1905, to June, 1907.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marshall Hall submitted there was no evidence before the Court of the pay<lb/>ment into Perryman's account of those notes.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Justice Lawrence. In saying that those notes were paid in to Perryman's account I am relying on two things, one, that the bank clerk told me a certain fact, and, two, that on the corresponding date in the Exhibit of Perryman's account I find a credit for a sum at least as large as the item in question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marshall Hall said the bank clerk had stated that notes of corresponding numbers had passed through the London City and Midland Bank, but he could not say they had passed through Perryman's account.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice A. T. Lawrence said that that criticism went to the value of the evidence, and not to its admissibility.</p>
               <p>At the request of Sir C. Mathews, his Lordship made the following note of the objection: "Mr. Hall and Sir C. Mathews object to the evidence because the numbers of the notes are not traced into the London City and Midland Bank to the account of Perryman. I rule that the evidence is admissible, but that the objection goes to value."</p>
               <p>Down to January 4, 1905, my evidence is not based upon the tracing of the exact numbers into Perryman's account, but I find payments of particular notes out of Smith's account, and that pay<lb/>ments of similar or greater amounts are made upon the same day into Perryman's account, and that the notes which came out of Smith's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210259"/>
               <p>account went to the Bank of England from the London City and Midland Bank, Queen Victoria Street, upon dates approximating to those payments in. After January, 1905, there are no payments in of notes. Taking the case of H. K. Ablett, George Martin, May, 1906, £55 in notes were traced out by me by their numbers. They were paid in in coin. In Tyler's case I have traced £85, notes, absolutely in and out by numbers. They are marked "L.C. and M., C. W. Perryman."</p>
               <p>To Mr. Marshall Hall. That is the Fullers Earth transaction.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Muir. The item "Cash, Exact Amounts" in CS 5 means that exact amounts are paid in on the same dates as they are drawn out, in coin. £1,121, on a number of different days, were drawn out and went into Perryman's account on the same particular days in the same particular amounts, between February and October, 1903. From October, 1903, to June, 1904, cash in exact amounts on the same dates was drawn out of Smith's account and paid into Perry<lb/>man's account, the amount being £671 7s. In the H. K. Ablett ac<lb/>count, London and Trading Bank, between July, 1904, and March, 1906, cash in exact amounts £12. There is no cash in exact amounts in the case of George Martin. In the case of W. Tyler and Co, between October, 1906, and May, 1907, cash in exact amounts £128 14s. 6d. Tracing the amounts in cash (CS 5, 1) in 1893, there were drawn out of Herbert Smith's account and paid into Perryman's ac<lb/>count on the same dates, which I give, various sums in cash, as fol<lb/>lows: March 23, £100; March 24, £35; April 9, £100; April 18, £100; April 23, £40; April 30, £40; May 5, £110; May 11, £20; May 29, £151; June 22, £110; July 9, £100; July 15, £25. On October 5, 1903, £620 was drawn out, and £622 was paid in. By a mistake "£600" is given as being taken out Dealing with the ap<lb/>proximate amounts with regard to Herbert Smith's London Joint Stock Bank account, on January 11, 1904, £20 was drawn out in cash and £15 paid in in cash to Perryman's account the same day. On January 18 £20 was drawn out and £10 is paid in in cash. Feb<lb/>ruary 29, £22 drawn out in cash; £37 paid in in cash. March 1, £60 drawn out; £60 11s. 7d. paid in. March 2, £20 drawn out; £50 paid in. March 15, £40 paid out; £55 paid in. June 2, £30 drawn out; £26 paid in. June 3, £100 drawn out; £120 paid in. June 15, £15 drawn out; £10 paid in. The table gives the exact figures and you can draw your own inference. The dates are identical, with one exception. Then "exact amounts" in Herbert Smith's Joint Stock Bank account there were drawn out of his account and paid into Perryman's account, in cash, in each instance: October 19, £25; November 20, £30; December 15, £50; January 14, £10; January 15, £25; February 15, £120; February 22, £20; March 20, £40; March 23, £55; April 13, £22; April 15, £100; May 25, £25; June 3, £105; June 6, £20; June 14, £25; June 28, drawn out in notes and, cash £44 in notes, and £1 7s. in cash; paid into Perry<lb/>man's account £40 in notes and £1 7s. in cash. The same notes for the £40 which were paid out of Smith's account were returned to the Bank of England by the Victoria Branch of the London City and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210260"/>
               <p>Midland Bank. With regard to Chalmers and Cox's account (CS 5, 3) there were drawn out in notes on October 23, 1903, £40; paid in in notes, London City and Midland Bank, Queen Victoria Street, to Perryman's account, £40. On October 29, drawn out in notes £25, which is paid into Herbert Smith's London Joint Stock Bank, Fins<lb/>bury account. There is £25 under the heading of "Herbert Smith, London Joint Stock Bank, Finsbury," in Exhibit 216 and Exhibit 226, which is Smith's account, and in Exhibit 227, attached; there is £50 paid in in notes on that day, but not the numbers. Those notes came back to the Bank of England from the London Joint Stock Bank. On November 20 £50 is drawn out in notes and paid in in notes. There is "C. W. Perrym." on the back of the note. On November 23 £50 was drawn out in notes, and paid in in notes, en<lb/>dorsed "C. W. Perryman." That is 97391. On December 3 bank notes to the amount of £75 were drawn out and a credit of £260 paid in. The notes came back to the Bank of England from that bank. On February 1 £40 in notes were drawn out and £40 in notes was paid in to Smith's account, marked on the back "H. Smith." On February 1 a £10 note was drawn out and paid into Smith's account the same day. On February 3 £70 was drawn out, and £70 was paid in to Perryman's account. I have seen these identical notes and they have come in from me London City and Midland Bank, and have "C. W. Perryman" on the back. Turning to the account of H. K. Ablett with the London and Trading Bank (CS 5, 4) on Feb<lb/>ruary 19, 1906, a cheque drawn by Ablett in favour of Perryman was drawn out for the amount of £89 10s., and that was paid through the Clearing House, the bank clearing it being the London City and Midland Bank. There is no corresponding credit in Perryman's account. One hundred pounds in notes was drawn from Ablett's account on September 14, 1905, and paid in to Perryman's account on the same day. The notes were turned into gold at the Bank of England, and on the same day £100 is paid into Perryman's account in coin. A larger sum was paid in, nearly £500 in all, £400 of which was in notes. There is nothing to show where the £400 in notes came from on August 28 £12 in cash was drawn out of Ablett's account, and £12 cash paid into Perryman's account on the same day; on July 5 £28 was drawn out and £27 paid in; on August 24 £21 10s. was drawn out and £21 paid in. On February 23, 1906, £54 in notes and cash was drawn out and £24 was paid in. On March 5 £150 in notes and cash was drawn out and £63 in cash paid in. Taking George Martin's account with the Middlesex Banking Company, on May 7,1906, £55 was drawn out in notes and paid in in coin to Perry<lb/>man's account. Those notes were changed into gold at the Bank of England. On May 21 £132 10s. in cash was drawn out and two sums of £81 12s. 6d. and £51 in cash were paid in. On August 31 two cheques payable to Perryman were cashed over the counter at Ablett's bank, making £31 2s. 6d.: there is no corresponding entry in Perry<lb/>man's account. Taking William Tylers account with the Middlesex Banking Company on October 16, 1906, £80 were drawn out in notes and coin, and the notes were cashed at the Bank of England; and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210261"/>
               <p>on the same day £75 was paid into Perryman's account in coin. On October 18 notes and coin were drawn out of Tyler's account amount<lb/>ing to £55 2s., and the notes were cashed at the Bank of England. There were two notes of £10 each and £20 in gold. The numbers of the notes are given on Exhibit 11, and they are endorsed "C. Perry-man, 41, Charing Cross Road." Thirty-five pounds went into Perry-man's account in coin on the same day. On October 22 £110 was drawn out in notes and coin. The numbers of the notes are 65,002-3-4. It is 65,003 which is endorsed £110 was drawn from Tyler's account, £80 in notes and £30 in gold. A £10 note was paid into the Bank of England by the London City and Midland. At the same time £7 10s. was paid into Perryman's account in cash. On October 24 £60 in notes and coin was drawn out of Tyler's account and £57 in coin paid to Perryman's account. On October 29 £115 was drawn out, £65 in notes and £50 in coin, and on the same day £112 15s. was paid into Perryman's account in cash. With regard to the Fullers Earth transaction, there is a credit to the account of Tyler of £87 2s., and, deducting from that 7s. 6d., the bank charges, there is a payment out of £86 14s. 6d., the amount of the exchange cheque which was cashed across the counter, and three days later there is a credit to Perryman's account to the same amount. I produce a note for £50, No. 64407, drawn out of Herbert Smith's account on March 9, 1903. It has stamped on the face of it, "Capital and Counties Bank, Limited, Godalming," and on the back of it is written in blue pencil, "M. L. W. Perryman." On March 23 two £10 notes, 89446 and 96384, are credited to Mrs. Perrymans account On April 20. £30 in notes goes into the same account, also from Herbert Smith's account. As to £40 in notes drawn out of Herbert Smith's account on February 27 I can only say they are marked, "London and Joint Stock Banc, Lothbury." I have also prepared an analysis of the account of Alexander Fraser with the Economic Bank on the same lines. On notes amounting to £245 I find the stamp of the Argue Printing Company, £580 I trace to Herbert Smith's account with the London City and Midland Bank. Some of them are endorsed by him. Altogether there is £945 coming out of Fraser's account into the account of Herbert Smith. There are notes from Fraser's account between April 6, 1903, and July 29, 1904, amounting to £255, all endorsed by Perry-man, and £460 that cannot toe identified. The analysis of Tyler's account show that £309 4s. was paid to the Argus Printing Com<lb/>pany, £88 to Straker's, probably for stationery; London and Provin<lb/>cial Register £525 11s. 3d., and bank charges £27 4s. 2d. These I classify roughly as expenses. There are drafts on the bank under the name of stock amounting altogether to £840. There are also drawings of notes in the name of stock.

                  </persName> was further examined as to the details of the accounts.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Marshall Hall. The analyses of these re<lb/>counts were made on the instructions of the City Solicitor. I never received instructions that whilst getting out details of all notes paid out of these implicated accounts into Perry man's account I should get details of the notes that were drawn out of Perryman's account. A large sum is paid into Herbert Smith's account in notes, many thousands of pounds. For the purposes of the investigation it was not deemed necessary to trace where those notes came from. The only way those notes could be traced was by going back to the Bank of England with the numbers and that would involve very great ex<lb/>pense and very great trouble; I mean I am not in a position to do it. I made the analyses upon the evidence produced to me. With regard to Herbert Smith's account, I am unable to give all the payees the various cheques. I make out that £3,520 was paid out over the counter in notes. I cannot tell how many cheques were cashed over the counter. I have no means of checking the statement that £5,515 9s. 7d. was paid in cheques that were paid through clearing banks alone, besides others.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marshall Hall. The total amount cleared through a clearing bank according to us is £8,571, of which £5,915 is paid to stock<lb/>brokers.</p>
               <p>Witness. Out of a total of £13,039 £10,400 was paid away in cheques that went through the Clearing House, and that does look like legitimate business. The total of notes paid in is £4,585, as shown by the first column, Exhibit 226, and the two figures £4,585, City and Midland Bank, and £2,343, London Joint Stock, make £6,928 total paid in. The amount paid out in notes in No. 1 account is £3,520, and in the second account £765, making £4,285 coming out. The £765 in the Joint Stock account is part of the £1,760. You may put it that the £765 is included in the £13,000. In C.3. 11 in the account of G. Martin there is an item, Dove £1 17s. 10d. I cannot tell why in C.S. 8 Doves name is not mentioned, though there are three cheques payable to him. I had no object. I knew Dove was supposed to be landlord in C.S. 11, but did not know he was not supposed to be so in C.S. 8. I have not had instructions in regard to that. In regard to the payment in of £55 in Perryman's account on March 15, as being £55 out of Herbert Smith's account, I did not notice that on three successive days there is £55 also paid in. I only saw one of the letter-books produced by Inspector Ottaway, that was for the purpose of examining an affidavit with an original docu<lb/>ment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Leycester. In regard to C.S. 3, the price of Rio Tintos that was chosen was not the highest of the day; 65 5/8 was the price entered in the contract. It was rising slowly all day, from 3/4 to 6-8. I give no evidence as to the subsequent rising or falling. The other transaction of Mr. Lever's was Canadian Pacific, a pur<lb/>chase of £1,000 worth of stock at 175 1/2, March 15, 1906. That was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210263"/>
               <p>the opening price. It was closed at 177 7/8 en April 9. There was no dividend in the interval. There was a meeting on March 19, at which a resolution was passed as to bonus, but it was not due until April 19. During the time this transaction was going on the shares would be quoted cum. bonus. Mr. Lever was not right when he worked out the difference of 2 3/8 as £118 15s. It should have been £23 15s., as the shares were in dollars instead of pounds. It was 2 3/8 on 5,000 dollars. Mr. Lever would only be entitled to £23 15s. and £30 deposit, even assuming the £10 on Rio Tintoe ran off. With regard to Mrs. Butcher's case, the shares were quoted ex dividend on February 22. There was an interim dividend on April 3, 3 per<lb/>cent. The dividend would be known a long time beforehand. The shares were bought on February 16, at U 7 £, the highest price of the day. In Mrs. Butcher's case the matter ended in dispute, and there was never any sale of the stock. I do not, therefore, know what price to take. The price on March 1 dropped to 173 3/4, on the 2nd they were 174 1/4, and on the 6th 1734. If Mrs. Butcher's transaction had been opened at 177 1/2, the price given in the contract, and suppos<lb/>ing it was closed on March 1 at the price Ablett contends she had run off at, there would have been nothing owing to her except her deposit. With regard to Mrs. d'Altera, that was a purchase of £1,000 stock at 176 5/8. The contango notes are not in the proper form used on the Stock Exchange. I do not think it is the proper way to reckon, contango; in this particular case it is simply a statement of interest. If the "Financial Guardian" had opened the stock themselves on the Stock Exchange at the price of February 17 (176 5/8) they would, in fact, have had to pay contango. If Mrs. Butcher was to be credited with the dividend, the other people would by entitled to charge in<lb/>terest in some shape or form.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence. Interest on what?.</p>
               <p>Witness. On the amount of the stock, at a rate; but that is exactly what I complain of, that when the final account is rendered to this lady three dividends have passed, and not one has been credited. Up to March 25 the would be entitled to two dividends, £70 less income tax. At certain times she might have closed and got a profit.</p>
               <p>Mr. Leycester contended that the "Financial Guardian" had a right to charge interest in a transaction which was kept open for an in<lb/>definite period, where the client was to be credited with dividend on the larger amount supposed to be invested—not in this case neces<lb/>sarily, but that was the proper way of drawing up the account between the parties. Mr. Justice Lawrence saw he could not see any right accruing to them to make the charge unless they actually made a contract with someone else, and opened the stock in their own name. They must show in the circular some bargain by which a sum was to be paid, in order to entitle them to charge their client with the interest.</p>
               <p>Witness. I should like to point out that the circular deliberately contemplates the purchase of the stock, otherwise, the dividend can never be collected.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210264"/>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. A. L. Jones. In regard to C.S. 5, showing on one side number of sums drawn out of Tyler's account, and on the other payments in to Perryman's account, the payments to Perryman are in coin, and there is no means of really identifying them, or the payments out of Tyler's account. There are some thousands of pounds paid in to the account of Tyler and Co., and those few I give are the only amounts that I suggest correspond with any payments to Perryman's account. With the exception of the £127 in cash and £85 in notes they do not correspond exactly.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. The reason I said that Herbert Smith's account, London and Joint Stock Bank, looked more like a legitimate business was that there are cheques drawn for considerable sums about the middle and end of each month, which looks like a Stock Exchange account—a stockbroker's banking account. There are also larger sums paid in cheques through that account than through the others. With the others, I am struck by the fact that there are very large sums drawn out in notes and gold. In the ordinary way it is most unusual to find accounts of the present day where such a large pro<lb/>portion are in bank notes and coin.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Justice Lawrence. With active shares it is not true that the quotation ex-dividend is the same as cum. dividend. Rio Tintos and Canadian Pacifies are very active; variations occur every hour or so. It must follow as a matter of course with active shares that when they became ex-dividend they decline to the extent of the dividend declared. There may be extraneous reasons why the price should not fall by the amount of dividend, but taking the example which your lordship asked for, and which I turned up and put in, the variation corresponds exactly. In my opinion it is less true with international shares to say that the price does not change when they are sold ex-dividend, because, they are dealt with over such a large area, and there are more people interested in their fluctuations.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I have known Herbert Smith 15 years. I have known Tyler since 1895 or 1896 when he was director of one or more companies with which I was connected. Harris became my clerk in about 1886, when the "Finan<lb/>cial Observer" was being published. Hawkee was sub-editor of that paper. It ceased to exist in 1896. Herbert Smith was in the tea trade. I had not seen him for some 10 or 12 Years when I met him accidentally in 1900 in an inside stockbrokers office with whom I did business, where he came to look at the tape and get prices. Harris was in the employment of that firm, and I learnt that Smith was working with his brother, who was a stockbroker near Lombard Street. 43, Moorgate Street, was the office of two or three public companies, of which Tyler and Atkins (who is now dead) and Fardell were directors. Tyler was going to South Africa, and I wanted office room as I had large interests in companies, and I arranged with him to make my headquarters at 43, Moorgate Street. I was a director of Hannan's King Gold Mining Company and the Tinga Valley Gold Mining Company. In 1902 Smith proposed to start an outside stock<lb/>broker's business, and I agreed to back him up. He than took offices at 80, Lombard Street, but as the offices at 43, Moorgate Street were larger it was arranged to transfer the company work to Lombard Street and conduct the stockbroker's business at 43, Moorgate Street Circular of August 1, 1902, has one or two words written upon it which I believe are in my handwriting, and an alteration of the date to the "16th" from the "l st" August. No circular of that date has been sent out. I may have trimmed up some circulars for Herbert Smith. I financed Smith at the start to a very small extant—he did not want any further help. I had a large Stock Exchange business and I introduced him to a broker to obtain cover; the runner of that broker introduced him to another firm also. As a rule, outside brokers run stock against the client in their own protection and to give security to the client. Accounts are delivered fortnightly. Smith's system gave this advantage to the client who bought stock under the cover system that, if the stock fell, the client was not liable further, and he would have notice from Smith before the ac<lb/>count was closed and so would have, a day to provide further cover if he preferred, thus keeping his interest in the stock and rescuing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210266"/>
               <p>hit first cover. I did considerable business with Herbert Smith on my own account, with the object also of increasing his credit and enlarging the volume of his business. I was in the habit of paying my differences in bank notes in preference to cheques. (A Urge number of accounts were gone through with the witness to show the way banknotes were dealt with, also a number of payments to clients.) On account day I attended at Herbert Smith's office and dissected his account to find out the bargains made on my behalf and on his, and I paid my differences to him. Herbert Smith died in October. 1905 Previous to and after that date Harris was conducting his business Some 15 or 16 days before Herbert Smith's death, Harris transferred the banking account, or, rather, he opened a new banking account with the London Joint Stock Bank in the name of Herbert Smith. I knew that Harris was going to carry on the business in the name of Herbert Smith. Harris and I saw Smith at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. Smith raised no objection at all. Harris got permission to continue the business in the name of Smith. Harris continued the business under the name of Herbert Smith. The account at the Lon<lb/>don Joint Stock Bank was opened on October 5, 1904. That account appears to have been carried on in the same way by Harris frost October, 1903, to June, 1904, I saw Mrs. Herbert Smith only twice. She came to see me by appointment. I think the dates she gave were about correct. I then had an interview with her, and told her that the business was hers, as she was the widow, and asked her what she would like to be done with it Harris was introduced to her on that first occasion. Harris made the appointment for me to see her, and she was then told by me that the business belonged to her—that Harris had been managing it alter her husbands death in the same way as when her husband was alive. I thought she knew all about it. She did not say she knew nothing about it then. She said she would consider the question, and ask her brothers. That interview was six months before the letter of June 28, 1904, was written. She did not know, as she stated, that Herbert Smith had taken offices at 80, Lombard Street. I received the letter of June 28, 1904, from Mrs. Herbert Smith (Exhibit 229), in which she says, "The enclosed has just arrived. Will you be good enough to see that I am not troubled again with application for rent." That was the rent of 80, Lombard Street. The letter continues: "It is very painful to receive letters addressed to my poor husband. I think it would be better not to trade under his name." Up to that time Mrs. Herbert Smith had not made any objection at all on her part as to not trading under her husband's name. I answered that letter, and asked her to come and see me, which she did within two days of June 27. She then said the same as she says in her letter, namely. that she did not desire the business to be carried on any more under her husband's name. Harris was there at the same time, and I said that under the circumstances it must be stopped, and it was stopped the next day. The Last account with the bank was the following day June 30. Bleach's statement about putting up the name—that Harris</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210267"/>
               <p>asked him and that he consulted with me, and that I told him to do it, is not accurate—my words were, "I had no objection." I was then paying the rent at 27, Sun Street. Bleach naturally thought it right to ask me whether I had any objection to the name going up, and I said "No." I did not in any way suggest that the name of "Herbert Smith" should be put up in Sun Street; it did not origi<lb/>nate from me. This was following on the interview with Mrs. Smith. The reason why assented to the name of "Herbert Smith" going up was that, although the business was shut down as from June 30, a good many accounts had to be cleared up—it took six months or more to clear it up. There were bargains open which had to be shut, and accounts had to be finished with. The exhibits in the letter-book which has bean exhibited show that only two letters were ever written from Sun Street. Dealing with the Joint Stock Bank account from the dates that have been given, out of a total of £13,039 paid in, according to Mr. Cash's figures, a sum of £11,519 was paid out to clearing bankers, and over the counter only £1,506 15a. 0d. Out of that amount £150 came to my account by way of notes. This is Herbert Smith's "No. 2" account. I have looked through Herbert Smith's account, and I find that £4,565 was said into his account in notes, and £199 0s. 11d. paid in in coin. Out of a total of £4,764 paid in in notes and cash, I provided quite £4,000. I was financing Harris, if necessary. I had to occasionally, because he had not got enough money to pay his accounts. Harris was carrying on business in exactly the same way as Smith did—he was protecting himself. He had an account for that purpose in the same way. For the pur<lb/>pose of assisting Harris I let him take some of my Stock Exchange accounts with one broker. Referring to Mr. Cash's figures, I, find payments out to stockbrokers between October 5, 1903, and June, 1904, totaling to £5,879 17s. 10d. After Harris had closed these transactions of Herbert Smith's I never did any business on my own in the name of Herbert Smith. I never had any direct association or responsibility with the firm of Herbert Smith, and never controlled it it is not true to suggest, as has been suggested by the detective in his information, that I was practically "Herbert Smith." In 1904 a bankruptcy issue was directed to be tried as to whether I was "Herbert Smith." That came on before Mr. Registrar Gifford, and lasted about a fortnight. I was represented by counsel and examined and cross-examined for days. The result of that was that Mr. Re<lb/>gistrar Gifford delivered a considered judgment in my favour. That decision was appealed from in the Court of Appeal. (Mr. Muir submitted that this was not admissible in evidence. Mr. Marshall Hall submitted it was evidence, inasmuch as one of the issues now being tried was practically whether Perryman, at this period, was "Herbert Smith." If he (the learned counsel) could prove that that was a mere resjudicator it was admissible. Mr. Justice A. T. Lawrence said that it was not resjudicata between the present parties, and that the Crown was not bound by any finding of the Court of Appeal. He did not see how it was admissible. Mr. Marshall Hall said that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210268"/>
               <p>his real reason was that he did not want it to be suggested that he was keeping it back in any way, and that he would leave it for cross-examination if counsel for the prosecution so desired.)</p>
               <p>To Mr. Marshall Hall. I have looked through the letter book 13, one of the many letter books found at Tokenhouse Buildings, and there is not any letter there in my handwriting. I have also looked through all the 10 or 12 letter books, and there is no letter in my handwriting. There are a great many accounts that are not in my handwriting. Those that are in my handwriting are the ones that I dissected from the accounts received from stockbrokers when I dissected the amount. In taking out the amount I took out for Smith the other items that appeared; they are protected accounts that had been opened with stockbrokers.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Justice Lawrence. On pay day there were two or three brokers' accounts, which bad to be dissected to see what my share was, and also in those brokers' accounts there are coverings for some of these clients, which necessitated an account being made out iden<lb/>tical with the statement in the stockbrokers' accounts; so when I took out my portion of the account I took out certain other accounts there for the purpose of sending to Herbert Smith's clients. The ac<lb/>counts that I have seen in this book are ones that were coverings and appear in the accounts that the stockbrokers tendered to Herbert Smith.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Marshall Hall. As to those that I have called out to the Judge, where it says "Paid," I have traced cheques out of Herbert Smith's account; they total to between £900 and £1,000, in this book, paid out to clients between October 9 and December 11, 1903. With regard to Sun Street, the only letters that went from there appear to be letters of April 5 and 10. My connection with Bleach was in this manner. I suppose that 20 years ago I knew Bleach's father and elder brother, who was foreman printer at the printing works where my paper was published. He died, I think, about 1892 or 1893, and then his brother, the witness Bleach, took his place, and after the "Financial Observer" and "Mining Herald" was stopped Peach has only had from me company work or my own private work. He was an old servant, and he had gone out of his way to get him work. Since he had had no regular income from his (witness's) paper he had been very poor. Witness had continually lent him money. With regard to the 125 cheques, as to which he originally swore were paid to him, that is not so, because all the earlier ones were paid to his father or his brother, because they were matters connected with the printing of the "Financial Observer." Bleach said on the second examination that they amounted in all to about £300, of which £60 or £70 were cheques he had from me to change for himself, and the balance, £230, had to be accounted as money lent. (To the Judge.) With regard to the changing of cheques to which he referred, what happened was that witness used to lend Bleach his post-dated cheque for £5 or £6 for his accommodation, and he gave me the money when it became</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210269"/>
               <p>due. It is wrong to say I was hard up and wanted money. The money I lent Bleach was to get him out of trouble. I not only paid the rent and the rent of the machine, but I paid the rent of Bleach's private bouse when the brokers were share. The total amount during the period we are dealing with, according to Bleach's statement, was £200, but I thought it was very much less. That worked out to somewhere between 15a. and a £1 a week. With reference to Sun Street, as Bleach wanted work, the original idea was that we should restart the "Financial Observer," of which I still own the copyright—not the "Financial Guardian." There was no object in my personally starting any other paper, as I was rather well-known in connection with the "Financial Observer." The next thing was where the offices should be. Bleach said he had had a convenient place offered to him in Sun Street, Finsbury, and he suggested taking it at £30 a year. I talked over the question of plant and machi<lb/>nery with Bleach, and he arranged to get both from a large firm who did this kind of business, and to have it on the hire system. I undertook to pay the rent of the offices and Bleach got the machinery and plant in. It was only adapted for newspaper work. Bleach did not get much work in, and went on for about a month or so, and then I abandoned the idea, saying that I did not want to be bothered over the paper any more. I told-Bleach that if he liked to keep on the printing works he could have the benefit of the amount that I had paid on the machinery. Bleach kept them on for a year as he stated. The alleged conversation that Bleach spoke to with re<lb/>ference to some case pending in the Courts was absolutely untrue. Bleach has never spoken to me at any period anywhere about the matter in question. I was attending the Court on subpoena, and saw Bleach in the Court, but had never spoken to him in the Court or near the Court. I was appearing on the same side that Bleach was. There was no question whether I was Ablett or anybody else. The case was not heard, and there was no occasion for Bleach making the suggestion he did. There was an Ablett. I have seen Ablett. I have never posed as Ablett or represented myself to be Ablett, or been accused by anybody as being Ablett. Bleach has been repeatedly in the company of two policemen. I and my friends have seen him in public-houses. The whole tale is a myth. I have known Parkinson many years. He or his firm did work for me in connection with the "Finan<lb/>cial Observer." I should call him an unintelligent witness. I think he has made a mistake when he says I have given him orders on ac<lb/>count of these people. Probably ha is confusing in his mind the circumstance that at some time, for some months, or weeks, he had orders through me for work which has been paid for, and he is simply muddling what the orders were. I knew of the Lombard Financial Corporation, but I have never had the least to do with it, nor with the business of the "Financial Guardian," either under the name of Ablett or Martin or Wood. I had not the least to do with the business of "Tyler and Co." I did not know it existed.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210270"/>
               <p>I have never in my life been to Pinner's Hall, and never had any con<lb/>nection other than I have described with Herbert Smith or with any other business excepting that I knew the Lombard Financial Corpora<lb/>tion was run by Herbert Smith. Part of the coverings that Herbert Smith did were as to the Lombard Financial Corporation clients, and part of the notes that are traced out by Mr. Cash from Fraser's ac<lb/>counts to Smith were on account of the very losses incurred for the Lombard Financial Corporation clients, which Mr. Cash will find were taken out on pay days. We did not know that Mr. Cash would be a witness until just before this trial started, and we did not know what he was going to say. The prosecution were put under an obliga<lb/>tion to give us notice of new evidence by October 10. Mr. Cash has made a great fuss with regard to £70 drawn out on March 11 in notes and traced to Herbert Smith's account, but if he will turn no Ellis's account of March 11 be will find that that £70 went into Ellis's account and was paid out of Percy Ellis's account on different Stock Exchange transactions that were coverings for clients. The Lombard Financial Corporation is at 80, Lombard Street. That was started on or about July 9, 1902. The offices were taken by the real Herbert Smith from Dr. Bennett. I never gave any guarantee to Dr. Bennett; I never saw him in my life or wrote to him. I was not in any way responsible for Herbert Smith taking those premises. It has not been suggested that there is anything wrong with the Lombard Financial Corporation that I know of. I have known Parkinson for many years. I introduced business to him. I never gave him any orders for printing for Chalmers and Cox; he got them from Hawkes. I knew Hawkes was running Chalmers and Cox. With reference to the quasi guarantee given to Parkinson. What happened was this, Mr. Parkinson came to see me, saying that he was in serious trouble with his managing director, and the directors of the company he re<lb/>presented. I knew some of them. He said there was a chance of his entirely losing his situation. I asked him what was the matter. He said his instructions were not to give anybody more than one circu<lb/>lar credit—that is to say, the last circular had to be paid for before a new one was issued, or printed, by the Argus Company. He said that on my recommendation of Hawkes and Smith he had extended the credit and that they had not paid. I said I could not afford to lose my credit with the Argus (which was unlimited), and as I did not want to see him lose his situation I would do my best to stir no Hawkes and Smith to pay the accounts, and if he did not get paid in two months' time I would see that his firm lost nothing by it. The three accounts Parkinson referred to were Chalmers and Cox, Herbert Smith, and Fraser. I saw Hawkes at the first opportunity and pressed him to pay his account with the Argus, and he did so. Hawkes is Chalmers and Cox. I pressed Harris to pay the other one, and be could not afford to do it. The other two accounts were both practi<lb/>cally Herbert Smith and Fraser. Harris not paying, I did. I be<lb/>came liable under my guarantee, and I paid. The only cheques out of my stolen cheque book that they have got, paid to the Argus—stolen</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210271"/>
               <p>by the police—are those paid on account of the guarantee. I never paid them one farthing at any date on account of these accounts or circulars except under the guarantee I had given to Parkinson, and they were only paid later than the date of the guarantee. I never paid Parkinson's firm anything in respect of work done subsequent to the date of the guarantee. I have examined the books of the Argus, and find they did no work for any of them after September, 1904, the date of the guarantee. I think Parkinson said they did, but I think he is muddled. The copy of the guarantee set out in Parkinson's evidence is ah exact copy of the guarantee I gave. The Argus Company, through Messrs. Lewis and Lewis, sued me on my guarantee in the month of December, 1904, before my guarantee had become operative. I do not remember whether I put in any defence to it. They got judgment; I think we agreed it. I was then served with a bankruptcy notice, which was set aside on the ground that it did not tally with the description in the judgment. They put in the bankruptcy notice "Trading as Herbert Smith." That was dismissed. In the bundle of circulars (Exhibit 204) there are all sorts of things—letters, draft circulars, and so on. The draft circular covering several pages is in Hawkess handwriting. What has been sworn to be my handwriting consists practically of the addition or alteration of a few words. Hawkes was a very proficient circular writer, and a very good newspaper writer of large experience. I should think he in over 70 years old; he may be 80. On page 12 of this there art the words, "just declared" in my writing. The explanation of that is this—that these are evidently drank circulars and draft letters of Hawkess; and if he had asked me (as no doubt he did) to make a grammatical altera<lb/>tion or an alteration affecting finance; I did do it; he is not the only person I have done it for. I am not sure that anything I have altered here has been used—probably not. The alterations come to nothing; I think they are only a word, or a line, or a dot. With regard to 90, Lombard Street I gave a reference for Herbert Smith (Exhibit 191). It is dated as being received on July 6, 1902. That was the time when Herbert Smith was thinking of taking No. 80, Lombard Street for the. purposes of his own business. I had forgotten all about the circumstance until the prosecution brought it forward. I have given references for other people. The other reference was given by Harms (Exhibit 192). The Kalgoorlie Company was a com<lb/>pany I had been associated with years before. The paper is dated July 15, 1890. It is evidently a paper that had been prepared before 1900. There is a wonderful lot of paper, but there are very little alterations in it. There are one or two figures put in here—what last year's total amount of income from the railway was. I pot that in; I had been asked to do it. Mr. Bass is right in saying there are a number of minute alterations in my writing in that bundle. I have 'lotted an "i" and crossed a "t" I knew there was an account of Fraser at the Economic Bank. The only way I can explain as to how some of the memoranda on some of the counterfoils is in my handwriting is that it would be coincident with a Stock Exchange</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210272"/>
               <p>Pay Day, when finance had to be arranged in some shape or form somewhere, and there was always a little scrimmage or squeeze to pay the obligations and finance one from the other, and as Herbert Smith treated the Lombard Corporation as his own account—the same as his own business—probably I should not be at all surprised that I filled up a cheque; I believe I have filled up some of Herbert Smith's cheques before now. (To the Judge.) I think Fraser is Herbert Smith; I am not sure about it. (To Mr. Marshall Hall.) I had not anything to do with the carrying on of any business by anybody in the name of Fraser. The cheque not turned down, which have been sworn to be my writing. I think are in my writing. There are one or two queries. I never gave any orders for any circulars for the Lombard Financial Corporation. I had an office at 41, Charing Cross Road, which I gave up a year last September, where I used to keep books, etc.</p>

                  </hi> (recalled) further examined by Mr. Marshall Hall. Herbert Smith's account with the London Joint Stock Bank was practically closed on June 29. There was a pay<lb/>ment in on June 30 of £30, and three small cheques were subse<lb/>quently drawn, leaving a balance of £11 4s. 9d., which was subse<lb/>quently transferred under a garnishee order. The business of Chal<lb/>mers and Cox was Hawkes'e and was in no way suggested or inspired by me and I had nothing to do with financing the business. The office at 2, Tokenhouse Buildings was taken from Dove by Hawkes. Dove sent for me and asked me if I knew Mr. Hawkes. I said that I had known him for ten years as a respectable man and thought he would keep his obligations, and I said I would do what I could to see that his rent was paid, but I gave no guarantee whatever. As a net result I was not called upon at all under that so-called guarantee. Mr. Hawkes paid all the rent. When Hawkes had left, and some time after these same premises had been taken over by Harris, I gave Harris two of my cheques for £18 15s. each drawn in favour of Dove. Doves evidence as to a cheque previously given by me, but never cashed, is correct. I gave a cheque for £56 5s. I do not know who paid the money. I only know it was paid. Whatever expression Mr. Dove may have used, in point of fact no guarantee was ever given by me. The words I used were, "I will see that it is all right." Hawkes did borrow some money of me about the time he went in. I saw him very occasionally. He came and bought shares of me, and also un<lb/>covered a small number of stocks with me. He asked my advice upon financial matters. He also did stocks with Smith. He ran his busi<lb/>ness honestly and paid his accounts. I might not see Hawkes for six months, or I might run against him two or three times a week. I never went to Tokenhouse Buildings when the business of Chalmers and Cox was being carried on there between 1903 and 1905, and did not give orders for circulars. I used to see Hawkes at 43, Moorgate Street. I did not go to Tokenhouse Buildings until after February</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210273"/>
               <p>1905. For years past I have advised people in respect of their circus<lb/>lars. I used to advise George Gregory, the largest outside broker we have ever had. I used to write for him, and I used to advise other people. I was supposed to have some knowledge, having had 20 years' experience of newspaper work. There is a very large honest business being done by outside broken at the present time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence. What does that meant "Honest business" is such a comprehensive term.</p>
               <p>Witness. Outside broken have been dubbed "bucket shops," which is presumably an offensive term for the purpose of assuming that they are fraudulent institutions, but there is a great number of sound, honest, outside broken who conduct legitimate businesses now and have done for the last 20 yean to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence. Does that mean places when they specu<lb/>late in differences, but speculate in differences honestly?.</p>
               <p>Witness. No, large transactions in genuine shares and the trans<lb/>ference both by sales and purchases of genuine shares. An outside broker's is not only a place where people speculate in differences, but thousands and thousands of pounds, hundreds of thousands of pounds, pass in the legitimate transfer of shares. I think every outside broker does both businesses. Naturally no outside broker confines himself to any particular class of business. As a rule he takes any business that comes to him. If a man wants to buy shares he buys them and deliver them to him; if he wants to speculate in dif<lb/>ferences, he speculates for him. A shareholder will, I presume, sell to anybody if he is paid. I have received money from Hawkes, but after this lapse of time it is rather difficult to give particulars. Generally speaking, if Hawkes has 'paid me money it has been 'small amounts advanced on loan; other amounts have been for shares sold, and there would be cover on stocks that might be open. The offices at Tokenhouse Buildings consisted of two rooms and a lobby. From February, 1906, to Christmas, 1906, I used to give assistance occa<lb/>sionally at 2, Tokenhouse Buildings. I knew Harris was carrying on an outside broker's business. The name of the "Financial Guardian" was on the door, and I saw a man there named Ablett. The name of the "Financial Guardian" was not up in Hawkes's time. The person I saw as Ablett was of different identity from Harris. I should think I saw Ablett half a dosed times; it did not run long after I font saw him; I should think about two months. In 1905 I used to see people at Tokenhouse Buildings by appointment. So far as I knew the business of the "Financial Guardian" was an honest business. I knew nothing of the existence of a man named Martin in connection with it. I cannot say when I first knew that Harris and Martin were identical. I eventually moved some papers and things there from 41, Charing Cross Road. I think that was in Sep<lb/>tember, 1906, shortly before I took a room for myself, on which were the letters "C. W. P." Those paper, weighing about 2 cwt., and in<lb/>cluding some old "Financial Observe," some cheque books, and two tin boxes of private paper are now in the hands of the police.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210274"/>
               <p>I also removed there some papery I had stored at Old Jewry. The draft account sent to Mrs. D'Altera is in my handwriting. This is not a Stock Exchange account at all. It is a calculation of so many days' interest on a certain amount of money on contango. It has happened more than once when I have been there that Harris has asked me to check his making up of the contangoes, and I have checked them while I have been waiting. What happened about this particular account was that I found it was wrong, and I wrote it out again. The initials H.K.A. (Ablett) and G.M. (George Martin) were copied from the original account. I have done the same thing on other occasions. At the end of 1906, or the early part of January, 1907, I entered into an agreement with Dove to take two separate rooms at 2, Tokenhouse Buildings as from December 25. 1900. They were in quite another part of the building. At the time I was living in the country. Harris had been an old servant of mine and used to do odd jobs for me when I was not in town, such as going to the stores and paying accounts. I used to give him cheques in blank. Sometimes my cheques were filled in by Miss Mabel Long, who was Harris's clerk. That happened in the case of the account of a stockbroker named Allen on one occasion when I was going away. I did not know the amount of the account, and gave a cheque to Harris to be filled in. As to the statement that my two "C. W. P." rooms were unfurnished, I cannot think why that should have been said. They were furnished as much as was wanted. There were three chairs, a flap table, a roll-top desk, and a settee, and they are there now. There was only one door to the two rooms. They were totally distinct from the "Financial Guardian" offices, and no use was made of them by anybody else except myself. My papers were not removed from the "Financial Guardian" offices, because I had entered into an agreement to do my new offices up; they wanted some carpentry work, painting, and cleaning. I am still a tenant of these offices. I have taken out some of the accounts for stock that I opened for Harris. The total amount opened by Cutliffe, Lea, and Co. from the middle of March to the middle of November. 1905, was £120,386 Ss. 3d., and the loss in differences paid was £837 5s. 4d. The account with Waiter Allen runs from August, 1905, to December, 1906. The amount of stock opened was £349.486. and the amount of differences paid was £2,560.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence. What did he receive in differences? They cannot all have been such bad bargains.</p>
               <p>Witness. I am afraid it was a time when markets continued fall<lb/>ing, and it was all on the wrong side. Prices in some instances are hall what they were two years ago. To take a well-known instance, Brighton "A" have fallen 50 points in six months.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence. The wonder is that with your experience you do not foresee these falls. You always buy for the rise.</p>
               <p>Witness. If we could only job backwards we should all be mil<lb/>lionaires, but we cannot foresee. Personally, I have made money on the Stock Exchange by being a "bear" not by being a "bull." All</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210275"/>
               <p>these bargains were effected in my own name. Union Pacific have fallen 90 points, and holders of £1,000 stock would have lost £900 in a year. Southern Pacifics have dropped 35 points, or 40 per cent. Caledonian Railways have dropped 50 per cent.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence. Do not let us have too many harrowing details of this sort.</p>
               <p>Witness. In another account, that of Jakes and Co., the stocks opened (between September and November, 1905, were £20,000, and the loss paid was £498. In the case of C. J. Ellis, commencing August, 1906, the stocks were running up to April, the time of this charge, and amounted to £39,981, and the losses paid are £773 19s. 4d. To the best of my belief the majority of this was Harris's stock. When I took the "C. W. P." offices I was negotiating two companies. This charge has had something to do with their not having been brought out, but the companies also dragged because the markets were bad. Mrs. Strick was my clerk from 1886 to 1896, and left me to get married. An extraordinary thing is that I met her outside policeman Ottaway's premises, in Old Jewry, about a fort<lb/>night before the trial began, and she said, "I have been to the police." It is not true that I ever asked her to take in letters in the name of Ablett. Tyler told me he had found suitable offices at 79 1/2, Gracechurch Street, but Smiles who was acting for the landlord, would not let without a guarantee, which I gave. There was some trouble about the superior landlord, and I demanded the guarantee back, but did not get it. After that Tyler went to 16 and 17, Great St. Helens, and was joined by Gibbs. Gibbs had had 30 years ex<lb/>perience on the Stock Exchange in Industrial shares. Grosvenor, a friend of Gibbs, was going to assist in the business. I had nothing to do with the taking of the offices, and was never there while Gibbs was there. Mr. Muir's statement in his opening speech that I guaranteed the rent is absolutely untrue. In December, 1906, Tyler came to me at 2, Tokenhouse Buildings, and told me Gibbs was leav<lb/>ing and going back to the Stock Exchange. Tyler also said he had established the business, and thought it would be a prosperous one, and asked if I would help him, He wanted to borrow a little money, and he also wanted shares for the purpose of dealing in. I lent him £30, and subsequently another £30 for his rent. With reference to the circular of Messrs. Pope and Westlake, I then owned, and still own, two founders' shares in the Fullers Earth Union. I knew If there was a willing buyer if I could find a willing seller I could make a profit between the two, and for the purpose of finding a seller I selected Tyler as intermediary, as I thought it was the class of busi<lb/>ness he required. As a result he purchased Lord Kilmorey's share for £50 and I gave him £55 for it, and resold it to Pope and West-lake by arrangement for £89. When their cheque for £87 2s. arrived I asked Tyler to give me an exchange cheque for it, which I cashed for notes, yet the police have put down these notes which they traced to my bank as being part of the proceeded of Tyler's alleged frauds against Chef parties, whereas they bad the counterfoil in their hands</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210276"/>
               <p>and could see this was a mere exchange. It shows the way they have persecuted we. As Tyler then owed me £60 I credited him with £55, the price of the share, and he gave me £5 to clear the matter up. I was arrested on June 27, but my letters and cheque-books were stolen on June 11, 16 days before any charge was made against me. As regards my habit of changing cheques into cash I produce a large number from various customers. I have evidence as to over £11,000, but that does not represent one half, because people do not always keep their cheques, and I cannot trace them. When I was at Tokenhouse Buildings I made some alterations to circulars once or twice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Muir. I began to attend at 43, Moorgate Street in 1900 for about three times a week for an hour in the morn<lb/>ing. I was then looking after some companies. One of them was the Rand Roodeport Gold Mining Co., which is still alive. The officials of that company were Mr. Tyler, Mr. Atkins, Mr. Fardell, and Colonel Thompson. I was only interested as a shareholder. My name did not appear as a public officer of the company. Another was the Teign valley Mining Company, which I think has been re<lb/>constructed. It has never paid any dividend. I was a director of that, and I think Mr. Ashworth was. There was a third, whose name I have forgotten. Another company was the Kalgoorlie Prince, which is still in existence. I had some shares. I believe it is earning money. I have ceased to be a shareholder for three or four years. None of the companies paid a dividend in my time. I believe there were two secretaries. One was named Nicholas; I forget the name of the other. I think there was one clerk. Harris in 1901 or 1904 became secretary of the Rand Roodeport. It was a few months after that that Smith appeared upon the scene. He came there with the idea of starting this business. He consulted me about it on and off for about two years. We talked the matter over, but I do not sup<lb/>pose I advised him to do it. Smith had been in the tea trade, and had become bankrupt. He had not much capital to start a business with. I should say the business of an outside broker was not a risky but a safe business. I do not endorse the suggestion that it is con<lb/>ducted oy the outside broker against clients. It does not follow that if the clients win the outside broker must lose; they may both quite easily win at the same time, and very often do. I do not agree to the proposition that the outside broker's profits are limited to the amount of the cover. If you say the client's liability is so limited that is perfectly true, but the broker cannot always win what the client loses; sometimes the cover lost may go into three or four hands. I consider the position of the outside broker a safe one, not necessarily at the expense of the public. It may be at the expense of the Stock Exchange. As far as I knew Herbert Smith's business was a model of what an outside broker's ought to be, I did not encourage Smith to start the outside broking business, I said I would back him. That is not necessarily encouraging him. It was his desire, not mine. The first thing in starting an outside</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210277"/>
               <p>broker's business is to draft circulars. Smith did that for himself. He was a good writer, one of the best circular writers I ever saw in my life. Neither Harris nor Hawkes drafted circulars for Herbert Smith that I know of. The usual way is to copy some other broker's circular. I do not know that I gave him any to copy. Atkins was the principal man at 43, Moorgate Street. He was a director. I believe I was on the voters' list. I cannot tell how I got there. Miss Long was Smith's clerk. Harris was manager of the business from the beginning. Herbert Smith took an active part, and at far ss I know was there daily. I cannot name any person who is here as a witness who has ever seen Herbert Smith. I do not believe that Bleach saw him only once, and I think that the story that Bleach had to have Smith pointed out to him by a lady clerk is an Invention. As to Mrs. Strick having only seen him once I do not suppose she has ever been there more than once. I never saw her there at all. Jessie Oyler was employed there about twelve months. If she thought Harris was Smith I cannot help that. There was no necessity for Smith to go into the office where the young lady clerk was, and she might have been there twenty years without seeing him. Besides she sat with her face to the window, and would not see anybody com<lb/>ing into the room. Parkinson, who identified the photograph of Smith, used to come about once in three months. As to the statement of Mr. Gash that £12,000 came into, the business, it passed through the banking account, but that is not money coming into the business. I consider the foot that Smith only had 4s. a day quite consistent with his controlling a business of this magnitude. With regard to my own position towards the business, I simply dealt through Herbert Smith. I was his client. I opened stocks for myself on the Stock Exchange, and they were debited to Smith's account, and the con<lb/>tracts went to Herbert Smith, in the name of Herbert Smith. Herbert Smith also opened stocks in his own name for his own protection. I met the brokers at Smith's office, and the stocks were put down to him with the knowledge of the brokers. I never gave orders to stock<lb/>brokers to cover for Herbert Smith. The volume of business Smith did gave him credit. I attended on pay-day, and picked out the stocks that were mine. Without a technical knowledge of the neces<lb/>sities of this business it is very difficult for anybody to follow it. I hare technical knowledge, but counsel have not very great know<lb/>ledge, end his Lordship is rather strange-to it. Herbert Smith, either by himself or through Harris, opened stock on the Stock Ex<lb/>change to protect his clients, and I opened stock on the Stock Ex<lb/>change through the same broker who was dealing for Herbert Smith, and those contracts went down to Herbert Smith's account. When pay-day came round I had to take up my three or four loans in order to know what I had to pay or receive, and the balance of the account belonged to Herbert Smith. If there was a profit on the account I got it from Herbert Smith, why in turn got it from the broker; if there was a loss the broker had to look to Smith for it. I was there paying differences and looking after the accounts. It is not. true</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210278"/>
               <p>that I took only notes and gold in payment; I also took cheques. I had a bad a strong preference for gold and notes. I do not accept the proposition that the broker might have to sue Smith, and might get nothing. I do not suppose I gained anything by not dealing with the broker in my own name. I did it for the purpose of ex<lb/>tending Smith's credit. I suppose that as a consequence Smith got better terms from the brokers. He did not get anything from me for doing it, except my assistance. I am not prepared to say that there are no cheques drawn in my name. I do not at all see that if a person in my position was trying to carry on business in the name of Herbert Smith, and desired to conceal his identity, he would have adopted the method which I adopted. I have drawn cheques in Smith's favour. My cheques have been stolen by the police.</p>
               <p>Mr. Muir appealed to the court that the police should not be sub<lb/>jected to offensive epithets of the kind.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence. I think it is very offensive and very un<lb/>wise.</p>
               <p>Witness. I cannot describe it by any other word. I paid Smith thousands of pounds. I had the settlements with Herbert Smith about every fortnight, on which we were able to tell on the contract notes how much was his and how much mine, and so a payment would be made on one side or the other. If there were £100 or £1,000 due to me he would make it up by handing me a number of cheques or notes, etc. I do not think I ever got gold in large amounts from him. The money was paid into my bank, as a matter of fact, by one of my clerks. It does not follow they were all fortnightly settlements; they would in some instances be on pay-days, sometimes not. There is confirmation to be found of amounts paid through Smith to me on paydays. They did not represent the whole of the payments from Smith to me, because it was not always paid on the pay-days. Your question as to what there would be in my banking account to show I was not conducting the business of Herbert Smith and receiving the payments made to his business is not a tenable suggestion; it is a hypothetical question, which I cannot answer. I do not see why any<lb/>thing should be shown in my account one way or the other. The fact that I acknowledge receiving cheques from Smith is sufficient. If you think because I have received cheques of Herbert Smith that therefore the business of Herbert Smith is mine, that is a hypothesis you must establish in some other way. You can find instances where Smith's cheques have gone into my account. It means nothing more than that Smith owed me the account, and paid me by those amounts. If £1,000 went into my account from Smith, from June to December, 1902, it showed he owed me the money. You say £125 only went into Smith's account; I do not know that it is so. Letter produced is from Smith to Atkins, acknowledging receipt of £100, signed by Herbert Smith. I do not think it is signed with a stamp. I have heard there was a stamp with Herbert Smith's signature. In the paying-in slip of the same date, "£100 Henry Atkins" is in my handwriting.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210279"/>
               <p>To Mr. Justice Lawrence. The reason my paying-in book was at 43, Moorgate Street was in case anything happened to be paid in. I kept it there so that if any money was owing to me I might know it was paid in and have a record. It was generally kept at home. When Herbert Smith owed me money—it might be lord several different things—I arranged with him that it was paid into my account as soon as he got it. I knew it came from him at the time; I do not know now. Perhaps he would any so, or one of his darks, or they would give me the book. The identification is obvious. If it came from Smith I knew it at the time, because I should be wanting it and asking for it, and they would take care to say that it had been paid in. That is my knowledge that the money had been paid in. Numerous amounts and names of payments in were put to witness, amounting to £959 15s., from October to December, 1902, the great majority of which were said by witness to be in Harris's writing, the exceptions being in that of a clerk.)</p>
               <p>To Mr. Muir. If £959 went into my account from Herbert Smith, and £125 went to his account, it simply showed that he owed me the money. There was £900 paid in apparently in the last three weeks of Herbert Smith's life; that was money he owed me. If he did not, it is a matter for argument whether the money ought to have gone to his widow; it ought, I think, to have gone to hit creditors. The widow had every opportunity of seeing whether Smith owed me the money; the books were there. I offered that she should take the whole business if she liked at the time of Smith's death. Harris had opened a fresh account at the London Joint Stock Bank. There was no obligation to give Mrs. Smith an opportunity of testing the rights of the thing. We have not put in the Stock Exchange accounts yet, which will go to explain a great deal of this. Harris carried on busi<lb/>ness in the name of Smith up to June 50; it was stopped because Mrs. Smith came up and requested it. The name remained up at 43, Moorgate Street, for the purpose of winding up the business. I do not know whether it was wound up in February, 1905. I was con<lb/>sulted about putting up Smith's name at 27, Sun Street, that was for the purpose of continuing the winding up. There was no need for it to be continued at 2, Tokenhouse Buildings. It was proper to have an address, it did not matter where, really. Bleach says he got all the books in March to destroy them. I do not know why they should have been destroyed. I accept no responsibility for that My books are in the possession of the police. I did not have my own books of account; I had the fortnightly account only. I have not kept books for 10 years, and have not got any receipts from Smith; there were none required. I paid the notes in and traced them. I never gave any receipts to Smith; no necessity. I have heard of actions brought against Herbert Smith and of actions by him. There was Leslie v. Herbert Smith; another one of Smith against Foster. I do not remember the date; if you will give me the date I will tell you where Herbert Smith was then. I do not know whether it was before Smith died. I do not know that he gave the address in that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210280"/>
               <p>action of 98, Thorpe Road, Forest Gate. I was not aware that it was found to be a false address. I know nothing about it. I believe the above address is Harris's. He was carrying on the business as Her<lb/>bert Smith; that is after Smith's death. I do not remember that an order for security of costs was made and not complied with and the action dismissed with costs. I do not even remember that I was sued as Herbert Smith in respect of those coats. There was an ap<lb/>plication for leave to issue. I presume I answered the affidavit in support of the application by an affidavit, if you say so. I attended to the legal documents through my solicitor; very likely I swore an affidavit that I was not a partner in nor proprietor of Herbert Smith's business. If you give me the affidavit I will tell you whether it is right or wrong. The action was settled—Smith paid the money, or Harris, I really do not know. I asked Smith to settle, and pay his debt under the issue. I have never seen the affidavit produced re Ashworth against Herbert Smith. "The fact a deposed to are within my knowledge true, and I am authorised by the defendant to make this affidavit, and am advised that the defendant has a good defence to this action." Harris ought to have been the defendant there. In regard to the sentence, "I, George Harris, etc., manager to the above-named defendant," though Smith himself had been dead a year, I was not the defendant, and Harris knew I was not Smith. In Leslie v. Smith there were some proceedings in bankruptcy, in the course of which I was asked about the action. It is true I said there that I remembered an issue being directed to try whether I was, in fact, Herbert Smith, and that I asked Smith to settle it. Smith bad been dead a year, but it was Harris I asked. I did not disclose that the original Smith was dead, because the business was being carried on. I think if a man takes the business and liabilities of Smith he becomes Smith, for the purpose of a business. The ques<lb/>tions asked were affecting Smith's business. It is true I said I first met Smith some years ago; about five. Although I said here that I had known Smith 15 years, that other matter was affecting his out<lb/>side broking operations, which began about 1900. Concerning that particular business, I said I had known him about five years. I said, "I have known him about the City, met him there. I could not tell who introduced me; he was an outside broker then." "Then" means in 1900. Twenty years ago Smith was in the tea trade; I was in the same trade. I had not seen him for 10 years before 1900; when he was in the outside broking business. That action was a blackmailing one, and I was not giving any gratuitous information to anybody. It simply referred to the, outside broking period. I also said I had last seen Smith at Moorgate Street about a year ago; that was a year before 1905. I said I had not been to Moorgate Street much lately, that I ceased going when they got attacking me in the action, that I did not think I had been there that year, and that pro<lb/>bably Smith went there after I did for all I knew. That was untrue That meant Harris, who was at 43, Moorgate Street, long after I was because I did not stop the whole time. I did not tell them durries</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210281"/>
               <p>was the same as Smith; I was not asked. It was not assumed that I was Herbert Smith. The charge in the Foster action was not as to whether I was Herbert Smith; it was an issue as to whether I was liable for costs. In regard to the question, "When you found this charge was being made against you, you did Speak to Smith about it? Yes," that was Harris. Unless you give me the date I cannot say that I was swearing it was Smith. I do not remember to whom I spoke; if it was before October, 1903, it was Smith, if it was after it was Harris. I do not think Smith was dead at the time I was saying that. If you will give me the date I will tell you; you are making some mystery about the date. You are confusing me with the Foster and Leslie actions. Mr. Barnes has acted for me some times; not frequently—Richard Barnes. The affidavits in the name of Martin were not read out, with Richard Barnes's name on them, in my hearing, nor Harris's, unless I am deaf. I do not know that Mr. Barnes acted for the defendant in the action Leslie against Smith, nor do I know that there was an agreement to pay by instalments, and a second writ issued for failure to pay. Neither do I know that there was judgment against Herbert Smith on November 10 for £100, the defence being the Gaming Act. I do not know whether such a defence sounds honest. Mr. Barnes did not tell me anything about all this. There was seen issue against me, and a notice of bank<lb/>ruptcy served. In the trial of the issue Mr. Glover was called, one of the brokers I have mentioned. He had brought an action against me for a debt, which Herbert Smith paid (that is Harris).</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence. Please do not use names in that way in this court. If you mean Harris, say Harris; if you mean Smith, say Smith.</p>
               <p>Witness. I did not do business with Adam Walker; Smith did. Walker did say before Registrar Giffard that he had been to the office and seen me, and that I was Smith. He was not believed though. It was denied by his partner, who, however, was not called. If it is there it is true that he swore I was introduced to him as Smith. I believe Alexander Robert Fraser was originally a friend of Smith's. I never saw him, and I do not think there is anybody who can be called who ever did. I believe it was intended Fraser should go into business with Smith. Smith at that time was daily at 43, Moorgate Street, being seen by Harris daily and by me several times a week. I know that bank notes out of Fraser's account have been traced into my possession. I got them from Smith—Herbert Smith—they were paid to me as part indebtedness from Smith (several amounts paid out of Fraser's account to witness were put to the latter—from April, 1903, up to July 28, 1904). These were all through Herbert Smith. I do not know why he adopted the alias of Alexander R. Fraser. I know a business in the City where there are 50 different branches in 50 different names—that is in the tea trade. The Herbert Smith busi<lb/>ness was conducted in an honest and straightforward way. The Lorn<lb/>bard Financial Corporation had a somewhat different business; it was not all on the cover system. I see no reason why H. Smith</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210282"/>
               <p>should not have had two or more businesses conducted under different names; 2, Tokenhouse Buildings were taken by Smith on my recom<lb/>mendation.</p>
               <p>(Friday, November 8.)</p>
               <p>Paying in book produced shows amounts paid into my account with the London City and Midland Bank, Queen Victoria Street, from January 25 to June 28, 1906; three slips are in my writing, four in Harris's, and the remainder are in Mabel Long's and some other clerk's handwriting. On the slip of February 2, 1906, written by Long, there are resemblances in the writing to the signature of "A. R. Fraser" in the Economic Bank signature book. Cheque-book No. 344 of A. R. Fraser has eight counterfoils in my writing. I could not tell you who filled the cheques in. I was not on confidential re<lb/>lations with Harris and he did not tell me who filled those cheques up. I do not pretend to remember, but it is probable the money was wanted for certain orders when I was doing the accounts at Smith's, and I wrote the counterfoil to indicate how much was wanted from Smith's banking account, and it was drawn from the Fraser ac<lb/>count. I have never seen Fraser. On June 29, 1904, the business of Herbert Smith was closed down—cheques of £50 and £210 in July would be the settling of old business. Of £100 drawn from Fraser's account in the Economic Bank as "Stereos," £20 in notes is paid into H. Smith's account (Harris); £20 to Chalmers and Cox (Hawkee); £20 to my account at London City and Midland Bank, and £30 to my account at Farnborough. Whatever I got I got from Mr. Harris trading as Herbert Smith. (Witness admitted that a large number of accounts and several letters in Herbert Smith's letter-books were in his writing.) I was helping Smith as much as I could, and when I was there all day I have no doubt I wrote one or two letters out of those many thou<lb/>sands. He was busy on account day, and I have helped him. On December 17, 1902, cheque Montgomery £10 was paid into my ac<lb/>count; in Fraser's letter-book, p. 91, is a letter acknowledging receipt of £10 signed A. R. Fraser, with a stamp. On December 18 "Price £10" is on my paying-in slip; on the same date is letter from A. R Fraser acknowledging receipt of £10 to Price. On December 19 in my paying-in book is "S. P. Bowles £4"—letter from Fraser acknow<lb/>ledging receipt of same. "H. D. English £5" is the same. There is no, concealment about it—the names are put in my slip. I got the cheques from H. Smith, whatever they were, and they were paid into my account and marked accordingly. There is nothing to show it comes from A. R. Fraser. January 28, 1903, Price £40; February 27, S. Hynd £10; September 14, 1903, Foster Knowles £206 7s., are amounts dealt in in the same way and the paying-in slips are in Harris's writing. I accept it as much as you like. So that the man who is carrying on the business of Herbert Smith in the name of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210283"/>
               <p>Lombard Financial Corporation when Herbert Smith it ill it paying £276 into my banking account and filling in my counterfoil paying-in slip in his own writing. I received £695 7s. in that way. The record was in Herbert Smith's books of the accounts due me and the payments made me. My accounts are here in my paying-in slips. My records show exactly what happened. Very likely the A. R. Fraser account on September 14, 1903, when £10 was paid in then only had a credit balance of £17 3s. 9d. When I had the £206 7s. probably H. Smith owed me more. The verification was in Smith's books. On February 19, 1906, in an old letter-book of Smith's is a letter from the "Financial Guardian" to Garnock. The previous letter is April 10, 1905, from Herbert Smith, 27, Sun Street, to Nicol, stating that "ill-health has caused me to give up business." Then follow letters from the "Financial Guardian" "p.p. H. K. Ablett, manager." From July, 1902, to June, 1904, there is £23,800 paid into my account. I have had speculative dealings on the Stock Ex<lb/>change, dealings in property and real estate, dealings in foreign stamps, and other things, by which I have made money. I have no account which will show what amount of my income from my dealings in land was during the two years from 1902 to 1904. I can tell you what they were and show you the cheques. I have obtained them on the undertaking of my solicitor to return them to the drawers. In a great number of instances I turned the cheques into notes. I have produced £11,000 worth of such cheques: a great portion of it did not go into my bank, but was turned into notes and paid to Smith or others, have not taken out how much went into my account as the profits of property dealing. It can be done. I dealt in stamps. I dealt with Messrs. Plumridge. I do not remember whether I paid the £160 in notes (produced) to Plumridge for stamps. It is very likely they came out of Alexander Fraser's account; if so I got them from Smith. I could tell pretty well what profit I made from dealing in stamps. As to the remainder of my income in those two years, amounting to £23,000, from dealing and speculating in shares, I have already said you cannot call income what appears on the debit side of the banking account. You must take both sides of the account. I might draw £10,000 for shares to-day and sell them to-morrow for £11,000, and the profit would be only £1,000. You cannot call the £10,000 income. I know of two actions brought against me in 1904, alleging that I ought to pay debts incurred in the name of Herbert Smith. I account for the drop that occurred in my account with the London City and Midland Bank from several thousands to £820 by the fact that the account was not used so much; there was no business doing—bad times. This was just about the time the Herbert Smith business was started, and that explains it; the Stock Exchange trans<lb/>actions were done through him. I had to pay or receive every fort<lb/>night. The moment the Stock Exchange dealings are shut down the account loses in volume, because there are no fortnightly pay<lb/>ments. Markets were bad, and I stopped dealing for the time being. Sometimes I have had £100,000 of stock open, and at other</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210284"/>
               <p>times not £5, and of course that affects the turnover and the debit and credit of the bank book. It is perfect nonsense to say that the pass-book shows one's income or the business one does. I have had a turnover of £30,000 or £40,000 in the half year, but that does not show the amount of profit I am making. I have paid out £10,000 or £12,000 in one day; the turnover in the books is nothing, and only shows I have done so much business. The fallacy of the position that I may do £100,000 worth of Stock Exchange business in one account, and may have to pay or receive only £10, but the £100,000, would our den the account. The banking account shows the volume of the debits and credits, but it does not show the amount of profit. I was aware that Hawkes was conducting the business of Chalmers and Cox. I do not know whether there was a Chalmers. I never went to 2, Tokenhouse Buildings in Chalmers and Cox's time. I formerly had an office at No. 4, Tokenhouse Buildings, but gave that up in 1899 or 1900. Hawkes drafted the circulars for Chalmers and Cox. I never heard that Harris was there at all. I had nothing to do with that business. I had no dealings with Chalmers and Cox. I had dealings with Hawkes, who probably had no other business at that time. I sold him shares and opened stock with him. I have no record of my dealings with Hawkes in the buying and selling of shares. They were effected through my account with Smith. The amount of the cover was small, perhaps £50 or £100, and he dealt only once or twice. I am not going to commit myself after four years. Hawkes, as Chalmers and Cox, paid me altogether £285. If Bleach says he printed circulars for Chalmers and Cox, with altera<lb/>tions, in my handwriting, that is very likely true. I may have made notes on the circulars if Hawkes asked me. The letter addressed, "Dear Governor," is in the handwriting of Hawkes. It may have been addressed to me. "Enclose Hairbrush's Epistle"—I do not know who "Hairbrush" is—"leaving you to finish with prices of the day. Have not mentioned Mexican Proofs., as it would only lead to apologetic effusion, perhaps best left alone. If you consider they (M.P.'s) should be touched upon you can only refer to the continued stubbornness of the market in face of all our pre<lb/>dictions having been verified. We must be very careful what we say to 'Hairbrush,' as in the event of any rupture any extravagance of suggestion would be in black and white against us. Bear this in mind. Will now go on to circs. Am better, but have been very low, which don't assist one. Can come up any day you want me if you will drop a line or wire. Hope Geo. is better. He was very sadly, I thought, when I saw him Friday. Then, Jas. Monday." "Geo." I expect is Harris. The letter is evi<lb/>dently written about the circular as to Mexican Preferences. Ap<lb/>parently I have recommended Mexican Preferences and he does not agree with it, as he says, "if you continue in your idea you can refer to the continued stubbornness of the market." The following letter is in the same handwriting, "Dear Governor,—There is, as you know, a large amount of div. accumulation divisible just now, a consider<lb/>able</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210285"/>
               <p>portion of which usually finds its way into speculative channels. Have been chewing the cud of your Canadian market, but get no for<lb/>rader. Yesterday I thought the Yank Market looked a bit like com<lb/>ing again, but it now seems to have fizzled up, as per usual. You are in a better position to feel the speculative pulse than I am, and perhaps you can suggest summit. It 's now or never, so to speak, and our rule is to play up to the div. distribution. You know, as Geo. has of course told you, that I have had a relapse, but although still confined to bed I am very much better, and hope to be up Saturday or Sunday, so that I can get to graft, any way, next week. Meantime could, if I was provided with any material, knock up a circ. Here so that no time need be lost. Kindly let me have your views on the matter as early as convenient. I see Mex. Prefs. are still wobbling; shall we ever close these accounts? Financially, as I told you last week, I am in a mournful condition. Thine, Jas. Thursday." To have my views on the circulars is exactly what Hawkes would come to me for. He would address me as "Dear Governor." When he speaks of "our role," he is referring to Chalmers and Cox. Another letter in the same handwriting it at follows: "Dear Governor, Of course I wrote Hairbrush letter in ignorance of temporary collapse in Yank Market. As this is of the usual nine days' wonder order it may simply be necessary to withhold such a letter for a reaction, which occurs in this market about every ten minutes. Same remark applies to circular, which I will nevertheless ready. I feel that we can't be too careful re Hairbrush, who may require ye 'Complete Angler' being to tomb-like silent. You are, however, playing croupier and know how the game runs. Let me know when you re<lb/>quire me in town. Thine, Jas." I do not know that I ever received these letters. I do not know what they mean. It is a very high falutin' sort of style. The reference to me "playing croupier" refers, I suppose, to his losing money with me. The next letter you cannot nut upon me, at it it addressed to Harris. "I can't say exactly when I can come up until I have seen ye Dr. to-morrow, Thursday. I see ye Yank market looks like spurting a bit, the thing in whether there it sufficient strength to hang a tale on. Of course, I do not know P.'s mind on the matter. He said something about Canadians. The changed attitude of Yanks may, however, have altered this. It is a somewhat difficult and delicate decision. Confer and advise me, as I could knock up circ. here. Will tell you when I come up, but scarcely think it will be worth while this week. Moiety of Hough's stuff looks like reaching hit margin? Thine Jim." This is a letter written by a third party in which he states that he has seen me and that I advised him that Canadian Pacific was a good bargain. I could not tell you now when "Geo." did confer with me. There are a few words in the circulars and letters produced which are in my handwriting, but that does not convince me that I got the letter addressed "Dear Governor." The circular referring to Brigh<lb/>ton "A" stock has had the date altered in my handwriting. From 1904 to 1905. In both these is the following passage: "At we write</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210286"/>
               <p>we have what we believe to be special and important information re<lb/>garding Brighton "A" stock, which will, we are informed, see a very considerable rise in the present quotations, and of which immediate advantage should be taken to secure a quick turnover of profit before the market advances, as we are well advised will be the case." I did not write a circular and cannot say whether what was true in 1904 was also true in 1905. I altered the date, but it does not follow that it was ever used. The body of the circular shows that the current price and the quotation it altered. The date being altered, the other alterations would be consequential. As to whether it was an honest and truthful thing to say in either circular "as we write we have what we believe to be special and important information regarding Brighton 'A' stock," the first thing you have to do is to ask the person who wrote it, and secondly, you have got to find out whether it was used the year afterwards, and finally to ask the person who used it whether it was right or wrong. Supposing it was sent it might be true. How can you say it would be a pure fluke if it were? I do not know how Brighton "A" was in 1904, nor in 1905 for that matter. I will go so far as to say that all my alterations have not been accepted. I do not see anything in it likely to be dishonest at all. There is no reason why I should not have special and important information in 1905, but it does not affect me because I did not write the circular. With reference to Chalmers and Cox's circular of De<lb/>cember 12, 1903, calling attention to the position of Louisville Rail-road shares, it may be a singular coincidence that exactly the same ad<lb/>vice should be given in the following year with regard to Union Pacifics, but very likely the position was the same. I appear from the circular to have struck out Union Pacifics and put in Louisvilles, and to have made the necessary consequential alterations. A similar circular has been altered to make the observations originally applied to Louisvilles apply to Brighton "A" stock, but you cannot go so far as to say that if that were printed anew it would appear to be a cir<lb/>cular advising investment in Brighton "A" stock. You do not know what may happen before it is printed. The alterations here are to show the difference in the dividend between Brighton "A" and Louis<lb/>villes. I have not altered the circular except by altering the name of the railway and the price of the stock. As to whether it strikes me as a singular coincidence that observations originally written about an American railway should be exactly applicable to an English railway you are assuming that it is used in that form. I do not as<lb/>sume that at all. The only alteration I have made is to give the proper price and proper dividend of Brighton "A." I was probably asked to do it by Hawkes. He wanted to know what the dividend was in Brighton "A" and the price of the stock, and I have put it on here. There is no alteration whatever in the body of the circular. I do not countenance or discountenance what is in the body of the circular. I have been asked to give the quotation of Brighton "A" in the latter year, and I have put it there. I do not agree at all that in the draft letter produced the opening line "We have now opened for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210287"/>
               <p>your account 30 Rio Tinto shares" has been struck out by me and the following submitted, "Taking advantage of the foregoing cir<lb/>cumstances, we have thought it wise, entirely in your interests, to open for you 30 Tinto shares." It is part of a business letter, and there are one or two amendments in my handwriting. I could not possibly say now for whom these letters were intended, as there is no address. As to the phrase which occurs frequently in these circu<lb/>lars "Your interests being identical with our own," it is an entirely mistaken idea that the outside broker wants his client to lose. I have heard it stated here, but the idea is utterly ridiculous. The outside broker is only too anxious to pay his clients. It is to his interest to do so because he retains his client, at the same time making money for himself en route. If the suggestion is made here that the interest of the outside stockbroker is antagonistic to that of his client it means that if the outside broker gate £10 off his client and the client loses it he has lost a client. Surely it must be the interest of the outside broker to retain his client and to make as many more as possible. He cannot do that if every deal is antagonistic to the client. The deal must be in his favour or the relationship would not continue. The outside broker is only too, glad to draw cheques to his client in order to increase his business. It is not like the case of a bookmaker; the client does not bet, and I repeat that the outside broker generally protects himself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence. That is not part of the bargain. There is nothing in these circulars that says a word about protecting your<lb/>self.</p>
               <p>Witness. Only, on the other, assumption, if the client loses the £10 he does not go on any more, and the broker loses him and loses his business. Well, the business would not last.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination continued. The "Financial Guardian" was started in 1905, and my business papers were removed to 2, Token-house Buildings in 1906. I did not do any business with the "Financial Guardian," and only met people there by appointment. After that I had my own address. I only saw Ablett once or twice. He was an coldish man, and appeared to be well educated. I have heard that Harris was the man who went to the bank, not Ablett. I understood that Harris only acted for Ablett after Ablett left. Ab<lb/>lett's account with the Economic Bank is in Harris's handwriting, but Ablett may have had an account elsewhere. I assume that the sug<lb/>gestion of the prosecution is that Ablett is a mere myth, an alias for Harris. As to whether I have made any inquiries for the purposes of my defence as to where the real Ablett is (if there be a real Ablett) you should have asked "for the purpose of Harris's defence." I am not interested in it. I have never been sufficiently interested in the existence of Ablett to inquire where be could be found; it does not affect me. I have never asked Harris why he introduced somebody to me whose name he assumed. I asked Harris where Ablett was, and he told me he did not know. I did not ask him why be signed his name as "Ablett" in the books of the bank. I have beard that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210288"/>
               <p>Harris gave the address of 6, Clovelly Mansions. I have already denied that I asked Mrs. Strick to take in letters if they came in the name of Ablett. I did not even know where Mrs. Strick's address was Ablett has drawn cheques payable to me. There is an entry in Ablett's account of the payment to me on February 19 of £89 10s. After the business had ceased to be conducted in the name of "Harris," I believe it was conducted in the name of "George Martin." Harris never gave any reason for the change. An affidavit was sworn by Ablett on February 15, 1906, that he was carrying on the business of the "Financial Guardian," and on October 13 in the same year Martin swore that he was carrying on the business, so that the change must have been between those dates. The cheques produced payable to "C. George," and endorsed "C. George" in the handwriting of Harris are my cheques, and date from June, 1893, to September, 1906. Harris was known at the bank as "Mr. George." The cheque produced payable to "George Martin" is in my handwriting. It has never been presented. The man with whom I shared the office at 2, Tokenhouse (Buildings, is the same man who has been to my knowledge passing under different names. That does not strike me as odd. I believe he had at that time been engaged in this outside broker business. I do not know whether it is in accordance with the outside broker business that the person carrying on the business should have all those different names. It is not unknown in the out<lb/>side broker business, and not unknown in other branches of business. I was not aware that Mr. Bloomer supplied lists of addresses and did printing for the "Financial Guardian." I did not know that they were lists of people living in the country. I have not seen the lists. I do not know that there is any object in making a distinction be<lb/>tween town and country shareholders. Each individual list that you require, you require for some particular purpose; sometimes you want country ones and sometimes only town ones. I have looked through some of the exhibits and find there have been town clients. I have myself frequently sent circulars to country shareholders calling meetings, without sanding them to the town ones who would know of the meeting without a circular being sent to them. I have never sent a circular to a country investor asking him to invest money with outside brokers; therefore I cannot answer that question; I cannot answer for any third parties. I only undertook to pay for the printing done for Chalmers and Cox after that business was finished; there was no necessity for it because there was nothing owing; Chalmers and Cox paid for themselves. With regard to the suggestion that as accounts in the names of two different brokers were running simultaneously, it was necessary, in making the calculation of interest, that some one should take care that no mistake was made. We have 20 or 30 more exhibits here of contango notes which do not appear in that way, and you assume that precaution was taken on one occasion only. The whole of the documents dealing with the account of Mrs. D'Alters and others is in ray handwriting, because, as I had to make correc<lb/>tions,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210289"/>
               <p>I thought I would copy it out again correctly; that is all. I cannot remember that I added the letters "G. M." and "H. K. A." I have chequed the contango accounts repeatedly. I did not know there was an action of "Harper v. The Financial Guardian" in which George Martin was swearing an affidavit pleading the Gaming and Wagering Act. I do not regard outside brokers transactions as essentially gaining and wagering transactions. As to whether a person pleading the Gaming and Wagering Act is acting absolutely dis<lb/>honestly in putting forward that defence depends on the transaction. Each transaction stands on its own level. Borne may be gaming and wagering transactions. I could not answer as to whether it is a dis<lb/>honest thing to plead the Gaming and Wagering Act unless I had the whole facts before me of that particular case. I am not hare to give an opinion.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. The returns as to my profits for the year 1902 and onwards was obtained from the banks. The amount of the accounts for the first half of 1902 is £6,629, and the balance overdrawn is £5 10s. 3d.; in the second half year there is £4,117 coming in, and there is a credit balance of £36; for the half year ending June, 1903, the amount coming in is £6,406 and the credit balance is £127. The money had been in and out. In the half year to December 31,1903, I find £8,643, of which £55 only is the balance; to June, 1904, £4,696 2s. 2d., of which £1 4s. 3d. is overdrawn; and in the final half year it is £820 2s. 6d., with £1 8s. 5d. credit balance. Cheques were not made payable to C. George on my direction or to my know<lb/>ledge. I noticed it from my pass-book, and asked Harris for the explanation I have given. Smith's letter-books contain a complete record of the business, and in every instance which has been men<lb/>tioned where there is a payment direct into my account I have ascer<lb/>tained there is a letter showing the source from which that money came. I knew of Tyler's arrest the day after it occurred and of Harris's the same day. I was arrested 16 days afterwards. I knew that letter-books were in existence showing accounts and letters in my writing. I had not concealed or destroyed any document or cheque or book of any kind whatever. On July 29, 1903, I drew from my account £400 in notes and paid it to Herbert Smith. (Witness proved a large number of payments by him into H. Smith's account.) Some of the money came from extraneous sources—moneys over and above those drawn from my bank. On October 29 I received a cheque from Turner on a real property transaction for £500 (pro<lb/>duced) which I cashed in notes and paid into Smith's account; they form part of £640 paid in on that day. On December 10, of £592 paid into Smith's account £580 was in notes; January 14, another payment of £500 in notes derived from cheque of Turner for £500 for real property. There were a large number of similar payments of which I have the cheques here. The Lombard Financial Corpora<lb/>tion (apparently carried on by Fraser) was always treated as a part of Herbert Smith's business. I had no part in the working of that business and took no share of the profits. I gave assistance to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210290"/>
               <p>Harris. No attempt has been made by me to destroy books. I saw nothing wrong in the continuance of Herbert Smith's business by Harris. After Mrs. Smith's visit to me in June, 1904, the H. Smith account was practically closed down—anything done after<lb/>wards was the clearing up. H. Smith had a large number of clients and a good business, as is shown by the letter-books containing up<lb/>wards of 15,000 letters. The work could not have been done without a staff; there were 40 or 50 letters a day. Harris had had a large Stock Exchange experience. The non-success of the business was due to bad markets and people not dealing so freely in the latter part of the time. With regard to my being on the voting list for 43, Moorgate Street, I had formerly had an office at 4, Tokenhouse Build<lb/>ings, and on my giving that up, the agent of a political organisation traced me as being known at 43, Moorgate Street, and put my name on the list. I did not even know of it, and never voted on it. No cheque derived from Herbert Smith was ever cashed in gold—always in notes. Those notes were never turned into gold. I had known Hawkes for a great many years. He worked for me on the "Financial Observer," and usually called me "Governor." I had helped him as I have others of my old employees—old friends. With regard to alterations of circulars, my assistance was called in to give the prices of stock, the amount of the dividend compared with the same day one year or two years before or on kindred points.</p>

                  </hi>, clerk to Percy Ellis, stockbroker. During 1902, 1903, and 1904 my employer acted as stockbroker to Herbert Smith. I have prepared an extract from the books from December 30, 1902, to January, 1904, 28 fortnightly accounts, showing a total of stock opened during that period of £123,284. In respect of differences there was paid £4,620 6s. 6d. The stocks dealt in were mainly Rio Tintos. Atchisons, Unions, Baltimores, Southern Pacifics, and Trunk Third Preference.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Mr. Percy Ellis is not here—he would know Herbert Smith. I have never seen Smith. I do not know anything about the transaction. I was not in the office at the time. By the look of the accounts Smith was more a "bull" than a "bear." I have not gone into the account to see the amount of stock actually pur<lb/>chased, or opened—part of the amount would be contangoes. Against the amount of losses paid by Smith there was £665 2s. 8d. received by him for profit.</p>

                  </hi>. I was subpœnaed by the prosecution and have been in attendance every day for a fortnight. My age is 80. I have known Perryman about 18 years and worked for him when he was on the "Financial Observer"; Harris was also working with him at that time. I remember taking some premises from a man named Dove; 2, Tokenhouse Buildings; that was for the purpose of carry<lb/>ing on the business of Chalmers and Cox. I was Chalmers and Cox, stock and share dealers—outside brokers. I composed the circulars. I have not in the ordinary composition of a circular had to ask the assistance of Perryman. I gave the orders for the printing to Bleach (the witness) and also to his father. I think Bleach arranged all the Argus work; I paid Bleach. Perryman never paid money to the Argus, as far as I know. I had control of the banking account and drew cheques. I consulted Perryman very frequently in connec<lb/>tion with the business, in reference to the stocks and market, and generally. A Mr. Watson was associated with me as partner subse<lb/>quently, when I removed to 49, Moorgate Street; that was in 1904. I gave notice to leave Tokenhouse Buildings. Mr. Dove and I did not come in contact; I always saw the managing clerk. I told the latter that Harris was going to take over the office. I could not give the exact date of that, because Harris did not take over the office at the time he negotiated with me to do so. He was to do it at Christmas, whereas it was about March when he did. I have seen Perryman occasionally at 43, Moorgate Street. I have shown him some of my circulars and he has made suggestions and alterations upon them, but I cannot say I have always acted on them; they did not always fit in with my view. I remember being ill; about which time I wrote to Perryman, seeking his advice on various stocks that I had opened, and difficulties I was in at the time. I used to buy shares from Perryman; Bonanzas, Chartered, and United Collieries, I think. I have also opened up stock with him—to protect myself. Perryman was a very large dealer I always understood, and on one or two occasions ho sold me the stock, not necessarily for delivery. I could not tell you whether I have opened up stock with anyone else, but I have an idea that I did with Harris. Perryman never came to my office. He did not have any share in the profits of Chalmers and Cox; I carried the business on myself; but, of course, he assisted me a good deal. The business is not in existence now, due to a variety of causes, want of capital and badness of business generally; the expense was too great. I have had interviews with the police on this matter. I have seen Mr. Ottaway several times, but have not had much to say to him. I really could not tell you the meaning of the phrases in some of these letters, "The Complete Angler," for instance, or "Hairbrush"; the latter appears to be the nickname of some client. There is a payment to a man named Brush in the banking account of Chalmers and Cox; I could not tell you whether that was "Herr Brush." I have tried hard to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210292"/>
               <p>explain what "hairbrush" means, but failed. I always called Perry<lb/>man" governor," from the old "Observer" days; he was my governor then. In regard to the phrase "I fear we cannot be too careful re hairbrush, who may require your complete angler being so tomblike silent. You are, however, playing croupier, and know how the game lies." I suppose "tomblike silence" means that I was getting no replies to my letters. I cannot say what I meant by it. I take it a croupier is one who directs the game at a gaming table; that would be my definition. I can only suppose that was when Perryman was running some stock against me and I should imagine he would be winning, I was evidently sorry I had opened the stock with him. These letters are in pencil; they were probably written in bed. I was in a good deal of pain at the time; I had to be operated upon. I have had no action brought against me in reference to Chalmers and Cox, and no complaints by the police that I am aware of. (Mr. Muir asked to be allowed to re-call Perryman before cross-examining witness, and that the latter should withdraw from court.)</p>

The top part is in my writing; it is not my signature. "Alexander Robert Frater, mining agent, Lombard Street, as above, J. W. Hawkes," is in my writing I cannot say in whose writing "Alexander R. Fraser" is. I am not an expert in handwriting. It looks like Miss Long's; I know it is not mine. The reason I wrote that document is this: I knew the trustees of the bank, and I had a number of these forms given me for the purpose of finding customers, current account holders for the bank. The name "Hawkes" looks like mine; it is not a signature. I never saw Alexander Robert Fraser. I was told he was a mining agent by Smith. The word "personally" is not in my writing.</p>
               <p>Further re-examined. I had not seen the above document since I wrote it until to-day. The signature Alexander R. Fraser is a little different from that in the signature book. The business of Alexander Fraser, the Lombard Corporation, was carried on with the business of Herbert Smith.</p>

                  </hi>, recalled. Cross-examined. (Witness read out the form previously read by Perryman.) I know nothing what ever about Alexander Robert Fraser, and never saw him. This form is not in my handwriting; it looks like Perryman's writing, all of it. I knew his writing fairly well. I have seen Herbert Smith at 43, Moorgate Street on various occasions; I should not say very often. I went there occasionally to see Harris and Perryman. The latter was not always there, but Harris was. I had nothing to do with drafting Herbert Smith's circulars. I fancy I spoke a good deal to Harris about starting the business of Chalmers and Cox, and I believe I mentioned it to Perryman. I opened an account with the Economic Bank for Chalmers and Cox, but I had had one previously. I opened the latter account in the name of Cox because I was trading in that name. I wanted the name of a firm; that is why I chose Chalmers and Cox; I thought it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210293"/>
               <p>would look better. I discussed the name with Harris, and I am rather under the impression that he suggested "Chalmers." I also discussed it with Perryman, who suggested some Exchange as a name, "The London Exchange," or something like that; but I did not like Exchanges. I should imagine the discussion took place at Moorgate Street; I should think that would be right. My memory about that time is pretty indistinct; I can remember things better 20 years ago. I drafted the circulars for Chalmers and Cox, and I rather think Perryman has altered them sometimes. I had an assis<lb/>tant in the business, Mr. Beteon, and I had a good deal of assistance from Harris. Whenever I was in any difficulty I frequently consulted Perryman. I think I have the credit of being able to write, in every sense of the word. If I remember rightly I signed the letters with a rubber stamp; my signature is inclined; to vary; not through bad habits. I signed the cheques as they were required; possibly some<lb/>times in advance, because I was away very frequently. Betson would have the cheque book, and he had instructions to hand it to Harris whenever he wanted it. Harris supervised my business when I was ill. I think he has been working with Perryman all the time I have known him. I could hardly say that handing blank cheques to Harris was the same thing as handing them to Perryman. I think there were one or two interregnums when Harris left Perry<lb/>man for a short time because of a tiff. I borrowed money from Perryman when I was short; I do not know that it would be £2 a week; more than that; I used to draw a certain sum per week. It was a loose arrangement I had with him. I had some money of my own when I started this business, which I lost; I paid a good deal out to clients. I should think I got into difficulties five or six months after I started, soon alter my illness. Watson and I had the moneys that came into the business.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Justice Lawrence. I should think I put about £100 into the business; I had it in the bank; I had £300 or £400 about that time.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Muir. In regard to the phrases in the letter, "complete angler," etc., and "playing croupier," a croupier is a man who rakes in the money; I feel a little clearer now about it. The letter to Mrs. A. E. R. Brush is in my handwriting. It would appear by that that all my splendid prophecies had come untrue. In regard to the letter, "We are sorry to learn you have been let in, and fear you have fallen across some black sheep. Your orders and instructions shall have our immediate attention; you will always find us prompt in our settlements. As you will have observed from our circular, our inte<lb/>rests and our clients' are identical," the broker does not necessarily lose if the client is successful, unless he is running the stock against the client; for the most part we were doing so. That letter would hardly bear much explanation. The words in the circular, "Our commission is 10 per cent. of the profits only, so that our clients' interests and our own are identical,"' would seem to suggest we were mere brokers. That is the only profit we were supposed to have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210294"/>
               <p>made. I could not tell you what we made apart from that. There is another letter, to Mr. Hough, in which there is a correction from 34 to 74, in my handwriting. It is all in mine. Regarding the draft circular with the paragraph, "A special note should also, we think, be made of the fact that the present existing war scare can in no way adversely affect English Rails," etc., I do not know whether it was published; I do not see anything which would lead me to sup<lb/>pose it was published. None of the letters of Chalmers and Cox's business were typed at 43, Moorgate Street. Of course, I cannot tell what Harris did when I was away ill.</p>
               <p>Mr. Muir: Did not you realise at some period of this business that it was a swindle?.</p>
               <p>Witness. Well, no. I did not like the business; it was too risky; there was too much anxiety for a person of my age. I did not tell Perryman it was a swindle. I did not think it was; not even now. Perryman said he thought I was a very poor outside broker. I was very good as a writer; or something to that effect. He said some<lb/>thing like, "You will never make a bucket shop keeper." I do not know why he should use that term, because there is no such thing now as a bucket shop in England; it is an American institution. You are not allowed to deal on the tape now in England. Bucket shop is rather an offensive term. I do not keep books at all; I made up my accounts on pay-sheets every fortnight. Betson kept them, as a matter of fact. They were not shown to anyone that I am aware of, Perryman did not see them; they never left Tokenhouse Build<lb/>ings and he never came there. I cannot say whether Harris saw them; very likely he did. The only book that I know Perryman kept was a Stock Exchange bargain-book. I have seen that at Moorgate Street. I could not tell you what transactions were recorded in it; those I had with him were, certainly. I should imagine Herbert Smith's were; but I know nothing of that. The contract notes, I should say, were usually made out at the end of the day; it depended on circum<lb/>stances. I made them out myself; but I have had assistance from Harris; I do not recollect having had from Perryman. In what I have told you I have come as near the truth as I could; the entire truth I have told you, as far as I can recollect. I have made and signed a statement about this business, one on August 17, witnessed by Mr. Stanier, the City Solicitor's managing clerk, and another on July 4, witnessed by Mr. Towell, another clerk. I believe I told them the truth.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Muir commenced to read a statement, when Mr. Marshall Hall objected that he had not had a copy of this farther evidence and protested that it ought not to have been handed to the Judge. He stated that the practice seemed to be growing of handing documents up to Judges, of which copies were not handed to the other side.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Muir explained that it had been handed of in mistake with a lot of other documents.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Muir continued to read a statement which witness had made to the solicitors for the prosecution.)</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210295"/>
               <p>Mr. Marshall Hall said that Mr. Muir ought to confine himself to reading what would have been evidence had the prosecution in fact called the witness.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence. If you look at it you will see he has omitted a passage.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marahall Hall. I agree. But I take the last piece he baa red—"I had nothing more to do with Perryman till about 1902," &amp;c.—that is not evidence in that ease. This gentleman's opinions about what was going on in 1902 cannot be evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence, Mr. Muir is putting to the witness a statement which he made on a previous occasion; it comes within the section of the Act.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marahall Hall. I agree, in any way, where he contradicts himself or where be has made a statement of a different nature, ha is entitled to put it; but the para<lb/>graph he has just read is not a statement of a different nature, and It is mere pre<lb/>judice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence. I do not see any prejudice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marahall Hall. It is this: He gives it as his opinion that they were carrying on a butineas in connection with the "Financial Observer" as a bucket shop. No witness is entitled to say that. I do not say that I see the remedy for this, but I submit it is a very serious and dangerous practice—though, of course, in the scrupulous hands of Mr. Muir it would not be abused.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence. If you look at the attitude you will find it expressly authorised.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marshall Hall. I think the word "relevant" must be read into that action. If my friend wants to use a written document he must confine himself to what would be relevant as evidence in chief.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence. Certainly. He cannot put that document in; he can only ask questions upon it; and he is now calling attention to it. If the witness denies it he can then put it in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marahall Hall. I do press this because I want to get a decision upon it. You will see that the section in Lord Denman'e Act never contemplated the bodily putting in of the statement as evidence. (Mr. Marahall Hall read the section in Lord Denmen's Act) I do press your Lordship upon it because it is not only an objec<lb/>tion now, it is an objection of all time, and I can contemplate the most terrible abuse might arise from such a practice being adopted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence. I am afraid I cannot rule under the statute that it is not admissible.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination continued. Perryman did not ask me shortly after<lb/>wards (after 1902) if I would start a bucket shop. I never used the term "bucket shop." He did not ask me if I would start an outside broker's business. That statement is a mistake evidently. It was some years after this Rosenberg incident that I started Chalmers and Cox. I am not responsible for what is put down there; it is put down wrongly. I ought not to have signed that statement. "We had some conversation about starting an outside broker's business"—that was a long time after this incident. I rather think Perryman said that Dove had offices to let at 2, Tokenhouse Buildings. I think he said he would assist me, not "pay everything, including rent, printing, etc." If I said that, I should not have done so. I suppose the statement must have been read over to me. I should think I said, "Harris was, I believe, present on this occasion, and I believe he knew what the arrangement was." I did not take the office under Perryman's instructions. It might be true that Perryman said he would overhaul the circulars. It is true that he suggested various titles under which I might trade. When I suggested Chalmers and Cox, I should have said "Harris and Co." Perryman gave me an idea of what stock to write about. I started the business with the assistance of Perryman and Harris.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190710210296"/>
               <p>He did not think my bank was good enough, and advised me to go to Lloyd's Bank, which I did. Harris was supposed to be secretary. Harris did not introduce me to Lloyd's Bank, I went there myself. The manager did not appear to know him, the account was not opened there, and I was introduced by Ernest to the London Trading Bank, where I opened the account as Chalmers and Cox, giving my name as "James Wilkes Cox," 2, Tokenhouse Buildings. Perryman only had the control of money in connection with stocks that I had opened with him. If I said the contrary I ought to have been more careful. Harris had the cheque-book, not Perryman, and Harris filled the cheques up. Towell read my statement to me, and I signed it. I may have been not careful enough in making corrections in it. I generally had £2 a week from Harris, sometimes £3. I do not think it is true to say that Perryman had the whole of the money—there was none to have; it all went in expenses. Practically, I was a weekly servant. I paid the money or cheques into the banking account, but sometimes I handed banknotes or postal orders to Perry<lb/>man—I nearly always owed him money. On one or two occasions he may have drafted a letter or portion of a letter. I have no recol<lb/>lection of letters being typed at 43, Moorgate Street. I knew the business of Chalmers and Cox was not being conducted properly, and I did not like it; I thought there was a great deal of sharp practice, and that Perryman had put me into a very dangerous position—actions being brought against ma through acting on his advice. I will not swear that I did not say to Towell that Perryman said, "You will never make a bucket shop keeper," but I do not think he used the word "bucket shop." The pencil letters produced were written by me while ill in bed. I do not think the contract notes were made out by Perryman—I consulted Harris about them. It was understood the business of Chalmers and Cox must be carried on on proper lines, and that, if people won, they were to be paid. Watson is dead—he had the Chalmers and Cox papers.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Ottaway asked me to go to the City Solicitor. No threat of any kind was made to prosecute me. Ottaway found me through Dove. The evidence I have given this morning is, as far as I know, correct. I left a lot of waste-paper at 2, Tokenhouse Buildings.</p>

Mr. Justice A.T. Lawrence said he was afraid he must receive it and that he must be trusted to know the meaning of it.</p>
               <p>The Inspector (continuing) said it was alleged that Perryman attempted to swindle a bookmaker by backing a horse after knowing the result of the race, and it was decided to expel him, but that decision was reconsidered. Soon after he started a bucket-shop business, and later on in the year promoted a bogus concern in which the public were defrauded. In 1890 he was expelled from the National Liberal Club in consequence of his connection with a gold mining company which was exposed by the "Financial News," who were sued by Perryman in the Queen's Bench Division, when the jury found the company to be a swindle. He was subsequently at this court sentenced for libel to two months' imprisonment as first<lb/>class misdemeanant. Numerous instances were given by witness as to the shady transactions in which Perryman had been mixed up, and he stated that many complaints had been received in connection with the present business.</p>

               <hi rend="smallCaps">E.B. RODWAY</hi>, Mann and Rodway, solicitors, practising at Trow<lb/>bridge. Mr. William Mann is my partner in that business. I re<lb/>ceived a letter which purports to be addressed from the General Post Office, Southend, Essex, in an envelope dated January 24, 1907. I also received a letter addressed to me from 54, Shaftesbury Avenue, dated February 17. I believe I received it the next day. I received the telegram produced on Saturday night, September 7, and a letter of September 8 beginning, "I am surprised that such an illustrious snob," on the Tuesday, I think. I received all those from the pri<lb/>soner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM JOHN MANN</hi> I am a solicitor of the firm of Mann and Rodway, at Trowbridge, where I hold several positions of an official character. The prisoner is my wife's nephew. My wife's Christian name is Julia, but she is commonly called "Dolly" by her sisters. Before the prisoner's arrest there was some correspondence between the prisoner's mother and her sister with regard to the prisoner. The prisoner was convicted on his own confession of libel on Septem<lb/>ber 14, 1905. In my presence he then gave the undertaking to Mr. Justice Bucknill which has been read. That, however, seems to have been followed up, in December of 1906, by the false allegation with regard to how it was that the prisoner's elder brother died of starvation in Canada. I sent a copy of the telegram to the prisoner's mother and made inquiries. In January, 1907, I learnt that this course of persecution had commenced afresh. I received the letter of March 19 from the postman and handed it to my wife; she read it in my presence. The whole of it is in the prisoner's handwriting and also the envelope. I was the recipient of a form of typewritten notice circulated on March 11. That came to me, although it was addressed to "Mr. M. Mann." The letters produced are in the pri<lb/>soner's handwriting, also the postcard addressed to the proprietor of the "Wiltshire Times."</p>
