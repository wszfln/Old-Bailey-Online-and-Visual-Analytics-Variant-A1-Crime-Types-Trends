               <p>Was the other man with him then? - The prisoner Thomas was immediately on his knees, picking the money out of my pocket: Brown kneeled on my breast with one hand at my mouth, and Thomas took my money out of my pocket, two half crowns; I am sure the prisoners are the men; I never saw them before, they were both in-the house.</p>
               <p>How long might you be drinking this beer? - It might be ten or twelve minutes, I cannot say the exact time.</p>
               <p>Had you candles? - There was light in the house, I could distinguish their faces very plain; I am sure they are the same persons, very sure.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Thomas. Whether he ever saw me from the time he saw me in the house till after he lost the money? a man was brought into the watch-house, and he swore that was the person.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you accuse any other person of behaving to you in that manner you have mentioned? - No other person but them two, there was another person taken into custody, I could not say he was the man; I knew he was not the man; I believe the watch took him.</p>
               <p>Did you ever charge that other man with having treated you in this way? - No, I never charged any other person but the two prisoners, I am sure it was them; I was robbed on Saturday night, and on the Tuesday the prisoner Thomas was taken; I had not seen nor heard any thing of him in the intermediate time; as for Brown he was apprehended immediately, I put him into the watch-house myself; he never was out of my sight; the prisoner Thomas was apprehended by the description I gave of him to Mr.

               <p>I am one of the head-boroughs of the parish; on Monday night after the robbery, I apprehended Thomas; on the Sunday night it was my night at the watch-house, I enquired his charge, and there was another man came to the watch-house to speak to Brown, and the watchman said he thought he answered the description of the other man, in consequence of that, he was taken into custody; on the Monday morning I saw the prosecutor; he described a very stout man in an orange coloured shag waistcoat, and a blue great coat; I knew the prisoner Thomas before, and in consequence of this description I apprehended him; I took him into custody on the Monday, and brought him to the magistrate.</p>
               <p>When you apprehended him, did you give any information to the prosecutor? - He was committed till the prosecutor came; he was in the office; I was desired by the magistrate to let Thomas come in by himself, when he came in, he picked him our directly; there were twenty people in the office.</p>
               <p>PRISONER BROWN'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor never was the person that apprehended me at all; I was walking over Tower Hill, and another gentleman took me in his arms, and asked me what I had been after, I said nothing that I knew of; then the prosecutor came up and said I had robbed him; then they took me to the watch-house, and took me before the justice.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Thomas. I wish to ask the prosecutor if he was not merely provoked by the officer at the Rotation Office to swear against me and this prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it your own free motion? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And what you have said is all true? - Yes, it is all true, so help me God; every thing I have done and said is true.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Thomas. There was a person here that was to speak the truth on my trial, he does not answer; I am very sure he could have proved me to be innocent.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Brown. This man that is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230009"/>standing here now is innocent of the affair; the man that took the money out of the man's pocket was not taken, that I declare in my dying hour; I have not been above four months from America; I am entirely a stranger in England; I came from Georgia in Savannah.</p>

               <p>I am butler to Mr. Meyrick; on the 9th of May I heard the other witness speaking to this woman about having stolen something, and I went into the pantry to see what I had lost, and I missed these four spoons, which I had used for breakfast; the woman was in the hall when he charged her, I told him to hold the woman while I saw what was missed else; and while I was looking, the spoons were found on the floor in the yard adjoining the pantry; they were taken up and put on the ledge in the yard, I do not know by whom.</p>
               <p>Did you see the spoons afterwards? - I saw them after they were upon the ledge; the last witness took them and locked them up in his box.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw the spoons; I asked for a morsel of bread.</p>

               <p>Did you fix on this man before he spoke? - No; I fixed on another man that was there.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not you fix on another man before you fixed on this man? - What to substitute him as the bookkeeper, never; but as his servant.</p>
               <p>You must mistake in that, you fixed on a wrong man, did not you? - Yes, I might, very like.</p>
               <p>Did you, Sir, or not? - I did.</p>
               <p>Who did that man turn out to be, that you fixed upon? - A man that seemed to be like the servant.</p>
               <p>What is his name? - I do not know his name.</p>
               <p>Do you know his name is Shallard; you fixed on him as the servant, and as the man who carried away your parcel? - Yes.</p>
               <p>As the man who met you first in the yard, as the man who walked with you to the corner, as the man that carried away your parcel at last? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was mistaken in that man? - They tell me I was.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt? - I do not give any thought of it.</p>
               <p>Do you mean now to say, that you believe the man upon whom you fixed at Bow-street, is the other man that was concerned in this robbery? - No, I do not believe he was the man.</p>
               <p>Then you believe you was mistaken? - In that part; I did not see this man at all.</p>
               <p>Was he in the room at the time? - He might or he might not.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, was not he in the room at the time; did you instantly fix on the prisoner in the room? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that you believe he was not in the room? - He might have been in the room and yet I not know it.</p>
               <p>Did not you know that he was in the room? - He might be in the room.</p>

               <p>Do you now believe he was not there? - I neither believe whether he was or was not.</p>

               <p>Do you believe he was in the room or not? - Well, I believe he was in the room.</p>
               <p>How much is Shallard taller than that man? - A good deal taller.</p>
               <p>Do you swear that? - I think he is taller.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear that you believe him to be an inch taller than the prisoner? - I certainly will venture to swear that he is taller than this man.</p>
               <p>You said at the beginning that the other was a tall man? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How soon were you convinced that he was not the man that had taken away your bundle? - I never took him for the bookkeeper; I walked with the man that took my bundle, some yards, close to him.</p>
               <p>Then you had an opportunity of observing him? - Yes, this man stood with his back at the door, and I looked upon him as the master, and I took strict notice of him; the other man was longer with me; it was not above five or six minutes walk; I observed him so far as the darkness of the night would let me.</p>
               <p>It was a fortnight afterwards before you saw him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you go to search his lodgings? - No, these things were never found again; I do not know where he was taken; I was not present.</p>

               <p>Whose coach was it? - One Mr. Cuttle's; he lives at Chelsea; his man was taken ill at our house; the Tobitt's Dog, the watering house.</p>
               <p>What time of night was this when they came to you? - Between the hours of nine and ten.</p>
               <p>Where did you go to, do you recollect? - I went from Saint Paul's to Charing-cross first, then I came back and got half a crown to the Minories; the first fare began at half after three in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>Had any of your other fares any bundles? - No Sir, none at all.</p>
               <p>Do you often drive? - Not very often; I only put people into coaches, and they very often have bundles.</p>

               <p>Was you present when King pitched on Shallard; you know Shallard well enough. - I was not there.</p>

               <p>I was the last up on the night of the 18th; I am servant to Captain Hindman, I went to bed about ten, I left the house fast and secure, I am very particular every night in fastening every one of the doors; I fastened every one of the doors, and all the windows; I am very certain sure that they were every one of them fast, the doors and windows, for I fastened them myself; and a little before four I was alarmed on Saturday last; we were alarmed by the cry of murder and thieves; I alarmed my master, and after seeing him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230016"/>come out of his chamber (for I did not know but he was murdered); I then understood by him that the house was broke open; after I had called him, and given him to understand what was the matter, we then with all possible haste went down stairs; we went down together, and going into the back kitchen, we found every thing in very great confusion; we found the store-room broke open, and likewise the outer door of this back kitchen; the outer door led into the garden; I am positively sure that door was both barred and double bolted the night before; we did not stop there, but went immediately into the coach-yard, and the first thing I saw there was this lock, all shattered to pieces; then coming into the coach-yard, I fixed my eyes on Gould, a coachman in the neighbourhood, having fast hold of Ellicott the prisoner by the collar; he was struggling with all his might to get away; by this time other assistance came, and he was secured; we found there were five doors broke open; I fastened four of these doors, and the store-room door I did not fasten, because that is kept fast, unless any body has occasion to go there; my master kept they key of that, I found every thing in great confusion, there was the great washing copper brought into the coach-yard, and lay in the middle of the yard.</p>
               <p>Was that washing copper set? - Yes, it was taken down, and all the bricks taken off, as if there had been a bricklayer at work; it was fast in the bricks the night before.</p>
               <p>Court. Must that not have taken up a considerable while doing? - I should imagine it must; and all the lead belonging to this great washing copper was laying by the side of the copper in the coach-yard; two baskets of china plates were in the coach-yard; a pail full of bottles of wine, and a little copper saucepan, and several other things laying in the yard.</p>
               <p>Had you seen these within the house before you went to bed that night? - The copper coal-skuttle I left myself in the back kitchen over night, and it was found in the coach-yard; the china was in the store-room over night, I only at that time saw Gould have fast hold of Ellicott by the collar, I know nothing of Toomes.</p>
               <p>Captain Hindman. I was alarmed a little after three by a prodigious noise and confusion; I immediately flew to my pistols, I laid one on the table, the other I held in my hand; I expected from the noise the door would be broke open, but it not being so, I then opened my chamber-door, my man was near the door and speaking, I do not recollect what he said; I ventured across the passage with the pistol in my hand, I threw up the passage window that looks into the coach-yard, and there I saw this witness Green, with the prisoner Ellicott by the collar; my man called out, my house was broke open and robbed; I returned to my chamber, put on my breeches, and ran down stairs, as I was; took my great coat out of the hall, went below through the servant's hall into the back kitchen; and there I saw a compleat heap of ruins; it was nothing else, I did not stop a moment there; I went through into the coach-yard, and I went immediately to Green; another man or two came in from the alarm; I saw Ellicott very well safe and secured, he told me the other man had made his escape by biting the hand of Gould the coachman; but there were people in pursuit of him, and he would be speedily taken; and while he was talking, he said, there he is Sir, he is taken, they have got him on the side of the green; I then became sensible that I was without stockings or a waistcoat, or any thing round my neck, and was very cold; I went and dressed me, and came down; the first thing I saw on the kitchen table, nearly where the copper had been fixed, was this iron crow; there were great marks of violence on the door where they had broke it open; they had forced all the staples by which the bolts were secured; from thence I went into the coach-yard, and there I saw the copper that had been set with brick-work, and the lead that covered the copper by it, and two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230017"/>baskets of china plates, one containing thirty plates, and the other twenty-nine, and several other things that I did not particularize, which I do not recollect immediately; on the whole, had any indifferent person been passing by, he would have said, Sir, I suppose you are moving; we suppose we lost six or seven dozen of plates, taken away entirely.</p>
               <p>Were those ever recovered again? - No.</p>
               <p>What quantity of wine did you lose? - I really cannot say, there was a great deal in my binn, and there is hardly any thing of wine left in the binn, the binn was open; I should not have thought of the wine, had I not seen the pail in the yard with some bottles in it; from the work they had done, and what they must have carried away, I am almost sure they could not have been in the house less than two or three hours; it is incredible, and exceeds all belief, such a rapacity there had been used.</p>
               <p>What hour was it in the morning when you first got up? - I suppose when I was first alarmed it wanted twenty minutes to four; I went immediately to the watch-house, to see that they were properly secured, that the people might not leave them; Toomes was also taken to the watch-house; there we searched them, and on the prisoner Ellicott was found a tinder-box with tinder in it, and a flint and steel, and a bundle of matches; and on the prisoner Toomes was a pocket full of grocer's currants; they had been in the store-room: I then went to the magistrate and attended their examination; before I went into the yard I was walking through, and I picked up the neck of a shirt, and handkerchief; I put them in my pocket; and on their examination I produced the neck of this shirt, and begged the magistrate to examine the two prisoners, to see if either of them had lost the neck of their shirt; a man now in court, one of Mr. Wilmot's men, examined Toomes immediately, and discovered the neck of his shirt off; and on comparing it, it exactly fitted; I saw it fitted; the prisoner Toomes evidently wanted the neck of his shirt, the handkerchief was not claimed; I saw several other things that were found in a ditch, which I swore to, and are my property. (The coat skuttle produced) I know it, it has no particular mark, but from seeing it for years; that kettle, and saucepan and two large pieces of soap, I cannot swear to soap; but the bag the soap was carried away in, I swear positively to.</p>

               <p>I am a weaver; I live within a few yards of Mr. Hindman; I was going past between three and four on Saturday morning the 19th; I was walking on that side of the green, when I came even with Sugar-loaf-alley, I saw two men at about forty yards before me.</p>
               <p>Court. What had brought you out at that early hour? - Why Sir, I am a very early riser, and I commonly go to the pump and wash myself before I go to labour, I have made it a practice for years past; the two men that I saw, were coming towards Captain Hindman's house, one of these two men had a bag under his arm, and by their appearance they were very dirty, and I thought they looked like very suspicious persons, and I thought it was not proper for me to meet them, and I turned off to go right across the green, there is a causeway opposite Sugar-loaf-alley that goes right across the green; I was fully determined to watch them, and before I got half over the green, I lost one of them; and as there was no turning for them to turn up, I concluded, they must go into some of the coach-houses and gateways, for there are three or four coach-houses; I watched the other, and my eye was never off of Ellicott, till I saw him go into Captain Hindman's yard; when I saw him go into Captain Hindman's yard, he shut the door after him, then I walked a little further across the green towards the Peacock, and I thought it was not proper to attack him myself; then I got across<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230018"/>the green by the road side, and in about five minutes after, I saw Mr. Gould locking up his coach-house gates, which are about forty yards from Captain Hindman's; after he had locked the gates, he came up the same path I had come up; he came up to me, and I told him what I had seen; we went to Captain Hindman's door, but the door was fast; then the coachman got upon the wall and got into Captain Hindman's coach-yard; by that time I got across the green (for he out-run me) he came out at the same door I had seen Ellicott go in at, with Toomes in one hand, and Ellicott in the other; I ran up to his assistance, and they struggled in a very furious manner, when I saw him, I ran up to Mr. Gould's assistance, and when Toomes broke loose from Mr. Gould, I was within two yards of him; I pursued Toomes to the corner of Sugar-loaf-alley, which is about twenty yards; then I perceived Toomes get ground of me in running, I thought I should not be able to take him, I thought it was the best way to raise an alarm, which I did, by crying out, murder, thieves, stop thieves for God's sake; by that alarm Toomes was taken in less than five minutes, by French and Crisp; then I went and assisted Gould in taking Ellicott; then we came into the coach yard, and there we gave a very loud alarm to the family; in the coach-yard I saw a great copper and lead, and a pail full of quart bottles of wine, and two baskets of china, and variety of articles of kitchen furniture; it appeared like a broker's shop in short. Upon my oath, the prisoners are both the same men; Mr. Toomes was the man that ran before me, and Ellicott never was out of Gould's possession; I am positive to Toomes.</p>

               <p>What happened to you on the 10th of May last? - I went from my own house, from thence to Covent Garden play-house, I was in the gallery, and alone; when the play was over I came out, and it rained pretty fast, I crossed over Broad-street through Bow-street, into <placeName id="t17870523-17-crimeloc87">Drury-lane</placeName>

I was running towards Temple-bar, I thought it had been somebody I knew, and I immediately stopped and turned round, and saw it was a stranger, and asked him, what it was to him? I then walked on, and he came up to the side of me, and he asked me if I did not know him? that was the prisoner Hyser; I told him I did not know him, I said no; he then asked me if I did not intend to give him something? I asked him for what? he then said, do not you remember unbuttoning my breeches, and putting your hands in? I was very much frightened, I told him he was an impudent rascal, and to go along about his business; I immediately crossed the way, and went down into the Strand, I thought it was a more publick place; he said, I will follow you, and by God I will charge the watch with you, if you do not give me something; he still kept talking to me, and said, he would charge the watch with me if I did not give him something; I told him he might, I was ready to go any where with him; I then met the prisoner

               <p>Who let you in? - The maid servant; the next day at twelve o'clock, as I was coming home, I met Ellison in Jewry-street, I did not know him again, he accosted me; says he, I have been at your house about that affair of last night; says he, they tell me you are master of that place, I told him I was not; then says he, I suppose you are a clerk, yes says I, I am; says Ellison I called for money, and expected a genteel present; but I have no money about me, said I, I must get you to call at five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Then had he asked you for any money, that you said you had no money about you? - Yes, directly, as he met me, he said, he called for some money of the affair of last night.</p>
               <p>You said nothing about money at first? - When first he met me, he said, he had been at my house; why says he, they say you are master of that house; I told him I was not.</p>
               <p>When did he say any thing about any money? - After that, he said, he called at my house for some money, and expected I would make him a genteel present; as soon as I told him I was not master of the place, then he said, he supposed I was a clerk, and he called for some money, and expected I would make him a genteel present; I told him I had no money, but to call at five o'clock; says he, I shall not leave you, I shall see you into the counting-house that you belong to; I told him, if he would call at five, I should be sure to be at home; he said, he insisted upon seeing me to the counting-house; for, says he, your life is in my hands, and if you was master of that place, I would not make it up for less than 100 l. I called on my taylor directly, instead of going home; he lived in Smart's-buildings; Ellison walked by the side of me; I told him that was the counting-house; I rung the bell; I waited a considerable time before they opened the door; and he stood down the gate-way<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230024"/>all the time; I staid about ten minutes at my taylor's, and then I came away; the prisoner was not there when I came out; then I went to Mr. Pinner, the constable, he lives in Jewry-street; he was not at home; I desired his wife to send him to me as soon as he came in, she sent him in a few minutes, and I told him the whole story, and that they were to be there by five o'clock, and that I meant to charge a constable with them; I desired him to be there as an officer; he asked me if I thought he had a right to take them without an authority from a Magistrate; I told him I would run all hazards of that; I went with him to Sir

I said, yes; and Ellison said, I only called to return the four shillings; and he threw down some silver on the table, which the officer took up; they insisted I should go with them to the Compter; and Mr. Cook said, I know Mr. Burrell very well, I shall take you; I shall not take him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoners Counsel. You are a master hackney-man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had been at the play this evening? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Alone? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had not been any where after the play? - No.</p>
               <p>You was returning in Drury-lane? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had come down Drury-lane so as to come near this side of Temple-bar; you had not been at Somerset-house at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Not in the course of that evening? - No.</p>
               <p>The first time Ellison made his appearance was after the conversation between you and Hyser? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That conversation began by somebody calling to you in rather a familiar way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That somebody immediately charged you with committing some indecencies? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He then told you that he would charge the watch with you if you did not give him something? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You d - d him for a scoundrel, and said, you would give him nothing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He did not take to his heels and run? - No.</p>
               <p>He walked on side by side; he was met by Ellison, and had some conversation; upon which, Ellison joined in the persisting that you should make some satisfaction for your supposed misconduct? - Yes.</p>
               <p>We heard of some things which must at present be unintelligible to the Court; what may be the meaning of his having been at your house, and found out that you was the master? - What is the meaning!</p>
               <p>What did he mean by that expression; why, they tell me at that house you are the master! Did not you tell him that you was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230025"/>not the master, and that your name was Thomas, and that you was the clerk? - I did not, I only said, I lodged there.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell him that your name was Thomas, and that you was clerk there? - I did not; he never asked me my name.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him your name was Thomas? - I did not, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>You did not tell him you was a merchant's clerk? - No, he asked me if I lodged there, and I told him I did.</p>
               <p>Pray, you walked all along with these people from Temple-bar to Crutched-friars? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A rainy night, passed several stands of coaches, a vast number of watchmen, and these people walking, sometimes by the side of you and sometimes just before you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It rained pretty fast; did it not occur to you to call a coach? - No, Sir; I had a great coat on.</p>
               <p>So that not only protected you against the weather, but against the attack of two people that charged you with an unnatural practice; it did not occur to you to call a coach nor charge the watchman with them? - I thought if I had charged the watch with them, I must have gone to the watch-house with them, and it was a very late hour of the night; besides that, I should not have had an opportunity of explaining myself to them.</p>

               <p>You mean by that, that there would have been charge for charge? - He told me, however innocent I might be, there were two of them to swear against me; that did not strike me before; I dare say it is in my examination.</p>
               <p>Why did not you stop at some watch-house? - Exactly for the very same reason; I had two men to swear again me.</p>
               <p>Why, you are a house-keeper? - But they did not know that; and I had the same reason at Crutched-fryers.</p>
               <p>What did you think of it when you got to your own house, where you have a watchman of your own? - I have not; there is a watchman in the street opposite to my dwelling-house, but not belonging to me.</p>
               <p>He might know you? - I dare say he might; the reason I did not apply to him, was, because these men had just the same plea then, and I thought if they called the next day, I should have a friend there; I applied at two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did you apply till you had met Ellison? - No, I did not think they would have the impudence to come again.</p>
               <p>Why, you told me this instant, that you intended to have got a friend to come in the morning while they were there; then you did not feel that it was necessary to get a friend ready to attend? - I did not apply to any body till I met Ellison.</p>
               <p>How long have you been a hackney-man? - Almost ever since I have been born; my father has been one these forty years.</p>
               <p>You have had a variety of servants, in the course of your time, and some of them have been promoted to a considerable dignity? - No, not of mine; my father had a coachman that was killed in the pillory for unnatural practices; I was not then a master hackney-man; that is about nine years ago.</p>
               <p>This man insisted upon going home with you, and told you he would call again the next morning? - Yes, I never said a word to him whether he was to call again the next morning.</p>
               <p>You left no directions with your servants in case persons of suspicious character should call? - No.</p>
               <p>How many servants do you keep? - I keep eight or nine servants; they were gone to bed; they were at home.</p>


               <p>Then I understand, that till after you had met Ellison the second day, you never mentioned this to any human being? - I do not recollect that I did.</p>
               <p>Do not talk so? - Then I did not; I was about my business as usual, and I staid at home two hours later than usual, meaning if this man came to secure him; I could have secured him.</p>
               <p>Why, had you desired any body to attend,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230026"/>or taken any precautions? - No, I staid at home two hours, if he had come, but I did not think he would have the impudence to come.</p>
               <p>The first thing this man said, when he met you in Jewry-street, was, that he had been at your house about this affair of last night? - He said, he expected I should give him some money.</p>
               <p>He told you he had been at your house, and found you was the master? - I know now, he has been there; I do not at this moment know what he said; I never asked nor never heard.</p>

               <p>The first thing he said was, why, they tell me you are master of that place? - I had not spoke to any body, till I went to my taylor; I told Ellison that was the counting-house I belonged to.</p>
               <p>There you staid ten minutes, till he was gone; did you tell your taylor what passed? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Did you tell any body? - Nobody; I went to Mr. Pinner directly; I did not speak to any body; I gave no information to any public office.</p>
               <p>What part of the house did you sit in, in the play-house? - The two shilling gallery.</p>
               <p>Alone? - Alone.</p>
               <p>Upon the second day, this man told you, I shall not leave you, I shall follow you home; I will have satisfaction of you, and he went with you till you came to your taylor, insisting that he would not leave you, though you told him if he came at five, you would give him money? - He said, that he would not leave me if a bayonet was run through him.</p>
               <p>Did not he add this, I would not leave you if a bayonet was held to me; your conduct is too infamous to be passed over? - No, he did not; I desired one of the constables to continue in hearing; I thought I had two people there to swear against me, and they would naturally speak the truth.</p>
               <p>That truth, as far as it goes, was this, they said they demanded nothing; had there been any thing said from you to them, that this was an infamous charge against you? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Why did not you begin the conversation thus; why do you say that I am guilty of practice which my nature abhors? - It did not strike me; he told me money was what he wanted.</p>
               <p>You say now, that you told them that they knew you was innocent; why did not you mention that sooner? - I did not recollect it; I said, you know I am innocent of what you lay to my charge.</p>
               <p>You stated the whole conversation; did you say any such thing to the prisoners when the constables were present? - I mentioned every thing that I recollected, and you saying it, made me recollect it now.</p>
               <p>In what part of the conversation did you say that to them? - I said it in the course of the conversation; they came in; I asked them what they demanded; he said, he demanded nothing; but I must give him something, then he would tell me whether he was satisfied or no.</p>
               <p>Tell us then in what part of that conversation it was that you said, you know I am innocent of the charge? - When they rung at the bell; when I let that man in I asked him where the other man was, and when the other man came in, I said, you know I am innocent of what you lay to my charge, but what do you demand? I did not mean to give him any thing.</p>
               <p>Have we got now all that passed? - I think you have, and I thought you had.</p>
               <p>Did they say any one syllable to import you was innocent? - They did not do it; all they said, was an assent to my proposition to give them a guinea apiece.</p>
               <p>So your reasons for not calling a coach and not calling any watchman when you came to your house, was the threat that these men would make a counter accusation against you? - They said they would, and therefore I knew they would; they said, they would call the next day.</p>
               <p>And then you was totally unprepared for them? - I was totally prepared for them.</p>
               <p>Did you meet any body in the Minories, particularly that day? - No, Sir, no.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230027"/>Did you meet nobody to whom you gave money to get their dinner that day? - No, Sir, nobody; I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Not on the day after you was at the play? - No, Sir, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>When was that four shillings taken which was returned? - On the preceding night.</p>
               <p>Did not you give that four shillings to any body in the Minories? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Do I understand you right, I think I understood you as saying, that you did not think they would have the impudence to call again; is that true? - I really did not upon my oath, think they would have dared to have called again.</p>
               <p>Then not expecting them to call again, how came you to let them escape that night when you had so many opportunities of taking them? - I thought they would charge the watch with me, for they both of them said, they would swear it; and I thought if they had called the next day, I could have had somebody by.</p>
               <p>Suppose they had not called, you were contented they should have escaped for this crime? - Yes, I must.</p>

               <p>Of the two prisoners, which came in first? - They were both there before I came; they were both in the parlour before I came; I endeavoured to hear what passed, but I could not hear a word spoken; my brother officer says to me, let us go in at once, do not let us us lose any part of our time; so we went in; Mr. Burrell said, that man, George Ellison, has got four shillings of mine.</p>
               <p>Recollect which of the men it was that he said had got the four shillings. - That on the right hand side, Ellison.</p>

               <p>I am constable and under beadle of the ward of Aldgate; I went to Mr. Burrell's house; I was in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Did you hear what passed? - Not a word; I said, what signifies our sitting here, we can hear nothing; let us go into the parlour, and hear what they have got to say directly; we went into the parlour, and at the time I went in, Ellison had four shillings in his hand, and he said, I will not have it; and he threw it down on the table, and said, I will not have it; and that was the first that I heard or saw; I put my hand into my pocket, and pulled out my staff, and I says to Mr. Burrell, do you give charge of these men? yes, says he, I do; says Ellison, I shall give charge of Mr. Burrell.</p>
               <p>Of, What? - I do not know that he mentioned any thing; I said, I know Mr. Burrell, he is a man of credit; I shall not take charge of him; he will be forthcoming.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You would not have taken Mr. Burrell, if the charge had been made the night before? - I would have been bail for him for 1000 l. Mr. Burrell is a man of an upright character, and there are enough in Court that know it.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. You said that one of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230028"/>the principal reasons why you did not take up these men the night before was, because you wished if you did take them up, you should have somebody that should overhear their conversation? - Yes; I thought it was morally impossible for them not to hear, for the room adjoining had a thin partition, and I opened the door, that I might hear the men, and I expected that they had heard it all.</p>
               <p>I think you said before, it was Hyser who took the four shillings from you? - The other demanded it; he desired me to give it to Hyser.</p>
               <p>How came you, when Mr. Pinner came into the room to say that Ellison had got four shillings of your money? - I meant them both, to put them both alike.</p>
               <p>Because Pinner was very correct, I asked him two or three times; then he is mistaken in that, is he? - I spoke of them both together; I thought them equally guilty; I did not know their names.</p>
               <p>But you did not point to Ellison as the man who had the four shillings? - I did not point to either of them.</p>
               <p>Is it true, that the moment the officers came into the room, Ellison laid down four shillings on the table, and said he would not have it? - Yes, I understood him that he said he called to return the four shillings.</p>
               <p>Then tell us the last part of the conversation that passed before the officers made their appearance. - While I asked them if a guinea a-piece would do, they said yes, that was very genteel, the officers came in.</p>

               <p>I see this man will take our lives innocently to save his own character; I had been taking leave of my brother, who was going into the country the next morning; I parted with him at the bottom of Wych-street; coming along Wych-street, I turned up the new street; I had occasion to ease myself, without intention; this man came to me, and asked me how I did? I said, I did not know him; he said, yes you do; he said, you have been in my company a night of two ago; he unbuttoned the flap of my breeches; I said, you villain, what do you mean? he made a scuffle; I followed him without buttoning my breeches; I caught him at the pastry-cook's which is opposite the street; I pursued him; this young man happened to come by at the time; I related to him the story; the young man said, charge him with the watch; I called the watch two or three times; he directly said, do not charge me with the watch, for God's sake; I am a merchant's clerk, and it will ruin me; I beg you will go and see me home; the other young man said, we will walk with you a little farther; he asked the other young man, what are you? says he, I am a servant out of place; says he, it is in my power to help you to a place; we walked along the street, and entered into conversation about his being out of place; the young man said, when he was out of place, he was a <rs id="t17870523-17-deflabel88" type="occupation">hair-dresser</rs>

               <p>Jury.

               <p>Mr. Garrow. By whom? - By a man who went by the name of mad Tom; I did not see the prisoner carry it; the coals went on the shoulders of a man whom the prisoner employed; Hands came into the yard, and said to me, Trevet, there is a backer for you, (that means a large coal) and the men had a pot of beer, and I was to put it to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the prisoner in the passage with these men at the same time that they took away the coals? - When I saw the prisoner, there was nobody in the passage but a gentleman that wanted change; at the time his servant took the coals away, they were both together in my yard; the coals were in the yard.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him give any directions or say any thing to him? - None at all.</p>
               <p>How did the man carry them? - On his shoulders.</p>
               <p>Who conveyed it on? - I did not see.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The man carried them publickly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner is a dustman, and of course sells breeze and soil to brick-makers? - I know he dealt with Mr. Scott for these articles, to the amount of 20 l. or 30 l. a week.</p>
               <p>Then I fancy it was not very uncommon for him to treat Mr. Scott's men with a drop of drink? - They had often pots of beer, for which I believe the prisoner often paid.</p>
               <p>How long may you have known the prisoner to be dealing with Mr. Scott at that rate? - I have not known the prisoner a long time.</p>
               <p>You knew all this that you have told, last sessions? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But you was not here last sessions? - No.</p>
               <p>Can you help us to any reason, why the prisoner was not indicted last sessions? - No, Sir, not at all.</p>
               <p>You do not know of any dispute that may have taken place lately between the prisoner and any body about breeze and soil? - The prisoner was a good civil sort of a man.</p>
               <p>Court. You say the coals were in your yard? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner present at the time the servant carried the coals away? - The prisoner came out of the yard behind the servant; I did not see where the coals were carried.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You made no objection to it? - I could make no objection.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Where do you come from now? - I was confined, because I could not get sufficient bail; I came from Bridewell.</p>
               <p>What are you in custody for? - I was there to come here.</p>
               <p>Have not you been convicted of felony, for stealing these coals? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. You was there to be forth-coming to give evidence? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Not charged with any crime? - No, I was a servant to Mr. Hands.</p>
               <p>What happened on the 11th of April? - On the 11th of April, in the afternoon, I came home with my load of dust to my master's yard; I could not get into the yard; this Shaw and Larney were coming by at the same time; they took my baskets off my cart; I says to Shaw, you have no business with those baskets; I shall not pay a pot of beer for you; because if we do not take the things into the yard we are liable to pay a pot of beer; my master came to me at the gate and bid me go along and mind my business; afterwards he went to the White Hart; he followed the carts there; I waited the spaae of a quarter of an hour; I went to my master and desired him to come into the yard to shoot the load of dust; he said, he would come; but he did not come according to his promise; I went to him again afterwards; he gave me orders to go and shoot my load of dust; after I had shot it, I went to him again and asked him, whether I should put my cart on the outside of the gate, or in the yard; he asked me to drink out of a pot, I believe there might be a gill of brandy or hardly so much; then he came out of the tap room and took me into the yard belonging to Mr. Trevet; he says to me, take these two baskets of coals and put them into my yard.</p>
               <p>What baskets? - Bushel and half baskets; they were the baskets that I had in my cart before, that my master directed Larney and Shaw to take them into the White Hart; there was coals in the baskets, but when I had them before, there was nothing in them; put them out, says he, take this basket of coals home to my yard; there was a great coal in particular, the basket would not hold it; he put it down by the side of the water tub; says he, that is for Mr. Trevet; after I took them coals home to where my master ordered me, I returned into the stable, and carried both these baskets pursuant to my master's directions, into the back yard; I directly unharnessed the horse, and rode him down and saw no more about the coals.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. So they only sent you to Bridewell because you had not a better lodging? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long have you been in Bridewell? - I believe I have been there about fourteen days.</p>
               <p>Why, you was taken up for stealing these coals was not you? - No.</p>
               <p>Which other of your good deeds was you taken up for? - Because I could not get sufficient bail.</p>
               <p>Bail for what? - Bail for my appearance.</p>
               <p>Has friend Trevet supported you in gaol? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Who did? - I had money sent me.</p>
               <p>Belike you can tell who sent it? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>How much has been sent you during this fortnight? - I cannot rightly tell, I believe about twelve shillings.</p>
               <p>Now try your hand at recollection, who sent it you upon your oath, did not Trevet send it you? - No Sir, upon my oath, he has not sent me any, I believe it was Mr. Clarkson.</p>
               <p>Pray, might you carry any of those coals home to your own lodging? - No Sir, none at all.</p>
               <p>That you swear positively? - Yes, nor to no other place but the prisoner's yard, I believe I have worked for him about three or four months.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230036"/>Did Mr. Scott use to deal with him? - Yes, for breeze and soil.</p>
               <p>Pretty largely? - I do not know how much a week; he had large dealings; as fast as he could make the cinders into ashes, Mr. Scott was ready to take them from him.</p>
               <p>How many of you honest men might your master keep? - There were eight of us to fetch the dust, besides the people we employed in the yard, and seven or eight carts.</p>

               <p>Court. Had you told him, to induce him to make this confession, that he should not be prosecuted, or receive favour, or any thing of that kind? - No, it was his own talk; he had his hearing.</p>

               <p>Have you known Mr. Trevet much? - Yes Sir, he lived in our parish; I never saw the last witness till I apprehended him.</p>
               <p>You locked him up directly? - The moment I took him into custody, says he, I will not suffer myself to be served as the other two men were, for I will go before the Justice and tell the whole truth, for I am a servant, and what I did, was by my master's orders; but my orders were to take him away and not let him speak to any body, which I did; he has been in custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am innocent.</p>

               <p>What was in your pocket? - I cannot say particularly, there might be two or three shillings in half-pence and farthings; I saw the patrol take a knife off the bench, near where the tall man sat, which was mine.</p>
               <p>Had either of the half-pence or the farthings any thing singular about them? - There is one half-penny that is crooked and scratched; I only point it out; I had it some time in my pocket; I am sure the prisoners are the men.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Watson. Mrs. Reynolds, do you remember any thing of a disturbance in the house about some man not paying for six penny-worth of something he drank at the time? - I recollect that while I was speaking to that man, these men rushed out of the door.</p>


               <p>Court. Did you ever see your pocket again? - No.</p>
               <p>Did the person with whom you disputed about the payment of the liquor come in with these men? - No Sir, not that I know of, he came in just after; they drank one bowl together; there were two more in company; the other two went away first; these staid behind; when I found they were gone, I could not get the reckoning, and while I was discoursing with this man, the prisoners went away; there were five of them; two went off without paying, when I was applying to the third for payment, these two rushed out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Watson. Do you remember some strange man coming into our company and drinking a share of six penny-worth, and paying three pennyworth of halfpence and no man else drank in our company? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Upon the oath you have taken, you do not come here upon any resentment about the reckoning? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>I was a patrol at this time on duty; I came in with another charge, and going out again, I met the two patrols that have been examined, come in with these prisoners; they were making a noise and a racket as we met them; I came with them to the watch-house, and Mrs. Reynolds said, they had robbed her of her pocket, that she missed it, and she thought it necessary to have them searched; with that, the constable of the night searched the tall man and found half a crown upon him, but Mrs. Reynolds knew nothing of it, and it was delivered to him again; then he searched the prisoner Elveston, and found three shillings in halfpence and farthings, and they were examined, so the constable thought proper to keep the money, and one of the men that was upon duty, said to Mrs. Reynolds, madam, is there any thing else in the pocket but halfpence; yes says she, there was a knife; then he looked about, and as I was standing by the two prisoners, I saw a knife lay down just by the tall man; the prisoners were near together; I asked Mrs. Reynolds if she should know the knife; she said, yes; I asked her the marks; she said, it was her own; I gave the knife either to the constable or Mrs. Reynolds, I do not know which.</p>

               <p>We went in about half after ten and had six pennyworth, then another six pennyworth; then another man drank with us and paid three-pence in part of the reckoning; then we had two glasses of raspberry and a pint of beer which was paid for; then there was six-pennyworth that she said was not paid for; there was a disturbance in the house when that six-pennyworth was brought in and set down; Mrs. Reynolds bolted the door to detain the people; they were going away without paying their reckoning; I asked her to open the door, I was going home; she opened the door, and I wished her a good night.</p>
               <p>PRISONER WATSON'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I had been spending the evening, and in coming home I met this young fellow; I went into this house; I had been drinking before; we had two or three six-pennyworths; I was rather in liquor; I asked Mrs. Reynolds what time her house shut; she said, two o'clock; I came away, and every thing was paid for as it came in; if the last was not paid for, it was by no wilful intent; we went to the Pilgrim; in came a friend; says he, the last six-pennyworth was not paid for; very well, says I, we will go back; we were going back to pay for it, and they took us; it has been attended with the loss of my charactr, and I have been in gaol a great while.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. You have already said that it is only the stature and voice that you can speak to? - Nothing else; the handkerchiefs being round their faces.</p>

               <p>I was an officer on board the Calais packet, belonging to the Excise; on the 4th of May, between the hours of twelve and one in the morning; about ten minutes after twelve we were alarmed, by a boat coming along-side, which I supposed to be an excise-boat, as we are frequently visited in the night; I was coming upon deck, and was met by a tall man with a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230044"/>pistol in his hand; I took one of the cabin chairs up to keep the man from me, while I alarmed my brother officers; I cried out, oh Lord, oh Lord! turn out; while my partner was waking, and turning out, one of them jumped up to the cabin where he was, and stopped him; that was Smithiers that they prevented from jumping out; the tall man that I met first, d - d me, and demanded my money, which I gave him, sixpence in silver, and two-pence farthing, I think there was, in copper, but twopence I am sure of; then he gave me a blow with the but end of a pistol, to make me hold my noise; I was begging for my life; and he bid me go into my bed again; I turned in, and one of them went to Smithiers, and demanded his money; he told them he had none; one of them made reply, cut his head off, a b - r; he made reply, because I have no money, my friends? and another that was in the gang, I believe, prevented him from doing mischief; then they asked us what packages they were that were in the cabin? we said it was impossible for us to tell, as we were only officers on board; but we believed they were perfumery and smelling waters; we could not tell.</p>
               <p>Who was the man that prevented the mischief? - I really believe the evidence was one, and that Romain was the other; they took away three of the packages, and came down and asked me for a candle; my friends, says I, we have no candle; we have nothing more here than what you see; the middle man, which I believe was Cunningham, took the King's book, in which the account of the cargo is entered, and crammed it into the fire to make a light, and it gave a great blaze; then they went up with their packages; they came down a second time, and asked me what was contained in the cag; they asked us round; I said, I believed it to be indigo, but could not tell; they replied, they thought that would do, and went away.</p>
               <p>From the observation you made of these men, can you speak with certainty to any of them? - I am positive sure that Cunningham was one of them that assisted in robbing the ship, by burning the book.</p>
               <p>What do you say as to the other men? - I cannot positively say; but I believe, from the stature of Mr. Romain, that he was the man that prevented them from doing the mischief, or else there would have been murder done.</p>
               <p>What do you say to Hammond? - I cannot say any thing to him; I do not remember Hammond; a tall man came up to me, but I do not believe he is the man; I do not think he is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This was between twelve and one in the morning? - About ten minutes after twelve, on the 4th of May.</p>
               <p>What hats had these persons? - They had round hats on.</p>
               <p>Their faces were muffled? - The blaze of the book gave such a light to Cunningham's face, and his squinting; I am positive sure of him; I could see all the forehead, and the eyes.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that you saw his forehead, when he had a round hat on? - All the eye brows.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not you say that Cunningham squinted? - Yes, that made me take particular notice of him.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing on the last trial about the man's squinting? - I was not asked any questions about Cunningham; I answered every question that was put to me; I understood I was asked as to the tall man.</p>
               <p>Did you, the last time you was here, say any thing about this man's squinting? - No, I cannot recollect I did; I did not say any thing about him, one way or the other.</p>
               <p>Was not you as much bound to disclose the whole then as now? - Yes, but the Judge ordered me down, and I asked Smithiers immediately, am not I to speak about Cunningham? and one of the officers of the Court pushed me back, and said no, you are done with.</p>
               <p>You mentioned nothing of the squinting at the last trial? - If you look at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230045"/>affidavit at the Justices, I swore to it there; I spoke the truth, as far as every question was put to me.</p>
               <p>Do you know what you shall get if this man is convicted? - No, God forbid any thing; I am not of that; I would not desire it; I have children of my own.</p>

               <p>I was on board the Calais packet, as an officer, and on the 4th of May she was entered by people who threatened all our lives; three of them came down into the cabin; one of them robbed me of eighteen and two-pence.</p>
               <p>Can you say, from the observation you could make, whether the prisoners, or any of them, are the men that robbed the ship? - I can form some idea of the persons of the men; part of their faces were not to be discovered, only by their eye-brows, and their statute; we had very little light; I believe two of them to be the men that were in the ship, Romain and Cunningham.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You mean to say you was robbed by some men about the same size? - I saw but four of them in the cabin, and I believe them two to be two of the four that were in the cabin; one of the men was taller, but I do not see him here.</p>

            , took a boat from the Tower, and rowed down the river; I was in the boat with them; we came down to Lady Parson's stairs, and boarded the Calais Packet; she was a sloop; we went down into the cabin, with our handkerchiefs half over our faces, with a pistol and cutlass, meaning to rob the people on board in the cabin of their money; the mate and the officers said they would give all that they had; we took from one of the men in the cabin one shilling and some halfpence; I cannot say which it was that took it; they rummaged all about the officers, to see if they had any watches, but there were no watches, and we took three cases; one case was covered with a mat, and we took two trunks, and put them into the boat; then we went down again to ask the mate for a hammer, or something to break open the cases and two trunks; he got out of his cabin, and gave us a hammer; then we went into the cabin again, and asked the officers what was in this cask that stood by the fire-side, and they said they believed it was indigo; we said then that would do for us, and we put it into the boat, and rowed over to New-stairs, Rotherhithe; alongside of the craft we took away three cases and two trunks, and we began to open the three cases, and they contained doctor's drugs; we opened the trunks, and there were two shirts and a great coat, and two or three pair of silk stockings, and some other articles of wearing-apparel with the shirts; then we began to open the cask, and it contained indigo.</p>
               <p>Is indigo and Prussian blue the same thing? - Yes; we began to tie it up in our handkerchiefs, and the wearing apparel we put into the boat; then we left the three cases in the craft, and the two trunks we chucked over-board, and rowed over to Lady Parson's Stairs, and then walked up the back lane; we had the clothes and the Prussian blue with us; we knocked at the door of one Moses a Jew, the other prisoner, about three in the morning; he came down and let us in; we told him we had some clothes, and this indigo, and we sold the property for four guineas, and shared the money equally alike; every one of us went home to our apartments; we four were all that were concerned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Mr. Dolfin, you stand there with a great deal of ease; how long is it since the ship was robbed of the dollars? - About three years.</p>
               <p>How long have you done business in that way before? - Not many years.</p>
               <p>You appeared then in the same easy manner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>As an accomplice brought from gaol<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230046"/>to this place, to give an account of your behaviour? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I am sorry you did not benefit by the warning of the Court; you received warning from the Court? - Yes, I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Then for these three years you have persevered in your old courses? - No, I have not; I have been on board a man of war since.</p>
               <p>However, you have resumed it; you begin now to be a little ashamed? - No, Sir, I am not.</p>
               <p>What office was you examined at? - At Mr. Smith's, in East Smithfield.</p>
               <p>I am very sorry to see you a witness here again.</p>
               <p>Court to Dawson. Were any of these goods ever found at Moses's? - I received a private information that they were at Mr. Moses's that morning; in consequence of that I went up to Mr. Moses's; but when I came there, I could find nothing; Mr. Moses was at home, he opened the door to me, and told me I was welcome to search all over his house, which I did, as far as I thought was necessary; but when I did not find the property in the place where I had information it was, I did not think it necessary to search any farther; nothing more was done in respect to Moses till the Sunday following, when Dolfin was apprehended; the persons of the other three were described to me, and we apprehended them; I am not quite certain with respect to Hammond, whether he was apprehended the day prior or subsequent to Dolfin's, being examined; in consequence of the information we received from Dolfin, we went again to Moses's house, but Moses had been down at the office, and there was word taken for his appearance at any other time, should he be wanted; Moses said as he said before, I was welcome to look any where, and I searched the house, and could find nothing; he was afterwards taken in custody, and admitted to bail.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. We leave it our counsel.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Meriton. What was the value of this blue? - It is twelve shillings a pound.</p>

               <p>I ask you whether you did not take pains to prevent being served with a subpoena, and keep your wife out of the way too? - Upon my oath, as that man said, he would have me if it cost five guineas; I did keep away in the course of the day; I did not come home to my dinner.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you keep your self and your wife out of the way, in order that you might not be subpoened? - I did.</p>

               <p>Had you mentioned to any body between that and the Tuesday when you was taken, any thing of this good fortune? - No, because it might be taken away again; on the Tuesday and not before, I converted one of those guineas into silver.</p>

               <p>The first you found was on the father and mother's bed? - Yes, eleven pair and a piece of black sattin; they were examined in Litchfield-street, before Mr. Barnfather; he asked me, if I thought any of them belonged to the first robbery; I told him I was not willing to swear to it, if they did.</p>
               <p>Are any of the shoes your property? - They are all mine, the sattin and all; the oldest boy said, that he assured the Justice upon his word and honour that they were all taken out on the Sunday.</p>

               <p>On the 30th of April last, about seven in the morning, my fellow servant came to me for the keys of the shop; I went with him to go to work, and found the door was bolted at bottom on the inside; we could not get in; I went and called my master; he came with me and he found the same; then I went and brought a ladder, and we got into the one pair of stairs window, and found a pane of glass had been taken out of the door; we saw a few shoes were gone, but could not recollect how many; that pane of glass was in the door, between the shop and the passage; the first square from the ground is about two feet and a half from the ground; we then examined the doors, and found all the doors and windows fast; I examined the rooms and saw the print of boys feet in the dust of the rooms, without shoes; some of the marks were like as if they had shoes on, and some had not.</p>
               <p>How do you know they were the print of boys shoes? - By the length of their shoes; I could count the great toe and the little toe through the stocking; the print in the dust.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - Yes, I could see the print of the great toe and the little toe in the dust, with stockings on; I came and brought my master and other people up stairs; I have the goods in my possession; they were delivered to me in the office.</p>
               <p>Who did you shew these prints in the dust to? - To Mr. Grieve.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. To me; I measured them, and by the measure of the print we knew the size of it to be a boy or girl, and we thought it had been a chimney sweeper; we could tell by the measuring of it; the dust had fallen in and the foot of the stocking had sucked up the dust; I measured two in particular, and I measured the biggest boy when I went into the house, and it answered to the biggest boy; eight inches; I only measured it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Grieve called on me, and I went to search the boys father's house; and in different parts of the house, we found shoes; in the two pair of stairs, on the top of the feather bed, we found some; he said, it was his bed; he was in the room with us; we found some sattin there; we went up in the garret, where the children lay, (as he said) and we found some more in the garret bed, covered with some clothes; then we went to the cock-lost, and found a good many more pair; we brought them to the office in Litchfield-street, and I brought the old man; I found this pistol in the cock-loft, with Mr. Grieve's shoes.</p>
               <p>(A pistol about the length of a finger.)</p>
               <p>I brought the children with us; the big boy was suspected; he wanted to get away; I was present when they was examined, and Mr. Grieve was present, and there was a great many in the office; Mr. Barnfather was there, and the clerk; I believe there was some acquaintance of the prosecutor's; I was in and out.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My Lord, the office was as full as it could hold; I heard the children examined; one said to the other, you would persuade me to do such a thing.</p>
               <p>To Mac Donald. What was said to these children at first? - Nothing to my knowledge; we brought them to the officer; I brought the big one; the little one I brought from school.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I should be very happy they should be discharged; I do not want to make the matter worse; the big prisoner at the office, denied knowing any thing of doing it, till we found the shoes; there were two buttons found, and they corresponded with the jacket he had on; he then said, more people wore such buttons; the name of the biggest boy is John; them are the same sort of buttons; but he said, they were larger, and they did appear larger.</p>

               <p>Does the little boy go to school any where? - Yes, in Litchfield-street.</p>

               <p>Do you know what promises were made to these children if they would tell the truth? - I saw Mr. Grieve clap my brothers on the head, and told them to tell the truth, and they should not be hurt; that was at the Cock.</p>
               <p>Did your father ever say any thing to them? - No Sir, they were taken directly to Bridewell, my father never saw them after.</p>
               <p>Court. Swear her to give evidence.</p>
               <p>SWORN IN CHIEF.</p>
               <p>Had any thing been said to you after, of the evidence you was to give by any body? - Nobody said any thing.</p>
               <p>Has there been any threats to prosecute you if you did not tell the truth? - No Sir, nobody said any thing to me; my father said, I must tell all the truth.</p>
               <p>But did any body at the Justice's tell you, that if you did not give evidence you would be prosecuted? - No, not to my remembrance.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that nobody told you that if you did not give evidence against these boys, your father and you should be prosecuted? - No Sir, not to my remembrance; I do not remember it.</p>
               <p>It could not well pass without your remembering it; will you swear that no such thing did pass? - I cannot say so unless I was positive of it.</p>
               <p>Did nobody ever say to you, that unless you gave evidence against these boys, you or some of the family would be prosecuted? - No Sir, I cannot positively say, whether they did or no.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, was not your father threated with a prosecution, unless evidence was given against these boys? - I do not know that, indeed.</p>
               <p>Was not you yourself threatened? - I do not recollect I was.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that no such threat was ever made use of to you? - I cannot, because I am not positive; they might, and I not take notice of what they said.</p>
               <p>Was any such thing ever said to you by any body or not? - I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Yes, you can positively say, if no such thing was never said, it is easy for you to say so? - They might say so, and I never took notice of it.</p>
               <p>Who do you think said so as you recollect<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230054"/>now? - Nobody that I recollect; nobody said any thing to me.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes, I am sure my father did not; there have been a many people to see my father, since my brothers have been gone.</p>
               <p>But I want to know what any body has said to you. - Nobody has said any thing to me.</p>
               <p>Did any body else? - People have spoke to me; but I do not remember their saying any thing of that sort to me.</p>
               <p>You do not say heartily that they did not; you have nothing to fear here; you are under protection here, provided you speak the truth; nothing can hurt you now or hereafter, if you speak the whole truth; and you are liable to be punished, if you do not speak the whole truth; did any body ever persuade you to give evidence against these boys, in order to save either yourself, or any part of your family, from a prosecution? - No, Sir, nobody never did; I am sure nobody did; many people said, be sure you tell the whole truth, and do not go tell a story upon your oath.</p>
               <p>But had you no motive to induce you to come here to give evidence against your three brothers? - No more than that I was ordered; I went up to speak to my brothers, and I saw the shoes in the cockloft.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing how these shoes came into your father's house? - I asked my brother how they came there, and he said my brother William had been playing; he said he had been a top of the leads; and my little brothers some of them, I do not know which, went down into the house, and brought up some of the shoes; and when I saw the shoes, I desired them to take them back again, and my big brother said he would; my little brother had them in a pin-a-fore; then my father called us all down to read; it was on Sunday night.</p>
               <p>How came they a top of your father's bed? - When the constable came with a search-warrant to the house, my mother came up stairs, and I saw Mr. Grieve, and I thought what he came for, and I went into the cock-loft and brought the shoes down, and put them on my mother's bed.</p>
               <p>How long had they been in the house? - On Sunday night, and this was on Monday morning, when I went up I saw them in the cock-loft; my eldest brother told me where they came from; they were all up in the cock-loft; when I came up they were jumping about.</p>
               <p>Did you never see any of them before that Sunday evening? - No, Sir, never before, nor heard any thing of them; I had often been up in the cock-lost; I was up there on the Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Are the shoes here that were found?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Yes.</p>
               <p>(The shoes deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court. There was no way in which they could be got out of your shop, but in the way you have described before? - No.</p>

               <p>Mr. TIREY, the father, sworn.</p>
               <p>I think, to the best of my knowledge, the eldest is fifteen, and the other is twelve, or in his thirteenth, and the youngest is about nine, or between nine and ten; I cannot say which; I have it down; I did not look at their age; I did not think it would have been asked.</p>

            ; and the first point that you ought to consider in an indictment of this kind, is the capacity of the parties to commit the crime of which they are charged: the law requires that a person who is charged with a crime, should be in a situation capable of comitting that crime; he should be a moral agent; the law has fixed different ages, to enable persons to do different acts; at the age of twenty-one a party is completely master of himself, in point of law, and capable of doing every act that any other freeman can do; at the age of seventeen a person is capable of being an executor, and of acting in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230055"/>affairs belonging to that, provided the trust is reposed in them by other people; the age of fourteen is what is usually called in law the age of discretion; and anciently, before the laws that were made in restraint of marriage, at that age children were capable of consenting, so as to contract themselves in marriage; below the age of fourteen they are considered, in point of law, as not within the age of discretion; the law, however, has fixed no precise time at which a child shall begin to be responsible for its actions; and anciently, doubts have been entertained with respect to all ages; for ideots, lunaticks, and persons non compos mentis, are not answerable for crimes that they commit; in the same way, a child that is of so tender years as to be alike incapable of distinguishing good from evil, and of knowing the moral consequence of its actions, is not capable, in point of law, of committing a crime; and a variety of doubts have been from time to time entertained, with respect to the capacity of children to commit crimes, when under the age of discretion; for after the age of discretion, which is fourteen, the law presumes capacity to make them accountable, but not before that age, unless some act is shewn, or unless it appears that the party charged with the crime, from their actions, or from their committing the fact itself, had that degree of understanding and discretion sufficient to make them accountable for their actions, and conscious of the nature and consequences of them; and on that principle it is, that sometimes children of very tender years have been condemned and executed for very atrocious offences; there was one instance of a child of between nine and ten years of age condemned and executed for murder; and the judges were of opinion, that the circumstances of the case being attended with a considerable degree of cunning, and with endeavours, on the part of the child, to conceal the fact which it had committed; they were of opinion, that these circumstances evidenced a degree of capacity in the child, beyond its years, and a consciousness of what it had done, and that it was answerable; in the same manner, in other instances, the judges have admitted that principle, that a degree of cunning, and of that malicious mind which the law requires in the perpetration of crimes, will supply the defect of years, and make the party responsible for their actions; but in general, something should appear to induce a jury to think that the child is conscious of the consequences of its actions, in order to induce them, on any evidence, however clear, to convict such child of a felonious action, because they must not only be satisfied that the fact was committed, but that it was committed from a felonious intention; now a felonious intention can never exist in any person who, from years, or other circumstances, are not acquainted with the consequences of what they do; I therefore think it very clear that the younger boy ought to be acquitted; for if he had been in point of fact guilty, there is no evidence, either from the circumstances of the case, or the previous conduct of the child, to shew any degree of art or cunning beyond his years, or to fix him with a moral consciousness of his actions; and unless it appears from the circumstances of the case, or from the conduct of the child, that there was a degree of art and discretion in him, that made him accountable, he is not a person capable of being acquainted with the nature of the case, and he should therefore be acquitted, as a person not capable of knowing the nature and tendency of his actions; but it would be dangerous to fix any rule, and it is left to the discretion of the Court and Jury to judge from the circumstances of the case, whether these circumstances are such as to supply the defect of years; and certainly there is no evidence of that sort in the case of the younger child; so far with respect to him, therefore, I think clearly, whatever your opinion may be, you ought to acquit him; the next is so near what the law calls the age of discretion, that it would be too much to acquit him on account of his years alone; I will therefore<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230056"/>state the evidence as it respects the two older boys.</p>

               <p>You are sure that was in the bag? - Yes, I took it to my counter, and threw out part of the money that was in it; he would not give me time to give him the change; but in haste began to handle the money, saying immediately that he wanted a choice half guinea; not finding one to please him, among the money that I threw out, he took hold of the bag, throwing out the remainder himself; he amused me in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230063"/>this manner, with speaking of the different terms that they call our coin in France, and in the present time took up half a guinea out of the money that he himself threw out, saying, that half guinea would do; he then paid me a respectful compliment for the favour I had done him, and I put the rest of the money in the bag immediately, without telling what was left; the prisoner then beckoned me to forward it into my desk with all speed, fearful I might lose some; he then looked at some leather that lay on some shelves in the shop, and to repeat his own words, he said, nice leather for breeches; he then behaved in a strange manner, by patting me on the back, and saying, you know what you are about; he then returned me so many thanks for the favour I had done him, that I almost thought myself under an obligation to him, instead of him to me, and immediately left my shop; my worthy and much esteemed neighbour and friend, Mr. Burridge, of Newport-market, stepped in, interrogating me -</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. Do not tell us what passed between you and him. - I will, in as concise a manner as possible, bring it to a conclusion; Mr. Burridge asked me if I had lost any money, if I had given him change; he said, has that man touched you, that went out? I said he has; he passed a few minutes; I said, Sir, you alarm me, is the man possessed with the plague; or any thing that is infectious, for he has touched me, and handled me; he said, has he touched your money? I said, he has touched my money.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prisoner speak English? - He did speak both French and English, as I shall make it appear; Mr. Burridge asked me if I had counted the money since I gave him change; I said no, I had not; I then went and counted the money before Mr. Burridge, and there were seven guineas exactly, to one farthing.</p>
               <p>You are sure, as you said before, that there were ten guineas when the prisoner came into your shop? - There were ten guineas in amount.</p>
               <p>How lately before his coming in, had you counted the money? - The money was counted and locked in the desk the night before.</p>
               <p>By whom? - By my brother; I believe the desk was locked when I told the money before Mr. Burridge; I found there were three guineas short, and that the man had robbed me of three guineas; I beg leave to observe, that Mr. Burridge watched the man both in and out; I desired Mr. Burridge, as he had been to his house, to let me know if he came to his house again, and I would let him know if he came to my house; last Tuesday was a week, the 15th of May, the prisoner went to Mr. Burridges's house for some veal cutlets, and Mr. Burridge sent his servant to me, to tell me he wanted to speak to me; I went over, and saw Mr. Burridge, and the second person I saw, was the prisoner at the bar, who wanted very much to shake hands with me; my recollecting him immediately, I told him, you had better keep your distance; shall I shake hands with a man that has robbed me once, and would again if he had it in his power? he started immediately, and pretended to be surprised, though I believe he was not; I told Mrs. Burridge that he affected not to understand English, though I believe he did; to communicate to him in French, that I was the person he came to a month ago wanting one day, for change for a guinea, and at that time availing himself of robbing me of three guineas; the moment he was told that, he took out three guineas out of his pocket, saying, you take your three guineas and let me be gone; I refused taking the money, and said, I should seek to the law for redress; I sent for a constable who did not come; then I went to the office in Litchfield-street, where I got a runner; he was taken to the office and committed by Mr. Barnfather.</p>
               <p>Court. Did any thing particular pass on the examination? - He behaved in a very improper manner, with a great deal of contempt to me, and the Justice told him, it was a matter of too serious a nature to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230064"/>be trifled with; my brother being not at home, he was detained till six o'clock, when he was re-examined by Mr. Justice Barnfather and was committed; I employed an attorney in order to see the business conducted, and the Jury found a true bill.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What are you? - A leather-seller.</p>
               <p>Is that the business you have constantly been brought up in? - No Sir, I was a woolstapler, or fellmonger, with my father.</p>
               <p>I thought you had kept a school made me ask you? - No Sir, I have a brother that does keep a school.</p>
               <p>So I thought; you say this was on the 18th of April this person came into the shop and asked you for change for a guinea? - Yes.</p>
               <p>On that occasion, you tell us he produced a very good fair weighty guinea? - A most excellent guinea.</p>
               <p>You said you went to the desk then, and took out a bag containing some money? - I did not take out the bag the first time, I took out two half guineas out of the bag, leaving the bag in the desk; I put the guinea he gave me into the bag again; I have been speaking only of one bag.</p>
               <p>You led us to understand at first, that you knew perfectly well the contents of this bag? - At first I did.</p>
               <p>Afterwards you said, you did not know the contents of it, because it was your brother that counted? - My brother counted it, over night.</p>
               <p>Then you know nothing of the real contents but from your brother's information, not from your own knowledge? - No Sir, I knew the contents of it so far as this; I settled the books for the day.</p>
               <p>This bag was your own? - It was mine and my brothers; it is a bag we have for the purpose; we always leave one day's money for another day's change.</p>
               <p>Had you not used it for any private expences of your own? - No Sir, this is the first time the bag was ever out of the house; I have a man; he is here; me and my brother have each of us a key of the desk.</p>
               <p>Have you any wife? - I am not so happy as to have a wife.</p>
               <p>Then your brother has? - No Sir, we are both single men.</p>
               <p>The prisoner staid a few minutes with you talking after he took the money; the prisoner did not affect to know you at the time you saw him again? - He seemed to recollect me, and shake hands with me as a friend; I should have said that he refused that ever he had tendered the money; he spoke in English, you take your three guineas and let me be gone; as plain and as articulate as I do.</p>
               <p>This man evidently is a foreigner? - Yes Sir, I believe him to be a foreigner; I wish he had remained foreign to me.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am brother to the last witness; I counted this money that was in this drawer the over night; there was in amount, in gold, silver and half-pence, ten guineas.</p>
               <p>When you had counted the money and put it into the bag, and put it into the desk, what did you do? - I put the money into the desk, and locked the desk, and put the key into my pocket.</p>

               <p>Did you ever take any of that money out again? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you and your brother each a key? - Each of us.</p>
               <p>Did you give that key to any body? - I kept it in my own pocket.</p>
               <p>Had any other person but your brother and you a key? - None else.</p>
               <p>Is it a good lock or is it a lock that any other key will open? - It is a tumbler lock; I took none neither that night nor the next day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Your brother has an equal access to the money as yourself? - I never suffer any money to be taken out whatever.</p>
               <p>Your brother has the command of the lock as much as you? - No Sir, I would not suffer my own brother to do it, for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230065"/>what ever goods are bought, I commonly pay with a draft on my banker.</p>
               <p>You do not understand the question, cannot your brother, having a key, go to the desk as well as you? - Without a doubt.</p>
               <p>And you occasionally trust your servant with the key? - No.</p>
               <p>Not to give change? - No Sir, we do not go to the desk for change, we go to the till; it happened that morning after I had breakfasted, I undid the desk to take out the book in which we enter the goods that are sold, and there had been no customer in that morning, and there was nobody in the shop, but my brother, after breakfast, till the prisoner came in.</p>
               <p>But your brother has equal access as well as you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you given a draft to your brother for his share of that money which was in the bag? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Was it your custom to give drafts of that sort? - That morning I had no bill due; I had bought no goods, so that I had no occasion to give a draft that morning.</p>
               <p>Was it your constant custom to give your brother a draft for his share of the money in the desk? - No Sir, if we want money for our own private expences, we take out as much as we want by a draft on the banker.</p>
               <p>Then if your brother wanted any money, you would have given him a draft on your banker? - Yes, if he wanted any.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you taken any money out for any purpose? - No Sir, that I did not.</p>

               <p>The prisoner at the bar came to my shop on the 18th of April; my first knowledge of him was, on Saturday the 14th; he came and bought a piece of beef, or rather a slice more properly; it came to a shilling or fourteen-pence; he paid Mrs. Burridge for it, and during the time Mrs. Burridge was giving him change, I had reason to suspect him; and having that reason, I went to Mr. Hitchen, on the 18th; then he came again for something; after he left my shop, he went to Mr. Hitchen's immediately; I watched him into the shop; I saw him go in again; I staid till he came out; I saw him pat Mr. Hitchen on the back and come out of the shop, upon which I went in immediately; I asked Mr. Hitchen if he had changed any money for that gentleman; I asked him if he had touched him; and he said, yes; he seemed very much surprised, and asked the reason why; he asked if he was possessed with the plague or any infectious disorder; I asked him if he had touched the money; he said, yes, he had; I desired him then to count the money.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you before he counted the money, how much there ought to be in the bag? - No, he did not; he counted it, and said, there were three guineas short; he said, there were to the amount of ten guineas in gold, silver, and halfpence, in the bag when he gave him change, and that then there were but seven, and that therefore, he had robbed him of three guineas.</p>
               <p>Did you see the money counted? - No, I thought he would come to him again; he told me he thought not; I said, I dare say he will come to my shop again; accordingly he desired me, if he did, to let him know; the prisoner came to my shop on Tuesday, the 15th of May, and Mrs. Burridge told me, he wanted some veal cutlets; I took down the veal to cut the cutlets; during the time the cutlets were cutting, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230066"/>said, veal cutlets, in English; and during this time, Mrs. Burridge sent one of my servants to call Mr. Hitchin; he came; the prisoner was then in my shop; the moment he saw Mr. Hitchin, he immediately wanted to shake hands with him; Mr. Hitchin said, do you think I will shake hands with a man that has robbed me? or something to that purpose; Mrs. Burridge then gave him to understand, Mr. Hitchin was the gentleman that he had taken three guineas from; so without any hesitation at all, the prisoner put his hand in his pocket, took out three guineas, and laid them on the block, and said, you take your three guineas and let me be gone; you be very good gentleman; he wanted to be gone out of the shop, and Mr. Hitchin pulled him back, saying, he would deal with him another way, according to law.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Mr. Hitchins stated you to us, as his very worthy and much esteemed friend; now I find that when you went over the way, you communicated your suspicions to him? - I did.</p>
               <p>Then there is no doubt that you had your suspicions at the time you saw the man go in? - I had.</p>
               <p>You suffered him to stay with your worthy and much esteemed friend, and to do what you supposed he would do? - I could not reduce it to a certainty.</p>
               <p>Now you see how much you deserve the title he has given you; when he came to your shop, the man offered to shake hands with him at once? - He did.</p>
               <p>This man does not rightly understand English? - He pretended not.</p>
               <p>He does not seem to understand English very well? - No, he does not.</p>

               <p>Have you any thing to say in your own defence?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went to the butcher's shop for change for a guinea, and he gave me two half guineas, and I have been two or three times to buy some meat there, and the day I was taken, they told me something, but I could not understand a word they said, and the lady told me about three guineas, in French.</p>
               <p>What did they say to you about three guineas? - They said something about three guineas, but I could not understand what they said.</p>
               <p>Did Mrs. Burridge speak to you in French or English? - She spoke to me in French, but she only said, we, we.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Burridge. Did you explain to him that Mr. Hitchin was the man that he had robbed of three guineas? - I did.</p>
               <p>You can speak French a little, could you speak enough in French to explain that? - He made a great many emotions, and offered it him again; then I said, why do you offer that three guineas? says he, he says, I owe him three guineas; says I, he says no such a thing.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you speak to him in French? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did he understand you? - I am sure he did; he eat paper for madness; he put me in a great tremble for fear he had pistols; I asked him, why he tendered him the three guineas; he said, because he understood he owed him three guineas.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you explain it to him? - I said, he was the man that had lost three guineas, and that he must have it.</p>

               <p>I was the wife of the deceased; on the 25th of April, I went to the Three Compasses for my husband; between nine and ten in the evening; he had not been there long.</p>
               <p>How long might he have been there? - I cannot say; a neighbour called for him, and I went to fetch him home; and he said he would come immediately; upon that I left the house; about two doors off, the two prisoners stopped me; the prisoner Thomas put his hand round me; they came after me; then Thomas put his hands round my waist and quite confined me; I called out, and my husband came out; the other man was with him at that time; they were close together; the other man did nothing till my husband came; upon my husband coming they unloosed me, and Thomas and Roberts immediately struck my husband as soon as ever he came up; Thomas was the first that struck him; he struck him a violent blow on each side of his face; he had a sad black eye and his jaw was broke; they gave him more blows than one.</p>
               <p>Did he return any of the blows? - He could not, I caught hold of my husband.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he did not return any blows at all? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>What was the immediate effect of the blows on your husband, did he fall? - That I cannot say; I run away and called White; he did not fall while I staid, I was gone but a very short time; White run directly, and when White was coming up the men run away, and when I saw them again, they were at the Red Lyon door; that was not above five minutes after; I am sure these are the very men that so accosted my husband; I did not know them, nor I never heard from him that he knew them; my husband was taken to Mr. Oldroyd's; he continued ill till he died.</p>
               <p>When did he die? - On the Thursday, the 3d of May.</p>
               <p>Was he in good health before this? - In very good health.</p>
               <p>How long before his death did he apprehend he was dying? - On the Tuesday the 1st of May, he told me he had got his death blow, and that if he died, he hoped I would see justice done.</p>
               <p>After that time that he declared he was sensible he was dying, did he give you any account of what passed at this time? - No, he did not.</p>

               <p>Was this poor man brought to your house after he had received the injury? - He came to me about eleven in the evening on the 25th of April; his jaw was luxated and broke; it was dislocated and broke; I reduced his jaw, and immediately he was in a violent hurry and in high spirits; he jumped up and wanted to run out; stop, says I, you must have something to rub your face for your teeth are loose; he said, they were so before; he said he was perfectly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230070"/>easy; and, to make use of his own expression, he said he could crack a brick; I then was to see him the next morning, and as he did not call on me before I went out, I called at his house, and he was out; on the Friday morning I called again upon him, and he was out likewise; on the Friday in the afternoon I saw him, and his face was very much swelled on both sides; on the Saturday evening I called upon him, and found him at home, he said he was much better, and his face easier, but that he had some little pain in his side, which when he coughed, it gave him much pain; I asked him if he had had any blow or kick, or fall against any thing.</p>
               <p>By that you meant any blow on the side I suppose? - Yes; he answered, I had no blows but on my face, nor any fall by which my side was hurt, for I only staggered against the house; he went further, he said he had had a pain in his side sometime; I sent him an emulsion for his cough, and he seemed better the next morning, though he had a restless night.</p>
               <p>Had he a considerable degree of cough at that time? - No, by no means violent.</p>
               <p>You understand he had a restless night? - Yes; on the Monday I saw him again, and he was feverish; I think it was the first time I observed any fever.</p>
               <p>State a little particularly what he complained of on the Monday morning? - Nothing but his side, he complained of nothing else; he made no complaint of his face at all; on the Monday in the afternoon, his pain of his side increased so much, that he was bled on Tuesday morning; Doctor

               <p>Was he then capable of giving any account of his complaints? - Not that afternoon; on Wednesday morning between ten and eleven, I was called to see him, and was told he had had a very bad night, and I found him exceedingly delirious, and he would not suffer me to touch his face; Doctor Smith was expected to see him again in the morning, and I desired them to continue the medicines, and take care of him till I saw him again, and I saw him no more; about twelve o'clock on Wednesday, I had a message sent me, that I need not trouble myself to attend any more; he died the next day.</p>
               <p>Court. You saw this man for a week, from the time of the accident? - Yes.</p>
               <p>From your judgement of the progress of his complaint, and from what you saw when you last saw him, what was the cause of his death? - There seemed to be two complaints, an original one, and the accident; but the accident was of such a nature, that I hardly think it could occasion his death.</p>
               <p>Was that original complaint, in your opinion, independant of the accident? - There seemed to be an original complaint, independant of the accident; the pain in the side appeared to be inflammatory, there was no fracture on the head, and I scarcely think the fracture of the jaw could occasion his death; so long as he complained of the pain in his jaw, he never had the least fever.</p>
               <p>Jury. You say, before this accident, this man had a pain in his side? - So he told me.</p>
               <p>Had he not been beat about the head as he was, do you think that pain of his side would have brought on the fever? - It certainly would, I think the fever was more likely to be occasioned by the pain in the side, than by the broken jaw; I just saw the man after death, he was not opened.</p>
               <p>You did not observe any external appearance on the side after death? - There was none; I observed that twenty-four hours after he had been dead, that the part where the inflammation was, was extremely warm, and no other part.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230071"/>What reason do you give for that? - The violent inflammation of the part.</p>
               <p>Why did not you open him? - There was an objection made on the part of the wife, and not a strong requisition on the part of the Coroner.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday the 2d of May, I attended the deceased, and found him in a high fever, and delirious, and his jaw fractured; no dressing, nor any thing of the kind on it, which they told me he had taken off in the night in his delirium; I bled him, and saw him again in the afternoon, I did not find him better; the next morning I saw him again, he had a very bad night, he had no sleep, I repeated the bleeding, the next night he died; he was never in his senses, it was necessary for three or four people to sit on the side of the bed, I heard nothing from him; I saw him after death, when Mr. Oldroyd made the observation on his side; the man certainly died of a fever, but whether it proceeded from the injury he received from the prisoners, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Taking it to be true that this man had complained for some time of a pain in his side, which had increased considerably, should you rather have treated it as proceeding from the pain in the side, or from the fracture? - From the pain in the side, I agreed with Mr. Oldroyd.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I beg to go further for the sake of the prisoners; your Lordship knows there is another way of proceeding, which is by appeal, which will be pursued.</p>
               <p>Court to Smith. You could not form a judgement what occasioned the fever, from your own observation? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Now supposing the fact to be as stated, that the fever did not come on till the inflammation of the jaw had greatly subsided, and that previous to the coming on of the fever, the man had complained of a pain in his side, which he had had some time; under these circumstances, was it most likely the fever should be occasioned by the pain in the side, or by some other subsisting cause? - The deceased had been guilty, as I understand, of some irregularity, such as walking abroad, and eating and drinking, which might have contributed with the bruises.</p>
               <p>But when a fever arises by an accident from exernal injury, whether the inflammation<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230072"/>attending that injury, is not the cause that produces that fever? - No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Then if the inflammation fails to produce a fever when it is at it's heighth, does it usually come on when it is subsided? - Very seldom; if any cause tends to bring on, and renew that second inflammation, it may be as likely to introduce a fever as the first.</p>
               <p>But is the fever produced without the introduction of the inflammation? - No, certainly not; my judgement is the same as Mr. Oldroyd's.</p>

               <p>I was mother to this poor man; I came on the Sunday, which was the 29th of April; when I asked for him, they told me he was very bad up stairs; I attended him to the time he died; I found him laying on the bed; I asked him how he did; he said he had been used very ill by two men, and his jaw-bone was broke all to pieces, and a violent kick he had received on his side, under the short ribs, and he complained of it very much, which occasioned a great spitting; I had not seen him for a month before; I never heard him complain of a pain in his side; he said on the Monday he was a dead man; he said he was kicked by these two men, which was the occasion of his death, and if he died, he hoped they would have the justice of the law.</p>
               <p>He was perfectly in his senses? - Yes, he said so not ten minutes before his death; he bore it with a great deal of patience.</p>
               <p>Not at all light-headed? - No, he might at times.</p>
               <p>Was he at all delirious? - Not at all; he did not say any thing but what was sensible; I looked upon him not to be out of his senses.</p>
               <p>Did you tell any body of this, what he said about the kick? - I told Mr. Oldroyd he complained of a pain of the side; I was sent for to him about a quarter of an hour before he died.</p>
               <p>How came you not to be examined before the Coroner? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Had not you a child died of a fever in the house? - There was no child, nor nobody died in the house, to my knowledge; I have no child, the child is living now.</p>
               <p>Jury. Do you know whether he did not tear off some bandages from his jaws in the night? - No, Sir, he did not pull them off; they came off, by his moving himself in the night; I said that he pulled them off; I do not wish to take their lives away, nor any thing but justice.</p>
               <p>Do you say, that he was not, for a considerable part of this illness, delirious? - He was not; every person that came in, when they asked him who they were, he told their names directly, for which I look upon him not to be out of his senses.</p>

               <p>Have you any doubt that he was out of his senses? - I do not think he was out of his senses only two or three hours before he died.</p>

               <p>Court. Then it is not true, that he was so much out of his senses, and so delirious, as to have three or four men at his bedside to attend him? - Sir, he was not out senses, though there were so many with him, because he wanted to go down stairs.</p>

               <p>Did not you think he was foolish for that; did not you think he was out of his senses? - No, I did not think he was.</p>

               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, from the course this prosecution has taken, rather than from any thing in the evidence that has been given, I think it necessary to take up a little more of your time in stating distinctly to you the substance and effect of that evidence; because it is highly necessary and proper, in this case, that whatever verdict you think fit to give should be satisfactory to the public, though there is no great reason to expect that it will be satisfactory to the parties concerned in this prosecution; and I am sorry to be obliged to make some observations on that part of the evidence, in a prosecution where it is carried on by a wife, for whose feelings great allowance should be made; but there appears to be a degree of zeal, that after making all the allowances that ought to be made for the feelings of a wife on this occasion, seems to go a little beyond a zeal for justice; for it is impossible but to observe, that not a single syllable has ever been said at any time, or by any witness, till after the evidence of the surgeons was read, that the complaint of the deceased's side was the probable cause of his death; in all the depositions, not a single word or hint was given, that this man ever received any violence on his side; so that the idea of his having received a kick on his side is clearly adopted (whether true or false, you are to judge) but it is clearly adopted and brought forward, after the surgeons had been examined before the Coroner, and had declared their opinions, similar to that which they have declared now; unquestionably, therefore, in such a situation, and under such circumstances, you are to receive such evidence with extreme caution indeed; for it is extremely<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230075"/>singular, that when the impression is strongest on the witness, that not one syllable should be suggested of that nature, till they found it material; then under all these circumstances, and with all this caution, there is but one witness that has brought himself to venture to swear that he saw or knew of any violence done by these men on his side, that is

            , he having heard what passed before the Coroner, for he was examined as a witness there; he having heard the distinct evidence given by the surgeons, he now, for the first time, swears that he saw the prisoner Thomas kick the deceased on the side; if that fact be true, there is a strong probability that that kick was the cause of his death; but it not only comes out in this very suspicious manner, but with this further circumstance, that the very witness that swears to it now, did not swear to it before the Coroner, but on the contrary, swore that he did not know any such thing; he swore to his kicking at him, whether at his legs or his side he did not know; he was repeatedly asked, before the Coroner, whether he had or no; he said he did not know; therefore not much credit is to be given to that part of his testimony; then that is attempted to be confirmed by declarations of the deceased; and I am extremely sorry to say, that the evidence of the mother is directly, fully, and pointedly contradicted, not only by the evidence of the two gentlemen, Oldroyd and Smith; but what is still more, this woman has ventured to swear that this man was never out of his senses, from the time she saw him to his death, though both the surgeons have positively sworn that he was delirious in a high degree; and though the fact sworn is beyond a possibility of doubt, because, it is impossible to assign a reason to common sense, why a man in that rank of life should have four men called in to attend him in his illness, unless he was in a high delirium; therefore the evidence of the mother cannot be true; she has sworn he was sensible to the last, and has added to the declarations and confirmed the testimony of White, by saying that he declared that he had had a kick in the side; Oldroyd distinctly swore he put the question to him, and that he repeatedly told him that he had not, and that it was an old complaint; so that to be sure, unless you disbelieve the evidence of the other witnesses, it is impossible that you can believe the evidence of the mother to be true.</p>

               <p>I cannot say any further, than I was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I do not know the tin, only that it is of the same kind; it is broke into ten thousand pieces; he confessed taking it before the Justice; I made him no promises; I am sure of that; he said, he could not tell where he was going to take it, but if he could not sell it, he would bring it back again.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was he in liquor at the time they took him? - Not when he put it in the coals; I believe he was in liquor when he was taken; he had been with me a year and an half; I had so high an opinion<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230091"/>of him, that he is the last of the labourers that I should have suspected.</p>

               <p>How happens it that you appear so bruised? - By the people of the house, at the Seven Stars; I was there on the Monday; I saw the two prisoners come in; and this quarrel was because I was to come on this trial; they said for a pot of beer I would swear either way; I was very much affronted, for I would not state any thing but the truth; the landlord beat me, and said he would murder me; it was understood I was to come here in favour of the prisoners; the money was weighed before I came in; I was in coloured clothes; the prisoners came in about five minutes afterwards, they did not even sit down in the house, the prisoners asked the Turk about the petition; the Turk told him to go about his business; the prisoner told the Turk he was no Turk, that he was a beggar, at which the Turk was very much enraged; he stood up, and put his hand to his knife, for he had a knife, or something of that sort tucked into his girdle; when the Turk stood up, the prisoner said, what are you gong to stab me with your knife, and he said no, I will not stab you with my knife, but I will beat you with my stick; then the prisoner struck him several times, and he struck the prisoners, and tore all his shirt collar clean off.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the Turk spoke in plain English? - So plain that I could understand him; there was no money on the table at this time; he had a fine gold laced purse at his girdle, whether he had any money in it I cannot say; there was no-money seen at all while the prisoners were in the house, nor while I was there; after they had been fighting, that tall French woman came down, and said they are blackguards, they are thieves, they want to rob you, swear they have robbed you; one of the Turks jumped out of the window, and soon after the constable came, they were not searched; the Turks made no charge of their robbing them, only of the assault.</p>
               <p>If they had taken up any money at that time from the table, should you have seen it? - Oh, yes, but there was no money taken, nor any seen while I was there; the tall woman is frequently there.</p>
               <p>What is she? - A common prostitute in that part; there were six or seven of them beating me; the mistress of the house is an old woman, and a foreigner, and the landlord is a young man that the old woman keeps; he does not speak French; I have been quartered there three weeks unfortunately.</p>

               <p>I had been with a letter, and I met my fellow prisoner, and we went to this house, and these Turkish gentlemen were sitting there, and I asked them how they did, and they d - d me; I said you did not d - n me the other day when you came with a petition to Lord Spencer, and I suppose you are angry I would not take it in; they had a target apiece at their side; the Turk seized me, and struck my fellow prisoner with a dagger; there was no money nor scales, or any thing of the kind on the table; the constable searched me by my desire; I had only two farthings.</p>

(The box and things produced by Willey.) The box was broke open, and concealed under the bed, and a guinea and a half taken out, and some silver; I asked the prosecutrix if she had the key, she gave me her keys, and one of them opened the box; they have been in my possession ever since; the bundle, with a gown and coat lay by the box under the bed, which I afterwards put into the box, and locked it up.</p>

               <p>Is that man here? - No, the Justice did not think him necessary; I went over to Mr. Fletcher, at Litchfield-street-office; the duplicate being numbered, Mr. Fletcher sent me to Mr. Peake, in St. Martin's-lane, a pawn-broker; there I found a pair of my shoes, but not the shoes I missed; that strengthened my suspicions of the prisoner; I went home and called him in before my father-in-law, and said, Simpson, can you tell any thing of these shoes I have just missed? he said, no; I said, I strongly suspect you have taken them; and he said, Sir, you use me very ill; I said, I have a duplicate here of a pair of shoes that you have pawned; now tell me where you have pawned them; then he turned round, and said, Sir, I have pawned one pair of shoes; this was May the 4th.</p>
               <p>Before he made that acknowledgment, had you given him any reason to hope that you would not prosecute him? - No, for my father-in-law gave me that caution; I asked him where he had pawned them; he directed me to another pawn-broker, in St. Martin's-lane; I then concluded he had pawned more; I think he mentioned two or three other places, but not the place where I had been.</p>
               <p>Did he say he had pawned other shoes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230100"/>How many pair did he say he had pawned? - I cannot say, whether two or three pair.</p>
               <p>Did he say where those were pawned? - I believe he hardly mentioned any name; he mentioned the places; one place in particular, in Long-acre, but could not recollect the name; in St. Martin's-lane amongst the pawn-brokers, I found three or four pair of my shoes; at Peake's, I found two pair; at Mr. Hall's, one pair; that was all I believe, I found for that evening; he was sent to the watch-house, and examined before the Justice; on Saturday morning, that was the 5th of May, he had mentioned a place which I had not time to go to; I think it was in Wardour-street; I desired the Justice to defer the examination till Monday Morning; in the interim, I applied to other pawn-brokers, and found shoes at each; at Mr. Heather's, Longacre, one pair; at Mr. Fleming's, Drury-lane, one pair; at Mr. Lane's, Drury-lane, one or two pair, I will not positively say which; at Mr. Priestman's, one pair; at Mr. Purse's, near the New-church, in the Strand, two pair; I went to one of them, by the direction of the prisoner, and to the other, by my own inclination, to see if there was any more; the several pawnbrokers have the shoes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Leach, prisoner's counsel. You say the prisoner confessed having pawned one pair of shoes? - He did.</p>
               <p>Now are you quite sure that no promise was made him? - I am.</p>
               <p>Was there no conversation previous to his confession? - No, Sir; I told him that I was in possession of a duplicate of one pair of shoes pawned; I did not tell him that I knew where they were, but I said, now Simpson, tell us where they are.</p>
               <p>You had a man and a boy in the shop, besides the prisoner? - I had.</p>
               <p>They had equal access to the shoes as this man? - They had.</p>
               <p>I think you said you missed one pair of shoes that you did not find at the pawnbroker's? - I did.</p>
               <p>So that whoever took those shoes, does not appear to be this man? - It does not.</p>
               <p>He confessed to have pawned a pair of shoes, but you did not find them? - I did not find the shoes that I first missed.</p>

            , he called it a letter; he said he had found a letter, and so he gave it me.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing else? - No, he did not say much else.</p>
               <p>What did you say in consequence of receiving that letter? - I could do nothing with it, only kept it in my possession; I had more before and behind.</p>
               <p>Who were they delivered to you by? - His wife and he chiefly, both of them; and one I found on the hole of the necessary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd Prisoner's Counsel. Only tell us about that one letter.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prosecution. This letter dated the 7th of March, you are sure you received from him? - Yes, they pretended to say they found them.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find out who sent them? - No, we never found out who, nor how.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. I believe you live in the neighbourhood of Harrow school? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe you were unfortunate enough Mr. Dancer, not to be very popular among the Harrow boys? - No, but they did not owe me any ill-will after this time.</p>
               <p>Had not you got them flogged three times before these letters were sent? - They were, twice.</p>
               <p>The Harrow boys had plagued you a good deal, before you got these people in the house, they had locked you up in the stable, and things of that sort? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not the boys come and threaten to be revenged? - They did not threaten to be revenged.</p>
               <p>They did not pull part of the roof down? - They never did visit my house in that way; I do not know that they pulled the tiles off; it was not them that brought these letters.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath now, did not they plague you handsomely? - They never touched me, nor hurt me.</p>
               <p>You did not come out when the boys came I believe? - I had no occasion to come out.</p>
               <p>Did not the boys come and plague you from time to time? - Yes; school-boys will do so.</p>
               <p>Were not you the constant object of their fun? were not they always coming to teize you? - They were not always, now and then.</p>
               <p>Did not you get these people into your house for the purpose of protecting you from these boys? - No, not them boys, there were others, thieves.</p>
               <p>Was not the whole parish against you? - I do not know that the whole parish was against me.</p>
               <p>How long did these people live in your house? - Nearly half a year.</p>
               <p>How long after you received this letter? - I did not set down the day of the month when they quitted it; I believe it was in March; they set it down at Sir Sampson's, and I did not take the account any further.</p>
               <p>Tell us any where within a month, what time they quitted you? - I suppose it got towards April before they quitted me; it is entered down.</p>
               <p>These people used in fact to do business for you as servants? - They never did any thing for me, for I did not care to set people to work that I could not satisfy.</p>
               <p>Did not the man set up all night once? - He was paid for that.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230104"/>Did not this man sit up constantly to guard your house? - He did with other people a while.</p>
               <p>Did not the Harrow boys know he was your guard? - I do not know that they did.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear them when they came in a posse, swear revenge against Hammond as well as against you? - I never heard that from them.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear it from any body else, that Hammond had been threatened by the boys? - His own wife might say so.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear it from any body else? - I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Hammond himself brought you this letter? - Hammond delivered it to me.</p>
               <p>Did not Hammond tell you he found this on your premises, and therefore he gave it you? - Yes, he told me he found it.</p>
               <p>Why I see in this letter that Hammond is threatened? - That is only a sham of his wife's.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was a sham of his wife; who put you in the head of this notable prosecution? - Who put me in the head of it, all the neighbours; they said, they found them in the house of office, where I never went in half a year; she went there, and nobody else chiefly.</p>
               <p>Was not this man one of your guards? - The neighbours all told me, that the letters came from them.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, after you received this letter, did not you yourself, appoint that man to be one of the guards of your own house? - He appointed himself; he proposed to be one, and I did not refuse him; I suffered him to be one, and he was one.</p>
               <p>Was not he one for a month? - He never was paid for a month, he was paid for about a fortnight; he served me about a fortnight as a guard; I did not appoint him, he was willing, and I was glad; and I was willing to take a mad dog for my safety.</p>
               <p>Had not you two other guards as well as that man? - I had three more, I did not think them all too much; I had no right to be burnt, and set fire to, and killed.</p>
               <p>How often had your house been attacked? - Several times.</p>
               <p>How many times during the two last years; how often was you robbed within the two last years? - I was robbed about twice, and pilfered; my house has been broke open more than once, it was broke open in the night; I did not see the persons in particular.</p>
               <p>However, before this thing happened, the Harrow boys had been about your house, and you had had them flogged for it. - The Harrow boys were not concerned in this.</p>
               <p>(The Letter read.)</p>
               <p>"So, you old damned dog, you will</p>
               <p>"not let me have no money; by which I</p>
               <p>"will be damned if I do not have your</p>

               <p>Had you then seen this paper at the time you said this to her? - No, Sir, I had not; she said I know you can, Mrs. Mason, but I do not trouble my head about you, for you cannot swear to it, nor any body else, for it is wrote upon whitish-brown paper.</p>

               <p>When you told her you could clear her from it, she said no, you cannot, for nobody can swear to it; can you write yourself? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>So you mean to say that you have seen that woman write so often, you not being able to write yourself, that you can venture now upon your oath to say, you believe it is her hand-writing? - I was sent for to look at it; I was told nothing by any body that sent for me.</p>

               <p>Of course, I suppose you talked to Mrs. Newman about this afterwards? - No, Sir, I do not know that we did, I said to Mrs. Newman, how foolish she was to talk so; Mrs. Newman told me she heard the conversation.</p>
               <p>When did she tell you that? - She heard it then, as well as me.</p>
               <p>When did you talk about the conversation with Mrs. Newman? - A great many times.</p>
               <p>Then Mrs. Newman told you she heard what passed? - Yes, she did several times.</p>
               <p>It unluckily happens that Mrs. Newman has told us, that she never told any body of it till she was supoened? - Only me, she has told me.</p>

               <p>How close? - I suppose they could not go by it, unless they went over the ditch, without the next door neighbour seeing them.</p>
               <p>Do you know the hand-writing of this woman? - I have seen her write; I verily believe that to be her hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Does your Ladyship know whether this poor man can write at all? - He told me he could not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. You say, Madam, you have seen this woman write? - I have since this letter was sent.</p>
               <p>I believe your Ladyship sent for this woman to write for you? - To write for me, no, Sir; Mr. Dancer commonly used to bring letters over to my house for me to read them.</p>
               <p>I only ask you as to having seen her write herself; did you ever see her write before these letters were sent? - Never before I saw her write at my own house; I sent for her.</p>
               <p>You desired her to write? - I desired her to write for this reason, because Mr. Dancer had brought the man over to assign some reason; he declared his innocence.</p>
               <p>You saw her write at your house, you desired her to write? - I accused them all in having that writing; I meant to vindicate her.</p>
               <p>Did she not write at your house at your desire? - I did not desire her to write at my house, I said, I have judged you very hardly, and so do all the neighbours as such; Mr. Dancer has brought me a bit of paper.</p>
               <p>Did not she write at your house? - Yes, before me.</p>
               <p>Your Ladyship told your suspicions before? - I had.</p>
               <p>And yet she wrote at your house afterwards in your sight? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To furnish evidence against herself I suppose? - I hope it will be to vindicate herself.</p>
               <p>Had not you told her of your suspicions, Madam? - I had, she certainly knew it was for the purpose of comparing her writing with the letters.</p>
               <p>Then she must know if she was guilty; it was to furnish evidence against herself? - I suppose she must.</p>
               <p>Then it was from this subsequent knowledge gained by you after the matter happened, that your Ladyship can swear to her hand-writing? - I swear to the best of my belief.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Your Ladyship sent for this woman to clear herself if possible? - I did; she offered to write before me; I said to her, I have judged you very hard, I have not judged you only in my own opinion, but I have spoke publicly.</p>
               <p>Court. You say, Madam, that you did not desire her to write? - Not at my house; I told her if she would write, if she was injured, as I had seen the name of

               <p>Mr. Shephard. My Lord, in this case, though I have not much doubt on the subject, in point of fact, yet I think it my duty to take an objection, in point of law, to this evidence; your Lordship sees both the statutes, on which the indictment was framed, have constituted it a capital offence, if any person shall knowingly send a letter to any person, demanding money; or in the other case, shall knowingly send, threatening to burn his house, and such offence shall be deemed a felony; in this case, the evidence is (if it is any thing) that this man,

            , delivered this letter to Dancer; I submit that the policy of the law which made that a felony, was for the purpose of discovering people who secretly did send those sort of letters to other persons, by which means their peace of mind was hurt; and in short, they themselves were put in danger; but I submit that the act of parliament certainly did not mean to extend this offence to the hand that actually delivered it; for if you should think that delivering a letter is an offence within this statute, which it certainly is not, then you will take these words into your consideration also, namely, shall knowingly do so; now it would be too much, where the man who actually delivers the letter, and whose duty it was to do so, be it sent by whom it would, was a servant; this is not the case of a stranger coming and delivering a letter of this sort, in which the act of doing it would afford a suspicion; but this is the circumstance of the man at the bar, a servant, an inmate of the family, and whose duty it was, come from whom it might, unless he was the actual party who wrote it, and fabricated it, to deliver it to his master; therefore it requires a stronger evidence, in this case, to shew that he was the actual party; because, if the delivery should be held by your Lordship to be within the statute, still I submit it must be a delivery by a person knowing the contents of it, and not merely by a servant; my Lord, there was a case before Lord Mansfield, in the County of Kent; the name of the case I do not recollect; it was an indictment on this statute; there the man who was indicted, was the party who brought the letter to the prosecutor, and who delivered it to him himself; and I recollect taking this objection there; and I am pretty confident my Lord Mansfield said he thought the policy of the law was meant against the persons who secretly sent these sort of letters to others, and meant the man who knew the contents of such letter; my Lords, in considering a penal act, you will be strict in seeing that the offence comes precisely within the words of it; when I mention the uniform construction of your Lordships on the statutes of private stealing from the person, which is made a felony, without the benefit of clergy; so strict have all the Judges been, that the smallest knowledge of any human creature, that a man was in the act of stealing at the time, has always been held to take it out of the statute, because the strictest construction of the act must be complied with; and if your Lordships have been so strict in that case, I trust you will also in this, where it has been said, that knowing of the sending a letter to another person, shall be deemed a felony, without benefit of clergy; you will not think the delivery is within the words of that statute, and it seems to me to be scarcely within the policy of it, which is to prevent secret acts; I submit therefore, in this case, it will intitle me to an acquittal; but if your Lordship should think that any thing does lay against the man, still I think at least the woman is intitled to her acquittal, as being the wife of the man, and as to the man himself, he cannot write.</p>
               <p>Court. When I sum up to the Jury, I certainly shall tell them, that in case they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230109"/>think this was done in the presence of the husband, and by his privity, that the law will not impute it to her as a crime; on the other hand, if they should suppose that she did these things without his privity, and only made use of him as the instrument; in that case she may be guilty separately.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen spoke on the same side; Mr. Silvester, in answer; and Mr. Shephard replied.</p>
               <p>Court. In all cases where an offence is made so very penal as this is, at certainly is necessary that it should appear to be within the intention of the legislature, and likewise within the act of parliament itself; now the words of that act are, that if any person shall knowingly send, &amp;c. they shall be guilty; now I own myself, I cannot think, that under these words,</p>
               <p>"send any letter" that the carrying of a letter does come precisely within the terms of the act of parliament; if the legislature had been asked at the time when they passed this act of parliament, whether it was an offence of the same kind, I have no doubt but they would have said, Oh, yes, by all means; but we are not to say what the legislature ought to have done, but what they have done; now it seems to me at that time, when the act passed, the legislature never had it in contemplation, that any man would have been the carrier of his own letter, but that they should go either by the post, or by some conveyance which would never bring it to the knowledge of the prosecutor by whom it was sent; if they had had the case in view, they would have provided for it; therefore I own myself, it is very clear that this is a case that does not come within the words of the act of parliament; and an act so penal as this is, ought not to be extended by construction; another circumstance that makes it appear more strongly is, that in another act of parliament, which is not so penal as the present, it is said, that if any person shall send or deliver any letter, to accuse another of a crime, with a view to extort money, &amp;c. now that shews, that where the legislature had meant a particular act to have created an offence, that they knew how to make use of the words proper to do it, and that is in my mind a convincing proof that they had it not in their contemplation at the time.</p>
               <p>Mr Baron Perryn. I am of the same opinion.</p>

               <p>Where did you pick him up last Tuesday? - I was going to Epsom races, and I stopped at the Admiralty Coffee-house, Charing-cross, and I saw that gentleman there; I was talking about it to a friend that was with me, and this gentleman said he was an attorney; and I said I knew no attorney; and he said he would do my business for me.</p>
               <p>So you engaged this attorney at the Admiralty Coffee-house; now tell us his name? - He informed me his name was Ashfield; he said he lived at the Coffee-house.</p>

               <p>Do you know Townsend? - I have seen the man before.</p>
               <p>I think you have; where did you get acquainted with him? - I have seen him about Covent-garden.</p>

               <p>Do you mean me to take that as your answer? - Yes, that is the only acquaintance I have with him; no correspondence, no dealings with him.</p>
               <p>Then I dare say you will venture to swear, that you never was in his custody in your life for a foot pad robbery? - Never in my life.</p>

I said, it was very hard to swear to the handkerchief, but I believed it was the handkerchief; the prisoner said before the magistrate, he was not come there to be made a fool off, he could hang folks if he chose it; the Justice said he did not doubt it, because many of them sort of folks could hang one another if they liked it; Justice Girdler got up and asked him, he said he had an uncle at Billston, who was a man of property; he asked him after three or four different people, but he could give no account of either of them.</p>

               <p>Ever been in Staffordshire? - No, 
Sir.</p>
               <p>Nor in Worcestershire? - I served seven years in the city of Worcester.</p>
               <p>Then you was vastly glad of having an opportunity of saving a handkerchief for a countryman? - I knew nothing of him, I served my time in Worcester.</p>
               <p>I dare say you knew Mr. Freeman the attorney? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Never heard of his name? - I have heard of his name.</p>
               <p>But you never heard of Ashfield? - The first time I saw him, was when we went to find the bill on this business.</p>
               <p>You said just now, that you was a distressed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230116"/>man? - Yes, I have been a man that have been possessed of a deal of property, I have run through it, and I have had an accident to put my arm out.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In Mutton-lane.</p>
               <p>You have lived there some time probably? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far is that from Field lane? - Why it is only the length of Saffron-hill?</p>
               <p>Now do you know that handkerchief? - Why I would not swear positively to it.</p>
               <p>You never saw it till you saw it hang out of the gentleman's pocket for fashion sake? - No; what profit or pleasure can I have to say that this man took the handkerchief out of this man's pocket?</p>
               <p>I will tell you, it is to prevent his giving evidence against your friend Mr. Jordan in Staffordshire.</p>
               <p>Do you know Billstone? - I never was there in my life.</p>
               <p>You never heard of such a place? - Yes, I have heard of such a place.</p>
               <p>May be you may have heard of Mr. Jordan who lives there? - I never did indeed.</p>
               <p>Do you know a man of the name of Pearson? - No.</p>
               <p>Has it never happened to you to have heard in conversation that it was a lucky thing that this sad dog was taken, because he was going to swear away the liberty of this Mr. Jordan of Billstone? - I do not, so help me God, nor against any other persons, nor never heard such a thing.</p>
               <p>Have not you been acquainted with Mr. James for three or four months? - I never was acquainted with him before; I have seen him by coming to the Coach and Horses, in Mutton-lane, that I used.</p>
               <p>You have been in the army I take it? - I have.</p>
               <p>Mr. Egerton is what they call a crimp in the East India Company? - You may as well say a kidnapper.</p>
               <p>That was the first time you saw Mr. James? - I never saw him above three times there in my life.</p>
               <p>Was the last time you saw him a week, or three weeks before the time he had his pocket picked? - I think I saw him about a week before.</p>
               <p>Who were the people that he supped with that evening? - I do not know that he ever supped in the house in his life.</p>
               <p>Who did he drink with? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Had not you a drop with him? - I never drank with him till after this affair happened.</p>
               <p>Who was his company at the kidnapper the last time he was there before he had his pocket pricked? - He had no company, he was there alone.</p>
               <p>What country man is your landlord? - I do not know, I believe he is Worcester.</p>
               <p>What way of life did you understand this Mr. James was in? - I did not ask him, I understood his name was James.</p>
               <p>That was all you knew about him? - Yes; I said, Sir, Sir, have you lost any thing?</p>
               <p>When he said he had not, you said yes, you have Mr. James, you have lost your handkerchief? - I did not say Mr. James, I did not know his name was James, I told you that I had seen him two or three times.</p>
               <p>Then you have forgot what you said a minute ago, that you saw him take the handkerchief from Mr. James? - I did.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that that puts an end to the capital part of this charge; why he will not be hanged; are you sure you saw him take it, or did you see it in his hand after he did take it? - I saw him as I told you before, snap it out.</p>
               <p>Have you never been in Ashurst's company before? - Upon my oath, I have never been in his company before, I swear it positively.</p>
               <p>You never drank with him of course? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>You do not know Mr. Jordan of Bilstone? - I do not indeed.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Perhaps you may know Mr. Pearson? - I do not</p>
               <p>You told us of being in the army? - I have.</p>
               <p>That is probably not the only profession you have been in, in your life, since you was a distressed man? - I have been a glover, and worked at my trade; I get my bread now by writing; I can write as well as any gentleman in the Court.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you may have written the brief upon this occasion? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Who was you clerk to as an attorney? - I do not tell you I was clerk to any attorney, I never wrote for any attorney.</p>
               <p>Did you ever write for Mr. Waling, he is dead? - Yes, and what I wrote for him I was paid for.</p>
               <p>How many years did you write for him? - I do not know, I have wrote for different people.</p>
               <p>Name a few of them? - I have wrote for that gentleman that put up for coroner of this hall, I forget his name, he is an attorney in the Court of Exchequer.</p>
               <p>Oh, Mr. Gosnell, that was clerk to Mr. Priddle! Did you write for him before or after he left Mr. Priddle? - I know nothing of Priddle, I only did three or four bills.</p>
               <p>Do not you know Freeman? - I do not know him if I see him.</p>
               <p>Have you never made any affidavit in the Court of King's Bench for Priddle, or Freeman or Ashfield? - Never in my life; I never saw him at the Admiralty coffee house.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear positively that to this hour you never learned that this man had been at Staffordshire, or Worcestershire, and that he was to be a witness at the next assizes? - Upon my oath I never did hear it.</p>
               <p>Neither from James, nor Ashurst, nor Pearson, nor Jordan, nor any other whatever? did you ever hear this prisoner was to be an evidence against Jordan, in Staffordshire? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Have you never been in custody in your life? - Never indeed.</p>
               <p>Did you go to Egerton's house after this thing happened? - No, Sir, never;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230119"/>Yes, I have drank with James since this affair happened.</p>
               <p>Very often? - No, he came when he was going from the Bell, and I believe we drank together than.</p>
               <p>Was Ashurst with you then? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you express yourself in some such way as this: well, we have done Jones at last? - No, Sir, I should be very sorry to say so.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, have you never said in conversation in Egerton's house, we have done Jones? - No, never, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you never say we shall now be rid of him? - No, Sir, never.</p>
               <p>You have never said either we shall do Jones, we shall get rid of him, he will be hanged, or any thing of that sort? - No, I never did.</p>
               <p>What militia was you in? - I was serjeant and clerk in the eighty-eighth regiment of foot.</p>
               <p>Did you know James when you was in the army? - I did not indeed.</p>
               <p>- ASHURST sworn.</p>
               <p>I was going about my master's business about three weeks ago, I did not take notice of the day of the month, and I heard the last witness call out Sir, Sir, have you lost any thing? Mr. James looked round, and said, no, but putting his hand in his pocket, he said he had lost his handkerchief; the last witness said, this man has your handkerchief; Mr. James said, have you my handkerchief? and he denied it, and he felt in his pocket once or twice, and he did not find it, however, he put his hand into a side pocket, and pulled out a silk handkerchief; Mr. James took him to the Justice's, and I was there; upon his positive denial of the fact, the question was put to me, whether I did see Mr. James take the handkerchief out or not, I said I did; there was another gentleman offered to give his evidence on the same thing; the Justice said he was very well satisfied, and that my evidence would not have been required if he had not denied it; Mr. James was a perfect stranger to me before this, and his character was very much spoken against; I have enquired into it, and all that I hear is, that he is a very honest gentleman, and there is one man that takes on himself to swear that he was at the place at the time, and saw Mr. James put the handkerchief in the man's pocket; I am sure there never was so great a falsity; he said he thought it was a joke; after a few more words, he said he heard they were gone to the Justice's, and he was so struck that he could not go down, and that is the sum of what I have to say of the matter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. James was an entire stranger to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But you have enquired into his character, and you found he was a very honest character? - I never enquired into his character till I heard he was a great rogue; I found it a very good one as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Did any of the people you enquired of tell you that he had been in the strong place, Newgate? - I have heard it intimated that he had been concerned with persons that have been hanged, since I have been at the door.</p>
               <p>So you have heard this lately? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did any of these people tell you that he has been in custody for a robbery on Mr. Ogden? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you know the Fooman in waiting, in Gray's-inn-lane? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You do not know such a house, upon your oath? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>In Bell-court, or in Fox court? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Do you know such a house in Feather's-court? - I came from the city of York; I am not ashamed of my country.</p>
               <p>Was you acquainted with Caldwell at the time the robbery was committed; have you no connections with Worcestershire, or Staffordshire? - I have heard tell of these places, I have not heard of Freeman; James is a stranger to me, and I to him, before this happened.</p>
               <p>What way of life may you be in? - I am a linen varnisher, such as they cover umbrella's with.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230120"/>Perhaps you know Mr. Kegan? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you never work for him in the preparing a balloon? - Upon my oath I never worked for any one in that branch, but Mr.

               <p>Do you know Mr. Jordan, of Billstone, in Staffordshire? - No, Sir, I do not know Staffordshire, nor Billstone, nor Worcestershire.</p>
               <p>Have you had any friends in Newgate lately? - I never was in any part of Newgate, unless this is called Newgate.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Jordan of Billstone, or a Mr. Pearson, or any body connected with him? - No, Sir, I think he said he came the day before from Birmingham.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you that Mr. Jordan, of Billstone, took him home, and made him drunk, put him to bed, gave him a new suit of clothes, and sent him to London? - I did not hear him say so.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath you did not? - Upon my oath I did not.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do not you know the fact to be so, that Mrs. Jordan sent this man to London, that he might not be a witness against her husband? - I know nothing about it, I never in my life heard so.</p>
               <p>If I understand you right, this man said, Mr. James, I have not got your handkerchief? - He did.</p>
               <p>James insisted upon it, then he said Mr. James again, I have not got it? - He did not call him by his name that I know of, if I said so, I was mistaken; I asked about his character of the gentleman where he was employed: I said that hearing a very bad character of Mr. James, I had enquired into it, and found he bore a very good character as a very honest man.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Ashfield ordered out of Court.)</p>
               <p>Court. Now remember you are upon oath, and do not get yourself into a scrape for any body, speak out the whole truth.</p>
               <p>(James sent out of Court at another door.)</p>
               <p>I will speak the truth as far as I can recollect, a gentleman came to me on either Wednesday or Thursday where I work, he was a stranger, that is the gentleman that stands up, the minister of Billstone, and a conversation took place between him and me; he said it was a piece of iniquitous business, and he said he thought Mr. James would be afraid to appear in Court; and upon that supposition I enquired of Ashfield with respect to James, and he said that James was a gentleman; and further than that, I heard the woman at the public house opposite to Hicks's Hall say she had known him for fourteen years; and as far as I understood he was what we call a gentleman.</p>
               <p>What did Ashfield teld you respecting the prisoner? - I cannot positively swear, I wish to be cautious, but I think Mr. Ashfield said (on account of the gentleman's asking) that the prisoner was concerned in a trial in the country, and I spoke to Mr. Ashfield about it, and I think he told me he had been concerned in a robbery with people there, stealing lead off a house, and he turned informer, and so he supposed they wished to have him back to give his evidence; that is nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did Mr. Ashfield tell you who it was that was charged as a receiver of that stolen lead? - No; that was all the conversation I recollect we had about it.</p>
               <p>Who did he tell you he supposed wished to have him back to give his evidence? - He did not say who.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you that there was a person charged as a receiver in that business too? No.</p>
               <p>Now what did he say more, that if he gets back again, he will hang some, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230121"/>transport the others? - He did not say that.</p>
               <p>What did he say would be the consequence of his going back? - He told me no further than what I have related that I recollect.</p>
               <p>What did he tell you would be the consequence if this man escaped? - He never told me any thing that would be of consequence.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you that he wished to convict him of felony, did not he say it would be a sad thing if he should get back again to give his evidence? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Or that he hoped he would not? - No, he never said any thing about it positively, he never related any thing to me about the matter.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you what would happen? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not he name to you a man of the name of Jordan? - Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear that he did not mention the name of Jordan? - I do not remember it.</p>
               <p>Do you swear that positively? - I wish to be cautious.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not he last Friday name the name of Jordan to you? - Then I give my oath that he did not, for I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you that this man would go back and convict Jordan for receiving stolen goods? - No he did not, nor any thing like it, he said this man had turned an evidence.</p>
               <p>Against somebody for receiving stolen goods? - No, I swear that positively.</p>
               <p>Nor that any body would be convicted if this man got back again? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Now upon your oath, did not he tell you that the whole from the beginning to the end, was a scheme laid to cut off this man, to prevent his being a witness? - No he did not.</p>
               <p>Nor any thing like it? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you swear positively, that you did not collect from their conversation, that it was their wish to have cut off this man? - No I did not particularly.</p>
               <p>Did not you understand it so? - I did not, I understood so far as this, that if the man was tried and convicted, it might prevent him going back into Staffordshire to give evidence, but I did not suppose it was done entirely for that.</p>
               <p>Then did not you understand as one good effect of it, it would prevent him from going back to give evidence? - I understood their view in prosecuting the prisoner was for stealing a handkerchief, and that it certainly would tend for the good of society.</p>
               <p>Both by convicting him, and by hindering him from going into Staffordshire? - I never recollect that.</p>
               <p>Court. I shall begin to change the opinion I entertained of you, I will read you what you have sworn this very minute,</p>
               <p>"I did understand that if this man was convicted it might answer the purpose of preventing him from going down into Staffordshire to give evidence? - That is as I understood it.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not Ashfield expressly tell you, that if they were not able to convict this man, that Jordan would be obliged to leave the country? - No nothing like it.</p>
               <p>And if he was not convicted he would go back and be a witness? - No, I collect that from the circumstances of the case, not from what they said; I do not know that he was a witness in the country but from them, he never said he was a witness against any body.</p>
               <p>Court. I will read you what you have said, Mr. Ashfield said he heard this young man had been concerned in an affair in the country, and had turned evidence, and that Ashfield told you the prisoner had been concerned with some people that had been stealing lead, and had turned informer, and he supposed they wished to have him back to give his evidence? - Yes Sir.</p>
               <p>Do you know, except from James or Caldwell, or Ashfield, that this man was to go back to be an evidence against Jordan? I understood from them, as they related the affair to me, that if this man was set at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230122"/>liberty, he would certainly go into the country and give evidence against them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Manley. Have you seen any other person upon this business before you saw Ashley, have not you seen this gentleman? - That is the gentleman.</p>
               <p>When did he call upon you? - I believe it was Wednesday or Thursday, he asked me if I knew one Jones and James, and I said yes, I told him where they worked, but I found I had mistaken the people, I told him what I knew, and he said they had an affair, or a cause, or a trial in the country, and that the man was a witness, and that made him enquire.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to this Ashfield about this mans' being a witness before he said any thing to you? - I did, and he told me that the prisoner was concerned in an affair in the country for stealing lead.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. James. Upon your oath, was not you taken up upon suspicion of being concerned with

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was robbed in a two pair of stairs room last Monday was a fortnight, about ten or eleven in the morning.</p>
               <p>What house was it in? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Where was it? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What part of the town? - Not far from Chick-lane, but I cannot name the place.</p>
               <p>How came you into that house? - I call clothes, and a girl stood at the window and called me up; I did not willingly go the first time, because I was afraid; I saw it was a very indifferent house.</p>
               <p>Did you go up stairs? - Yes, she said do not be affraid, I have a gown and petticoat and some more things; I asked how many pair of stairs, she said two; when I went up three men rushed upon me, and one man stood directly before the door, they said, have you got any money? I answered if you have got clothes I have got money; one directly took a knife and says d - n your eyes, give your money, and he came to me directly with his knife to my throat, so I took my bag and held it up to my throat.</p>
               <p>What did you say to them when they said they would have your money? - I would not willingly part with my money, I said I had none, I wanted to call murder, and the third man held my mouth shut, one cut my finger, and one that stood at my left hand hit me on the arm with his hand, and my hand began to pain me, and I let my bag fall; I says stop, I have got five shillings in my pocket, I will give it you; I had five shillings in one pocket, and four or five pennyworth of half-pence in the other, he said you must give us more money, and he cut me over the head, I suppose he meant to aim at my neck, but he cut me over the head, through and through my cap, after that he said give more money, I said I have no more, the girl said your people commonly have plenty of money; I said by God I have got no more. I saw they took the knife again to aim at me, and I found I was in danger of my life, then I gave one of them a throw away from me, and I wanted to run to the window and call murder, after that, they took and threw me all down the stairs, and had like to have broke all my limbs, I gave the five shillings to one of them, but I do not know which; I found myself very ill used.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you gave it to any of them? - Yes, but I do not know which.</p>
               <p>How much money had you in your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230124"/>pocket? - Five shillings in one pocket, and five pennyworth of halfpence in the other, I had no more, I said you may search me; if I had had 20 l. I should have given it to them, because I was in danger; after they threw me down stairs, I made the best of my way for fear I should be murdered in the dark; they threw me down part of the stairs, and the rest I went down myself; I do not know whether I flew in the fright I was in, there was a great mob of people before the door, they asked me what was the matter, I made as many motions as I could, and shewed I was robbed, and said I would give any body six pence to fetch a constable, a girl said she would go; when I was up stairs they were two of them without coat or waistcoats, but afterwards they came down in their clothes; I laid hold of one, and said master, stop give me my money, all the people round saw that, then he laid hold of a stick and beat me over my head, and made another hole in my head, then the blood began to pour from me, for all that I kept him fast, then he hit me over the head again, and I was forced to let him go; I fell, my hat, cap and bag and all fell, then the people brought me my things, and wanted to take me to the doctors, I had no strength to give them an answer; I staid there a few minutes, I did not know how to help myself till a Jew came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Court. Why would not you give your evidence in English? - I cannot hold a discourse but I can speak a few words.</p>
               <p>What language did you speak to these people in the room? - The few words I did speak were in English, they would not let me speak, some few words I know but I cannot speak them plain, they spoke English to me, I understood them, they said give me money directly, how much money, have you any more, and I understood all that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheridan, Prisoner's Counsel. How long is it since you forgot to speak English? - I have been only a year and a half here, I am an old man, I cannot take the language quick.</p>
               <p>Did the woman or man speak very good Hebrew? - She said no more than clothes, come up.</p>
               <p>In what language did she speak to you, that she had a petticoat and gown to sell? - In English.</p>
               <p>In what language did she say, that in general, your people has plenty of money? - In English.</p>
               <p>In what language did you reply that you had no more than five shillings in silver, and five pennyworth of halfpence? - In English.</p>
               <p>Why will not you hold a conversation with me now in English, as well as you did with the prisoners? - In the bargaining for clothes, some words I knows.</p>
               <p>Where would you have got the sixpence to send for the constable? - I told the girl I would give it her afterwards, because I knew I had not so much; I said the same before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Did you never say you had lost five guineas, and you had forty more about you? - I did not say a halfpenny more.</p>
               <p>Did not you at another time swear, since this affair happened, that you had lost no money at all on any occasion? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you seize on one of them when you saw them dressed, and say he was one of the persons? - He was the first that came down stairs.</p>
               <p>Would you have laid hold of any man that came down stairs? - I would have laid hold of any of the three.</p>
               <p>Did you know that man to be one of the three? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear that there was a reward for apprehending highway robbers? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you a German? - A Polander.</p>
               <p>Have you not a view in this prosecution to share this reward? - I know nothing about that, and nobody at the Justice's office told me that.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear of it? - I did not hear any thing of it; all that I heard was,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230125"/>they told me, something about forty pounds, and I was to go against the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Would not you be very glad to get forty pounds a piece for each of these prisoners; would not you take it now? - If it was to come to my share I would take it, I would not throw it away.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was it told you you would get forty pounds, if you would go against the prisoners? - Upon my oath I have not heard any thing of the kind from any body.</p>
               <p>Why you have this moment said so? - According as my law is, if forty pounds comes to my share, I would take it.</p>
               <p>But you said just now that they did tell you something about forty pounds, if you would go against the prisoners? - No, my Lord, I was bound in forty pounds that I should go against the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear there was a reward of forty pounds? - From whom should I hear it.</p>
               <p>Do not you know it now? - I know know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>When were these men taken up? - One was taken up the Tuesday following, I did not rightly know him, so I could not swear to him.</p>
               <p>What was done with that man you would not swear to? - I told them to clear him.</p>
               <p>What was done with him? - Afterwards there came a witness against him, then they took him at twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>When were the other men taken? - One was on the Friday.</p>
               <p>When did you first see him? - One of the thief takers came to me and said, we have taken one of the men; I said I could not go, so they took me in a coach, and paid eighteen-pence for it, for I had not eighteen-pence of my own to pay for it; I knew the man directly.</p>

               <p>What did the Jew complain of at that time? - I could not understand any thing he said; I could not make him understand any thing about going to the doctor; he put his hand to his head when I was begging somebody to take him to the doctor.</p>

               NOT GUILTY
            </rs>.</p>
               <p>Court. Prisoners, you have been extremely fortunate in the caution that has been used by the Jury in this case, which I am far from blaming: for in a case where any degree of doubt occurs, whatever reason there may be to suspect the guilt of parties, it is always safest to lean on the side of mercy; where any real and substantial doubt occurs: but there are such circumstances proved, that whether you are or are not guilty of the robbery, it is perfectly clear, that you and your associate, that worthless woman there, decoyed this poor man, if not for the purpose of robbing, clearly for that of grossly and cruetly ill-treating him; that is an offence punishable by law, though in a different way; therefore I shall think it my duty, that you should be brought to punishment for that offence; and I shall therefore commit you to Newgate, till you can find bail for assaulting and ill-treating this man; in this case, for the encouragement of those who may have been guilty with their associates, but have shewn some compassion on the person whom they have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230128"/>robbed, I shall except Ward from that order; and as there is not so much evidence of activity against Porter, I shall confine the activity against Bell, who is clearly guilty of a violent and cruel assault. Let Porter and Ward be discharged; and let Bell be detained, in order to take his trial for a misdemeanor.</p>
               <p>Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. RECORDER.</p>

               stealing a silver watch
            </rs>; but she appearing to be deaf, the Jury were sworn to enquire whether she stood mute wilfully and of malice, or by the visitation of God.</p>
               <p>- ONLY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon; the session before last, when she was brought here, I understood she was deaf; I was informed by herself that she had a fever in Clerkenwell Bridewell, in consequence of that this deafness ensued; I have since seen her at different times; and sometimes she would not hear, or could not hear; she was in the middle ward; I suspected the persons instigated her to continue in the deafness, by saying, she would be starved up stairs; and one of the questions I put to her was, how she came to be there; she said, she was only just come down and would return immediately.</p>
               <p>Court. She knew she was ordered to remain above? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Then do not you conceive that as soon as you come in, she might without hearing any question you asked her, justify herself for being there? - She certainly might; there was a conversation passed when I examined her upon her deafness how it originated; she seemed to understand my question then.</p>
               <p>Have you examined her ears at all? - Yes, and given her something to drop in; and she had something in her ears; there is no particular appearance; I have been told by the people that there is sometimes a hemorrhage at the ears, as well as at the nose; the prisoner said it was owing to what somebody gave her; the ear is intricate, but as far as the eye will reach, there is no appearance to account for the disease, and sometimes she appeared to understand my questions.</p>

               <p>Who supplies this woman with her victuals? - When the bread is delivered out, the wardswoman delivers it to every prisoner; when there is any meat and bread given, she gives it them; that woman is a convict.</p>
