I really think a sovereign ought to do, this reward that I have offered, and which I am quite willing to give;" in fact, I authorised the housekeeper to give 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if the dog was brought back—he said he could not get the dog for less than 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then asked him to go down with me to Shoreditch where the dog was, as I wanted to find out about him myself; I would give him something for his trouble, and prosecute the man who had it—he said he could not go down with me to the place; he had no objection to go with the little page, a boy about fourteen or fifteen—if I would give him the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he would bring me the dog back afterwards—I did not do anything more then—I told him I must consider this first; I did not know whether I could trust him with the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if he called at my office at 1 o'clock I should then decide—he came to my office at 1 o'clock—I then repeated to him that a sovereign, or two, ought to have been the sum which he should have taken and no more, and he again said he could not take less than 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then gave him the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and asked him when he would bring back my dog—he said, "In an hour and a half, at half-past 2 I shall be here with the dog"—I would not have given him more than 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I could have helped it—I saw the prisoner next within two minutes of half-past 2 at my office with the dog, which was tied to one of the desks—one of my clerks had received it—I then said to the prisoner he was either the thief himself or an accomplice; that he had had six months before, and he would not get rid of me so soon as that, and the quicker he walked out of my office the better—he was rather confused, and said, "I am not the party who stole the dog or an accomplice," and he gave me a paper with the name of the man who stole the dog, as he said, but I did not take any notice of it—he went out of my office and the next morning I went before the Magistrate, a warrant was granted, and the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I have known the prisoner since June or July, 1858—he was introduced to me by two of my cousins, who told me that he was following the profession of an artist—during the whole time I have known him he has been following that profession—in consequence of that introduction my sisters and myself invited him to our house—we were not residing at Twickenham, then but in London—he did not ask me for any money shortly after I became acquainted with him; I may strictly say it was alter his return from Italy; but previous to that, I think in the very commencement of February, 1859, I found him melancholy one day and asked the cause of it—he said that he had heard very bad accounts of his mother, to whom he was devotedly attached; that she was very aged and that he longed to see her, but was not able to do so—I asked him why he did not go immediately?—he did not answer at first, but afterwards said he could not afford it—I said could I be of any use to him; and he said it would be a great blessing to him if I could—I then asked him what would be required—I said that I had 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by me, but ho did not seem to think that would be sufficient and he then showed me some bill of Nosotti's, which I did not look at particularly, and he read at the bottom some threat, that if it was not paid immediately they would proceed against him, and he said, "This is the shameful way that a man treats me, of whom I have had everything since I have been in England, and he is a countryman of mine"—and I then said, "If you like to have that, you can do so;" or something of that kind—I believe he told me the amount, but I cannot positively remember it; it was something like 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and then as regards the sum total he wanted, I think it was either 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but certainly not more than 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in consequence of what he stated about his mother and Nosotti, I advanced him somewhere about that sum—I said at first, "I will give you a cheque"—he seemed not to know what a cheque was—I described to him what it was, and he seemed as if he would rather have the money, and I gave him the money—I believe I had given him the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. first, and then I added the other—he had before that offered to paint my picture—he commenced a sort of sketch of it in 1859; that was after his return from Italy, but it had been all planned to a certain extent in 1858—I think it was about the middle of 1859 that he com<lb/>menced the sketch—I became intimate with him, and there was at one time a contemplation of marriage between us—we from time to time wrote letters to each other—as regards his letters I have destroyed them—I destroyed</p>

               <p>them at various times; the last that I destroyed were on the 2d of August this year—that was a certain number that I had by me from the time we came to town—in the spring of 1859, I was seized with illness; that was while I supposed him to be in Italy—I did not see him for a long time after that; I was too ill—I next saw him when he announced his return from Italy—that was about the 10th or 12th of May, 1859, and I think it was in the month of June that I communicated to him as to our marriage being broken off—he said he never thought it would have come to pass; but he expressed very great sorrow, and said that he was so ill that he had not the courage to tell me what he was contemplating, but he thought he was in consumption, and he thought he should end his days in a little village perhaps, in his own country.</p>

I understand the Italian language—I have trans<lb/>lated this letter before (<hi rend="italic">Reads.</hi> "Monday, 3d June, 1861.—Frederica, my life has become infernal, a moral martyrdom, a vengeance of God, it was so before, but now it has become more than ever insupportable. Alas! how tired I am of it. Yes; I am tired of it beyond measure; every day as it passes I feel more and more the weight of this existence, of my unhappy position, from the enormous accumulation of difficulties which surround me. I am by G—the most unhappy man on earth, and so much the more so am I, because by others I am supposed to be happy, envied—envied, wherefore, wherefore? for being on the brink of a precipice; being to-morrow, to-morrow, the laughing stock of society; with my pride, with my hanghti<lb/>ness. I am in a chaos, my mind is in a deplorable state. I can work no more, nor act, nor think, nor do anything; in short, in this state I must be ruined; yes, ruined, and for ever. However, the one who is the cause of my sorrow, that one who despises my heart, shall not trample under foot my self esteem. I swear this before God, for the love of my mother Came and see me Frederica, if you can, on Wednesday next."</p>

(<hi rend="italic">continued.</hi>) I do not distinctly remember whether I called upon him or not, after receiving that letter, or whether I received another letter before I called on him—I certainly did call after this—I think it is very possible that I went upon the Wednesday mentioned in the letter—when I saw him after that letter, he was most violent in conversation</p>

               <p>—I received this letter from him also (<hi rend="italic">read.</hi>—"10th June. No, no, no; not a moment more of such a life, not a week; it is a hell to me; A vengeance of God; yes, you have ruined me physically and morally, Miss; you have destroyed everything in me, industry, peace, the heart; come, Miss Frederica, there are but three resolutions to take; choose—you will either marry me, or ensure me enough to live upon, or I shall leave England—you have three days for reflection")—I think I may put the two interviews I had with him into one—I think I had two, hut the subjects were almost identical—I have some difficulty in describing the conversation—I told him as regards the first proposition, it remained the same as it had done, and that as regarded the other two, I could not take upon myself the respon<lb/>sibility of advising—I am not giving the language I used—we spoke in French, therefore the words are not the same; what I said was that I could not take upon myself the responsibility of advising; upon which he imme<lb/>diately burst out, "Responsibility! responsibility!" and dared me to use such a word—I said, "I can say nothing more"—he proceeded with a great deal more, which made me give an answer something to this effect—"What do you mean by my having injured you?" what he did say was so detached, and so furious, and so broken, I really cannot state it—he was very violent—he said I had injured him, and that he would fight any one to the last who dared attack his honour—he pointed to some foils which were fastened against the wall, and said he would not be conquered, he would fight any one who dared attack his honour, and subjects of that kind; in short, the end of it was that he frightened me dreadfully, and I said to him, "If there is anything in which I have injured you, tell me what it is?" but he never came to the point of telling me, but kept on saying, "Very well, very well"—I said, "Is there anything I can do for you?" and he said something about money, but the subjects were all so broken up that it was really not like a regular conversation; I forget how it came to pass, but I said, "If there is anything I can do I will endeavour to do it, but I can decide upon nothing without thinking it over"—I also said that as regarded leaving England, it would be a pity; what should he leave England for?—he said it would be better, because there would be so much scandal, talking; and then he said if I could give him money, and would keep it secret, (for if once it transpired to a third person it would remain no longer a secret,) then he might perhaps be able to work, or something of that kind—that was the substance of what passed at the two interviews—after that I again saw him, and I then alluded to the letters—I said, "I must have my letters"—I said that to him more than once—I repeated it every time I saw him—he said, "You shall have your letters"—I afterwards had an interview with him at the Baker-street Bazaar—I appointed it—I said that I would see him in Pellatt's depart<lb/>ment, where we were in the habit of buying our china—we were beginning the conversation there, and he said that there were so many persons about it would be better to go to the carriage department, which we did—almost the first thing he said to me, when be saw me, was, "Don't be afraid," when we went to the carriage department, for he had seen fear on my countenance; I was very much agitated; I had a horror of seeing him, because I knew he was then beut upon something—he asked what I had decided, what I could give him—I said, "I hare decided nothing in one sense; but if after all my kindness to you, and all that I have done for you, after the kind interest I have shown in you, you still say I have injured you, though I cannot see it myself, and though I never meant it, and though I do not think anybody would admit it, still, if you promise me my letters</p>

               <p>faithfully, I will endeavour, if I can, to let you have 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." but this was all under the greatest agitation, whether I said 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or what I cannot say, it might have been anything—I was barely aware, but my bent was to have my letters, whatever I gave him—he said, "You shall have your letters"—I told him that I did not know that I could accomplish it but that I could not do anything till after the 11th or 12th of July—he said, "That will do for the moment;" but I said, "No; do not say tint do not deceive yourself; do not flatter yourself; I can do no more and I will do no more, if I can even do that, it will be as much as I can afford," and he admitted that he quite understood me—on leaving the Baker-street Bazaar just near the portico, he turned suddenly round, as if nothing had occurred at all between us, and said, "What day shall we go to Marochtti's studio and Phillip's?"—I was so astounded at such a question that I did not know what to do, but still under the same impression of fear, I said, "I will let you know what day"—I scarcely know what I said—I did call on him after that, I think about 27th or 28th of July, at his house in Ovingonsquare—when I went in he said, "Well, what have you decided?—he said "I thought you would have had it in your hand"—I said, "No"—he said, speaking in French all the time, "Why this is a moment when a lady, I should rather say a woman, ought to sell to the very last of anything that she possesses"—I said, "I do not understand you"—I was quite petrified, for I bad not the slightest notion that any one could have spoken to me in such a way—he was very violent during this interview, in words, gestures, and everything—he said, "It is money, money, money, that I must have;" and he took hold of his coat and dragged it in this way, and said, "It is in that way that you shall be drawn along by me"—I was perfectly petrified, and said, "I do not understand what you mean"—he said, "Oh! it is rather figurative, but that is the way you shall be drawn along by me"—and he spoke about a spy, and a society of Italians of 1,000 or 2,000, and how easily they could bear from Naples in a few days, and so on—it was in detached, violent, and incoherent sentences—he said he must have a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a day or two of the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "Well, I will see what day I. can do that"—and the termination of that interview was, that I was to have my letters when I gave him the remainder—I afterwards met him at the Baker-street bazaar, and gave him the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; nothing particular passed between us then; I was very much disgusted, and frightened, and flurried, and glad to get away, and to say little or nothing—I did not make any arrangement then about the remaining portion of the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I wrote to him after that, I cannot call it a letter, I wrote on a small sheet of note paper on Friday, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. August (<hi rend="italic">Notice to produce this letter having been proved it was not produced.</hi>—I remember the terms of the letter, it commenced "Friday," and the words were these, "To-morrow, at half-past 10, or towards 11, at the Pantheon Bazaar, in Oxford-street, where the paintings are Bold, and bring with you my letters," with a hue under the words. On the following morning towards 11 o'clock, I went lo the Pantheon—I had previously obtained nineteen 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes at the bankers on the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of August, and put them up in a parcel of writing paper—I found the prisoner at the Pantheon when I went in, in the large room upstairs, where the paintings are—he addressed me first—he said, "How do you do?"—I did not give any answer, but I said we were immediately leaving town, and then he said, "Give it to me give it to me "—I said, "Where are my letters?"—he said, "I have them"—I said, "Where are they?"—his hands were down, he was looking at a</p>

               <p>painting; he had his overcoat on, and he had his two hands down in this way, and said, "Here"—I did not see anything, but as a pocket looks when it has a large thing in it—I saw his pocket as though it had a parcel in it—I said to him, "Remember in what way you obtain this money, it is a very large sum, and all the notes are numbered, they are very easily traced—and there were a few other remarks of his and mine—two, three, or four persons came into that room, and we then passed round and went into a little narrow sort of room leading to the gallery of the Bazaar, a sort of passage room—he commenced looking at a small painting again there—during the time I was in the other room, I think he must have said the words "Give it to me," eight or ten times at intervals—he looked very pallid, and his eyes were fixed as upon some one object which he had in view, and nothing more—he still did not make the slightest allusion to my even baring them—when we got into the narrow room, I told him I had had great difficulty in getting the money, there had been so many formalities to go through, which to me was all new; I had never done such a thing before—he then said, "Give it me"—I said, "Give me my letters," with great emphasis, on which he gave me a brown paper parcel, saying, "Here they are"—I did not ask him as to whether they were all there—I had previously said to him, "All my letters," I always asked him for all my letters—when he had given me the parcel, I took out of my pocket the panel in the writing paper; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,—it looks exactly like it—I handed it to him, and he took hold of it with his left hand, and with his right forefinger he opened the seals, and turned it round in that way—I said, "Yes; there are nineteen 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes there, they are all numbered and can easily be traced—it is a very large sum, and you should be very careful of what you do with it"—he had said to me in the other room, "Oh, yes; I shall have some money, and if I do not succeed in the coming season, I shall have money in my pocket to go away with; he had spoken about America and other things—we then went, downstairs—I retained the parcel, fully believing, at that time, that my letters were in it—at the entrance or vestibule of the hall, I said to him, "Now we will go to a booksellers or stationers in Oxford-street, and I wish you, to give me a stamped receipt"—there was a little sort of hesitation on his part, and I said, "It is very easy"—he said, "Oh, there will be too many witnesses"—I said, "Oh, dear, no, it is a common thing that any one will do; the shop-keeper is always civil; he will allow you to write any little memorandum you please, we will go into my booksellers or stationers, there is never any objection to it"—upon which he said, pulling out his watch, that he had do idea it was so late, drawing his breath at the same time, that he had an appointment, and I said, "Very well, then you will send it me by post"—he said, "Yes; I shall send it you by post"—and then he went away—that was the last I saw of him.</p>

               <p>did not do so—there is a hole in the parcel, and on looking through that hole, if I had done so, I should have seen my own handwriting on this letter—when I got home I communicated with my brother, Mr. Campbell John-stone, when he came home; he was not at home on my arrival—I com<lb/>municated the circumstances to him, and placed the whole matter in his hands—he is my guardian and trustee—these two letters, dated 16th and 17th August, are the prisoner's writing—I have seen and read them—my brother opened them in the first instance—(<hi rend="italic">Translations of that letters was here read at follows.</hi> "16th August My dearest,—I receive this very moment a letter which makes me laugh, and I believe you will laugh, also when you read it. By G—, I think you have chosen the worst path, and I warn you, that if you take another step not friendly, I shall give your letters into the hands of a Magistrate in order to claim my rights. Miss Frederica, with your hands you have ruined me, and with your hands you shall save me from the precipice into which you have thrown me. Yes have destroyed my future, and shall restore it to me, I swear it by my mother. The idea of taking steps against me makes me laugh very much Against me? Do you mean to say that you intend to make my conduct public? But that is what I want, in order to justify myself in the society which I live. Remember, however, that you have not a single reason in your favour. The star in the ceiling of my studio; the star you have reproduced in the picture; the star on the small bottle received from you as tokens of love, and the star in your hair, would be sufficient proof, without the letters, to condemn you. And what of the letters? Think that if any one dares to use violence with me, it will cost him his life. The letters are mine, and no one has a right to claim them, and I will not give them up except when you, yes, you shall wish it. Adieu, Frederica; remember that you will gain more by remaining my friend than by making war against me, and that I love you, and you as a reward have raised me. P.S.—Come and see me as soon as possible, and, if you like, in company with the gentleman that wrote the letter, as I shall be very happy to make his acquaist<lb/>ance. 17th August. Frederica,—It is now three years and more that you have known me, so that by this time you have already considered that the path you have chosen is the worst. I am in my rights with the laws of this country; there is no mortal being who can touch that which belongs me without scandal, therefore away with useless stratagems and foolish bravadoes; come and see me in good friendship as you have always done for the past, that which you and me can arrange cannot be done by any one else. Remember, that to get out of the ruin into which you have throw me I am ready for everything. Do you understand?!!! Ah, Frederica? I beg of you not to drive me to extremities, which may be terrible to and me. You have placed me in a position from which there is but one way to get out; that way is in your hands. Do not let your guardian write to me any more, for it is lost time; I have already said that I shall not open his letters any more"—I at one time gave the prisoner a seal—the impression of that seal is on the wax of this parcel—I saw it the moment I opened it—this is the seal (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,—it bears the impression of a dove carrying a letter—the two envelopes of the letters which have just been read bear the same impression—the addresses are in the prisoner's handwriting—after the interview at the Pantheon, I never saw the prisoner again until he was is custody before the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>that I have always been equally certain about it as I am now, for it was always on my mind—in the accounts I have given of the interview on 10th June, I believe I have always stated that the return of my letters by him was then mentioned—I cannot be sure, I believe so—I answered any questions that were asked me—I cannot remember whether I stated it, but I know what I did—the first proposition of the three is that I should marry him—all notions of our marrying had been quite given up between us at that time; certainly as far as I was concerned, and he knew it perfectly well—there was no person who had my confidence—I do not know that anybody on his part knew that the engagement, or the notion of engage<lb/>ment, had existed between us before he went to Italy—no one knew on my part—there would be nobody to whom I should have to explain it if nobody knew of it—the correspondence between us went on as before, at his par<lb/>ticular request—it was always kind and friendly, and affectionate—it was not of the most affectionate character, not in my meaning—I addressed him in Italian, we spoke in Italian also—at the Pantheon we spoke in French, and in Baker-street—we generally spoke in French, unless I liked to speak in Italian for exercise—in business matters we spoke in French—I believe he speaks French well, better than he writes it—it is very variable, many persons make a mistake without intending to do so, and yet they may be very correct at other times.

               <p>he could not follow his profession, and had not followed it; he was following it immensely, I thought; I saw plenty of painting going on—he never said that his countrymen shunned him because be went so much with me—he did not tell me what the life was that he could no longer endure, the life that was mentioned in the letter of 10th June, nor did I ask him, because I heard him make use of that expression when I was first acquainted with him; he was always alluding to some mysterious thing which I did not know—the responsibility which I said I could not take upon myself, was the responsibility of advising, of telling him what to do—I believe it was the third or fourth day after receiving the letter of 10th June that I went to him—I went alone—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,) is in my writing—it is in Italian—it begins "My dear friend,", "dear," or "dearest,"—it does mean u My dearest friend"—this letter was written after the rejection of the picture from the Royal Academy—it is simply dated "Wednesday"—I did not know that his picture was rejected by the Royal Academy until he particularly requested me to ascertain whether it was received or not—the letter was written by me in May—there is the post-mark on the envelope, May 9th—I suppose that is the correct post-mark—it was not my opinion that he was at that time a person who was worthy of my love, not under the sense of "love"—I wrote this letter with a great deal of feeling, in tower to one of his about his unworthiness, Asking me to go to Mr. El more about his picture, and saying that he was worthy of nothing, not even of the Royal Academy—you may put any construction upon it you please—my feeling at the time of writing it was that of the warmest and kinds t friendship, feeling for a person who bad been disappointed—I should feel for lay one disappointed, and would give them a helping hand, man or woman, as I have done—this letter, with the postmark of 20th September, 1860, is mine—I was not engaged to him at the date of that letter—lie never made n a condition of his giving hack the letters, that I should give him some written paper stating why they were given back; nothing of the kind at any time—he never told me that be could not give me back my letters until he had some paper from me that would justify him before society—there was never a promise by me to give him such a paper, nor did he tell me that he would not give me the letters until I did; nothing of the kind.</p>

I keep the Poet-office receiving house in Greek-street, Soho—on 27th July, I received a letter of advice from Bath to pay 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to George Mather—the prisoner called about 12 o'clock on that morning, and presented the order—we asked him who sent the money and he could not tell—he went away and came back with the name—I had in the mean time communicated with Mr. George Mather, who came to the receiving-house—the prisoner came back about 3 o'clock in the afternoon with this Post<lb/>office order, and Mr. Mather was then in the shop—the prisoner told me that Mr. Price was the transmitter of the order, and I paid him the sovereign—Mr. Mather and I followed him up Crown-street into New Oxford-street and Hart-street, to the corner of Duke-street, where he went into a public-house—I saw him have something to drink there—I did not see him lay a sovereign down, but I saw him take up the change—we lost him most mysteriously near Bloomsbury-square, and did not see him again till he was taken in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was delivering circulars, and a person at the top of Chancery-lane asked me to go to the Post-office to get the order, as a friend was going to take him out of town in his gig, who would not wait if he was out of the way. I went to the Post-office, and they said they had no advice; the gentleman then asked me to meet him at the British Museum on Saturday to get the order, and he would give me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I went and was given in custody; I asked the policeman to go to the Museum, and he would not go till long after, and then he was not to be found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the brother of Joseph Smout, and assist him in his boldness—on the 14th, my brother sent me to Gravesend to look after the prisoner—I waited for him in the street, and saw him come out of a house where I understood he lived—I went up to him—I had known him before—I told him I wanted him for uttering a forged cheque, well knowing it to be forged—I said that to him the first thing, when I put my hand on his shoulder; his back was turned towards me—he said, "Then I must go with you I suppose"—took him to a police-station and charged him with felony—the superintendent refused to take the charge because I had no warrant for his apprehension—it was not a Magistrate, only a superintendent of the constabulary—upon that I left the police-office, and went out with the prisoner—when I got outside I asked him if he would go with me to London; that if he did not I should telegraph up to London for a constable and a warrant for his apprehension—he said he would go with me to London—he came with me voluntarily, in the same carriage in the train—we had some conversation about this matter.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you present at the settlement of his accounts in September? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I might have gone into a longer statement, showing that the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not the only sum owed to us—I should think it is very likely that, the amount being 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, one of us gentlemen sug<lb/>gested that it should be 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. so as to allow for any outstanding goods-none of that was the result of sales which we considered he ought not to have made—I remember a customer named Charles Patreen, at Paris—it is a fact that he was charged in our account 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for those goods, including duties and so on, and was only credited to the amount of 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it would require a great deal of explanation to prove that; but in consequence of his affairs not being straight some time previously, we had those goods delivered to us by the prisoner, nominally 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth; but we only considered than worth 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But as a matter of fact, so far as the prisoner was concerned, that 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he was debited with, represented duties and a variety of other things, and you only gave him credit for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I should sy certainly from recollection this account of Patreen's had nothing to do with the settlement—I think I have a note here in the prisoner's writing which would explain that settlement—Patreen's was not included in that 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think I can say positively; it was in connexion with another settlement made previously—the balance of that previous settlement was not carried into this 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. account; it was kept perfectly separate.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were any parts of it due in this way, that he had over<lb/>valued goods, and that you had credited him for what you considered to be the proper value of the goods? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in this case at all; in Patreen's case perhaps it might be so, but not in the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I am a seaman—I have been cook on board the ship, <hi rend="italic">Shantung</hi>, for the last three years—she is a British ship—in August last we were on our voyage from China to London—we arrived in St. Katherine's Dock on 18th September—the prisoner was the master of that ship—there was an ordinary seaman on board of the name of John Riley—he died on board on 12th September—at that time the ship was between the Western Islands and the Land's End—Riley complained of being ill at that time, and I believe he was ill—he had been ill for a twelvemonth before, Off and on—I was a shipmate with him on board for two years and three months—I was with him all the time he was on board—he shipped in China—at the latter part of August, I remember some punishment being inflicted upon him—I cannot exactly say the date—the ship was then between the Western Islands and St Helena—Riley complained of being ill, and was lying down in his bed—the captain sent the chief-mate for him—Riley told the chief-mate that he could not go aft, that he could not work—I heard the mate say to him, "Get up, and come on deck"—the mate went aft—I did not hear what he said to the captain—the mate was sent to him a second time, and Riley then went aft to the captain—the mate went down into the cabin, and the captain asked Riley what was the matter with him—the captain was standing on the poop, and Riley was on the main-deck—Riley said he was not well—the captain said be would make him well if he would not go to work, and told him to come up on the poop, and during the time that he was ascending the poop, the captain struck him with a rope several times—it was a piece of lanyard rope, between two and a half and three inches in circumference, and about four and a half feet long—Riley went on to the poop, and the captain beat him for several minutes, still asking him would be go to work—Riley still replied that he was not well, that he was not able to work—the captain said he would beat him till he would work, and daring the time the captain was beating him, Riley fell down on the poop out <hi rend="italic">sang</hi>, out for mercy, while the captain was beating him—the captain said be would have no mercy on him, that he would make him work or have his life; so the man gave in, and he said he would go to work—the captain ordered the steward to give him some bath-brick and some oil to clean the brass-work with—while the captain was beating him with the rope he put two knots in it, and the man was down at the time—all this took place on the poop—it was after he had beaten him with the knotted rope that Riley cried out for mercy—the steward gave him some oil and brick, and be used it in cleaning the ship's bell and several other little things that afternoon-be seemed very slow—he did not complain much that afternoon to any of us—he never moved smartly at any time; I did not particularly observe how he moved on this occasion—he continued working at the brass-work the remainder of that day—I saw him next day at work—he was put to tarring by order of the captain—the carpenter was keeping the captain's watch at the time—he was tarring the fore and aft stays—he continued doing that one day—he went below in the afternoon and began to complain about the beating he had got from the captain—he seemed if anything to be worse than he was the day before—he did nothing the next day—he came on deck at 8 o'clock in the morning, but he was not able to work—he did not try—I saw him stripped that afternoon, and his body was black and blue from head to foot—his hands and knuckles were all cut, both his right</p>

               <p>and left hand, and bleeding—he asked me if I would wash him, but I did not, another man did it—he went to his birth that afternoon, and was confined to his berth, not exactly till he died—he took to his bed that afternoon, and the next morning part of the crew found out that he had been taking their sugar, and they proposed to turn him out of the forecastle, and they did so—he was agreeable to it, he said, very well, he would go on deck if they wished, and he took his chest on deck and all his clothes and effects, and went and slept under the mocker top-gallant forecastle for two nights after this—that is a place that is only sheltered from the weather at the top—it is close to the bows—the after-part is exposed to the air—he had his bed there and all his effects on deck—he remained there two days—it was fine weather—after that the captain sent for him and put him into his own cabin—he remained there that afternoon, and the next morning he came forward again into the forecastle, into his own berth—the captain did not lend him anything, or show him any attention during this time that I know of—the steward was forward to him several times, asking him if he wanted anything to eat or drink; any arrowroot or rice, or anything of that sort—he did not come on deck again—three of us brought him on deck once after that; we were obliged to lift him up, he could not get up by himself—we kid him on deck—it was a fine warm afternoon—he stunk so that we could not stud it in the forecastle, and we brought him on deck thinking that would take the smell off him—he remained on the deck that afternoon till it became cool, and then we took him down below again, and he remained below after that—we brought him up dead next time—it was between fifteen and twenty days from the time he got the beating till he died—about five or six days previous to his death he sent for the captain—the captain went to him, and he asked the captain if he would ever forgive himself for not putting him ashore at St. Helena as he wished—the captain replied that he had never asked him to go ashore at St. Helena—Riley said he did; and he said, "Captain Baldry, you have given me a beating, and that has killed me; you are my murderer"—the captain said, "You deserved it"—Riley made no reply to that—in about two minutes he spoke again, and asked the captain if he could make a will out—the captain said, "Pooh, nonsense, what do you want with a will?" and he smiled—he asked the captain if he could give him a few sweet biscuits that he bad on board, and some preserved ginger—the captain said that he had not got any; that all the sweet biscuits he had the rats had eaten, and all he bad was for his own child; but it appears that that afternoon he did send him a few biscuits, at least the steward took some forward to him—he told him he might have some arrowroot, or sago rice, and the steward gave him some—he also sent him some brandy and water, am an old jacket, and a pair of drawers, as he complained of belief cold in the feet—during the latter part of his life he was not able to eat at all—he would drink any amount of water—he suffered from diarrhoea, or something that appeared to be similar to that—he was buried on the 13th low—I assisted in putting him overboard.</p>

SERJEANT BALL AN TINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any dysentery on board the vessel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there were two men very bad with it—I could not say that it was that that Riley died of—for two or three days at a stretch he would eat and drink, and it would go through him as fast as he ate and drank it—that was the last few days of his death—(at other times his bowels would not net at all)—I believe that is one of the symptoms of dysentery—he did not complain of pain, only in the feet—he wanted warm</p>

               <p>water the last few days of his life—I should say it was about thirteen days before Ins death that he was turned out of the forecastle to sleep on deck—he remained out for two nights—there is an expression on board ship called being "moonblind"—I do not know what it is—Riley complained of being moonblind, but that was three months before this—I do not know that the steward complained of his stealing everything he could lay his fingers on—he did not do so to me—the forecastle was the proper place for him to sleep in—it was not blowing hard at the time he was turned out, it was fine weather—we were then between St. Thomas's island and the Land's End—I think it was Simmonds who complained of his stealing—I cannot say that all the men insisted on his going on deck, most of them did—they did not insist—he said if they did not like him he would go on deck—it was not after he had been on deck that his victuals passed through him as I have described; not till after the captain had taken him into his cabin, and we had taken him back into the forecastle again, two or three days before his death—he had never been turned out of the forecastle before for being so dirty—he was a dirty man, taking all in all, all through toe voyage—he had very dirty habits with him—he would not wash himself—he washed himself about once a fortnight, and the like of that—I should say he was a drunkard—I have seen him several times come on board intoxicated—I never called him a skulker—sometimes we drew the conclu<lb/>sion that he was a skulker, and sometimes we said the opposite—sometimes we thought he was skulking, and sometimes that he really had something the matter with him—in China I complained to the captain that he was a skulker, and not doing his work—that was eighteen months previous to his death—the first time I spoke to the captain about him, I said, "He com<lb/>plains of being ill, and wants to see a doctor; but there is no more the matter with him than there is with me"—he was not then as apparently ill at he was latterly—he said he was ill—for the last few months he was very much inclined to avoid work if he could—not so much formerly as he was for the last four months—I cannot say that he always avoided his work if be could—sometimes he would work for a month or six weeks, and never complain; at other times he would complain—I never saw him put his fingers down his throat to make it appear that he was sick—I never told the captain so—I only spoke to the captain once about him—I don't know that he has bought drink with the boots and things that the captain has given him—on one occasion he had a pair of shoes—they were too small for him—that was in China, eighteen or nineteen months previous to his death, and he traded those boots away for spirits with one of the China boats coming alongside; that is all I know about his trading his clothes away for liquor—he has gone on shore several times, and come hack without his jacket or boots; but I never saw him sell them—his clothes were gone and he had a good deal of liquor in his body—the ship came up the river to St Katherine's dock—I came ashore on thel 9th—the crew consisted of nine, including myself—I cannot say whether myself and two others are all the crew remaining in this country at present—one man went to the hospital—I cannot say when a complaint was first made against the captain; the first time I made a complaint was at the shipping office, on 26th or 27th—I did not make a complaint—three other men had made a complaint before me—Peter McEvoy, and Samuel Johnson were two of them, they are not here; and Thomas Simmonds, and William Fensom, they are here—the captain never refused to pay our wages that I know of—we took out out a summons to compel him to pay, but he never refused—he,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186110210056"/>
               <p>said he was quite willing to pay if his owners were agreeable to advance the money—we had to take out the summons against him; there had been a complaint before that—we took out the summons on the Friday, and the case did not come on till the ensuing Monday, and during those three days, it appears that some of the men stated the case at the Sailors' Home, and they forwarded a complaint to the Seamen's registry, and they communi<lb/>cated it to the Board of Trade—I was not with them at that time—the complaint was not made after the summons—I am quite sure that it was not so much as five weeks after the beating that the deceased died—I am sure it was not before the 14th August that the beating occurred—there was only one mate from St. Helena—I have seen him here to-day—I saw him rope's-end the deceased before his death; I should say it was five or six weeks previous to his death, I cannot say exactly—I did not see him rope's-end him after the captain had done so—I cannot swear that.</p>

               <p>captain said, "Pooh, nonsense, I will give you all the medicine you require when I get you to sea"—Riley had been poorly a long time, and he looked very ill then; as far as my judgment went he appeared unwell—he was not allowed to go ashore—I remember something taking place between him and the captain after leaving St. Helena on the way home, somewhere at the latter end of August—the chief officer came down into the cabin and told the captain that the man was unfit for work—I was in the cabin—told the captain said, "Oh, nonsense, pooh! give him a rope's-ending and he will work; it is only an old dodge of his, he will work"—the chief officer said, "No, I cannot rope's-end him, I shall get into trouble if I do when I get home"—the captain said, "Then send him aft to to me"—with that the chief officer went on deck, and the captain went up a minute, or half a minute after him—I went on deck directly after the captain, and I saw Riley coming aft, as I was going forward to the galley on the port side of the deck, and as he went up the ladder, I saw the captain strike him with the rope three or four times, with a piece of the running gear of the main-royal, and after he got up on the poop, he picked up another piece of rope abort two and a half inches—this is the rope; but that is not the rope he struck him with when he was coming up the ladder; this is part of the royal clew<lb/>lines—I was standing by the galley at the time, with the remainder of the ship's company, for I should say four minutes, while the captain was beating him, and he crying out for mercy—he cried out a great many times—I then went aft, he was still beating him, when I went on the poop; and he was crying out for mercy, would no one come and save him from being murdered—the captain said, "There is no mercy for you; I will either have your work, or I will have your life"—he was standing at this time—I saw him down on the deck afterwards, after the captain had put the over-hand knob in the rope—I saw the captain put those knots in the rope—I went to the companion and stood looking at him a second or two, and then I went down into the cabin, and when I came up he was still beating him; he was still standing up then—when I got forwards to the galley I saw him down on the deck, and the captain still beating him—I did not see him fall; I then came aft again—I left him lying on the deck, and the captain still beating him—then I believe Riley said he would give in and clean the brass-work—I did not hear him say so—the captain sent me for the bath-brick and oil for Riley to clean it, and when I got on deck again, Riley was sitting on one of the guns on the poop—I did not give it him, I put it on the hen-coop, and he went to work with it, cleaning the brass-work—I did not take much notice of the state in which he was at that time; he appeared to be very ill and very sore about his bones, which he must have been I know from the severe beating he got from the captain—I saw him cleaning the brass-work afterwards, but I did not see him again that day-how long he was cleaning the brass-work I do not know—I do not know whether it was that day or the next day that I saw him lying forward the windlass—I believe he was set to tarring—I saw him next day with the w tar-pot or something in his hand, but what he was going to do with it I do not know—I did not see him do any work after that tarring; I did not see him again for some days—the first time I saw him afterwards was in the captain's cabin—the captain ordered me to clear a berth out for him, and said he would take him down into the cabin—I did so—he told me to go and fetch his things aft—I did not—they were brought aft by some one; whether it was the chief officer or not I cannot say—he slept in the cabin that night—next morning I went down into the cabin, and saw Riley</p>

               <p>coming out of my pantry with a sugar-basin in his band—asked him what he did in there—he said he was going to put a little sugar in his tea—i said, "Why not ask roe for it, and I would give it you"—then went and made it known to the captain, that he was taking the sugar out of the pantry, and the captain said, "We will turn him out of the cabin," and he was turned out there and then, or half au Hour after that—he was up and down three or four times in the night—was watching him; I had a berth next to him—do not think he slept all night—he went back to the forecastle—that was the first place I saw him in afterwards—think that was seven or eight days after this occurrence, or something like that; I could not say within a day or two—he was getting much worse—he asked for Moe brandy—'went aft and said to the captain, "Riley wants some brandy"—he said, "That is the only thing that will do him good"—said, "I do not think it is good for him, you had better give him a little wine"—he amid, "No, the d—d rascal shall not have wine"—gave him a little weak brandy and water by the captain's orders—saw the man a few hours before be died—saw his body at that time—t was black from the head to the foot—he was lying naked in his bed—they had been washing him, and had not covered his clothes over him, and I could not see three fingers' breadth bat was black and blue from the beating he had had with the rope—he was lying on his right side—after seeing the man's state, I felt very timid—i went aft and said to the captain, "If you have got a drop of wine, out of charity give it to that poor man, he won't lire twenty-four hours"—he said, "Pooh, nonsense! you have said that so many times before, steward"—he would give me no answer whether I should give him wine or not—went out, and in a few minutes he called me in' and told me to give him some wine, and I gave him a little—put my right arm round his neck, and held it up while I poured it down his throat—he had not strength to swallow it—some went down Jus throat, and some down the sides of his mouth—i aid then that the roan would not live till to-morrow morning—this was between 2 or 3 o'clock in the afternoon—between 6 and 7 o'clock, the chief officer came down and called the captain out of the after cabin, and said the man was dead—the captain came into the fore cabin and said, "What had we better do with him?" and the mate said, "We had better get him on deck, wrap him up in a tarpaulin and bury him to-morrow morning—after I came home I summoned the captain for wages—t was I who made the statement of this matter at the Sailors' Home—made a statement first to the owner—that was before the summons—he told us to meet him next morning at 10 o'clock, and he would take us to the Board of Trade, and make it come to light—he said we must go to the Sailors' Home first, and we went there.</p>

I was mate of this vessel—I joined at Batavia, and worked from thence home—I remember Riley quite well—he was always a dirty, slovenly fellow in his habits—he was not ashore at all while I was with the vessel—I had, at times, reason to complain of his not working—I remember the time when the captain rope's-ended him—up to that time I thought that there was something like skulking about him most part of the time—I was not present when the rope's-end was applied—I went forward to know the reason that the man was not up at his work on this occasion, and he told me he was sick—I told the captain what he told me—that was in the beginning of August—I cannot say the day—I do not recollect the date—I saw the man at his work after that, for about a week as nearly as I can recollect—I had occasion to find fault with him after that, and I certainly did strike him once or twice, with the rope's-end, my self. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>went down West-street into St. John's-court to Mr. Neighbour's stables—they are wine merchants, carrying on business in King-street, and the stables lie at the back of their premises—before he went into the stables I noticed that his pockets were very light, not at all bulky—he remained in the stables, I should think, about six or seven minutes; he and Brandon then came out of the stable together, and turned up Fox-and-Knot-court into King-street—there is an entrance from King-street through into West-street—they went up King-street towards the public-house where I had seen them together on the Thursday evening—before they went into the public-house I noticed that both Goodall's pockets were very bulky—they remained in the public-house about two or three minutes—they then came out and separated, after about two minutes conversation together; Goodall turning again down King-street, and Brandon going down West-street towards the stables—I followed Goodall into Farringdon Market, and from there to Newgate-street—when at the end of Queen's-head-passage, Newgate-street, I felt his pockets, and got in front of him, and asked him what he had got there, putting my hand at his sides—his coat was open, and the pockets were inside—I said I was an officer—there was a little commotion at the time—crowd began to collect—I took him by the arm and took him across into King Edward-street—I said, "I am detective-officer, and shall take you into custody for receiving these two bottles from Mr. Neighbour's servant "—he said, D----n it; you are not going to take me for a little drop of brandy"—I had bold of him—he begged of me not to take hold of him, for he would not run away—he then put his hands in his pockets and walked by my side—we proceeded a little farther on the way to the station, when he suddenly turned from me, put his hands into his pocket, held the two brandy bottles up and dashed them to the ground, saying, "There you b----, you shan't have the brandy"—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,) are some of the pieces of the bottles—one was green and the other white—I picked up some of the pieces and the corks, and took them to the station—Pavitt took Brandon in custody, but I gave him the directions to do so—on the remand of Goodall at Guildhall, Brandon was at the station awaiting my arrival to charge him—I there told him everything that had occurred about Goodall, and foe said, "All right master; I have been led into this by Goodall and <hi rend="italic">Mahogany".—Makogany</hi>, is the nickname of a man named Simpkins, who was drinking with them on the Thursday evening when I first saw them together—I asked Brandon how long he had known Goodall, and he said he had known him three months.</p>

Neighbour's counting-house in another—I stood in Fox-and-knot-court—if Brandon had come round the street and entered the stables after Goodall I should have seen him, but he did not come round—I was not instructed to watch Brandon—I was watching his companion, <hi rend="italic">Mahogany</hi>, and through watching that man this case turned up—I suspected Brandon then of being mixed up with that</p>

Mc'Glashen of the Coal-yard, Drury-lane, engines and copper-smiths—I have been there about four years—I have a younger brother named John, and a fellow apprentice named Alexander Davidson—on Saturday night, 7th September, somewhere about half-past 6, after we returned from work, we all three went for a walk—we went to Hyde-park, down St Martin's-lane, through the Horse Guards, through St. James's-park and into Hyde-park—we remained there a quarter of an hour or twenty minute and came back along Piccadily—when we came opposite St James's chorea, we saw the rifle volunteers—we were then on the side opposite St. James's church, the left-hand side of the street—there was no other person in my company except Davidson and John James—I saw the prisoner Gordon when he came and threw my brother down—that was the first I saw of him—he was dressed in private clothes and had a walking-stick in his hand—when my brother fell down, Gordon hit Davidson across the back with a stick—I thought he was mad or intoxicated, and I ran some yards off, and my brother ran across the road; I stopped on the side of the kerb and saw him thrash my brother, and then let him go—he then came behind me and caught hold of me by the collar, and halloed out to another policeman, 59 C, to take Alexander Davidson, and he did so—when the prisoner took me by the collar, I asked him what was the matter, and he said, "You know as well as I do," and took us off to Vine-street—I did not say anything more to him till we got there—I said there that we thought he was mad, and run away—before that I did not make a snatch at any gentleman's guard or chain, or endeavour to steal it—Davidson did not attempt to put his hand into any gentleman's pocket—I was so close to him as to be sure of that—there was no person named Rickets, or any person at all, in our company—we did not come from the Haymarket, we came the other way—Gordon did not, about three weeks before this, caution me for being in the company of a thief—I do not know such a person as Ricketts—the prisoner charged us at the station with attempting to pick pockets—I said it was false, and he said he had followed us from Leicester-square, following the rifles, and seen us make several attempts—I gave my address, and I was bailed out late at</p>

               <p>night—on Monday I went before Mr. Beadon—after Gordon had been sworn, he said he had watched us from the Haymarket to St James's church—he also said he had cautioned me about three weeks back, and that I had thanked him—he said he told me I was in the company of several thieves, which was false.</p>

Q.</hi> There were a number of persons there, were there not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; with the rifles, lads, and boys, and men—there were a great number of people; I cannot exactly tell—I did not notice a hoarding near St James's church—I did not get under a hoarding—we went straight down the pavement—I did not pass over a hoarding or plank; nothing of the sort—I ran away about twenty yards—I can't exactly tell how far Davidson ran before he was taken; a very short distance—he was taken at the next turning to St. James's church, not far from the Circus—he stopped directly he saw the man catch hold of me—I should say he was about ten yards from me on the same side, nearer the Circus than Vine-street—my brother only crossed over—I saw a cab alongside of me—I saw no lads running there besides ourselves; no lads dodging about by the cab—I did not hear anyone call out, "The scamps are picking my pocket"—we met the rifles opposite St James's church—the charge against us was heard before Mr. Beadon, the same gentleman who afterwards heard the charge against the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an apprentice to Messrs. McGlashen, engineers and coppersmiths, Drury-lane—I was with William Price James and John James on this Saturday night—we went to Hyde-park, and returned through Piecadilly—we had not been along Piccadilly before that at all—when we got opposite St James's church we saw the rifle corps—we were on the left hand side of the street coming from Hyde-park; the rifle corps was on the opposite side going towards Hyde-park—there was nobody else in my company besides those two—I don't know anybody named Ricketts—I never heard of such a person till I heard it at the police-court—I did not see the prisoner till he came behind us—he caught hold of John James and threw him on his face, came forward and struck me on the back with a stick; John James then got up, and ran over to the other side of the way, the same side as the church—I believe there is a hoarding there—I did not notice it that evening; I have noticed it since—there was a hoarding on the side I was—when I was struck I ran away about sixty yards, and was then taken by constable 79 C—the prisoner called to him to apprehend me—I was taken to Vine-street police-station—before that William Price James did not make a snatch at a gentleman's watch—I was so close to him as to know that he did not—I did not put my hand into a gentleman's coat pocket—I am quite sure of that—I was charged at the station with attempting to pick pockets—on Monday I was taken before the Magistrate—I heard the prisoner examined after he was sworn—he said he had followed us from the Haymarket, and said he had cautioned William James three weeks ago that he was in company with a thief, and that he thanked him—I have been with Mr. McGlashen three years—I am his nephew.</p>

I am the brother of William Price James, and was fifteen years old last January—I have recently gone to a compositor's—on 7th Sep<lb/>tember I went out with my brother and Alexander Davidson to Hyde-park, and on our way home we came along Piccadilly—we there met a rifle corps coming along, going towards Hyde-park—I saw the prisoner—the first thing he did he threw me down; he was behind me; I was then on the left hand side, opposite St. James's Church—I got up and ran over the other side—my brother and Davidson kept on the left hand side—the prisoner came after me to the other side, and hit me across the legs with a stick, and I ran away again—nothing was said to me at all by the prisoner—I did not make any snatch at a gentleman's watch—I was so close to my brother that I could have seen if he had made a snatch at a gentleman's watch—he did not do so; I am sure of that—Davidson did not put his hand into a gentleman's coat or any other pocket, I am sure of that—there was nobody in my company besides my brother and Alexander Davidson—no other boy with us at all—I don't know Ricketts at all—I did not talk to anybody else—I went home, and on the same evening the prisoner came to the house—at that time he had a stick—he saw my mother, and told her that my brother was charged with picking pockets—my mother told him he had better go and withdraw the charge; he had made a mistake—he made no answer to that—he said to me, "You were going towards Hyde-park—and I said, "No, we were coming from Hyde-park"—nothing was said about striking—he came about half-past 8, and was there about five minutes—my mother told him he had struck me, and he did not answer—I did not hear any cry of "Stop thief."</p>

In consequence of instructions which were given to me, on 7th September, I followed the prisoner and his cart—he keeps a potato, or vegetable shop, in King-street, Deptford—a person of the name of Whittingham keeps a marine-store shop next door—the cart was at Gibraltar toll-gate when I stopped him, at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon—I said, "Mr. Grimwood, I am going to see what you have got in your cart—he said, "Mr. Crouch, I have got nothing"—I said, "What have you in that sieve you are sitting on?"—he said, "Can't you lee I have nothing; it is bottom upwards"—seeing the end of a sack pro<lb/>jecting from under the sieve I said, "Get up and let's see what's underneath"—he got up—I turned the sieve on one side and found this sack—I took hold of it, and feeling that it was heavy I said, "You have got metal here, where did you get it from it"—he said, "From my next door neighbour"—I said, "You must go with me to the station," which was fifty yards off—he did so—when we got there I took hold of the bottom of the sack, turned the contents out on the floor, and out rolled some pieces of copper pipe that I have since weighed—they weigh twelve pounds—they were loose in the outer sack—there were also two pounds of copper nails—I opened all the bags—I asked him where he got the whole—he said he got it from Mr. Whittingham, his next door neighbour; "We were to meet at St Georges Church, in the Borough"—I then took hold of the sack, seeing it was a potato sack—I said, "Where did you get this from"—he said from his neighbour—I said I should search his house to see if I could not find some more sacks there—he then said that it was his sack, that he had lent it to his neighbour about a quarter of an hour before—he asked the inspector to allow him to go to St. George's Church with me—the inspector refused—I afterwards went to his neighbour, and saw Whittingham, on the Monday morning.</p>

I am an engine-driver, in the service of the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway Company—on 23d September I was engaged in taking a train of empty carriages from New Cross to London Bridge—there were two engines, one in front, and one behind—the one I was driving, was the one-at the tail of the train—it was a few minutes before 5 in the evening—after I had passed the Bricklayer's Arms Station, between there and Corbitt's-lane, signal station, I saw a man on the east side of the line with a gun—I was going very slowly—about fourteen miles an hour—the man was on the embankment—he put the gun to his shoulder, put it down, then put it up a second time and fired it off—he fired as if he aimed at the engine—one of the shots caught me on the bottom of the chin, and fetched the blood out, and several caught the boiler—I heard them rattle on the boiler—the wound on my chin is quite well now—I had never seen the</p>

On the morning of 18th September between 3 and 4 o'clock, I was on duty in St George's-road, near the prose<lb/>cutor's house—I heard a rattle springing—I went to the house and went to the flap of the cellar was open; it had been forced with an instrument—I found four lucifers and this jemmy in the bar—it corresponded with the marks on the flap—I also found a piece of woodwork broken away on the staircase—I had a teapot that was given to me, but it was given up to the prosecutor by order of the Magistrate—I was coming through Gaywood-street on duty on this morning, about twenty minutes past 3, as near as could be, and saw Pitts walking—I noticed him come underneath a lamp—he had no cap on at the time—he had a blue guernsey on—I heard the rattle spring just after that, when he got to the corner of Lion-street, and went after him, but could not find him anywhere—he got out of my sight in about a minute from the corner of Lion-street—if I see any one at that early time in the morning I take particular notice of them at times, but I took particular notice of this man on account of knowing that street, because it is full of thieves and prostitutes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, of Rose Villas. Montpelier-road, Peckham—I built some houses in Albert-road, Peckham—in July I had some semi<lb/>detached houses, called Lansdowne-villas, two of which were, unoccupied—the adjoining house to the one in question was occupied by a family named Collis—I call them three-storied houses—the entrance to the house was at the side in the Albert-road; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,) is a model of it—there was a stable at the side, which had been built by my previous tenant, who kept a pony and cart—there was no communication between the stable and the house when the house was let in July; you had to go round the back way—there was an entrance here for the carriage, but no communication from the middle—when you entered the house from the street you came along a passage—there were two solid brick walls; one fourteen inches thick, and the other nine inches—the wall at the back of the stable was nine inches thick, and there was another at right angles to it—one wall was against the other—they were each nine inches thick—here is the wall of the stable, and this is the wall of the house, which was fourteen inches thick—when you enter the passage to go to the house, you have not to go into a door; it is an arch—there is a half-briek wall opposite the door that separates the pantry or store closet from the entrance hall—when you go through that archway you come into the lobby where the staircase is—there were two parlours with folding doors—there was a closet under the staircase with a door and boarded floor—there were certain rooms above, and a kitchen built out behind, with a sloping roof—there was an entrance here into the</p>

               <p>kitchen—the only way into it was from the kitchen, but I call it a store closet—the only entrance to that store closet in July was from the kitchen—a garden ran round the premises, and between Nunhead-lane and the passage was a piece of vacant ground belonging to me—about 13th or 14th July, Frederick Clift called upon me—he said he came about the house at Nunhead-lane, and wanted to take it for the accommodation of the stable; that he was living at 2, Harwich-cottages, Commercial-road, which I know very well, as I happened to build it; that he had no stable there, which was inconvenient, and he had to put his horse up at his brother's—we agreed on the rent, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—my wife was present—he signed the agreement on the Monday, and paid half a quarter's rent in advance—on 16th George Clift called on me for the key by himself—my wife was present—I handed the key to my wife, and she gave it to him—no opening had been made at that time from the stable into the house—nothing was said by them about any intention to make an opening, or I should not have allowed it—I did not see the house again till alter the fire on 3d August—I did not then see that any opening had been made—having been at the fire, I went to George Clift's house, in Hardres-road, also called Lansdowne-villas—it is about a quarter of a mile from Frederick Clift's—it is a straight road, only you turn to the right a little—I was asked into the parlour, and saw both the prisoners—I said to Frederick, "There is my house burnt down; how did it happen?"—he said that he did not know; that they had gone to Waltham, and were not at home till half-past 11 that night—I said, "Where were your servants?" and he said, "They were dismissed the week before, and my wife was washing in the kitchen; my child had tumbled into a pan or tub of water, and had not been well since, and she had taken it to Doctor Dennis, in Southampton-street"—I said, "She might have found plenty of doctors it Peckham, without going to Southampton-street that time of night"—Southampton-street is about two miles from there—they said that they should have great losses, and Government particularly, because they could not get their contracts out—I said, "The Government always allow for accidents"—on 13th August, ten days afterwards, I went again to the house—I had been to it and examined it in the mean time, and had seen that a doorway had been made from the pantry to the stable—I saw both the prisoners at George Clift's house on 13th—I asked Frederick when he cut that doorway—he said that he cut it two or three days after he went into the house—I asked him why he cut it—he said that George told him he had done wrong by cutting it, as he ought to have asked my leave—I said that if he had I should not have allowed it to be done, as it affected my insurance—he gave as a reason for doing it that he was afraid of thieves—I said, "I never heard any of my tenants complain of thieves"—he said that he took a gun out one night after them—I said that it made it more easy for thieves to get in, if they had taken a tile off the stable—I asked him the name of the person who had cut the doorway—he said that he would not tell till he was forced to tell, on account of what Collis had said—I said to Frederick, "I let you that stable for your pony, chaise and trap, not for a warehouse"—George said that the stable was not high enough for the shafts of the chaise—he did not then tell me where he had kept the chaise since Frederick had taken the house—the wall had not been cut through by a tradesman, nor was the way which it was made good—it was merely a rough hole in the wall, and a bit of board round it; it was not done cleverly—Frederick said that he had lost sixty sovereigns, I believe it was, which he had to meet a bill—I said. "It is very strange; the firemen</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—I was present when Frederick Clift called in July, about taking the house—he said he wanted it principally on account of the stable, for his horse and trap; it was agreed that he should have the house—a day or two after that, I gave up the key to George Clift, his brother—after the tire I was present with my husband at George's house—I remember something being said by my husband about the doorway being out—he asked them why it was out; they said to prevent thieves—they said there were sixty sovereigns in the house—I do not remember whether this was the 3d or 13th of August; it was some little time after the fire—my husband asked who cut the door<lb/>way, and the answer was that it was done by a man about fifty years of age—my husband asked who it was, but there was no further answer given—Frederick said he had been at Waltham on that day—I do not remember whether he said what time he returned.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Globe Insurance Company-at the time this matter happened I resided at No. 1, Lansdowne-villas, next door to the house that was burnt—I was instructed on Monday, 22d July, to call at No. 2, Frederick Clift's house, to look over it—I went on the Monday evening, and saw Frederick Clift there—after some conversation with him about the quills, he took me into the stable; he took me through the back parlour and kitchen, round the back of the house, through the back entrance to the stable—we went out from the back kitchen through the passage out<lb/>side the house—he said, "I am very sorry there is no other way; I must take you through the back of the house "—there were two entrances to the stable, one at the front and one at the back—I might have gone round by the front of the house, and gone in the same way—he said there was no way through the house, he was obliged to go out of the house—I was directed to ascertain whether there was any communication between the house and the stable—I asked him whether there was any communication—while I was in the stable I said, "There is nothing in that wall; are you sure the wall is perfect?"—he said it was—that was one of the principal things that I was directed to ascertain; whether it was a brick wall—I found that there wert quills in the bags which were there—the stable was full of them, within a short distance from the roof, and a narrow passage through, from the front to the back—the bales were packed against the house side, dote to the wall, a narrow passage being on the other side—I have not the slightest know<lb/>ledge of the value of such goods; my object was to see that they were really there—after Frederick Clift had been at the house some little time, I knew him and Mrs. Clift by sight—on 2d August, the day of the tire, I saw Mrs. Clift, the wife of Frederick, between 5 and 6 o'clock—I crossed the road to come to my own house, and saw her with the child in a perambulator, standing in the path in front of the house—I think she was coming from the house; she appeared to be standing still—she told me her child had been taken ill, and she was going to take it to a doctor—I cannot say whether she went in the direction of George Clift's house after I left her—I do not recollect whether she moved—I did not see her go away with the child—I went out some little time after that, and afterwards heard of the fire.</p>

               <p>of similar construction: the outer wall against which the stable has been built being a thick wall—the bales and packages were placed against the wall nearest the house, not the outer stable wall—the feathers were piled to t certain extent against the wall; but I think if the door had been there. I must have seen it, above the feathers—the wall on the outer side was away from the house; it is a lean-to stable—I could have walked upright if I hid walked close against that wall—the height of the stable, is on one side, I think, about six feet, and on the other side, it is about two feet higher there is not a passage with feathers stacked on either side of it, only on one side—I know the position of the door that has been cut—if that door bad existed with the bales packed as they were, I think I must have seen the top of it—I did not measure within what distance of the roof the bales went; the door might have been there and escaped my observation, but I do not think it is likely—I swear that I asked him if the wall was perfect; it was one of my first questions when I reached the stable, if I recollect right; it in usual question to ask—of course I have spoken before about having asked him if the wall was perfect—I made a report in which I said that I was told it was perfect—I recollect my previous examination before the Magistrate—I understood it to be a perfect party wall, and that there was no communication; he did not use the word perfect, but he said there was no break in the wall, and that constitutes a perfect wall—I was told by Frederick Clift that there was no communication—I do not suppose I was on the premises more than a quarter of an hour altogether—I looked at several bales, and they appeared to be full of quills because the ends were protruding from the bales—they were not covered.</p>
