                  </hi>. I am a licensed market porter, and live at 143, South Street, Walworth—on December 6th, between 1 and 2 p.m., I went into the Al restaurant to get a light for a cigarette—I did not notice who was in there—there was no disturbance when I went in—nobody spoke to me—I went outside—the prisoner came out and knocked me down—while I was on the ground he hit me under my jaw, breaking it in four places—I am unable to eat now—I knew him before; we were always on friendly terms—we had no quarrel—he was not drunk; he may have had a drop to drink—two blows were struck—I went to the station and to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, where I remained for seven weeks.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We were not both struggling on the floor inside the public house—I was sober—I know Henry Williams—he is wrong if he says I was struggling on the floor of the public-house—when the prisoner struck me outside I did not get up between the two blows—I did not put my hands up and say, "Do you mean it?"—I cannot suggest any reason why he should have struck me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the Al public-house—on December 6th, about 2 p.m., I turned the prisoner out—he was disorderly and causing a disturbance, he was not drunk—I do not know if any blows had been struck—he had been quarrelling with the prosecutor, who was in there—I went outside to see that the prisoner did not come in again—while I was there the prosecutor came out—the prisoner struck him violently on the jaw twice without any provocation—the prosecutor did not try to hit him.</p>

               <p>saw the prisoner and the prosecutor struggling on the floor in the bar—the manager and the head barman parted them—the prisoner was turned out—I went for a policeman; when I got back the prisoner was outside—I saw him knock the prosecutor to the ground, and as he got up again he hit him again—there were two blows—the prosecutor gave the prisoner in charge—I did not see him make any attempt to strike the prisoner—I went for the policeman of my own accord—we did not go back together; I ran back as fast as I could.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager at Griffiths' Tavern in the Meat Mar<lb/>ket—on December 6th I was outside the Al public-house, speaking to a friend—I saw the prisoner being ejected by the manager—a little while after I saw the prosecutor come out—the prisoner said to him, "Now then," and hit him a blow with his left hand, which knocked him down, and then he hit him again with his right hand on the jaw.</p>

On December 6th I saw a crowd outside the Al public-house—I went up and found the prosecutor bleeding—the prisoner was given into custody for assaulting him by striking him in the mouth twice—the prisoner did not say anything on the way to the station—he had been drinking, but he was not so drunk as not to know what he was doing—the prosecutor was taken to the hospital—the doctor certified then that his jaw was broken in two places, but the doctor who has been subpoenaed here says it was broken in four places.</p>

Webb &amp; Poulter, meat salesman in the Central Market—Mr. Christopher Poulter is a partner in the firm—King was a meat porter in the market; he worked for a Mr. Fergusson, a meat carrier—on January 2nd I sold five saddles of mutton to a Mr. Scarlett for ₤2 7s. 6d., which was 81/2d. a lb.—about 6 or 6.30 a.m. on the 2nd, King came up to me and asked if there was anything for Bury Street—I said, "Yes, there are five saddles"—they were on the scales; he saw me weigh them; I put them on his shoulders, and he went away with them—a little while afterwards one of Fergusson's men came in, and I found out that the meat had not gone to Fergusson—I thought King was working for Fergusson—I should have had to pay for the mutton if I had not found it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant</hi>). On January 2nd I heard of this robbery—I went to 38, Lisson Grove, which is about three miles from the Central Meat Market—the prisoners live there—Sex keeps a coffee-house there—I think King had lived there about two or three months—I went to the premises with another officer—I saw Sex crossing the road with a bundle with which he entered his house—he put it down on a table and spoke to King—I followed him and said, "I am a sergeant of police; I want to know what is in this bundle"—Sex said, "I know nothing about it"—I said, "What is in the bundle? is there any meat?"—Sex said, "I do not know; it belongs to this man," pointing to King—I said, "I saw you crossing the road with it"—I opened the bundle; it contained two saddles of mutton—Sex said, "I have been to Kensington with this meat, and have sold one to a publican"—I said, "What publican?"—he said, "The name of the house is the George"—I said, "Where?"—he said, "Near Kensington Church"—I said, "There are three other saddles; I shall have to charge you, King, with stealing those five saddles of mutton, and you, Sex, with receiving them"—they made no reply—while we were in the train, going towards the City, I said to Sex, "King days that you have had all those saddles"—he said, "Well, I may as well toll the truth; I sold the others to old Charlie Palmer, at Camberwell Green, and I sold him two sheep; I hope he will not get into trouble over it"—all the five saddles have been recovered; two at Palmer's, and one at Nailer's, at Kensington.</p>

I live at Silver Street, Stepney, and keep a coffee-stall in the Commercial Road, close to Church Lane—on Decem<lb/>ber 1st, about 1 a.m., I saw the deceased constable; he was on duty, and in uniform—he passed my stall, going towards Aldgate—soon afterwards the prisoner came to my stall with two women, who had some refresh<lb/>ments—the prisoner left and walked towards Aldgate; a minute or so afterwards the women followed him—I next heard the prisoner shouting or singing, about 7 ft. or 8 ft. from my stall, and between me and Church Lane—the deceased came up and told him to go away; he went away towards Union Street, or eastwards—the women went in the opposite direction, towards Aldgate—as the prisoner moved away he asked the constable what he had done—he continued walking away, and I see them walk a little way towards Union Street, the prisoner in front of the con<lb/>stable—I went outside my stall, and was talking to a man named Ellis, a cab washer—I saw the constable follow the prisoner to Union Street, and saw the constable stop at Morrison's Buildings; then I saw my father coming towards my stall from the east—the prisoner went as far as the corner of Union Street—I saw him turn round and go towards the deceased, who was on the pavement—the deceased made a step or two towards the prisoner, and I saw them meet and fall—when they fell I heard a police whistle go—I then saw six or seven other constables on the other or south side of the road—they were going along in file, and taking prisoners to Arbour Square—I thought the whistle came from the deceased—the constables ran over to where the deceased had fallen—I did not go up to the place—there was nobody near the spot where the deceased and the prisoner fell—my father and myself were the nearest—there were no passengers in the road.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190102040016"/>
               <p>they fell—as they fell the deceased said, "I am done; he has stabbed me, hold him"—I saw blood spurting from the left side of his neck—I did not help to take him off the prisoner—I helped to pick the prisoner up—I saw no mark on him then—he became violent when we got him on his feet—Beckett struck him with his truncheon on his left shoulder; at the same time the prisoner struck Beckett a blow on the chest, and I immediately struck him a blow between the eyes with my fist—I did not then know where the knife was—I took the prisoner to the station—Beckett blew the first police whistle, when he was 9 or 10 yards from the deceased and the prisoner—I did not see or hear the deceased blow his whistle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I first saw the men they both had their hands up to each other's collars—they fell with considerable force—when the deceased said he had been stabbed he had his hand on the prisoner's chest—the prisoner was only held to the ground by the deceased, who was on top of him—when he was on his feet he was not struck because of what the deceased had said; he was struck because of his violence—it would be correct to say that I hit him as hard as I could on his face twice—I said before the Coroner, "I struck the accused because I thought the accused had murdered my colleague."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not strike the prisoner out of revenge—at the inquest I was rather confused by the way the question was put to me—I did not mean that the prisoner was not violent to the other constables, I meant that he was not violent to me, and it was after he had struck Beckett that I struck him with my fist.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a foreman lighterman, of 28, Guildford Road, Poplar—in May last I was carrying on a tobacconist's business at 111, Crisp Street, Poplar, which I sold for ₤225, and was paid partly in notes, one of which was a ₤100 note, No. 98361, of January 6th, 1899—I thought I would bank it, and on August 29th I put it in my hip pocket, but had not the opportunity of getting to the bank—I should say that it was in my possession till just after four, because I went down by the 4 o'clock train—I saw the prisoner that day, and we simply had a glass of beer together—I missed the note at 7 o'clock next morning, when I was dressing—I went downstairs to see if the house was securely fastened, and then went to the bank just before 10 o'clock and stopped it—I saw the prisoner about three months afterwards at Fenchurch Street Station, and simply told him that I had lost a ₤100 note—he said that there had been several bad notes—I had known him before; I was a shipmate with him</p>

I am a barrister and Recorder of Deal—I have known Cobb about 36 years—he was known to my father and mother, and greatly respected, and that led to my being engaged professionally on his behalf—Hamilton called one morning and said that he was interested in Cobb's case, and that he was very well acquainted with criminal investigations, having been a detective at Scotland Yard for some time; two years, I think—he said he proposed to go to Petersfield and see what could be done, and that he felt sure he could make Mrs. Cobb agree to some terms—he proposed a subscription among people interested, of whom he said there were many in the neighbourhood—I received this letter from him dated January 30th—I know his writing—I threw cold water on it, but on my return from being away, I found that my brother-in-law, who is 20 or 21 years of age, had given ₤1, my sister-in-law another ₤1, and 10s. and 3s. more had been given from my house, and this appears to be Mr. Moore's writing.</p>

               <p>carrier, of Silver Street, City—I was outside my master's premises on January 25th, about 5 p.m.—there was a van there with some parcels on it; it was being loaded—I saw the prisoner walking away with this parcel (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) on his shoulder—he was 2ft. or 3ft. from the van—he walked down Monkwell Street—I followed him—I did not lose sight of him—when I got to the bottom of Fell Street I slipped round the side of him and saw our label—I asked him if the parcel belonged to him—he said that it did not—I asked him where he got it—he said a man gave it to him, and he was to take it down the street and meet him at the bottom of Wells Street with it—I had not seen him or anybody take it off the van—I did not see anybody near the prisoner—the box contained seven ladies' mantles, valued at ₤7 19s. 5d.; it was a cardboard box—I asked the prisoner to go back with me to our premises—he said he would come back—he did so—I took him to my master, and he was given into custody.</p>

I am manager to Edward Saunderson, of 16, Silver Street—on January 25th, about 5.30 p.m., Lamas brought the prisoner to me—he told me in the prisoner's presence that he had seen him carrying a parcel, and had asked him if it belonged to him; that the prisoner had said it did not, whereupon Lamas told him it was ours, and pointed out the label, and asked him to come back with it to see me—I asked the prisoner what he had to say about it—he said it had been given to him by a man to carry—I think he said the man had also given him a letter—anyhow, he produced this letter "Please give the bearer the two books, A and B, that were left last week, and oblige, R. Robinson"—the envelope is addressed, "A. &amp; H. Kemp &amp; Company"—I took him into my office—I said that he had placed himself in a very funny position, and asked if he could give any explanation at all to throw any light on the matter—he said that he was innocent of any theft, and that he had come into Silver Street to see someone at Messrs. Vyse's place of business; that he was standing opposite our van, and he saw a man near our place who asked him to take the parcel—I forget the name of the street which he said—I could not get anything satisfactory, and I gave him into custody—a plain clothes officer came in while I was talking to the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a machinist, of 128A, Cambridge Road, Bethnal Green—on Christmas night, about 9.30, I was walking in Green Street, Bethnal Green, with two lads about 16, my brothers-in-law—it was rather a dark night, and it is not well lighted at that spot—I saw seven or eight lads coming in the opposite direction, about 25 yards from us, making a noise—I do not recognise either of the prisoners—three or four of them began punching my two lads about their heads and faces—they had done nothing—I was getting one of them away, and told him to run away, and I was about going away, when one of the lads came out of the gang and fired a pistol which I saw in his hand, and saw the glitter of it—I felt my hand numbed; I then saw blood on it—I ran away to Dr. Grant's shop, and met two constables—when I came out I went to the station with one of them, and then went home and back to the station a second time, and then to the London Hospital—I got there between eleven and twelve—I walked there—I did not remain there all night; I went to my brother-in-law's—I went back to the hospital next morning in consequence of directions—I went there about four times, and the fourth time I was kept there as an in-patient, as my wound had become more painful—I was an in-patient a fortnight, and after that I went to a convalescent home at Tenterden for a fortnight—a bullet was extracted from my hand on the second occasion—when I went to the station the second time on Christmas night I saw a boy in custody, and recognised him as one whom I had seen in the crowd—it was not one of the prisoners—about a week after I was an in-patient I went to the station and saw a dozen boys and men in the yard, and picked out one, but neither of the prisoners—the wound is well now, but I have not the use of my hand, and am unable to carry on my business.</p>

               <p>not find it—I looked for it at the orifice—I invited him to stay in the hospital, but he said he had rather not, and went home—I told him to come again next day, which he did, and the receiving surgeon saw him, and again on the 27th, and as the result of that visit he was admitted as an in-patient that day—he was under my care, and on the 29th I con<lb/>ducted the first operation—the bullet had been localised by the X rays, and I was present when it was taken out on January 2nd by Mr. Barnard, and I produce it—he was not constitutionally fit to attend the Court, both from the operation, and the wound combined—a bullet such as this would not be dangerous to life in that situation, but in certain circum<lb/>stances it might.</p>

The prosecutor was standing in doorway of chapel, next door. Shaunesey asked prosecutor for a <hi rend="italic">fag</hi> (cigarette), and then snatched the cigarette prosecutor was smoking out of his mouth. I said, 'Good night! I am going indoors.' I went indoors, and before I bolted the door I heard screams and shouting "Murder" and "Police." I opened door again, looked out, and saw Fisher and prosecutor rolling in road. Fisher was on top. I pulled Fisher off, and he broke away from me, and he and Shaunesey struck and kicked prosecutor while he was on the ground, and then I</p>

               <p>ran from them and ran indoors, and the men Fisher and Shaunesey followed into my house. I ran upstairs and went to bed, leaving them downstairs. About a quarter of an hour afterwards police came and took me from bed to station. I did not tell the police what I have now said. I have read the above, and it is true. January 25th, 1901.—A. Curtis."—I know Fisher—he collects rags, bones, and bottles—he has been con<lb/>victed—he is medium height, is rather cross-eyed, and about 27 or 28 years of age—he is about the height of prisoner Edward, but much fairer—he is slightly bigger than Albert—I have made inquiries about these two men, and cannot get information.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 5, Malvern Road, Hornsey—till recently I was owner of 15, Lightfoot Road—in May I advertised the property for sale—in reply I received this letter from Newson &amp; Co.—(<hi rend="italic">Dated May 29th, 1900, from 11, Queen Victoria Street, asking for particulars.</hi>)—I sent particulars, and received their letter of May 30th—(<hi rend="italic">Promising to introduce the property to "our applicant," and stipulating for the usual commission.</hi>)—I next got this letter from Newson &amp; Co., stating "We have introduced this property to Mr. W.

               <p>the purchaser—I next went to Mr. Terrell on the Monday, and in consequence of what he told me I went on to Newson &amp; Co.—after waiting, I saw Child—I handed him Mr. Terrell's letter—he read it, and handed it back to me—(<hi rend="italic">This letter stated that his client, Mr. Alfred John Wyatt, had instructed him to act on his behalf in the purchase of this property from G. P. Newson &amp; Co., who wished the deposit paid to them upon signing the contract they had prepared as agents, and asking if he had any objection.</hi>)—Child said Mr. Terrell had been too hasty in writing to me, and that he was writing or had written to me—on the Saturday, September 8th, I got this letter of September 8th from Newson &amp; Co.—(<hi rend="italic">Asking the witness to call on Newson &amp; Co. at 11.30 a.m. on Tuesday.</hi>)—I did not call—on Tuesday night, September 18th, or Wed<lb/>nesday morning, I received this letter from Newson &amp; Co.—(<hi rend="italic">Stating they had sold the property to Mr. W. J. Roberts for ₤565, and asking for name of a solicitor to whom they might forward the contract.</hi>)—on Monday, 17th, I had called at Newson's office by chance, and seen Wyatt, whom I knew as Wyatt for the first time, as the clerk said, "Mr. Newson is not in, but you can see Mr. Wyatt"—I asked Wyatt if anything had been done, and he said, "Haven't you heard? It is all fixed up"—I said, "No, I have heard nothing"—he said, "You had better see Mr. Newson," who was expected—I called three or four times, and waited about all day, but he did not come—I called again on Tuesday, 18th—I told Child that I had called yesterday, and wanted to see him about the house, speaking to him as if he were Newson—he said it was settled—I asked if his client Wyatt had purchased this house—he said "No"—I asked if the deposit had been paid—he said "Yes," it had—I am not certain whether he gave me the purchaser's name—it was a hurried interview—he asked for the name of my solicitor, and I gave him the name of Mr. Gerrish, of College Street—I asked him if the purchaser knew that the house was let, also if he knew there was a mortgage on the property—he said the purchaser knew everything—I told him I should go straight to Mr. Gerrish; then on my return home I got this letter, saying that Mr. W. J. Roberts had purchased it for ₤565—I never received any deposit from Newson &amp; Co.—I have since sold the property.</p>

I am a solicitor, of 9, Old Jewry Chambers—in November last, Wyatt called and said that he had been engaged in the office of Fuller &amp; Fuller auctioneers, but was now associated with Newson &amp; Co. in business as auctioneers; that he had an opportunity of making an advantageous purchase of the shops, 61 to 67, Queen's Road, Walthamstow, for ₤1,800; that he was prepared to pay ₤130, but</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190102040057"/>
               <p>the deposit was ₤180, ₤10 per cent., and he wanted ₤50 to complete the amount of deposit—he gave me particulars of the property, and promised to come again the following day, which he did—he said it was a great bar<lb/>gain, and he should have an opportunity of selling it at a profit—I asked him how he was going to complete the purchase if he was not prepared to pay the deposit—he said if the property was not resold he had other transactions which would produce the necessary funds to complete the purchase; that Newson &amp; Co. were indebted to him, and he offered the amount of that debt as security for the amount of the advance—I agreed to advance him ₤50 on the security of a charge on the contract, and a charge on the debt due from Mr. Newson—it was arranged he should come with Newson, but he came on November 24th, and handed me these two letters, the contract for purchase and, I think, another letter—(<hi rend="italic">These letters were from Newson &amp; Co., 19, Mansion House Chambers, of November 23rd, confirming Wyatt's statements. A third letter was from Wyatt, of 2, Newton Mansions, West, agreeing to pay ₤55 by December 25th for the ₤50 advanced, and authorising the witness to act as his solicitor in the matter. The contract was dated November 16th, and was between Samuel Walter Robinson, of Gwendoline Villa, Albert Road, Hoe Street, Walthamstow, by his agents, Newson &amp; Co., and Albert John Wyatt, for the purchase of 61 to 67, Queen's Road, Walthamstow, for ₤1,800, paying a deposit of ₤180.

This stated</hi>, "As agents for the vendor, we confirm sale and acknowledge receipt of ₤180 as deposit. <hi rend="smallCaps">G. P.

P. Newson &amp; Co.," and crossed it—it now appears endorsed "G. P. Newson &amp; Co., R. H. Barnett, P. P.

I am a builder, of Albert Road, Walthamstow—I was the owner of 61 to 67, odd numbers, Queen's Road, Walthamstow—since this case has been proceeding I have sold them—early in November last I wrote to various auctioneers about them, among them to Newson &amp; Co, from whom I received these letters of November 20th and 26th, in consequence of which I called at 19, Mansion House Chambers, after the second letter—I found the offices were closed—I called several times, but the last time I saw a person there who said that Newson &amp; Co. called for letters in the morning—on December 6th I received this letter from Newson &amp; Co., asking for a reply to theirs of November 16th, stating that they had secured a purchaser for ₤1,800—I had not, to my recollection, received such a letter—I replied, and received this letter of December 10th from them, expressing surprise at my letter of the 7th instant, after the trouble they had taken in the matter, and stating that they had effected a sale and expected the matter to be carried through, and adding, "Those offices are still ours"—that referred to the fact that I said in my letter that I was informed that they only called for letters, and as I had made an appointment I expected them to keep it—Newsons never introduced a purchaser; I never got any profit from them, and I have sold the property since.</p>

Wyatt, Esq., Rutland Gate, Belvedere, Kent"—I wrote to the references, and received A. J. Wyatt's reply, that he had had numerous transactions with Child, and that he felt sure I should find him a responsible tenant—I accepted Child as tenant, and he entered into possession of an office—on the door was put" Newson &amp; Co."—the door was generally locked—in November Wyatt came and wanted to remove the goods—I had seen Wyatt more frequently than Child—I asked for the rent, which was</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 33, Pelham Street, Ken<lb/>sington—I have lived there nearly five years—on August 28th last a woman named Jeanne Giriot called on me—she wanted to know if I wanted a girl to replace my maid—I refused because I was going to France on September 1st; then she asked me if I wanted a girl for a lodger—I said I lived with my old servant, but if she would pay me two guineas a week she could come, and if she was quite respectable, because I did not want a man in my place—she ultimately came as a lodger on, I think, the next night—she said to me, "I have a young friend from the City; he comes once or twice a week"—I said, "While I am absent you can do what you like with your friend"—I gave her permission to bring her friend once or twice a week—on Sunday, September 2nd, three or four nights after she came, I went out about 10 p.m., leaving my old servant, Anna Le Pesant, at home—Giriot was out—I came back about 11.30—I went straight up to my bedroom—I saw Giriot in the passage—Le Pesant opened the door for me—every night I take a glass of milk, which my servant brings upstairs, with a little piece of bread—on this evening my dog was with me, and I put my bread into the milk and gave it to him, but he would not eat it—I tasted the milk; it was very nasty—I did not drink it; I thought it was poisoned—I was very frightened—I shut my door, and put my bed against it—I did not hear anything in the night—I did not sleep at all—about 8 a.m. I opened my curtains; it was light, and I went to bed again, and to sleep, as I was not frightened—I usually have my breakfast about 8.30—at that time I heard somebody trying to open my door very slowly—I said, "What is it?"—a voice said, "It is me, madame, Jeanne, with your breakfast"—generally my old servant brought my breakfast; Jeanne had never brought it before—I got off my bed, and removed it, and opened the door—Jeanne came in with a tray, and set it out for my breakfast—she put the cup on the table; the tea-cup and tea-pot were empty—I sat on my bed and turned my back to the door—I was in my night-dress—Jeanne put my breakfast on the wash<lb/>stand—I said to her, "Give me my cup of tea"—just at that moment my neck was seized, a cloth was put on my head, a handkerchief was put over my mouth, full of chloroform, and I did not</p>

               <p>know any more—I was unconscious for some time—before I became unconscious Jeanne held my legs, and she bit my hand, while the other person put the chloroform over my mouth—I am certain it was chloroform, because five years ago I had an operation, and the doctor gave me chloro<lb/>form. When I first recovered my senses I could not see anybody—I felt very sick—I heard the woman calling "Charles, Charles, she come back"—at that I was frightened; I wanted to go to the window to cry out—I tried to go, but I was seized—I saw the prisoner then for the first time—he took me by the neck and pushed me into an easy chair which was just opposite my window—I had my back to the window, and he had his face to the light—he said he wanted to strangle me—he said in French, "Have you ₤50, or I kill you"—I said, "No"—he said in French, "Where is your jewellery?"—that is all that was said—Jeanne was beside the chair—that was the first time I had ever seen the prisoner, I shall remember him all my life—he then chloroformed me again with a handkerchief; I do not know if it was the same one—he said, "Let us hurry, and get done with it"—I noticed a wart on his hand; I do not remember which one—I showed it to the inspector when the prisoner was arrested—after a time I opened my eyes a second time; that was about 9.30—it was about half an hour before the police came—when I recovered consciousness I found my wardrobe glass broken, and the door had been forced—I had locked it the night before—the door of the next room, where my travelling trunks were, had also been broken open—some boxes, which had been upstairs, had been brought down, and a great number of things in my bedroom had been put into them—I lost a diamond necklace, a diamond bracelet, a pair of earrings, six rings, and other things, worth altogether about ₤350, ₤30 in gold, two French notes, and nearly ₤2 in silver—the money was in my wardrobe—the boxes with my things in were not shut—it looked as if they had been interrupted—Jeanne knew I had the money, because I wanted to go to France on Monday night, and on the Saturday I had gone to fetch the money—when I came to, these people were not in the room—when I opened my eyes I was dazed—I went to the window to cry out, and I saw Jeanne going across the garden—she went out—she was alone—I did not see the prisoner—I have not seen any of my property since—I had two teeth broken—I was ill after it, and had to stay in bed for a month afterwards—I next saw the prisoner on January 3rd, when he was arrested—when I went with the police to have him arrested I recognised him by his voice before he opened the door—when he opened the door he did not speak to me; he went at the inspector.</p>

I went to open the door; there is a little girl at the door. I asked the person who was there, Madame, what she wanted; she said she wanted someone who was not in the house, because I was alone. I answered there was nobody only me. Ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after they rung again three times at the garden gate. The house is walled right round. They cannot get into the garden unless they open the door from the inside. I was going to see who was ringing, and just at that time they opened the front door. Two men threw themselves on me; and I defended myself. I could not understand what they were saying; I kept quiet. They came into my room and punched into me; then they took me to the station. They must certainly make a mistake about the business I am charged with; at that time I was in Rouen. The house this happened at is where some women prostitutes live; a lot of people go into the house; they take me in mistake for another. The photograph that has been found I gave to a prostitute about the end of May or the beginning of June. I cannot understand how that photograph happened to be in that lady's house. Between the time they rang and the time they arrested me I had plenty of time to escape; as I was not guilty I never moved from my house. I have no witnesses here."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Offey Road, Stockwell, and am a solicitor's clerk—from 1887 to 1897 I was one of the managing clerks to Kingsbury &amp; Turner, solicitors, of Brixton—a Trade Protection Society was carried on in the same building, and Messrs. Kingsbury &amp; Turner were solicitors to it—the prisoner Smith was one of the collectors to it up to 1895, and in that way I became acquainted</p>

               <p>with him—he left them and started a business for himself between 1895 and 1897, which was called "The United Kingdom Inquiry and Trade Protection Office," which he carried on at 111, Knatchbull Road, Camberwell, his private house—I went there from time to time, and saw the business being carried on—he was assisted by his son, S. J. H. Smith, who is now about 21 years old—Smith called on me continually for about six months, and suggested that I should leave my employ and become his manager—I said that in my opinion it would require a lot of capital—he said that he had plenty of capital—the negotiations resulted in this document—(<hi rend="italic">Dated December 9th, 1897, by which Smith engaged the witness as manager at a salary of ₤150.</hi>)—this is his signature to it, and this is mine—he took offices at 19, Cheapside, three rooms on the second floor—he had one room, the centre room was the solicitor's room, and the outer one the clerk's—a prospectus was prepared; there was one in use, and it was amended, and the name was changed from "Offices" to "Association"—the solicitor is Mr. F. O. Chinnery; Joseph Smith does not appear—the annual subscription is ₤1 1s.—these were printed and sent out in large quantities—at 19, Cheapside, Smith's son acted as cashier part of the time; he was reading for his examination as a scholar part of his time—this circular letter (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) was drawn up and issued—when Smith was in London I had opened the letters; he was out all day canvassing to collect members, and when he returned in the afternoon he brought in six or eight documents similar to this(<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), and sometimes more—they are the names of persons willing to become subscribers at ₤1 1s.—it was his practice to put on those forms the names and addresses of persons, and this is his writing—when he brought them in in the afternoon he gave them to somebody to enter in the subscribers' ledger—the next step was to send out this notice(<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) for the subscribers to fill in the names and addresses of persons who owed him debts, and if the subscriber did not send anything to collect after six months he was asked for his subscription, and if he took no notice he received notice that if he did not pay by return of post the matter would be placed in the hands of the solicitor, with 1s. 6d. added for expenses—a solicitor's letter was also sent, which was headed "Christopher Cleobury"—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that unless the sum was paid within four days, and 3s. 6d. for charges, legal proceedings would be taken.</hi>)—if the subscriber wrote saying that he was not a member, this printed form was sent to him—(<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had signed a printed contract which they could not cancel, but any business that he gave them should receive their best attention.</hi>)—when I went to the office a number of forms of that sort were in stock in large quan<lb/>tities—I spoke to Smith about them, and said that it was anticipating complaints, and after that printed forms were not used any more, but they were type-written about half a dozen at a time—when Smith went out he took a card like this(<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) with him—he very seldom brought in debts to collect for subscribers—persons very frequently came repudi<lb/>ating their signatures—I sometimes saw them or Smith, and Cleobury saw many of them—about nine clerks were employed, who were occupied in sending out notices and other business—I did not pay the salaries till after four months—I paid Cleobury and Smith,</p>

               <p>junior, and the other clerks weekly—Mr. Smith paid all the solicitor's out-of-pocket expenses—Chinnery was the solicitor when I went, and he remained till July, 1889—Smith said that Chinnery left because they could not agree, as Cleobury insisted on keeping all the money he earned—when he left I inserted an advertisement by Smith's orders, and Cleobury answered—Smith saw him, and said that he had found a solicitor who would come for ₤2 a week, and who would call on me, and I was to say whether in my judgment he was a competent man—Cleobury called on me with Smith; I asked him if it was quite under<lb/>stood that he would come for ₤2 a week; he said, "Yes"—I said that he would have nothing more; that all the costs would go to the Association—I made inquiries as to his character, and he came about August, 1899—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the petty cash book, I find an entry in it of a pay<lb/>ment to Cleobury of ₤2 on July 28th, and that appears several times—here are payments of all kinds in this book, and hearing fees—I received money to pay to the Association, including the solicitor's profit costs—the bank was the City and Midland, Blackfriars branch—I have not seen these books since I left till this moment—I paid out about ₤50 a month—I paid Cleobury till about February, after which Smith said that Mr. Cleobury did not like my paying him, and I was to hand it to him, Smith—on March 5th, 1900, Reg. v. Bice came on in the Bankruptcy Division, and Smith said that he had to make an affidavit at 6 o'clock, and he wanted the book prepared, to show that I was his clerk—Sampson, Cleobury's clerk, was to prepare it—my two years' agreement terminated on November 15th, 1899, after which Smith brought me this letter and asked me to sign it—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that the former agreement having expired, the witness admitted that he had no claim to make, and engaged to remain as clerk at ₤3 a week.</hi>)—I did not agree to sign that—I never received any bonus or commissions—I asked him to give me notice to leave—he gave me the notice, and I left on March 30th—before I left he urged me many times to sign that letter, and I refused—while I was there, and while Cleobury was there, an action was commenced against the late solicitor, Mr. Skinner for the return of some documents and some money payments—this is Mr. Skinner's signature to this affidavit—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated February 8th, 1899, declining to act any further for the Association, in consequence of articles in the newspapers, and the way in which the business was carried on.</hi>)—these five documents(<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) are endorsed by Smith, and Nos. 7, 40, 52, 59, and 61 by Cleobury, and one is written by him—Exhibits 71 and 76 are Cleobury's writing, No. 72 is Smith's—after I left Smith's employ I went to see Mr. Lister, my present employer, whom I have known for 12 years, and entered his employment the next day—I afterwards commenced an action against Smith in the City of London Court, and Mr. Lister acted as my solicitor—when I entered Lister's employ I had to make a statement to him about the association, and prepared an affidavit, of which this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is a fair copy—I do not know what he did with it—I never swore it—this subscribers' ledger is the book in which the names and addresses of persons were entered who were brought in by Smith and other persons, and the amount they agreed to pay, a guinea, with very few exceptions, and if they were not paid a memorandum was made here—the words "<hi rend="italic">Fac-simile</hi> traced" means that a <hi rend="italic">fac-simile</hi> has been sent to a subscriber who has repudiated his subscription.</p>

I was 10 years with Kingsbury &amp; Turner, and Mr. Lister was a fellow-clerk with me nearly all the time, but not in the same department; he was in the canvassing—Kingsbury &amp; Turner were solicitors to a debt collecting agency—the solicitorial work which went to the High Court was in my department; the rest was County Court—it is the usual practice for debt collecting agencies for canvassers to call on tradesmen and merchants to get them to become subscribers, and the business is carried on both by subscription and com<lb/>mission—before I was with Kingsbury &amp; Turner I was solicitor's clerk to Clayton &amp; Son—they had nothing to do with debt collecting—I have been with Mr. Smith eight years now—he never was a clerk to Kingsbury &amp; Turner—I have heard from him that he was clerk to Stubbs &amp; Co. at the Trade Protection Society—as manager I received all the money, and paid it into the bank—I also assisted the solicitor in actions which he had pending to recover debts—I prepared the writs—I did not keep any books at that time—here is a debt collecting book of 1896, before I was with Mr. Smith—this other begins in January, 1898—this shows the names of the debtors, and the amount of the debts, and the charges—if there was litigation there would be solicitor's charges on letters—the majority of the cases were County Court cases—there were about 36 County Court plaints during the six months after I went, and in more than half it was necessary to litigate, but a large number are entered in the subscription book—the next book commences on January 1st, 1900, and continues to November 28th—if Mr. Smith was not there I opened the letters, and if I was not there somebody else would—as Mr. Smith was very much away very much duty devolved upon me—people would come to the office and complain that they were not subscribers, and I sometimes interviewed them—if I had thought there had been anything seriously wrong I should have thrown up my agreement—I always referred the people to Mr. Smith—about five persons went about collecting, but only one at a time, and all the names they brought would appear in these books—subscribers would send the particulars of their debts by post, but canvassers brought in debts with the orders—I saw very little of the people themselves—I thought they were trying to evade their responsi<lb/>bility, but I sometimes thought they might say, "I never did join your society"—I thought so for a long time—I think it was at the end of 1899 that I first came to the conclusion that there was fraud—I think my agreement had come to an end then—I had been trying for months to get something else, and answering advertisements—I did not decide to leave at all—I did not quarrel with Smith, or he with me—I left on friendly terms, but I did not feel very pleased; I can give you the circumstances—10 days or a fortnight after I left I went to Lister's office, and some time afterwards I told Lister about the circumstance of Cleobury, and he wrote letters to Cleobury—I never had any conversation with Smith about the way the work was conducted—while I was in Smith's office I was appointed by a debtor as the trustee of a small estate, and Smith contended that as I ceased to be manager I should cease to be trustee, but that was not the debtor's view nor the view of Mr. Phillips—I had communication with Mr. Phillips after I left, but</p>

               <p>he did not refuse to recognise me—the total amount is not ascertained yet, but ₤20 was the amount in Mr. Smith's hands—I brought an action against Mr. Smith, and Mr. Lister was my solicitor—the money was paid into Court—I am at Mr. Lister's still—I receive ₤2 10s. a week—there is another clerk who receives ₤1—this was in Thavies' Inn—Mr. A. J. H. Smith kept the books and served the process, and assisted in County Court work—his name was always used as secretary—he was usually there—I never thought there was anything wrong during the two years I was there—I found these forms there, and thought it was more likely to bring grist to the mill to have them written, and after that type-writing was used—my objection was that members might object, but I did not think it was a fraud—Mr. Dawson kept the ledger nearly all the time I was there—this is the journal, but it was used as a ledger; it commences at August, 1892, but it soon gets into 1896; there are no entries in 1893; it goes down to 1899—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the cash book—it contains a daily entry of all money received in the office, and another book has the payments—money would be entered from this book into the ledger.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. The money collected for debts was all entered in these collecting books—there would be a sum to go to the customer; that would be entered in this journal—the first case is Cutliff, ₤3 8s. 5d. received, and the balance is ₤1 9s. 11d. after deducting the subscription—when the balance was struck the balance was sent to the customer when there was sufficient money in the bank—there were many complaints, but the customers all got paid ultimately.</p>

The debts collected were sent out when we had the money; there was no particular day—a cheque sent to Mr. Hoptoun for ₤10 or ₤12 is the only cheque I know to be dishonoured; I do not remember the date—it was subsequently paid through the solicitors.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEYCESTER</hi>. I made inquiry about Cleobury's character, and found it perfectly satisfactory—the profit went to the association, and he got ₤2 a week—he had a room of his own, with his clerk—he was away twice a week, attending County Court business—there might be 10 or 12 cases a week at County Courts, but there would not be separate attendances for each—he was engaged a great part of his time in conducting High Court cases on behalf of members of the Association—letters addressed to Cleobury would be opened by me or by Mr. Smith—he had no business to do unless Smith or I gave it to him, unless some of the people were complaining, and then anybody would see them—he advised members if they came—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the first letter Cleobury sent, applying for payment of a subscription alleged to be due—it is partly printed, and the client's name is filled in with pen and ink—the matter was not put before him till after an unsuccessful application had been made, but it sometimes went out without his knowledge, and he objected—they were taken to him in a packet, and all signed at the same time, and sometimes signed for him—I signed for him sometimes; he did not object—I had authority to sign his name—I had no idea that the affidavit I made was to be used in a criminal prosecution—Chinnery received a salary at one time, at another time he took his own costs.</p>

I am manager to Mr. Walter Dracon, a grocer, of Bexhill—he has other branches—in the early part of 1898 Smith called on me and said that he represented a Trade Association, and collected debts—I told him I should have to refer to Mr. Dracon, and refused to attend to him—he said that he would send a prospectus on, and asked me to put Mr. Dracon's name on a piece of paper which he gave me—I did so—he took it from a bundle of papers folded over—I did not agree to make Mr. Dracon a member or subscriber to any association, and I did not know that I was doing so.</p>

I heard of the matter again six or seven months afterwards—Mr. Dracon first suggested to me to give evidence in December, 1900; he had already given evidence—when Smith called I thought he was canvassing for members, and that he would send the prospectus to the address I gave him—I do not think there was any print on it, but it was folded as this is now—it did not occur to me to turn it up, I was extremely busy, and was desirous to get rid of him—it was folded, and I do not know whether it was a blank piece of paper.</p>

Cleobury" (<hi rend="italic">per pro somebody</hi>), and stating that an action would be brought in four days—I instructed my solicitors to defend any action, but no action was taken—in August or September Smith came into my shop in a hurried fashion and said, "I have called for my guinea"—I said, "I am not a member of the association"—he said, "Yes, you are; here is your writing"—I said, "Let me look at it"—he said, "Oh, no, no," but he held it and let me look at it—I said, "It's a very good imitation"—he said, "I must have the money before I go"—I said, "I must refer you to my solicitor"—he said, "I do not acknowledge your solicitor"—I said, "If you don't go I shall call my workmen to put you out of the shop," and he left—I did not pay, and I afterwards got an application for ₤2 2s. and 3s. 6d. and 1s. 6d. for solicitor's costs, as far as I can remember—I tore it up, and took no notice—I have heard nothing since.</p>

I do not wish to act harshly and hurriedly, and you had better look out for something else to do"—on March 20th I commenced an action on behalf of Courtney as his solicitor against Smith, on which Cleobury acted as Smith's solicitor—in the course of that action I served on him a notice to admit certain documents—on April 24th Cleobury attended at my office for the purpose of inspecting the documents—he inspected them in my presence—they were four cuttings from newspapers; the <hi rend="italic">Star</hi> of April 8th, 1899; the <hi rend="italic">City Press</hi> of April 1st, 1899; <hi rend="italic">Truth,</hi> February 22nd, 1900; and Truth, April 5th, 1900—in my presence Cleobury read the cuttings through—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I live at 40, Parr Road, Finsbury Park—I was formerly in the employment of Mr. Chinnery, who was then solicitor to the Association—I remained with him till July, 1899, when he resigned—when he left, Smith asked me to stay on—soon afterwards Cleobury became solicitor; I became his clerk, my salary being paid by Courtney—I sat in Cleobury's room—I left about June last—I recollect the matter of re Price—it was on for hearing about March 5th, 1900—this book (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)was handed to me; I do not remember the date, or who gave it to me—it was blank then—Cleobury told me I was to put his nett costs on one side, and the other costs on the other side, such as salaries, postages, etc.—he told me Courtney's salary was 30s. a week, and he told me to put ₤1 a week for mine—the entries in it, from September 11th, 1899, to April 28th, 1900, are in my writing—after April 28th there are some entries in pencil, and some in ink; they are all in the writing of A. J. H. Smith, the prisoner's son—after April 28th there are eight pages in my writing—I think Smith, jun., made it up, because I neglected to do so—the matter of re Price was settled, and this book was never used—Cleobury's applications for the payment of subscriptions were sent out two or three times a week—some days there would be 40 or 50 sent out; sometimes they were signed by Cleobury, and sometimes per procuration—when Cleobury signed them I believe they were placed on his table, and he signed them one after another—sometimes only a dozen were sent out in a day—I was instructed by Smith to call on Mr. Ward about paying his subscription—he handed me a letter from Mr. Ward, repudiating it—I went and saw Ward—I do not know the date—I took his letter with me and showed it to him; he said it was not his signature on the document—I asked him to write his name down on the same document, so that I could compare them—I said I thought it was something like his signature—I then asked him to band me back the document—he said, "No, I shall keep this"—he did not say why—I did not get the guinea—I went out and returned in a few minutes with my friend, and again asked him to give me back the document, and he handed it to me—I told Cleobury what had taken place—that was last year—Cleobury said he would write to him—I do not know if I saw him write it—this is his signature—the letter is to Ward, and is dated December 28th, 1899—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that Ward's behaviour had been very bad, and that the sooner he paid the subscription which was overdue, the quicker he would get rid of his liability in the matter.</hi>).</p>

I am one of the firm of Cash, Son &amp; Co., chartered accountants, 90, Cannon Street—in pursuance of instructions, I have examined the books found at 19, Cheapside—I found a list of members, showing the date of their joining, with amount of their subscriptions—five books, called registers, containing details of debts placed in the hands of the association for collection, and the amounts collected—also three ledgers showing transactions for members, and amounts received on their accounts; three County Court ledgers containing payments made in respect of summonses issued—roughly, some 500 or 600 summonses were taken out yearly—I also found two cash books, petty cash books and other small books of account—I have drawn up a tabulated statement showing the amounts collected—in 1896 ₤116 odd, 1897 ₤522 odd, 1898 ₤854, 1899 ₤552, and up to November, 1900, ₤402—I found in addition, on going through the registers, considerable amounts paid direct to the mem<lb/>bers in consequence of the applications made to debtors by the association, but the evidence is not sufficiently reliable to fix any figure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I verified, as far as I could, the book from which I took the amounts of the collections paid to members, with the bank pass book, and satisfied myself that they were genuine payments for the last two years—I tested it in the ordinary accountant's way—for the six years I have taken, from 1895 to the end of November, 1900, the total amount of commission earned was ₤458, but that is not the total income.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Smith, in his defence, said on oath, that he had been a traveller in Stubbs' Agency, and afterwards carried on a debt collecting business, and had subscribers in all parts of the country, and that all his transactions appear in his books; that when a member sent debts to collect, he sent to the debtor, and if he did not reply, a final notice was sent, and then a solicitor's letter; that he used to carry the forms of application always folded in the same way, and sent to subscribers, who questioned their liability, a copy of their signature made by his daughter, by placing a blank form against a window in a strong light against the original; that he never repre<lb/>sented those signatures as being the originals; that he never obtained signatures by writing to people and then representing that they had signed the subscription forms; that the papers were not folded so as to hide the print at the top; that he obtained Dracon's, Ward's, Holmes's, and Mortimer's signatures himself, and saw them sign the form; that it was not true that he gave Limby a folded paper, and said that it was for a Trade Directory; and that Cleobury had nothing to do with getting subscriptions.</hi>

I live at Stony Stratford—I have no occupation—about the end of November I received a circular identical with this produced—I read it and believed it—on November 26th I sent to Cunliffe, Mitchell &amp; Co. a certificate for ₤70 10s. Mysore Mining Shares, value ₤400, in my name—they now stand at ₤6—I received this receipt of November 27th, which stated "by way of security for 30 ₤10 shares in the guaranteed railway deal," also on 28th a blank transfer of the shares for my signature, and stating, "We shall under no circumstances dispose of them without written authority; we merely ask you to sign transfer as a formal matter of business"—I signed, and returned to Cunliffe's the transfer—I got no acknowledgment, but on December 11th I wrote to the Mysore Company certain instructions, and again on December 18th, to say they were on no account to transfer the shares without my authority—on Wednesday, December 19th, the prisoner Francis called on me with a man who is not here—in conversation Francis said, "I ought to have introduced my friend to you," but I did not catch the name, or it might have been "He is my lawyer" or "solicitor"—he said his own name was Francis, and that he understood from the secretary of the Mysore Company that I had some reason for not allowing the transfer of those shares—I said, "Yes, I hold Cunliffe &amp; Co.'s letter that they will not use my transfer without my written authority," and I showed Francis the letter—he said he had advanced ₤300 to a Mr. Darby, and he produced the transfer which I had signed, with Darby's name attached to it—this is it, with my signature—the name "Joseph Henry Darby, Oak Lodge, Chiselhurst," underneath my signature, and the seals, have been added since I parted with it, and also the witness's name, "F. Timms, Praed Street, builder"—"J. Smith," the witness to my signature, is my groom—all I said was that I should not allow them to be trans<lb/>ferred until I had gone further into the matter—Francis left—he gave his address as Gloucester Chambers, Bloomsbury—the next morning I came to London—I called at 257, High Holborn, the address on the circular—I found a plate on the door, "Cunliffe, Mitchell &amp; Co."—I went upstairs to an office, which also had those names on the ground</p>

               <p>glass of the door—no one was there, and I could not get admittance, though it was about 11 o'clock, as I had come by the 9.8 train from Wolverton—I went to Bow Street Police-office to make inquiries, and from there to my solicitor, Mr. Chatterton, of Finsbury House, Blomfield Street, City, who gave me advice—I went to Gloucester Chambers, Blooms<lb/>bury—Francis was not at home, and I went home to Stony Stratford—I next got his telegram, regretting that he missed me the previous day, and asking me to meet him at an hotel in Holborn next morning—I then wrote him this letter: "Ouse Bank, Stony Stratford, December 21st, 1900. Sir,—I am sorry it was impossible for me to leave here to-day. Will you assist me in prosecuting the scoundrel who has swindled me? If, on the other hand, you are in the swim, I offer you the following alternative, namely, if you will deposit the shares with the secretary of the company on Wednesday next, I will give orders for him to pay you the sum of ₤100, and will give you my word on the honour of a gentleman that no police prosecution or further inquiries shall be made, if you are in the swim.—Yours faithfully, S. R. Rooke. P.S. Please do not wire, write"—I did that through ignorance of offending society—I had no reply—Francis called again with the same man as before, and I said I was prepared to give ₤100, if he would hand me back my certificate—he said, "It is very hard for me to lose so much money; I cannot afford to lose ₤200"—I said, "Very well, then; assuming you are a gentleman, I am sorry I have been the cause of getting you into this trouble; I shall be willing to advance ₤200 for the certificate, and I will lose ₤200 in consequence"—he said, "I have not the certificate with me"—the gentleman with him said it would be better that the transaction should be done through the brokers—I said I was quite willing, and that I would instruct my brokers, Messrs. Bride, Stockdale &amp; Co., of 571/2, Old Broad Street, to pay ₤200 to his brokers on handing him the certificate and transfer—the other man, always calling him "Doctor," said, "Dr. Francis could not afford to lose his money"—Francis seemed satisfied, and they left—I com<lb/>municated with my solicitors and my brokers—I began an action against Cunliffe, Mitchell &amp; Co. and Francis to prevent their dealing with the certificate, claiming damages and a declaration that the contract was induced by fraud—this is the writ—I asked Francis if he would assist me in prosecuting these men, and give evidence against them—he said he would, but all the evidence he had to give was that he had given ₤300 for my certificate—I have never had my certificate back, nor its value in money.</p>

                  </hi>.

               <p>Mysore Gold Mining Company? They are quoted at 5," and some fraction—I said, "Yes, we can arrange that through our brokers"—he arranged to bring the document that afternoon—he brought this certificate for 70 shares about 3.30 that afternoon, and the transfer from Rooke to Darby, of Oak Lodge, Chislehurst, but with no transferee's name filled in, and it was not stamped—the witness to Mr. Darby's signature on this document is "F. Timms, 58, Praed Street, West, builder"—I said I would ring the brokers up on the telephone, and after doing so I told Francis that my brokers told me it was too late to do anything that day, as the Stock Exchange would be closed before he could get into the City—I then arranged with Francis that he should leave the documents, and that I would forward them to our brokers that night, with instructions to sell sufficient shares, to arrange the amount he required for cash, and to sell the remainder for the account—I explained that it was a special sale, and that he would probably have to pay extra stamp duties, although he was the vendor, as is usual when the purchasing broker has to take them up—I completed the transfer from Darby to Francis, and forwarded the documents as promised—I attested Francis's signature as transferee, and appointed to meet him at my brokers at twelve the next day—I had a telephone message from my broker, and about 1 o'clock Francis called—he said he had seen the broker, but was unable to get the money, as the transfer could not be certified by the company, he not being the registered holder of the shares—that was in accordance with what my broker had telephoned in the morning—he brought back the two transfers and the certificate—he said he very much wanted this ₤200 in connection with some speculation he was interested in with his friend, whose shares I understood these were, and after some pressing on his part and conversa<lb/>tion I gave him ₤100—I believed that Francis's description on the transfers, "3, Venner Road, Sydenham, physician," was correct—on Friday, December 28th, I again saw Francis at my office, when he told me that he had arranged with his friend, who had instructed his brokers to pay the ₤200 against the delivery of the certificate and the transfers—a memorandum had been left for me in the office during my Christmas holiday—I went to my brokers that day, and afterwards saw Francis and told him so, and that they had informed me the instructions to pay the ₤200 had been withdrawn.</p>

I know nothing about it; I simply called for the letters for my client; here is my card," and produced his card: "Mr. Robert G. Porteus, so icitor, 5, Crooked Lane, King William Street"—at Bow Street he produced 21 post-letters—one a large one, two postcards and 34 tele<lb/>grams, all addressed "Cunliffe, Mitchell &amp; Co., 257, High Holborn"—he was taken into Inspector Pugsley's office, where he produced a second card, a duplicate of the first—Pugsley said he would like to ask him how he came in possession of these letters, and why he went to 257, High Holborn—he replied, "I went for a client to get the letters"—the inspector then asked the client's name and address—he replied, "I do not know the client's name, nor address," and afterwards added, "I now say his name is Carton; he has gone by the name of Prowse.

I then went to Mr. Ives' public-house, and again returned to No. 257, and saw the housekeeper; this was after I had given him my name, and, I believe, my address or card. I told the housekeeper I knew nothing about the business, and simply called for the letters, and had a written authority to receive them; it was written in blue pencil"—he was asked if he had the authority about him, and he said, "I think I tore it up"—he then drew attention to these words on an envelope: "The ladies not at business till Thursday at X; take key with them"—he was asked if he wished these words put down on his statement—he replied, "Yes"—it was bring taken in writing—he said, "I was going to leave that for Prowse with his letters"—he was then charged with unlawful possession of these letters—when the charge was read over he said, "It was at Lincoln's Inn Fields, called Whetstone Park, where the place was"—seven of the 110 letters contained cheques amounting to about ₤100; one contained two ₤5 notes—amongst them were Ebden's letters and cheques, also Williams' letter and cheque, and others produced here—on December 5th, at Bow Street, Porteous was in the prisoner's room, when he asked me for a sheet of paper, saying he was going to write—I gave it to him, and as he was going into Court he handed it to me, saying, "Here it is"—it is headed "Wednesday," and begins, "Briefly: I met Mitchell or Prowse on Thursday last"—that would be the 29th—this is the statement: "He informed me he had personally opened a banking account at the London and South-Western, Regent Street, and on sending to pay the second time the manager demurred. Prowse then requested me to see the bank manager as Mitchell's solicitor (this was the first time I heard the name Mitchell, of 257, High Holborn). I asked for a written authority, which he gave me on my own headed paper, setting out my name in full and my occupation. I saw the manager, and he declined to say why he did not wish account opened. I then took the cheques, note and gold to Prowse, and he gave me some more cheques to pay into his account, of the name of Pierre Carton, at the Economic Bank, where I had been in the morning, and arranged with the manager there, whom I told my name, address, and occupation. He asked, 'Are you a solicitor?' I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'The account is open, and you can pay cheques, and they will be all right.' I spoke a few more words, and asked for banker's pass book, but it was not there. The manager and cashier assisted in filling up the paying-in slips"—there is written across it, "Gave receipt in my own name in hit presence"—then, "Friday, met Prowse, and he asked me to call at Holborn office for bis letters. I said, 'Funny! why don't you go yourself? How do you carry on business?' He said, 'There are two clerks there, and I have a commitment warrant out.' I asked, How much for?' He said, '₤60, and if I go I might get collared.' I said, 'I must have a written authority.' He wrote, mentioning my name and occupation therein. He further said, as he had to be west at once, would I pay certain other cheques into the bank? I did so, and late in the afternoon I called at</p>

               <p>High Holborn; in fact, at Mitchell &amp; Co.'s door; saw the housekeeper, and said, after a conversation, I would return. He and I had a drink and a short talk, and I did return, but nobody was in the office, so I went away, saw Prowse, and told him that when I paid cheque in Friday I took his. written authority for a cheque book, which contained my name and occupation, which I left at bank, and I signed the receipt book 'G. R. Porteous.' I handed this to Prowse. When I saw the cheques on Friday I said, 'Why don't you pay the commitment warrant off? He said, 'This is not all profit,' referring to the cheques,' and, besides, I have a lot more debts, and I am going to get you to arrange all at once by calling a meeting of creditors, and making a composition deed,' or words to that effect. Saturday, December 1st, I saw him, and he promised to wire me Monday, which he did at Victoria at three. I asked for the list of <hi rend="italic">'c.'s'</hi> and addresses, which he promised to have ready for me on Monday. He promised to have it ready by 11.30 Tuesday, and he again requested me to call at office at 10.30 on Tuesday, 'Get the letters and meet me at my office at 11.30.' I told him it would be the last time, as he had money, and could settle and do his own work. He agreed. I went there on Tuesday at 10.35, saw the two ladies whom I had never before seen, gave them my written authority, and received letters and wires, got 'bus, collar loose, got off, put collar in order, and, spoken to by sergeant, gave my proper name and address, etc, answered every question at once. Very roughly, the above are the facts, but I was asked to stand up last night to be identified. I instantly walked out singly, and the witness, without a moment's hesitation, said,' That is not the man,' R. G. Porteous"—then there is written across, "Only knew Prowse under these two other names; never had an office with him, or been to any of his offices."</p>
