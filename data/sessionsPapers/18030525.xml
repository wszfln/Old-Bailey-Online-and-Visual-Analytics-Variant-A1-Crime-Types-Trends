On Sunday, about three o'clock, I was going out, and missed the piece of print from the place; I took no further notice till Monday morning, ten o'clock, when all my young men were collected in the shop, I enquired who had taken it from the place, and no one would own it; I went up into the accompting-house, and they were searching to see if they could find it; I described the pattern to them, and in the course of an hour one of them, of the name of Lattey, brought me a piece of print; he is not here; he found it behind some white calico; I enquired who had put it there, and nobody would own it; it was the same piece that I had missed; I gave it to a young man of the name of Bliss, to take it into the accompting-house; I told them I was intimate with Mr. Bond, and they should all be examined the next morning at nine o'clock. I wrote a memorandum, which I asked them to sign, and they all signed it, the prisoner signed it among the rest; I was up stairs at the time he signed; the paper is not here; the prisoner came up stairs, and Bliss with him, and he acknowledged he had taken this remnant of print from behind the shutter on the Saturday evening, and put it where it was found. I went up stairs with Bliss, and searched the prisoner's box; I found a number of articles, which Bliss will give an account of; then we came down into the shop; after that Bliss brought me up a till from the shop, in which was a pocket-book belonging to Beams, containing entries of various articles, five yards, two yards, and so on; I asked the prisoner what this meant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe you and all your servants had made an agreement? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You meant by that agreement to get a confession from the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not give them to understand, that if they would sign the paper, and be the means of discovering it, it would be better for them? - A. I said, they had better confess it. I found a paper in the pocket-book, in consequence of which I got a search-warrant, and went to Mrs. Ross's, in Carnaby-street, Carnaby-market, up three-pair-of-stairs, in company with Jones and Treadway; she lodges in the front room; I found several articles there in a drawer, which she called

               <p>Q.And accounted over to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And had each a separate till? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is impossible for you to say how many things you sell in a day? - A.Impossible.</p>
               <p>Q.If he wanted any articles for his own wear, he had the opportunity of taking them, and accounting to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Then he had as good an opportunity of selling articles to Mrs. Ross as well as any body else? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>ISAAC BLISS sworn. - I am a shopman to Mr. Ovey: After the piece of print was found that Mr. Ovey had been making enquiry about, he begged of me to find out the person who had taken it, if possible. I took the prisoner up stairs to Mr. Ovey, and he demanded the key of his box; we found some Holland shirts, pocket-handkerchiefs, and neckcloths belonging to Mr. Ovey; he came down stairs into the dining-room again; I went up again, and in a corner of the bed-room I found a hat-box belonging to the prisoner; he himself desired me to bring it down; it contained two painted velvets, some small diaper table-cloths, and some printed calico; I have had them ever since (produces them.) Mr. Ovey asked him for the key of his till, which he gave him, and in the till I found a remnant of lawn, a remnant of nankeen, some Bank-notes, and this pocket-book, containing some entries which led to the discovery of Mrs. Ross; there are a great variety of articles put down with the prices.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it the name of Mrs. Ross in it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the articles with the book? - A. No, I did not go to Mrs. Ross's.</p>

               <p>Q. You had all distinct tills? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you distinct rooms? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else sleep in the room where this hat-box was found? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any of these articles before they were found? - A. No.</p>
               <p>EDWARD TREADWAY sworn. - I am a constable: On Tuesday the 19th of April, I went to the apartments of Mrs. Ross, in Carnaby-street; I told her, I had a search-warrant; I saw some bed-furniture; Mr. Ovey said, it was his property; I asked her if she had any more property belonging to Mr. Ovey; she then opened a drawer, and pulled out his bundle of things, saying, she had bought them of the prisoner, Beams, (produces them); there was a drawer under a bureau bedstead, locked; I desired her to open it; she said, she could not find the key; at last I found the key, and opened it; I found in that drawer these articles(producing a large bundle); she begged I would wait till her husband came home; I was then desired by Mr. Jones to go and fetch the husband; I asked for Mr. Ross, and they did not know him by that name; it turned out to be the prisoner, Slorow; he said, he had been married two years to her. I went back, and searched under the bed, where I found this bundle (producing it.)(The property was produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.When you came to the house of Mrs. Ross, you found she was a married woman, and her husband not at home? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She said she bought the things of the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You asked for the keys, and she could not find them, and luckily you found a key that opened them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found him, he acknowledged he was her husband? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You brought him in a coach to the house? - A. Yes; when I found these pantaloons, he said he had them of the prisoner.</p>

            , was above stairs; I immediately went up stairs with Mr. Ovey, where I saw a large quantity of linen goods and silk handkerchiefs in the drawing-room; the prisoner was then present. Having understood the nature of the business from Mr. Ovey below, I put questions to Thomas Beams respecting the silk handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Ovey promised him favour if he confessed, was that while you were there? - A. No; there was a quantity of linen-drapery goods; I said to Mr. Ovey, you had better take the prisoner to the watch-house; as we were going to the watch-house, Mr. Ovey asked him if he had any thing further to say; he said he had, if Mr. Ovey would pardon him; I replied, Mr. Ovey shall enter into no promise whatever. The next day a search-warrant was obtained, and I went with Mr. Ovey, and Treadway, the constable, to Broad-street, Carnaby-market.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any more than Treadway? - A. No, only one circumstance; I sent Treadway for the husband; Mrs. Ross desired I would wait while she put on a bed-gown; by her manner I thought we had not found all the property that was in her apartment. I had no opportunity of communicating my suspicion to Mr. Ovey, but I was determined to watch her. After considerable difficulty she came out of a room on the two-pair of stairs floor, and another woman with her, and locked the door. I went down a few stairs; I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250005"/>not hear the foot of Mrs. Ross following me, but I turned round, and discovered her very busy with a bunch of keys, selecting one, and giving directions to the woman, whispering to her; I then made her understand that I had observed her, and desired her to give me the keys; she refused to deliver them, and on my coming up to her, intending to take the keys, she put her hand behind her; I took the keys from her, after a small resistance, and also the keys of the doors, and went down stairs with her, where Treadway was waiting with a coach and Slorow; I told Treadway what had passed; Ross and Treadway were present; I desired him to make a second search, as I believed the whole of the things were not found.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Treadway.) Did you discover any thing in consequence of the direction of the last witness? - A. Yes, in the middle of the room under the bed.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.(To Ovey.) Have you any partner? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. Several persons have the liberty of selling in your shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you, when you sell things in the shop, cut the name off? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear these articles might not have been sold in the shop? - A. It is impossible to know that.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has this man lived with you? - A.Four years; I always had a good opinion of him to this time; I believe this is his first offence.</p>
               <p>Beams. I leave my defence to my Couniel.</p>
               <p>Slorow did not say any thing in his defence.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.Was any promise made to Thomas Beams to say any thing about them? - A. None.</p>
               <p>EDWARD TREADWAY sworn. - On Tuesday, the 19th of April, I went to the house of Mr. Philpot, in Holborn; Mr. Philpot gave me charge of his servant; Robert Beams. On searching his box, he gave me this silk handkerchief; he said it was his master's property, and that he had had it about a month, or six weeks; that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you make him any promise to induce him to tell you that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Philpot. I know the pattern, there is no mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Q.You don't know that this property belongs to you, but from what the prisoner said? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had such handkerchiefs? - A. Yes, a great many, while he lived with me.</p>
               <p>JOHN JONES sworn. - I saw the handkerchiefs in Mr. Ovey's drawing-room, the prisoner, Thomas Beams, was then present; I questioned him as to the time these handkerchiefs had been in his possession; he replied, two years; I asked him of whom did he receive them; he said, of a Mr. Cook; that he became acquainted with Mr. Cook by accidentally meeting him in the Park - that about a month after such acquaintance commenced, he told him he had a quantity of silk handkerchiefs in pawn for five pounds - that he bought them of Cook for the identical sum for which they were pawned, namely, five pounds; I put the question, how came Mr. Cook to sell you the handkerchiefs in pawn for five pounds, for which he must have paid five pounds and some interest; to that he gave no immediate answer. About one o'clock in the morning, I went with Mr. Ovey to take him to the watch-house; in his way to the watch-house, Thomas Beams requested to go back to Mr. Ovey's house - that he had something further to say respecting the handkerchiefs; on returning to Mr. Ovey's house, he admitted that all that he had before stated was false - that he had the handkerchiefs from his brother, who lived with Mr. Philpot, the corner of Turnstile, Holborn; I went to Mr. Philpot to inform him of the circumstance next morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you present when the prisoner Robert was searched? - A.I went up stairs after the box had been searched, and heard him admit that the handkerchief was Mr. Philpot's.</p>
               <p>Q.Whether, or no, before you heard him admit any thing, any promise was made to him by you, or any one in your presence? - A. No, on the contrary; the moment he said he had something further to state, provided Mr. Ovey would forgive him, I prevented a reply.</p>
               <p>Q. This applies to Thomas; I was asking you what you heard that applied to Robert? - A. I heard nothing that applies to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You saw Robert in the shop before he went up stairs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then say, it would be better for him to confess? - A. I did not.(The handkerchiefs were produced by Treadway, and two of them, which had the marks on them, were identified by Philpot.)</p>

Mr. Philpot and Jones say, that they never held out any promise to me; when I came into the parlour, Mr. Jones said, it was a serious case - that a number of things were found - that it did not signify any thing to deny it- if I expected any favour, the best way was to confess; he said that several times; and when they took me to Bow-street, Mr. Philpot and Jones pressed me very much to confess, and said, it would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250007"/>be best, if I expected any mercy, for many things were very clear against me; when I would confess nothing, he went again in a rage into the Office. After the examination, when my brother and I were committed, we went into the Brown Bear; Jones came and sat down by me, and said, it was a very bad business, if I could make any discoveries, it would be the better for me; I told him I had nothing further to confess; Mr. Philpot came to me, and said, there were two silk handkerchiefs my brother sent into the country; I said, I knew nothing of it, I knew nothing of the concerns of my brother; then Jones and Philpot left us, they pressed us very hard to confess. On the Sunday following, I think it was, Mr. Philpot came to me alone at the New-Prison, Clerkenwell, and said, if you have robbed me to any considerable amount, if you confess it, it shall not operate against you; this he repeated several times then, and at other times.</p>
               <p>Thomas Beams's defence. I have nothing to say in my defence.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Jones.) Is what the prisoner says, true? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Philpot.) Is what the prisoner says, true? - A. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Robert Beams. I used frequently to want goods for friends; Mr. Philpot said I might take any thing I wanted.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Philpot.) Did you suffer him to take goods? - A.The shopmen sometimes want goods for friends, but they are always entered in the accounts.</p>
               <p>Robert Beams called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you feel any thing? - A.No, I did not; I perceived it by its appearing white outside my gown; I had a small red morocco pocket-book, a white cotton handkerchief, seven duplicates, and a register in my pocket; I put them in my pocket when I set out, at nine o'clock, to go to my mother; I went to a pawnbroker's in Whitecross-street, where I had a gown in pawn, to mention it, but it being Saturday night, the shop was very full, and I did not go in; I asked my mother to go on Monday morning, and stop it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.You walked a good distance that evening? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have met a great number of people besides the prisoner? - A. Yes; the duplicates were in my pocket-book; I felt my pocket-book in my pocket at different times, when I put my hand in my pocket to take my handkerchief out; I felt it not above a minute before he overtook me.</p>
               <p>SARAH BOWLER sworn. - I am the mother of the last witness: My daughter was absent from my house but twenty-five minutes, till she returned; she had the duplicates in her pocket-book, I saw her put them in her pocket when she came home on Saturday night, and I went with her to the pawnbroker's, and the shop was so full, we could not get in; I went on Monday morning to stop the gown.</p>
               <p>GEORGE SHEPHERD sworn. - On Saturday, the 23d of April, about ten o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to our shop to redeem a gown for six shillings; knowing that he was not the person that pledged it, I asked him where he got the duplicate; he said he bought it; the gown was brought down to him, he looked at it, and asked me if I would purchase it of him; I told him I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250008"/>could not; there were several women in the shop, he wanted some of them so buy it, and none of them would; he paid me the interest, and had a new ticket in his own name; I gave him a fresh ticker, and he went away; Mrs. Bowler came on Monday morning to stop it, and I told her who had got the duplicate of it; I knew the prisoner before, I believe he deals in ear-rings; his father and mother keep a cloaths shop; I sent Mrs. Bowler to his house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You knew where he lived very well? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The duplicate was in the name of a different person - he transferred it into his own name? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you he had purchased it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Bowler.) What did you do on receiving the information that the prisoner had the duplicate? - A. I went to his house, he was not at home; I did not see him till he was taken up, and was at Worship-street Office; we gave Ray, the officer, charge to seek after him. When he was in custody of the officer, he asked me whether I would make it up, and make my daughter speak soft to what she had said the night before, and he would take her cloaths out of pledge, and pay us for our trouble, and give us any satisfaction we desired, if we did not bring him before the Justice, for if my daughter said that which she said when he was taken, he should be transported; I told him we would take no brlbes, we would speak the truth, and nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was by at the time? - A.Ray, and my daughter.</p>

             sworn. - On the 29th of April, I was at the public-house adjoining the Office, in Worship-street, and the headborough of St. Luke's brought the prisoner there; he begged to speak to me; he went into the back parlour, and asked me if the business could not be settled; he said, the young woman should have all the duplicates, and something besides.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I bought the duplicate of a person on Sunday, and went to the pawnbroker's on Monday morning; I never saw Ray at the Office; I never spoke a word to him; I saw the gown, it was not worth the money; I left it in my own name, intending to fell it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the door shut? - A. I cannot say; I left a little boy in the shop, who was gone for some beer; I saw a man in the shop, and saw him go out; I flew out into the street instantly, and this young man of mine followed him, and never lost fight of him; I cried, stop thief, and he was taken; my young man and I followed him to Sheppard-street, and then I returned; I saw the prisoner after he was taken.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you call out as you pursued him? - A. Yes, stop thief; I followed him into Blenheim-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep your eyes upon him all the time? - A. Yes; I took hold of him by the collar of his coat, and held him till the watchman came and took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q.What o'clock was this? - A.Half past nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say or do any thing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the candles fall from his hand? - A. Yes; I did not stop to pick them up, but pursued him.</p>
               <p>THOMAS COSS sworn. - I am a watchman of St. George's, Hanover-square: On the 26th of April, between nine and ten o'clock, there was a cry of stop thief, just by Union-street; I was close to the prisoner; he threw down the candles, and said, d - n your eyes, there take them; he was running, and they were pursuing him; he ran across Bond-street into Blenheim-street, we pursued him into Blenheim-street; the candles were picked up by the watchman; we took him, and brought him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about these things? - A. No. (The candles were produced.)</p>
               <p>Timberlake. These are my candles; the papers they are in are marked by my shopman with his mark.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Freeman.) Were the candles delivered to you that night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These are the candles he threw away? - A. Yes, I have had them ever since; I have kept them under lock and key; there are 17 lb. the present wholesale price is 3s. 5d. a pound.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Timberlake.) Do you know that they were in your house that night? - A. Yes; I missed them the moment I went into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you take no less, if a person took a large quantity? - A.Taking a great quantity, and paying ready money, might make a penny in the pound difference.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to say, they were in the shop before the prisoner was in the shop? - A. I cannot say I saw them before, but I missed them immediately as I came into the shop; there were 6lb. in a paper, 1 lb. had been sold out of one of them just before.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Freeman.) How many pounds were there in the papers you took up? - A.Two 6 lb. and a 5 lb.</p>

               <p>Q.Was the basket your's? - A. No, the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light at the time? - A. Yes; I saw him with the basket and things in it under the gateway; I saw him go out with it; he hid himself under the gateway; he was gone with the things before I had power to follow him.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was the prisoner did this? - A. I am very sure; I have known him for years.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you see him next? - A. Ten minutes after under the gateway; I suppose he thought I watched him; I went back to call my husband, who was in bed with another man.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you do after this? - A.Came in doors, and went after my business; two days after I found one of his children, and went to his place in Glass-court, Mutton-hill; it was about three o'clock; I found him at home, and desired he would let me have my things, or I would get a constable; he said, his wife bought the frock on the Monday; I had him taken up that afternoon; I saw the lace hanging on the line of the chimney-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250012"/>piece in the prisoner's house when I went in; his child wore the frock on the Sunday afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q.Who was in the house when this happened? - A.Only my husband and

               <p>Q.How did you find the house in the morning? - A.One door was shut, and the other open.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you fastened that door over night? - A. Yes, it was bolted; I think he came in at the window, and unbolted the door to let himself out.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the window fastened? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How could he get in at the window - was it broke? - A.No, it was up when I came down stairs; it was down over night, but not fastened.</p>
               <p>Q.How far was it up when you came down? - A.Half up; there was room for a person to get in.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there any window shutter? - A. No; there were marks of dirt of feet inside the window, and at the door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You told the Justice the house was undergoing a repair? - A. Yes, but it was all fastened up at the time.</p>

               <p>Q.Did the prisoner pass the dog-kennel? - A. Yes; the officer has the cheese, they weigh about five pounds.</p>

               <p>Q.Are you sure it was your property? - A.It had never been off the premises; it was the same sort we had on the premises.(Mr. Morgan produced the cheese.)</p>

               <p>Mr. Morgan. There was a lamp in the shop, I am not certain that it was alight, but there were candles in the shop; it was light enough to see him take it from his bosom.</p>

             Sworn. - I am one of the patrol belonging to Bow-street: On the 23d of February, as I was going through the passage of Lincoln's Inn, the two prisoners ran across from Portugal-street towards Lincoln's Inn; the prisoner, Fry, had this ink-stand, (producing it,) which struck against the upright iron bar going into the passage.</p>
               <p>Q.How far might they be from Mrs. Barrett's house? - A.Not more than thirty or forty yards; some of the things fell off the ink-stand, and they both stooped to pick them up; I laid hold of the ink-stand, and asked Fry what he had got; he said nothing, and immediately let go, and ran away; then White got up, and I laid hold of him, and searched him; I found under his coat these pencils,(producing them;) from there I took him to the watch-house; about half past twelve o'clock, in company with Christopher Jones and Michael Lee, I went to Fry's lodgings, and took him out of bed.</p>

               <p>The prisoner, White, did not say any thing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Fry called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q.Was it in an apparently agitated manner? - A. Yes; I had a stick in my hand, I lifted up my stick, and was going to strike him over the wrist, that he might drop his pistols; seeing me going to strike him, he put his hands in this way, (down by his sides;) I saw two persons in St. James's Place, standing by the end of Cleveland-court; I called, help, upon which he lifted up his right-hand, cocked the pistol, and I turned my back to him.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he present it at you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How near was he to you then? - A.About the distance of a yard; I turned my back, and he fired; I felt a shock on my back as if I was struck; I endeavoured to get out of Cleveland-court to run<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250015"/>into St. James's Place, I fell down; when I was on the ground, he came up to me, and stooped to me, and swore at me, and cocked the pistol, and fired again.</p>
               <p>Q.The other pistol was it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When he fired the second time, your face was fronting to him? - A. Yes, I was on my right side, and looked at him; I received the shot here in my ham; they went through my breeches, through my drawers, and through the upper part of my stocking; and made several marks in my thigh, I believe three or four; upon that a number of people came, hearing the report of the pistols, and secured him, and took the pistols from him; these are the pistols. (Producing them.)</p>
               <p>Q.Were you acquainted with the prisoner before? - A. I had known him four years.</p>
               <p>Q.Had the prisoner, at any time, expressed any displeasure against you? - A. Yes, he had threatened to shoot me twenty times.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know where he was taken to? - A. He was taken to Bow-street immediately.</p>
               <p>Q.You had known this gentleman four years before - what is his situation in life? - A.I was agent for a Miss Ward, who is since married to Colonel-Major St. Paul, and I knew him from the day after she came of age; he had been a long time troublesome to her, insisting that he was in love with her, and because I would not introduce him -</p>
               <p>Q. Had he applied to you to introduce him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.More than once? - A. Yes, repeatedly, and because I refused to introduce him, and to sign certain papers which he sent to me to sign, he expressed his resentment against me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q.You have known the prisoner four years? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.His attachment, I believe, had been long before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.So he had opportunities of seeing the young lady before you knew him? - A. I believe not; only in this way; she lived at her father-in-law's, in Sloane-street; the prisoner had a mother who lived in Sloane-street, with Sir William Bunbury, and Miss Ward visited there.</p>
               <p>Q.You would not introduce him upon his desire? - A. I refused him.</p>
               <p>Q.He wanted you to sign something, and you refused? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon this evening he made his approach to you very much agitated, and came close to you, and presented the pistol, as you have stated? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How close must you have been to him when he fired? - A.About a yard from him.</p>
               <p>Q.What was in the pistol you felt? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.But received no wound? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.The second time he fired, you were probably nearer? - A.Not so near.</p>
               <p>Q.You received what was in that pistol? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.But there was no wound? - A. Nothing to signify.</p>
               <p>Q.Through the whole of this time this young man has been under the insluence of this attachment to the young woman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He never threatened to destroy you upon any score of jealousy? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.What was the nature of the papers that he wanted you to sign? - A. That he was a respectable man, and a proper person to marry Miss Ward; and if I did not sign them, he threatened to destroy me; and he sent me copies of duels, and said that should be my fate. On the 25th of last March, in consequence of a pretended duel he produced to me, I had him up at Bow-street before Mr. Bond, and I informed him I thought I could prosecute him criminally for the threats he had used to me, but did not think it worth while; I told him I thought he was a foolish fellow, and bid him go about his business.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you see the gentleman at the bar on the day that Mr. Townsend was shot at? - A. I saw him in custody.</p>
               <p>Q.What time of the day did you see him first? - A. I believe about half past two, or three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was he when you saw him? - A.He was standing at the post at Lord Carrington's door, in St. James's Place.</p>
               <p>Q.Can you, at that place, see who goes in and out of Cleveland-court? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q.How far is it from Cleveland-court? - A.About twenty yards; I saw him staying there above an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you hear the report of any pistol? - A. I heard the report of a pistol, and ran into Cleveland-court; Mr. Townsend was on the ground then, the prisoner was standing just by him.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see him do any thing? - A. I was just turned the corner when he fired the last pistol off.</p>
               <p>Q.Who did he fire the pistol at? - A. Mr. Townsend; he was lying on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q.After he fired, what happened? - A.My fellow-servant came up, and he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you pick up any thing? - A. Yes, two shots, just by the scraper, about two yards from Mr. Townsend's door.</p>
               <p>Q.How near to where Mr. Townsend lay? - A.About a yard and a half; I have one shot, the other I gave to Miss Townsend, Mr. Townsend's sister.</p>
               <p>Q.Were they loose on the ground, or fixed in the wall? - A.They were fixed in a circle of the ground.</p>

               <p>Q.At what time? - A.About four or five o'clock in the afternoon; I went up, and served some cream and milk, and he was there; I went down Pall-Mall; when I came back, he was there still.</p>
               <p>Q.How long was it before you came back? -- A.About half an hour, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q.When you last saw him, what did he do? - A. I was coming past him a second time, and before he moved, I saw Mr. Townsend come up St. James's Place; with that, he rushed by me, and shoved me off the curb stone.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did he go? - A.He went into Cleveland-court as hard as ever he could run; with that, I heard the report of the first shot, and as I came into the court, the second I saw him fire at Mr. Townsend.</p>

               <p>Q.Immediately did you go out? - A. Yes; I merely saw the prisoner, Grant, standing in the custody of the people who came to the assistance of Mr. Townsend; I walked with Mr. Townsend to Pall-Mall, but being in a bad state of health, and unable to assist him, I returned, and there were shots put into my hand by various people; I did not see them picked up.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I did intend to enter into circumstances particularly between myself and Mr. Townsend, but I have been advised to say but little upon it; it is an affair so the heart, and nothing that can be alledged against me, no, not the verdict of a Jury can affect me so much as the expression of Spencer Townsend as to a declaration of malice; I would wish your Lordship's attention to the circumstances; one of the pistols having struck Mr. Townsend on the back, and not harmed him in the least, and the other pistol that was fired from which he received no harm, I would ask whether the pistols were not presented with the handles to him, and the mouths to myself; whatever I could have thought of Mr. Townsend, I could not wish to take any advantage of him; when I loaded the pistols, I declare before God I did not apprehend any harm could come to either of us; I knew the effect of pistols loaded with swan-shot and powder.</p>

               <p>Q.From your observations of the impression made on his mind, what was your opinion of him? - A.My opinion was, that his mind was not quite right upon the very point which brings him to this unfortunate situation.</p>

               <p>Q.Love? - A.Love upon this subject; though he has discovered a sanity on other pointsd, on that point he has always shewn some degree of insanity; that has been uniformly my opinion.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the account on which you parted with him? - A.That unfitted him for business entirely.</p>
               <p>Q.How long before this moment has this sort of thing struck upon your attention? - A.Four or five years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. He has traded largely on his own account? - A.Afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q.How long has he left you? - A.About three years.</p>
               <p>Q.During which time he has traded as a merchant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You never heard of his being confined as a lunatic? - A.Never.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you mean to say that he did not know the distinction between good and evil? - A.On other points he knew it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that he did not know that it was a criminal act to fire at a person? - A. No.</p>

            , Esq. Sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I live in Water-street; I have known the prisoner from an insant in petticoats.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you known of the unfortunate attachment? - A. Not till within a twelvemonth past, which was since his bankruptcy.</p>
               <p>Q.Whether, prior to that twelvemonths, he was a peaceable, quiet, and harmless man? - A. He was of good conduct, as to his morals and behaviour.</p>
               <p>Q.The last twelve months was his conduct at all altered? - A.After that time, it appeared to be perfectly inconprehensible.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon any particular score that you were made acquainted with? - A. Upon general circumstances, particularly with regard to his bankruptcy, he persevered to the last moment in an opinion contrary to the opinion of all his creditors.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you ever had any conversation with him, or heard any thing from him, respecting this unfortunate attachment? - A.Very lately he has hinted at it; there appeared to me some cause of mental derangement, but from what cause I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not his conduct appear compleatly contrary-to what it used to be? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. He differed from his creditors about his bankruptcy, and wanted to go on longer? - A.He wanted to go on a deed of trust, and not to be a bankrupt.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not hear that he wanted to go on, in expectation of marrying a woman of fortune? - A. I did not hear that.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you consider his wanting to go on under a deed of trust, in oppostion to his creditors, as a mark of insanity? - A.I did.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you think he was incapable of knowing good and evil? - A.His conduct was so extraordinary that I slighted him, and have known but little of him this last twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q.How often have you seen him this last twelvemonth - have you seen him half a dozen times? - A. I may have seen him half a dozen times, but I have not conversed much with him.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you venture to say, that a man you have not seen above half a dozen times in a twelvemonth, is incapable of knowing good from evil? - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>JOHN GARDINER Sworn. - I have known the prisoner three or four years.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you an opportunity of knowing that he was pursuing an hopeless attachment to a young lady? - A. Not till within this twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you occasion to speak to him on the subject since you knew of the attachment? - A.His conduct has been such as consirmed my opinion, which I all along entertained, that he is deranged, that his mind is not right.</p>
               <p>Q.You are of opinion that he has been deranged down to what time? - A. I have thought his conduct, previous to the information he gave me of this affair, extremely strange and incoherent; he has for some time previous to this affair visited at my house, and as well as I can recollect, about a twelvemonth ago, he called upon me one evening very late, I believe about twelve o'clock; on that evening, to the best of my recollection, he related to me this affair, previously pulling out some papers from his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q.Was your observation of his conduct from that time such as convinced you he was deranged? - A.Those papers were a gross attack, a gross libel, on Mr. Townsend, which he meant to publish in all the papers.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you think, upon your oath, that he has been for some time deranged? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250018"/>Mr. Knowlys. Q. He shewed you some papers that were a libel on Mr. Townsend? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You advised him not to publish them? - A. Yes, as it would subject him to punishment.</p>
               <p>Q.You were a creditor of his? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had dealings with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him lately? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he is incapable of knowing good and evil? - A.From the circumstances I must think so; I have refused to trust him any more, not thinking him right in his mind.</p>
               <p>Q. He wished to have a deed of trust instead of being a bankrupt, on the expectation of marrying a lady of fortune? - A. I don't know that.</p>

            . - I have known the prisoner three or four years, and a more harmless, more inoffensive man, and more unlikely to commit the outrang that has brought him here, is not within the circle of my acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you ever any conversation with him on the subject of the attachment we have been speaking of? - A.Frequently.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he appear to you, in those conversations you had with him, to be in his found mind? - A. In every conversation I had with him on that subject, I thought him bewildered.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you take him to have a rational mind on that subject? - A.Perfectly irrational.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.Do you believe him to know the difference between good and evil? - A.Perhaps he may, except in the question of this unfortunate attachment; certainly it is not the same in any topic not connected with that circumstance.</p>

             Sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I have known the prisoner from his infancy.</p>
               <p>Q.Within these last four years? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you know of this unfortunate attachment? - A. I spoke to him of it about two years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his conduct in respect to that attachment? - A. It was extremely absurd and irrational in every degree.</p>
               <p>Q.Did his conduct lead you to conceive he was deranged? - A. On that subject I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Simmons. Q.You don't remember his telling you that this woman was a person of a great fortune? - A. No, I think the affair rather an affair of love than fortune.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL MILLER Sworn. - I know the prisoner; I think I became acquainted with him in the end of the year 1799.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had conversations with the prisoner, or has he told you of this unfortunate attachment? - A. He gave me information of it after his affairs became deranged.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your observation of his conduct, was it the conduct of a man having the possession of his mind? - A. I am a principal creditor; he wished to have a trust deed; I was strongly for a commission of bankruptcy.</p>
               <p>Q.Whether as applied to this subject of the attachment, did you believe him to be an irrational agent? - A.He was not rational upon that subject.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you had many conversations with him upon that subject? - A. A good many.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you form your opinion from those conversations? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.You were his principal creditor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What did he owe you? - A.Six hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q.Is it very frequent for persons to with to act under a deed of trust? - A. I suppose it is.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he want this in expectation of marrying a lady of fortune? - A.He never stated that.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he ever describe the person to you? - A. Yes, as the daughter of the late Lord Ward.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he state her to be a young woman of fortune? - A. I understood her to be a person of fortune.</p>
               <p>Q.You have not seen him much since his bankruptcy? - A. I have seen him more since than before.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you conceive him conscious of moral good and evil? - A. I think he was, except when this subject came across his mind, he was quite wild.</p>
               <p>JESSE GREGSON Sworn. - Q.I believe you were solicitor to this gentleman upon his affairs being deranged? - A. Yes, I was called in to settle his affairs; the first interview I ever had with him in my life, he mentioned this young lady; I had conversed with him before on his general concerns, upon which he talked as rationally as any othere man could do; but when he touched on the subject in question, he was wholly unmanned, quite irrational, and cried like a child, and talked in so incoherent, so inconsistent a style, that it excited the observation of a gentleman with me, that he was not right in his mind, that he was certainly a madman; I had occasion to converse with him a number of times on his general affairs and his attachment to this lady; he talked quite consistent on his general affairs, but on that subject he was invariably incoherent.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination. - Q.Do you mean to say, that such was the deranged state of his mind, that he was incapable of knowing good or evil? - A.Upon my oath, I should doubt very much whether at times he was capable of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he was so deraged, as not to feel that it was a dreadful crime to fire at a fellowcreature? - A.I think his mind was so distracted, as not to know what he was doing, and that he might fire at Mr. Townsend without knowing whether he was doing right or wrong, or even fire at myself, or any body else, when his mind was on that sub<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250019"/>ject; I conceive he was entirely incapable of knowing what he did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.How long is it since you made that observation? - A.The first time I ever saw him; that is about a twelvemonth ago, and it has been invariably so.</p>
               <p>Q.How many times have you seen him since? - A. A great number of times.</p>

               <p>Second Count. A round blank of base metal of the size of a shilling, feloniously and traiterously did colour.(The case was opened by Mr. Fielding.)</p>
               <p>JAMES TRAKLEY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you know the man at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How long have you known him? - A. About two months before he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you first become acquainted with him? - A.At a public-house in Long-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of your acquaintance, did he apply to you for any loan of money? - A. Yes, about a fortnight before he was taken up, he came with another man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he state for what that loan of money was wanted? - A. Yes, they told me they were going to Cox's, the resiner's, in Little Britain, to buy gold and silver.</p>
               <p>Q.Did they tell you for what purpose they wanted that gold and silver? - A. To make half guineas and guineas of; I went with them to Cox's to the door; Bryan told me, I had better give the other man the money, and he would go in and buy it.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he give you a reason why the other man was to go in? - A.He said, he did not like to go in, because he was so well known there for having bought so much silver; the man went in, and stopped about a quarter of an hour, and then came out again with some stuff in a paper, some silver and gold as he called it.</p>
               <p>Q.While the other man was gone in, had Bryan and you any conversation? - A.He said, he would be answerable for the money, as there was nothing but gold and silver sold there; he came out again, and we went to a public-house, and he gave me this stuff, which he told me cost more money than what he had of me a great deal.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you any further conversation about money? - A.Bryan and the other man told me they would come the next night to my house; Bryan came, but the other did not; Bryan's wife came with him.</p>

             sworn. - I am one of the officers of Bow-street: In consequence of an information I received on the 13th of April, I went with a search-warrant to No. 132, St. John-street, Smithfield; I went up two-pair-of-stairs; I knocked at the door.</p>
               <p>Q.The front room? - A.The front room; the prisoner, Bryan, came to the door in his shirt.</p>
               <p>Q.What time of the morning was it? - A.Between seven and eight; he opened the door, and let me in; I and my brother officers, Passmore and Lewis, went in; I told him I had come with an aukward circumstance; that I had a search warrant against his apartment; he said, I was very welcome to search; when I went into the room I saw a great quantity of half crowns, some shillings and sixpences, and some gold on the table; the gold and silver were all on the table mixed together.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that good money you found on the table? - A. It was all good but one shilling and two sixpences; on searching about we found some implements, some stamps that answer the marks upon these shillings I have got, and some vitriol, and other ingredients for coining. On searching the prisoner I found six had shillings in his right-hand breeches pocket; Mrs. Bryan taking up her pockets from the head of the bed, I caught hold of the pockets, and took them out of her hand, and found five bad shillings in her pocket; there was a half crown and a sixpence very good; I secured them; this is the money I found on the man, and this on the woman. (The things were all produced.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. She was found in bed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.The husband was found in bed? -</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q.You made a mistake I believe; you said you searched the man, he was naked? - A. He had put his small clothes on before I searched him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250021"/>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you find any aqua fortis? - A. I found some vitriol.</p>
               <p>Q. Vitriol is a distinct thing from aqua fortis? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found no aqua fortis? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any files? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have often searched such places? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You always found files? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not files necessary in this business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not aqua fortis necessary? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you find any press? - A. No; there was a little hand vyse.</p>
               <p>Q. You found no crucible? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.Whether vitriol or aqua fortis, that was the thing you found? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>EVAN LEWIS sworn. - I went to this house; I found this liquid, a pair of plyers, three stamps, with letters upon them, A D, a P, and an A; I found some papers, containing something, I imagine to be gold dust; another paper with some other metal in it not of the same colour; I found some clippings of some kind of metal, and something like filings of metal; some scowering-paper, some part of which seems to have been used; a piece of cork that appears to have been used, and these two bottles, and some blacking I found.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you find all the things that are there? - A. Passmore and I found them, and put them in. Here is a piece of paper I found in his pocketbook (the paper read), eight ounces of silver, at 5s. 8d. per ounce, 2l. 5s. 4d. eight blank copper at 3l. 2s. mill seventeen ounces at 11/2d. 2s. 11/2d. cuttings at 2s. 3d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What is that you call blacking? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Shew it me - is it not liquorice? - A. Yes, for ought I know; here is a piece that is not liquorice.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any doubt that this is a piece of liquorice? - A. I have not tried it; here is a little bit of blacking that is not liquorice.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you ever been at the apprehension of a person for colouring silver before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Scowering-paper is used in cleaning irons? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you been in the army? - A. Yes; I gave evidence on Governor Wall's trial.</p>
               <p>- POWELL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. - I am clerk to the Solicitor for the Mint.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you seen the things that are produced? - A. Yes, they are such as are used by persons who counterfeit the coin.</p>
               <p>Q.Will that liquid, if there is a particle of silver in the metal to which it is applied, produce the silver on the outside of the metal? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that by actual experiment which you yourself have made? - A. Yes, out of this very liquid I made the experiment; the officer, Blackman, delivered to me one of the counterfeit shillings, which was then finished fit for circulation, and found on John Bryan. In order to satisfy myself that the aqua fortis would produce the effect on this particular blank, I took all the silver from it entirely, and reduced it to the same state it had originally been in as a base metal blank; I had some of the liquid out of the bottle delivered to me by the same officer; I then applied such materials as are found, by robbing it with the sand-paper and the cork; I then made use of the aqua fortis; I put the aqua fortis into a cup, but knowing it would be too strong of itself, I lowered it by adding a little water, which is always done when it is used; I then put the blank in, and it produced the colour of silver.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you had taken all the silver from it? - A. Yes, all the silver on the outside.</p>
               <p>Q. It produced what? - A. The colour of silver again.</p>
               <p>Q. You had only taken the silver from the surface, but there was silver in it? - A.Certainly; it was a composition of base metal and silver.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you destroy the colour of silver? - A. By taking it off compleatly with the sandpaper.</p>
               <p>Q.Rubbing with sand-paper made it rub off? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you make it smooth again? - A. By rubbing it with cork.</p>
               <p>Q.Then putting it into the liquor produced the colour of silver again? - A. Yes; at first when I took it out it was black, and it was necessary to clean it with salt; there is salt among the things found coming out of the pickle; it has a blackish appearance, and rubbing it with salt cleans it.</p>
               <p>Q. That was found on John Bryan? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When cleaned with salt it appears very clean indeed, and glaringly white? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing there that reduces that glaring white? - A. No; here is a pair of plyers; these may be used in holding the blank while the operation is performed of rubbing it with the sandpaper and cork, which is preparative to its being coloured; here is sand-paper, which is of a peculiar sort used by those who counterfeit the coin; part appears to have been used, the other not.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a piece of blacking, what is the use of that? - A. I don't think that is used in that case; it is very dry, it has been kept a long while, I cannot form an opinion of it; here is a piece of cork that appears to have been used a long while; here is the salt I mentioned; here is the liquid that produced the colour; here are some stamps used by persons in coining; there are the letters D P A upon them; these sort of marks are often<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250022"/>put by persons on good money, which gives a kind of credit to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the money found on the man, is any of that money marked with either of those stamps? - A. Here is one with D and P (compares them); the D corresponds and the P corresponds. I am now looking at what was found on the woman; here is one piece with a P, which corresponds with the stamp; here is another with an A and a D, found upon the woman.</p>

               <p>Q.The pieces of coin found upon the man and the woman, do they all appear to be coloured blanks? - A. Those found on the woman are coloured blanks.</p>
               <p>Q.Do they appear ever to have been in circulation? - A.They do not appear to have been in circulation; here are four in particular I think have not been in circulation; they are coloured blanks.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you see among the things found sufficient for a person possessing blanks, to produce the colour of silver, and make them appear good shillings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Aqua fortis is obliged to be lowered with water? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing found in the room capable of producing the effect without alteration? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a single shilling that was found on the man fit for circulation? - A.These four in my opinion have not been in circulation, and they looked much better when I first saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they found on the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you mean to swear, that there is one shilling among those found on the prisoner, which would deceive a cautious person? - A. I conceive those four I have produced I could pass very well.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Knowlys, I think you should select one shilling.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Shew any one to the Jury compleat, and fit for circulation.</p>
               <p>Court. In a case of this sort it cannot be necessary for the prosecutor to say which shilling is coloured.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL MENSELLING sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am one of the Moniers of his Majesty's Mint.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at that shilling, is it a good shilling or not? - A. It is not; it is base metal coloured.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Do you mean to say, that that appears like a shilling by any outward application, or is it internally white? - A. I cannot say; it is base metal coloured.</p>

               <p>Q. What trade are you? - A. A gun-maker; I repaired it, and offered it for sale to more than one or two, and could get no more than a guinea and an half offered for it; wanting some money, I afterwards pledged it; I went and informed him, I could get but a guinea and an half for it; he said, that would do very well; I was to be paid for the repairs, which was full the half of it, and we were to divide the money; I paid him 12s. in part of 15s. 9d. I went home, and took the gun to the pawnbroker's, and pawned it for two pounds; I did not see Freake for two days after; he then asked me when I would pay him the overplus money.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you tell him you pawned it for two pounds? - A.No; I told him I would give it him in a few days; I saw him two days after, and he asked me for it; I told him I had not it about me.</p>

               <p>Q. You saw him two days after, and was honest enough to tell him you had received two pounds for it? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What repairs did you do? - A.There was a new lock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you scratch the maker's name off? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q.You have no doubt it went at the time you felt it go? - A. I did not feel the pocket-book go; I felt a person at my breeches-pocket, not at my coat-pocket.</p>

             sworn. - I live at Islington, I follow no profession at present; I received that bill from the prisoner on Tuesday, the 10th of May; the prisoner asked me to discount it.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the amount of it? - A. Thirteen pounds; I told him I would give him an answer on Thursday morning; I came to the Britannia, in Little-Britain, to meet him, I had seen him there a number of times before. On the Thursday evening, I told him I had enquired of Mr. Harris, whether it was his acceptance; I told him, Mr. Harris knew me very well, and said, it was his acceptance, but that the gentleman that had it, had been robbed of it, with much more property, and I told him it would be necessary for him to go with me to Mr. Stebbing, to have the matter explained; he said, to be sure, but that he was particularly engaged that morning, but I might depend upon his going with me the next morning; he came the next morning, and waited half an hour for me, and left word he would come again in a quarter of an hour; he came, and went with me to Mr. Stebbing's; I told Mr. Stebbing I had brought Mr. Davis to answer for himself, and we walked immediately to Bow-street; there he was committed for further examination; he lived in West-street, West Smithfield, with his father, a leather-seller.</p>

               <p>Q. You would hardly discount a bill for a man without you had a good opinion of him? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand a mode of getting a livelihood, is getting bills discounted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You would not discount it without his indorsing it? - A.No, I should not.</p>

In Dartmouth-street, Westminster, I belong to the Twopenny Post-office; I have known the prisoner since the 5th or 6th of April. In consequence of a suspicion I entertained, I gave information at Bow-street, and on the 3d of May I went with Pasmore and Lewis, two officers, to the <placeName id="t18030525-27-crimeloc152">Red Lion public-house, in Davies-street, Berkeley-square</placeName>

In consequence of some information, we went to another public-house, the George, close by; I went first into the parlour; in the course of a little time, the prisoner came in, followed by Lewis; Pasmore, I believe, was in the tap-room; the prisoner sat down in the same box with me, and in the course of a little time, he asked me how many I wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told him you wanted any thing? - A. Yes; his appointment was to meet him that day at another public-house; the price was fixed before; I was to have twelve bad shillings for six good ones; he told me he had but ten; he put them down on the table, and I gave him five marked shillings; I put the ten into my left hand waistcoat-pocket, he put the five marked shillings in his pocket; he had his hand in his pocket for a minute or two; as soon as he pulled his hand from his pocket, I gave the signal to the officer, and Lewis came up and seized the prisoner; Lewis rung the bell, and Pasmore came in, and he was secured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How long have you been in the Twopenny Post-office? - A. About a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were not in the Twopenny Postoffice at the time of this transaction? - A. No; I kept a chandler's shop in East-lane, Lambeth, till the 25th of March, and then I tried to get into the Post-office.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other business between the 25th of March, and your getting into the Post-office? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you had no other sort of dealing with the prisoner at this time, but for bad money? - A. No other.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you did not pay money to the prisoner in advance towards the purchase of a pair of breeches? - A. No, nothing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner is a person dealing in cloaths? - A. He had a bag with some cloaths in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say positively, you had no dealing with him but for base coin? - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. You had an anxiety to bring a man to justice who was dealing in this manner? - A. Yes, I had indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. And that anxiety led you into Newgate to visit him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went there from that anxiety to bring this man to justice? - A. A person called upon me, and said, he wished to hear his proposals, and I said, I had no objection.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.Do you know the name of the man who called upon you? - A. I understand his name is Howell.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you first desired by the officer to lay the information? - A. No; I wrote a letter myself to Justice Bond, in consequence of conversation with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What communication had you with the prisoner before this? - A. I had purchased some bad shillings of him before.</p>

I asked the prisoner, in Mrs. Whitney's room, how he could think of committing such a depredation, a respectable young man like him, and he said, he did not do it.</p>

               <p>Murrils. Here is the bill of it.</p>
               <p>Cumming. It corresponds with the book.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that Dymock was a man of bad character, and refused to attend at the Office, on account of his being known there.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Dymock.) Did you refuse to attend at the Office? - A. Yes, because I was very busy that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever at the Office before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Hancock. I don't know Dymock; I do not believe he is known at the Office.</p>
               <p>Murrils. I have known him twelve years; he likes a drop of beer; I don't know any thing else against him. <rs id="t18030525-32-verdict181" type="verdictDescription">

             sworn. - On the 20th of May, about three o'clock, I went with Rudd for some grains; we were both carters to Mr. Cloment, a cow-farmer; we got the grains from Mr. Charrington's brewhouse, at Mile End; we stopped at the bottom of the lane; Mr. Willis's house is at the corner of the lane; I was going up the lane, and Mr. Willis's gates were open; it was then past nine o'clock; Rudd was behind me, and as I was going past Mr. Willis's gates, they threw a basket up; I cannot say who it was; there was Mr. Willis and another man.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the prisoner? - A. I cannot say whether he is the man or not, I was in liquor, but I am almost certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before? - A. I had seen him once before with Rudd, behind the cart; they called to me to stop, and they asked me for a few grains, and I gave them two or three shovels full, and Mr. Willis gave us sixpence a-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark at that time? - A. No, it was day-light; that is the gentleman, (pointing to the prisoner, Willis.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any money pass? - A. Yes, there was some money passed; as I was getting out of the cart, Mr. Willis holloaed out there were two shillings, and Rudd took the money from Mr. Willis's hands; Rudd gave me one shilling; I asked him what it was for, he gave me no answer, but laughed at me; he afterwards said it was for some grains.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You were not quite sober? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What ale-house had you been at? - A. None; we had some beer at the brewhouse.</p>
               <p>Q.When your master asked you if you had sold any grains, you told him, no? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master thought you ought to have given it him, instead of putting it in your own pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought it was better, when you were taken up, to be a witness than a prisoner? - A. The whole was laid upon me at first, till Mr. Willis told the right of it; he said it was not me that had the money.</p>

               <p>Mr. Clement. Mr. Willis came to my house on the Saturday, the day after we had seen the grains on his premises, and said he was very sorry for what he had done, in buying the grains of the man; I asked him what quantity he had, and he said six baskets that night, and some one or two nights before; he asked me if I could settle the difference between the officers and him, and I told him I could not, the law must take its course; I was very short upon the business; I was not in his company above five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Willis? - A. He has some birth in the Bank, and lets out horses and chaises; Mr. Willis went to the Magistrates, and they would not grant a warrant; the Magistrate said, Mr. Willis had been there, and settled the business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. I believe he came and told you of the transaction between him and your men? - A. He told me part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you he thought he was doing right? - A. Yes, he said he thought the man belonged to the waggon.</p>
               <p>Q.When was that? - A. At the time he came to my house, the next day.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How many horses were there to the waggon? - A. Four, I think; I told him they did not look like masters of waggons or carts either.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your name upon the waggon? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What did he say then? - A. He said he had done wrong; he was very sorry for it.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did he say that? - A. After I had told him I should punish him.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Worship-street; I went to Mr. Willis's with the prosecutor; he was not at home; I saw the grains in a little room parted off from the stable; we told Mrs. Willis we would call again; there was no refusal of a warrant, only he came late at night; he had a warrant to apprehend his person on Monday.</p>

               <p>The prisoner, Willis, put in a written defence, which was read as follows:</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, I have for some time past, for amusement when at home, kept a few rabbits, and some pigs, and have been in the habit of purchasing grains for them of Mr. Lee, a cow-keeper in my neighbourhood, till a week previous to this transaction, when Mr. Lee was without grains; I made enquiries to get them elsewhere, and I therefore acknowledge, without hesitation, that upon the prosecutor's men calling at my house to know if I wanted any grains, I bought those in question, under an idea that they had power to sell them; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250034"/>gave them the same price I had always paid Mr. Lee, and which I thought was the full value.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, The moment I was informed that some of the officers belonging to Worship-street had been searching my house, I went and informed the Magistrate who I was, and every particular respecting the transaction; and that, if there was any charge against me, I was anxious to meet it, and explain my conduct, that not the slightest suspicion might attach upon my character; but the Magistrate said there was nothing against me, and I went home perfectly satisfied that I should hear no more of it; a few days after I was, to my great astonishment, taken from my own house by a warrant, and in a few hours afterwards examined, and committed as a felon.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, 
               <persName id="t18030525-38-person300">Till</persName>
             this unfortunate occurrence, I have not had the smallest imputation; on the contrary, I have been nearly eight years in a confidential situation in the Bank, and, as I shall prove by gentlemen of the greatest respectability, have always borne the character of an honest man; independent of the heavy punishment which the law has provided to deter from the commission of this crime, my situation in life puts me far above the imputation of so mean and contemptible, as well as guilty an act, as that with which I am charged.(For the prisoner, Willis.)</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250036"/>Q. Had he intimated an intention to leave your service? - A. He had not; on the 25th I got a search-warrant to search his lodgings; I attended Macmanus to Gray's-Inn-lane; the prisoner was at home; Macmanus entered first, and told him his business, and asked him if he had any property of mine; he said, he had none; upon the execution of the warrant there was found, in my presence, these six towels, a second volume of the Age of Louis XV. the Art of Swimming, a blank book, another book, which was blank till he wrote in it, a manuscript book, an account of costs, two cut glass bottles, a silver hook, they call it an Alderman's hook, and a bottle label; I cannot swear to any of them positively, except the manuscript, the towels, the silver hook, the second volume of the Age of Louis XV. and the Art of Swimming; I believe the rest to be my property; the prisoner admitted the towels were mine, but not the rest of the things.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the towels? - A. A shilling a-piece.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. With respect to the manuscript book, was he not permitted to glean from your Office all the information he could? - A. He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that it is customary, on all occasions, for a clerk to take copies of the precedents of his master? - A. Regular clerks, not an hired clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not that a manuscript of costs? - A. Yes, it was in the state it is now when I lost it.</p>
               <p>Q. As to any individual in the world out of the profession, is it worth two-pence to any man in the world? - A. It is an account of costs for fifty or sixty years back.</p>
               <p>Q.Except for your own information, it is of no value? - A. I should suppose there are people would be glad to have it.</p>
               <p>Q. That might be taken for the purpose of copying only without your consent - the towels have no mark upon them? - A. I can swear to them from their complexion, make, and his confession.</p>
               <p>Q. He had the care of your towels after his marriage? - A. Not generally after his marriage.</p>
               <p>Q. He had the care of them, and used to give them out to wash? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you that he took them home to his wife to wash? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q.There is a book, an odd volume of Louis XV. an amusing story he might take away for his amusement, it is worth nothing as an odd volume? - A. No, I suppose not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. He could not improve in his profession by the towels? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He could not improve his knowledge by the hook? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were the things loose? - A. The towels were found in a paper, the books in his book-case, the other articles in his drawer.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you expect him to leave the chambers? - A. No, he left the door wide open; I, seeing the door open, went in; I saw him the night after; he called at the lodge-room, and said, dame, how are you? I said, when you went away, you left the door wide open, and the things were gone; he said, I did not know I left the door open; that was funny indeed; that was all that passed between us.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, as to the articles of plate and bottles, I know nothing of them; the manuscript books were taken home to copy for my instruction, with intention to return them; the towels were taken home by me for no other purpose than to be marked; it not being convenient for my wife to do it just then, I placed them in the book-case.</p>

To the care of Chubby and another boy; they came to Smithfield that night; between twelve and one I found five of them missing when I came to draw them, that is, to separate every man's sheep by themselves; they belonged to three different people.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this, did you make any enquiry of persons of the names of Boyle and Butler? - A. Yes, and they took to the house of the prisoner; I went to the prisoner's house between ten and eleven on Monday morning, with two officers of the Police; we found five sheep dead.</p>
               <p>Q. The carcases of five sheep? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What part of the house were they in? - A.Just as you go in on the right hand; he is a butcher.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they bear the appearance of having been recently killed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the skins? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the heads on or taken off? - A.Taken off; we found the heads underneath an armedchair in the same shop, facing the carcases.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you able to say from the appearance of the carcases, or the heads, whether they correspond with the five you lost? - A. They were like the five I lost.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you speak from? - A. The heads.</p>
               <p>Q.Had the heads any marks upon them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the heads the heads of sheep of different sorts? - A. Yes, two or three different sorts.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the appearances such as to induce you to believe they were the same sheep? - A. Yes; I cannot undertake to say they were.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The skins were not off the heads? No, not all off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You cannot positively swear they were the sheep? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.If you had seen other heads of sheep with marks on them, you might have thought them the sheep? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see the heads immediately on entering the room under the chair? - A. No, the patrol pulled them out.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been in custody yourself for this? - A. Yes, a week.</p>
               <p>Q. We have heard of a boy of the name of Chubby, where is he? - A. He is gone off.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the circumstance excite your suspicion? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When the drove went away, did you look into the prisoner's house? - A. Yes, throught the holes in the window-shutter, I saw the prisoner at work killing sheep; he had a jacket and blue apron on.</p>
               <p>Q.How many did you see him kill? - A.

               <p>Q. Did the watchman, Butler, watch with you? - A. No; he looked in at the side of the passage. I saw the prisoner go out rather before five in the morning; he had a bundle under his right arm, covered with a blue apron; he went up Cow-cross with it, towards Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you with the officers when they searched his house? - A. Yes; the prisoner was not at home then.</p>

             sworn. - I am a Police officer belonging to Hatton-garden: On the morning of the 25th of April, I searched the prisoner's house; I found, in a dark part of the shop, parted off from the front of the house, (one side is parted off, and kept dark, and the other is open,) five carcasses and five heads, under a chair; the liver, hearts, and plucks, were hung behind the door of the partitioned room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, on the same day, apprehend the prisoner? - A. I did; the sat was in a pan.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you apprehend the prisoner? - A. About twelve; I went to him in the City, where he was at work.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is he a master butcher? - A. No, he is journeyman to a calf-dresser, in Warwick-lane; they call him a leg-dresser.</p>
               <p>Q. This shop was parted off - was it a shop he only hired, or a part of his dwelling-house? - A. Part of the dwelling-house, where he lived.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not a regular butcher, killing meat at this shop? - A. No, there might be a few joints of meat sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the shop appear to be such as would lead you to suppose you should find five carcasses there? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the carcasses where they might easily be seen? - A. No, you could not see them at all without a light.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the prisoner where he was at work, did you make any enquiry about this shop? - A. I said to him, Harvey, there is a person in possession of five sheep at your house, and without you come and prove which way you came by them, they will be taken away; he said, he bought them of a man in the Hackney-road, who was driving them along the Saturday before; he washed himself, and came along with me; I told him he must go to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Where is this shop? - A. In Turnmill-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When this is for sale, it is usually hung up in the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen joints of meat in this shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In butcher's shops there is a place to kill sheep? - A. There were pullies behind the door; they were temporary things; they appeared to be a make-shift.</p>
               <p>Q. If a butcher wanted to kill sheep, he would have this kind of make-shift? - A. He must have pullies to pull them up.</p>
               <p>Q. This man was a journeyman butcher? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But, though a journeyman, he carried on the trade of a butcher in this shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After they have killed the sheep, don't they hang them up sometimes till they are cold, before the carcasses are cut up? - A.Exactly so; I never searched a butcher's shop before where there was such a private part as this.</p>
               <p>Q. There were five heads, and hearts, livers, and plucks? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The heads were under a chair? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am a sheep salesman.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of being informed by your servants of the loss of the sheep, did you go to the prisoner's house? - A. I went after I had been to the Magistrates.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the prisoner was taken? - A. I believe after.</p>
               <p>Q. What time? - A. Between twelve and one o'clock on Monday, the 25th of April; I saw the carcasses, and the heads, and the sat, and the plucks.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you enabled to say whether or no those sheep resembled those you lost? - A. I believe they did resemble them, from the heads, and carcasses, and plucks.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to the heads first, had they any marks upon them? - A. No farther than the teeth, and being born sheep; the borns were chopt off.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they the same sort of sheep as those you lost? - A.They were.</p>
               <p>Q. How many different sorts were there? - A. Two single ones, and three of one sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they correspond with the sorts you had lost? - A.Every one with the sorts I had lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the weight such as would correspond with what you had lost? - A. Yes, and the price corresponded; provided they had had the skins, they would have corresponded in weight and price within five shillings of the money; they were worth forty-five shillings each.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe those to be the sheep you lost? - A. As far as a person can be sure without the skins, I am sure they were my sheep.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.First you say they resemble the sheep? - A. Yes.PQ. They resemble the sheep in two circumstances, the teeth and the horns? - A. I said the carcasses resembled them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear positively these to be your property, or that you believe them to be your property? - A. I mean to say that I believe them to be my property.</p>

               <p>Q. If you had had the good fortune to find the skins, you would have found no difficulty in knowing them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Without the skins, you mean to swear to the best of your belief? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. The teeth of sheep is one of the circumstances by which you know the age of sheep? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In Smithfield market there would be many sheep of the same age? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There would be born sheep there? - A. Yes, there is a great difference of horns.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear no others are chopt off in the way these were? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The horns were chopped off by the man that killed them? - A. Yes, or I should have known them.</p>
               <p>Q.Has not every exertion been made to take up Chubby? - A. I believe there has.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any partner? - A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I bought these sheep on the Saturday as I was taken up on the Monday.</p>

               <p>HENRY LANGHORN sworn. - I received a chesnut horse with this note on Friday, with authority to sell it by private contract; I received the note from a person I don't know, he looked like a person in the situation of an ostler; I received it between ten and eleven o'clock; I made sale of it at twenty-two guineas, the price limited by his note; soon after I received the note and the horse; I sold it in about a quarter of an hour after, (produces the note.) Previous to the horse being delivered, he was claimed by Cobb, therefore I could not deliver him at all; the horse remains with me still; the prisoner came to me on the Monday to demand his money, and to know what became of his horse; Cobb had taken hold of him before I came; he was in custody when I saw him, Cobb and an officer having laid by in wait; I keep these stables in Barbican; nothing particular passed between me and the prisoner; he begged of me to let him go, as a friend of his wanted him, but I would not let him go; I did not hear Cobb claim the horse to be his in the prisoner's presence. (Produces one of the hand-bills.)</p>
               <p>WILLIAM COBB, Jun. sworn. - I am a serjeant in the second regiment of Foot Guards; Cobb is my father; I went with him to Langhorn's; I do not know the gelding.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ROSE sworn. - I was sent for as an officer to take the prisoner into custody; Mr. Langhorn sent for me; as I went up Mr. Langhorn's yard, the prisoner jumped through the window in the yard, and I caught him in my arms; I took him to the Compter, that is all I know.</p>

            ? - A. Yes; I know nothing of the property; there were two rooms taken by the Westminster regiment, at Brentford, as an hospital; the prisoner was in that hospital; I have an apartment in the same house; he came down to me, and asked for a few halfpence to get him a little nourishment, for he was quite low, till his serjeant came back; I let him have nine-pence, and he left a bundle with me for it; the serjeant gave me the money in a week, Serjeant Howell; it might be about a month ago.</p>
               <p>JOHN PERKINS sworn. - I bought a jacket of the prisoner five weeks ago last Saturday, as I was going to work in the morning; I overtook the prisoner in Blandford-street, Marybone, about ten minutes before six in the morning; he asked if I knew any one that wanted a jacket; I told him I wanted such a thing; I bought the jacket, and paid for it, and a pair of breeches; I agreed to give him a guinea for them, but I never had the breeches; he said, he lived in Baker-street, No. 8; I went there, but could not find him.</p>
               <p>OWEN HOWELL sworn. - I am a serjeant in the Westminster Militia; the prisoner was a soldier in that regiment, and the prosecutor also; I never attend the regiment, I am always in London; on the 6th of May, I was at Brentford; on Saturday, the 7th of May, the Colonel ordered me to find the property, if possible; the prisoner was in the guard-room; Colonel Cluthero ordered me to take Price, and he would make an example of him for robbing his comrade; he told me where to find the property; I went by his direction to Mrs. Newton's house, and found it left for eight-pence or nine-pence; I paid it, and shewed the handkerchief and waistcoat to Driver; he claimed it; the jacket I found with Mr. Perkins, in Grosvenor-square, on his back; I have kept them ever since. (Produces them.)(The property was identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

            : On Saturday, the 7th of May, in consequence of some information I had received, I went into the warehouse about half past eight in the morning; I immediately missed all the articles mentioned in the indictment, (enumerating them,) except the handkerchiefs, which I missed soon after.</p>
               <p>Q.Whereabouts is the value of all that property? - A. The whole of it very near one hundred pounds; I saw it on the Friday evening, the night before; on Thursday, the 12th, I went to John Lench's house, in Horseshoe-alley, Moorfields, in company with Armstrong; Lench was not at home; we found two hundred and seventy handkerchiefs in a bed-room, up one pair of stairs; I immediately knew them all to be my property; the officer took the property; we found nothing else then; I saw Lench afterwards at the Office in Worship-street.</p>
               <p>PETER JEFFERY sworn. - I am a warehouseman belonging to Drake and Kay; I got up about half past seven the morning the property was lost; I went out for a walk; I left the porter in the warehouse; when Mr. Drake came, the property was missed; I saw the property found at Lench's house.</p>
               <p>LOUTHER JONES sworn. - I am porter to the prosecutors; I got up the morning of the robbery about a quarter past seven; I went out about five minutes to fetch water to sprinkle the warehouse; I shut the door after me, and locked it, and put the key in my pocket; I returned in less than five minutes, and found the lock shot out, but not into the ketch as it ought to be; I am sure it was in the ketch when I went out, for I pushed the door.</p>
               <p>JOHN ARMSTRONG sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Worship-street; in consequence of a search-warrant, I went to the house of Mr. Lench, in Horseshoe-alley, on Thursday, the 12th of May, about seven o'clock, or a little after, at night, in company with Mr. Drake, Jeffery, and Mason, another officer; I informed Mrs. Lench I had a warrant, and had these goods immediately produced to me out of a drawer by Mrs. Lench; it was a chest of drawers; there was nothing in the drawer but these handkerchiefs; Mr. Lench was not at home; I took the goods and Mrs. Lench to the Office that night, and she was committed; on Friday night, Mr. Lench surrendered at the Office, which was the first time I saw him; he is a master weaver, carries on a manufactory, and has a number of people working for him; I knew him before; he has lived there many years; Lench attended the Magistrate on Friday, and the two prisoners' names were given in by him; I knew the prisoners, and went in company with Ray, about eleven o'clock on Friday night, to a house, No. 10, in Leonard-street, pointed out by Lench as the house where Clarke lived, a little chandler's shop; we did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250044"/>go in that night; in the morning I, Mason, and Ray, went to this house, and went in, and found a woman and child, but Clarke was not at home; I left Mason there, and went, in company with Ray, and apprehended the other prisoner in his bed-room, No. 3, Fox-court, Worship-street; we then went to a bookseller's, Postern-row, Tower-hill, and found Clarke at work there; I took him, and brought him to the house where we left Mason, No. 10, Leonard-street; I asked him if that was his house; he said, yes; I asked him if he had any lodgers; he said, no, none but him and his family, and that every thing there was his; I desired Mason to search, and in a cupboard I saw Mason pull out a handkerchief, which I desired him to take care of, for I believed it was some of the goods we were searching for; I found this bag at Clarke's, on the pillow of a bed, at the foot.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You knew Lench very well? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went with a search-warrant, and though you knew him to be a master weaver, you detained his wife in custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not appear till Friday night, and she was still detained in custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found Clarke at work at his usual employ? - A. Yes, at a bookbinder's.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Lench? - A. A number of years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you ever know any harm of him? - A. No, I always thought him a man of independant property.</p>
               <p>PETER MASON sworn. - I am an officer of Worship-street; I was with Armstrong at Lench's house; I saw the things found that he has been mentioning; I was also at Clarke's house, and found the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Mrs. Clarke told you that she bought it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you a married man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your wife has such a handkerchief, perhaps? - A. No.</p>
               <p>JOHN RAY sworn. - I went with Mr. Lench to his house on Monday, the 16th of May, and Mr. Lench delivered this bag to me; he took it out of a drawer.</p>
               <p>JOHN LENCH sworn. - I live in Horseshoe-alley, Moorfields; I have known Chinnery many years, and the other prisoner about two years: On Saturday, the 7th of May, between twelve and one, I was reading the newspaper at a public-house, the Blue Bell, the bottom of Horseshoe-alley, there is a skittle-ground at the back of the house, which the back window looks to; Chinnery came out of the skittle-ground, and asked me how I did; I asked him the same; he said, he wanted to speak to me; I went about the space of a yard from where I was sitting; Chinnery said, his friend standing by, that was Clarke, had got something he thought might suit me; I asked him what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Clarke near enough to hear what he said? - A. Yes, he told me it was women's shawls; I told him I did not deal in those kind of things, I was no judge of them; Mr. Clarke then asked me if I would see them; I told him I had no objection, but they were articles I did not deal in; Clarke said, should he bring them to my house; I told him he might, if he pleased; he asked me what time; I told him I should be at home in half an hour, or a little more it might be; Clarke then went away.</p>

               <p>Q. Before Clarke went away, was there any conversation to whom the goods belonged? - A. I seemed to hesitate; Clarke said, I need not be afraid, they were honestly come by; I think he said he had them to sell for a friend; Chinnery went away, I believe, at the same time; I staid there about half an hour, and then went home; in about an hour from the time they left me, Clarke came to my house with some silk handkerchiefs, in a black linen bag.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at those handkerchiefs that lie by you? - A. I cannot swear to any of them; they are handkerchiefs of the same description.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at that bag, was it that sort of bag? - A. It was a bag of this sort; the bag that Clarke brought them in I delivered to Ray when he went to my house on the Monday; when Clarke brought the handkerchiefs, I told him he might leave them, I was going to dinner, and that when I had dined, I would look over them; after dinner I looked over them, and put them up in the best manner I could, being so much tumbled; I told Clarke I should be some time looking over them, and if he would come to my house in two hours I should be ready; Clarke appointed me to meet him at the Green Dragon, Half Moon-alley, Bishopsgate-street Without, near about four o'clock in the afternoon; I went to the Green Dragon, and found both the prisoners there; Clarke asked me whether I had looked over them, and how many I made; I told him I made two hundred and fifty handkerchiefs; he said, he thought there might be more; Clarke talked first of selling them by the piece, then by the lump, at last I agreed to give him forty-five pounds for the whole; I paid Clarke the money in the presence of Chinnery.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they about when you came to the Green Dragon? - A.They appeared to have been eating, there were radish-tops on the table; I left the handkerchiefs at home; I put them in the bag again; when I returned home, I put them in a drawer in my bed-chamber, up one pair of stairs; on the Thursday following, I took out two or three parcels, and went to a master weaver, a Mr. Stevens, in the neighbourhood where I live; I shewed them to Mr. Stevens, and asked him if he would buy them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250045"/>Q.Where was this? - A. At Ruddock's-buildings, near Skinner-street, Shoreditch; I believe I went with them about half after two; he looked at them, and asked me what I asked for them.</p>
               <p>Q.You had some conversation about them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.After the officers had been at your house in your absence, did you go to Worship-street? - A. Yes, I sent my compliments to the Magistrate, and I would wait upon him in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not taken up at all, but went to the Justice? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the story there you have been telling to day? - A. Yes, as near as could be; I was sent to New Prison that night, and was bailed on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Bailed to appear here, and give your evidence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your wife was discharged? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. We have heard that you are a man of independant fortune - that you could have no temptation to mix in a dishonest business? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You believed you were dealing in a perfectly honest transaction? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to Stevens, you told him how you came by these things? - A. Yes, he said he could give no such money as I asked; then I said I had made a bad bargain, for I had given more than I should have done; he said, they would be a dead stock, they were going out of fashion.</p>
               <p>Q.Whether you told Stevens the truth how you came by them? - A. I told Stevens I bought them.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell Stevens you took them for a bad debt? - A. No, I did not; I said, I had had a bad deal.</p>
               <p>Q. You enquired of this person, Clarke, what business he was, I suppose? - A.No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew what Chinnery was? - A. I heard he was a kind of a smith, that made small instruments for cases.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not a dealer in handkerchiefs? - A. No, that is very clear.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no curiosity to ask Chinnery what trade his friend was? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a manufacturer - you know large quantities of goods don't commonly come into person's hands? - A. I cannot account for that.</p>
               <p>Q. The bag was found in your house? - A. I produced it.</p>
               <p>Q. You made no enquiry what trade the man was, nor went to his house to see what trade he was, nor asked Chinnery what trade he was? - A. No, I did not; I did suppose he was a bookbinder.</p>
               <p>Q. You supposed he was a bookbinder, and therefore bought of him forty-five pounds worth of handkerchiefs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't deal in this sort of articles? - A. I deal in a variety of articles, and manufacture a great many articles.</p>
               <p>Q.Not handkerchiefs? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you talk of this in the neighbourhood? - A. To no person but Stevens, whom I went to.</p>
               <p>Q.Before you went to the Magistrate, your wife was in custody? - A. I was not at home that night till half after eleven; then I heard of this matter of Mrs. Lench; the next day I sent to the Magistrate to tell him I would wait upon him; I have lived in the house thirty-six years, my character was never impeached before in any criminal way whatever during my natural life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say that this matter was brought home to you, if you did not get rid of it? - A. I never did; I never made use of any such expression.</p>
               <p>Q.Nothing at all to that purpose? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.What do you deal in? - A. I cannot tell you all I deal in; I manufacture all in the fancy way, tassels and fringes for garments.</p>
               <p>Q. The Magistrates committed you? - A. I was committed on Friday night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. This bag you found in your house, was it sent for by the Magistrate? - A.There was a bag produced at the Office, and I was desired to look at it; I looked at it, and could not take upon me to say it was the same bag; I thought it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner there at the time? - A. I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go back to the house, and find this bag you now produce? - A. I did, and gave it to Mr. Ray.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember his coming to you with any handkerchiefs? - A. Yes, on Thursday, the 12th of this month; he brought four dozen of silk handkerchiefs, I asked the price; he said, four shillings and sixpence, or six shillings; I told him they were not saleable, and would not suit me, they were going out of fashion; he said, he took them of a person he was glad to get any thing of; I said, I supposed for a bad debt, and he said, yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. He has sworn that he said no such thing? - A. He told me first he took them of a man he was glad to get any thing of; and I said, I supposed for a bad debt; he said, yes, which we are all liable to in trade.</p>

             sworn. - I have been formerly in the Light Horse; I keep a house in the City of Westminster; On Tuesday, the 10th of May, I went to Mile-end New-town, and from thence to Whitechapel, to the sign of the Sugar Loaf, in Church-street, to get a favourite sword given me by his Grace, the Duke of Northumberland; I stopped there to spend the evening, and got a little intoxicated; returning about half past nine, in Whitechapel I was accosted by the prisoner, and another girl, informing me they could get me a lodging where I could lie down with a pretty girl; the prisoner took me to <placeName id="t18030525-59-crimeloc326">Angel-court, in Wentworth-street, near Brick-lane</placeName>

At last, I found the door, and found it fast against me; by making a noise at the door, the woman in black came and opened the door; I told her I was robbed of my money, handkerchief, and gloves, and I would call for an officer; she told me she knew nothing of the prisoner, she was gone away from the house; I went across the way, and made application for an officer; a man, who keeps an eating-house, went with me for an officer; he said it was well I escaped with my life, for it was a very bad house; we could not get an officer; he took me then to the Flying Horse, where we found an officer, and he desired me to leave it till the morning, and come about half after eight, which I accordingly did; the officer came to me, and took me to a house in Wentworth-street, where we found the prisoner and a good many more eating hot rolls; the officer, when we got into the room, asked me if any of those girls was the girl that robbed me; I immediately said, the prisoner was the girl; he searched her immediately, and found upon her six half guineas in gold, and seven seven-shilling pieces, two slides belonging to my purse, and a silk pocket handkerchief; I asked her what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250048"/>she had done with the remainder of the things; she said, that was all she had got.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you told her it would be better for her to give an account of the things? - A. No; I told her I would punish her; she said, that was my money, and hoped I would forgive her; I asked what she had done with my purse; she did not give me any answer; the officer took the money; I did not find my gloves, my braces, nor the purse; there was some silver found upon her; I missed all the articles mentioned in the indictment; the silk handkerchief was a striped one, I wore it on my neck in the morning instead of a white one; it was in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing remarkable about the half-guineas or seven-shilling-pieces? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you sober enough to swear you did not give her these things? - A. Yes, I was sober enough to know I did not give her any thing; she did not ask me.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not sober when you went there? - A. I got more sober afterwards.</p>
               <p>EDWARD SMITH sworn. - I am one of the officers belonging to the Police Office, Whitechapel; I took up the prisoner; I found upon her six half-guineas, seven seven-shilling-pieces, two little brass rings, he calls them sliders to his purse, and a silk handkerchief; the prosecutor applied to me about eight o'clock in the morning, and stated to me that he was picked up by two little girls; I went to George-street, Spital-fields, to a Mr. Jenkins's, where these match-girls lodge; I apprehended her, and took her to the Office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor know her immediately? - A. No, he did not, he hesitated some time; when I searched her, and found the handkerchief, he said, that was the girl; she said, it was not her, it was the other little girl; I asked her what she had done with the other two seven-shilling-pieces; she said, she had no more, that was all the other girl, who was with her when they picked him up, gave her.</p>
               <p>Q.She never admitted it was her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He has stated that he immediately pointed out the prisoner? - A. No, he did not; there were two or three other little girls; he did not know which to pitch upon; she begged to be forgiven, he was in a violent passion, and said he would hang her; I asked her if that was the gentleman's money; she said, the other girl gave it her; there is nothing remarkable about the money.(The handkerchief was produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The other girl and I were going up the Minories; this gentleman met us, and he says, come along, I will give you five shillings; the other little girl was but eight years old; we came back, and went with him, and when we came to the house, he gave us three shillings and sixpence; he went with the other girl, he did not go with me at all; I stopped at the door, and she came out; we came into Whitechapel; she gave me the money; she said, the gentleman gave it her, and desired me to keep it till next morning for her.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To the Prosecutor.) Q.You spoke of a pair of braces - where were those braces? - A. I had them in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Smith. The prosecutor expressed a surprize bow they could get his gallows's off from under his waistcoat. <rs id="t18030525-59-verdict327" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. How could any body get into the garden? - A. By going through the passage from the street; the door was upon the latch.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were in the house at this time? - A.Myself, Mary Callan, and Cornelius Callan; I got upon the tub, and saw a half tester bed turned down, and missed a blanket, a pair of sheets, a pair of pillows and pillow cases.</p>
               <p>Q.They were your furniture? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>LAZARUS JACOBS sworn. - I keep a clothes-shop: On Monday the 16th of May, between three and four o'clock, the prisoner brought me a gown and blanket; I bought them of her for 4s.(Vickery produced the gown.)</p>

               <p>JOHN VICKERY sworn. - In consequence of a search-warrant, I went to the house of Lazarus Jacobs, in Raven-row, Spital-fields; I found this gown hanging in the window; I did not find any other property; the prisoner was brought to the Office on the Saturday following by Jacobs; I asked her where she got this gown from.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise her any thing? - A. I did not; she then said, she had bought it of a woman; I took her to the house of Beasley, to see if she could produce the woman she bought it of; and in returning, she said, I will not lay this blame upon any body else, for I am guilty of it myself; I then asked her how she did it, that the window I thought was so high that she could not get into it; she said, she did not get into it herself, but that she got a little boy, and put him in at the window, and he had given her the things out at the window; and when he came out, she gave him sixpence for what he had done, and that she had taken the things to Jacobs, and sold them.</p>

Yes: On Saturday the 30th of April, I saw the house; there were two coppers in the back kitchen fixed in the building; I saw them safe about half after six on Saturday evening; it is a house undergoing repairs; nobody lives in it; I left the house at half after six, and double-locked the door, and took the key with me; I returned about eight in the evening, and found the door on the single lock; going into the passage, I saw the back door open; I looked into the yard, and saw the shutters of the back kitchen window put back</p>
               <p>Q.At this time it was dark? - A. Not quite; I immediately went down into the kitchen, and found one copper taken out of the place in which it was set on the floor, immediately after I heard some noise at the foot of the stairs, and turning about I saw two men going up the kitchen stairs, the prisoner and another man.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure one was the prisoner? - A.Quite sure.</p>
               <p>Q.Had he been employed as a workman in the house? - A. He had not; I went up, and caught them on the kitchen stairs; I caught the prisoner as he ran up stairs, and conveyed him to the door till assistance came; the other got away.</p>
               <p>Q.When you unlocked the single lock, did you shut the door after you, or leave it open? - A. It was left open.</p>
               <p>Q.When you first saw them, they were coming up from the kitchen? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Then they could not have come in after you? - A. No, they must have come in before me.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any instruments in their hands? - A. No.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250050"/>Q.Nor in the kitchen? - A. No; the prisoner was taken to St. Pancras watch-house; he was searched, and two parlour-door keys found upon him, and a knife; I believe that was all.</p>
               <p>Q.No key large enough to open the street-door? - A.No; there was a key picked up in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure the men that ran up from the kitchen must have been in the house before you came in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The house was under repair? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.There were workmen employed? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he much in liquor that night? - A. I thought he seemed to pretend to be more in liquor than he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go through the room, where the things were, to-bed? - A. No; he went out backwards, about ten o'clock, through that room; the things were on a dresser; there was no light in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't remember his going into that room but that once? - A. No, only once.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BLACKALL sworn. - I was sent for by Mrs. Gibson on the 29th of April, between one and two o'clock; I took the prisoner into custody; I was desired to search him, which I did; I found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250051"/>a frock and four caps loose in his breeches, in the back part; he said, he was very sorry, he did not know what he was doing, and hoped he should be forgiven - that he was rather in liquor when he did it. (The things were produced and identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Whether I did not ask her whether the suspected me? - A. I did suspect him, but did not say so, because there was nobody at home but myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am a plumber; the circumstances of my case demands pity: I was going to sail in a few days, I met two persons at the prosecutor's house, and, in the course of the evening, I drank immoderately of mixed liquors; I knew nothing where I was, till I waked in a strange room; I did not know how the things came into my possession; I found them in the morning, and came down to the sitting room, and intended to find an opportunity of dispossessing myself of them; if you should find me guilty, I hope you will permit me to serve his Majesty by sea, which I will do thankfully and faithfully.</p>

I went into this house to have half a pint of beer, and while the man was giving me the change, a woman gave me a wink to come out with her; I went with her, and going along she gave me this bundle to take care of; and walking, along I missed the woman, and was looking for her, and this man came up and asked me where I got the bundle; she went to pawn a check apron, and left the bundle with me; I went about the street two hours seeking her.</p>

             sworn. - On Monday, the 9th of May, about four o'clock in the morning, I was informed by a drover that the prisoner was turned out of the Holloway road, with a copper upon his back; I immediately pursued after him, and in a bye lane I found him among some thick bushes, and the copper by his side.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prosecutor's house, at Holloway? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from his house was the place where you stopped the prisoner? - A. About half a mile; when the prisoner saw me advance towards him, he got up, and took the copper upon his back; I asked him where he was going with that copper; he said, to a coppersmith's, in Smithfield; I asked him where he brought it from; he said, from Whetstone; I asked if it was his own; he said, no, that it belonged to one Sanders, a bricklayer, that he had it of; I asked him the coppersmith's name that he was going to take it to, and he said he did not know the coppersmith's name; I told him he must go along with me for further examination, and I took him into custody; I took him to the Islington watch-house; the Magistrates of Islington ordered him to be taken to Hatton-garden at half after eleven that day; it has been in my possession ever since; I put two marks on it before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q.Did it appear to be recently taken out of the brick work? - A. Yes, the mortar was all about it.(The copper was produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am veryinnocent of taking the copper away; I brought it from Whetstone.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the Prosecutor.) Was the house broke open? - A. There was some brick work down behind the place where the copper was, and some wood work put up at the windows to keep the weather out; he must have got in by removing the wood work, or where the bricks were down.</p>

               <p>Q.(To the Prosecutrix.) What was he to give you a shilling for - had he any connection with you? - A. No; he said he would give it me to get me something to drink as I was going home.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he give you the two sixpences? - A.Under the arch way of Gardener's-lane.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, to-morrow will be a fortnight, between eleven and twelve o'clock, coming home to my lodging, I met this woman coming over Westminster-bridge; I was very drunk, I made a stumble; she said, she would take care of me; I did not know she was a woman of the town; I said, I would give her something to drink; we went to a house, it was not open; I said, I would give her a glass at my lodging; she took me to an obscure place, and began sumbling my pocket, and my face, and wanted me to do what is common to man and woman, and I would not; I had a shilling in my hand, she took it from me, and then I bid her good night; we had not been parted long before she came back, and charged me with taking her money; I was stupidly drunk; she afterwards came to Tothill-fields, and wanted to extort money from me to keep out of the way, and not appear at my second examination.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the Prosecutrix.) What time was it you met this man? - A. Near twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking? - A. No, not at all, I was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Q. He says you snatched some money out of his hand, is that true? - A. No, he had none in his hand but the two pieces of tin he gave me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the prison? - A. Yes, he sent for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you offer to make it up with him? - A. Yes, for my own money, I wanted nothing more.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you do? - A.

               <p>Q.She is the wife of the other prisoner? - A. She said she was, and afterwards she said she was not; she said before the Magistrate that she was not married, that her name was Morro; she came with the man to the Office, she was not brought in custody; I took the woman, and went to Mr. Farmer's, a pawnbroker, at Bow, and found two shirts and one handkerchief, in three different pledges; I went afterwards to the Coach and Horses, where the woman told me the chest was, and likewise the man told me before I went away; there I found the chest; she said, the other bits of rags were in it; I asked the woman of the house if she knew John Green; she said, yes, very well; I asked if he left a chest there; she said, yes; I searched the chest, but found nothing in it; I then went with her to her lodging, about ten or twelve doors from the Coach and Horses.</p>
               <p>Q.Did the man and woman lodge together? - A. Yes, I was told they did; the woman went with me; I searched two rooms, and found nothing; I then asked if they had any other room, and a person told me they had the whole floor; there was a room, with a padlock on the door; I desired her to open it, or I would; she pulled a key out of her pocket, and opened it; I found this quilt on the bed; I searched a chest, and found various articles the lad said were his; in that chest I found a pocket-book, with three duplicates in it; one for a pair of boots, another for a pair of breeches, pawned at Mrs. Harvey's, Mile End, another for two jackets and a waistcoat, seven shillings, at Mr. Dexter's, Whitechapel; I told the pawnbrokers to attend at the Office; they attended, and brought the property.</p>

               <p>Ann Green's defence. I have nothing to say; I pawned the things by his direction, because I wanted money.</p>
               <p>Smith. The quilt is an East-India article; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250057"/>bought it in the East-Indies, and brought it home with me.</p>

               <p>THOMAS ROBERTS sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Thomas Hawley, a watch-maker, No. 120, Fleet-street: On Thursday, the 5th of May, Michael Tool, and George Jones, the prosecutor, came to our shop, and Jones delivered me the watch specified in the indictment, to be repaired; on Friday, the 6th, Tool came for the watch, but it was not ready for him; he said, he was come for Jones's watch; on Saturday, the 7th, he came again; I informed him the watch was done, and told him it came to six shillings and sixpence; he said, he would go and fetch the money; he went and fetched five shillings; on the receipt of the five shillings, I delivered him the watch; there was a metal chain, two keys, and one seal; I rather objected to taking five shillings instead of six shillings and sixpence, and he said, on condition of my taking it, he would bring a customer on Monday to purchase a watch.</p>

               <p>Q.When he came the second time, how did he demand the watch? - A. He said he came for Jones's watch, which was left to repair; and from his coming with Jones, I could not think but he had sent him.</p>
               <p>GEORGE JONES sworn. - I am a sailor: On the 5th of May, I was coming down Fleet-street with Michael Tool and John Owens; I had let my watch fall on board the frigate Cibber; says Tool, I will shew you a watch-maker's, and he shewed me Mr. Hawley's, No. 120; we went in, and I gave the watch to the watch-maker to repair; we came out, and went into a public-house, and had two pots of beer, and then I went home.</p>
               <p>Q. After this, did you ever give the prisoner any orders or directions to get the watch when it was done? - A. No, he came to me on the 6th, and told me the watch was not done; I told him to go about his business, that the watch-maker would not deliver the watch to any person but me, George Jones; on the 7th, he came to me again, and told me the watch was done, and the price was five shillings; I told him again to go about his business, that he could not get the watch till I went myself; I went to the watch-maker's half an hour after for my watch, and was told the prisoner had got it; on the 11th, I went to his house, he was sitting by the fire up stairs; he asked me what I was come for; I told him for my watch, and he offered me his pension-ticket for a security; I told him I did not want it, it was of no service to me; I then took him to Mr. Hawley's, and Mr. Hawley sent for a watchman; he offered me his pension-ticket in Mr. Hawley's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him any authority, at any time, to get this watch? - A. No, nothing of the kind; I saw it afterwards in the hands of the pawnbroker.</p>

On the 5th of May, this man and a shipmate of mine were together; he asked me to go down to a watch maker's with him, to get his watch repaired; I went to the watch-maker's, and gave him the watch, and desired him to repair it as soon as possible; the next day he desired me to go and see if it was done, and said he would satisfy me for my trouble; I went to the watch-maker's; he said it would not be done till Saturday, the mainspring was broke, and it wanted to be cleaned; I went on Saturday, about two o'clock to Jones, and he was not within; I went to the watch-maker's, and got the watch, and went again to Jones's lodging, and they told me he was gone; I met a person I owed some money to, and I pawned the watch for thirty-five shillings; he came to me, and said he wanted the watch; I went to the watch-maker's,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250058"/>and gave him the duplicate, and offered him my pension-ticket for the use, of the money for three hours; he had a man with him, who told the watchmaker to send for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Jones.) You have heard, what he has said - is it true? - A. No, none of it; I never saw him before we went together to the watch-maker's.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in liquor? - A. Not much, I knew what I said and what I did.</p>
