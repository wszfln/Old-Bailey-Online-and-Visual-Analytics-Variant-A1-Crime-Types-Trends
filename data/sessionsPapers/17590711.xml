               <p>Sadler. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How much lead was there of it?</p>
               <p>Sadler. There were about twenty pounds weight.</p>

            . I am a Merchant's watchman. I lost a hogshead of tobacco out of a lighter, that lay along side of a ship at King Edward's stairs Wapping; the ship was bound to France.</p>

               <p>Lake. It contained seven hundred three quarters and eighteen pounds; I had word brought me the next morning that there was an empty hogshead at King James's stairs; I went and found it to be one that I was in charge of; then I went and looked in the lighter, and found one was gone; then I was informed there was some tobacco scattered about at the stairs at Shadwell. I got two parish officers and searched all day, but found nothing; we beset the place all night; the next morning we went to searching a great many houses, but found nothing that day; the next morning I had information brought me; that there had been some tobacco brought to a house in new Gravel-lane; the person's name is Webster; the constable and I went there, and found some and took it away to the Custom-House. I was told that the prisoner had been there that morning, and had taken some money of Mrs Webster for some tobacco. I went and took her up, and Justice Berry committed her for further examination; I think the day after she was committed, we found the remainder of the tobacco in an empty house, joining to the prisoner's apartment; there was between five and six hundred weight of it, and a ladder standing in her yard that went up in at a window into the empty house. The tobacco is of the same quality of that which I lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the prisoner a husband?</p>
               <p>Lake. She has: I took him up; but I left him in charge of two men, and he got from them out at the door of the house, and at the same time she was going to get out at the window.</p>

            . The prisoner at the bar came to Mrs Webster's on the 8th of June last, in the morning, and asked for a half-pennyworth of snuff; I saw her bring no tobacco in, neither did I see any money paid, but I heard money chink while the prisoner and Mrs Webster were in the little back room together.</p>

               <p>White. No; she lives at the lower end of the lane, and I at the upper end of it; but I happened to be there at that time; in the afternoon she came again and asked for Mrs Webster; I said, she was not within; she look'd me full in the face, and said, she hoped Mrs Webster would not come into trouble about the tobacco.</p>

            . On the 8th of June last Mrs. Chambers came to my house, and asked me if I would buy a little tobacco; this was at nine in the morning; she had a man with her with a little bag of tobacco; she bid him go away, and I weighed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that man?</p>

I do, it was not him, it was a stranger that brought it; we weighed it at three times; the first time twenty pounds, the next thirty-four pounds, and the next twenty-one pounds, which I paid her for at six pence halfpenny a pound; then she went away and soon returned with some more in her apron, which weighed eighteen pounds; I paid her for that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you which way she came by it?</p>
               <p>Webster. No; she did not, she said, I should come into no trouble in buying it of her; she had an acquaintance among the sailors, and it might be the sailors for what I knew.</p>

I desired he would recommend me to somebody, as he was an entire stranger to me, that knew him, before I parted with the cloaths; he said, cannot you see a difference between a sharper and a gentleman; I told him I was not so discerning as always to do that; I told him if he would recommend me to any that would give me satisfaction, as to his character and circumstances, I would give him as much credit as any Taylor in London; then he mentioned my going to a gentleman in Queen-square, whom he called his uncle, and after that he mentioned Mr Dunbar in Grosvenor-street; I would not deliver the coat to him, but laid it down on a chair, and went to my cutting room to give out some work, and when I returned to that room in about twenty minutes, the coat and he were gone; I searched about the room to see if he had laid the coat by in any place, but not finding it, went to my wife, who told me somebody went out at the street-door and left it open; then I went to Justice Fielding, and had the coat advertised with a guinea reward. Afterwards going about the city, I look'd on every body's cloaths I could see of that colour; at last I met with the prisoner in Beaufort-buildings, and laid hold of his collar, and told him that he and I should not easily part. I ask'd him what he had done with my coat; he said, it was in Meard's-court, and I should have it again. The people came about us; I desired assistance, or somebody to go for a constable, but I got no assistance. At last I shew'd the people the advertisement which I had in my pocket, and said, I had advertised a guinea reward, and said, whoever would assist me should have it; then a man went to Justice Fielding's and got assistance, and we carried him there, and Mr. Fielding sent a man as the prisoner directed, who brought the coat there.

               <p>I was going to Captain Kane in order to get money to pay for the cloaths; but he not being at home I had not the money to pay, and was afraid to go back to my lodgings so fear of being arrested for the money for the coat. I took away my own coat after I had put this on, in order to carry it to the Scowerer to be cleaned. I saw my prosecutor above a hundred yards before he came to me, and staid 'till he came up to tell him when I should bring the money.</p>

               <p>Larmond. She lives with her father and mother in Drury-lane: her father and mother were gone down to Chatham at the time, and she was alone.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be at that girl's house?</p>
               <p>Larmond. She called Mrs. Larmond, my mother, to come and keep her company; I looked out at the window, and said, my mother was laying down the child to sleep; then she desired me to come and keep her company; I went, and the prisoner was then in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. What room was it?</p>
               <p>Larmond. It was a parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any body else in the room besides the prisoner and

            ?</p>
               <p>Larmond. No, nobody else: after I had been a little while in the room he went and lock'd the door, and put the key in his pocket, and shut the windows, and put one hand to my mouth and the other round my back, and throw'd me down on the bed; in struggling I got up, and he took his hand away, and I squalled out, and he clapp'd his hand on my mouth again; I got up again, then he throw'd me down a third time and ravished me.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell what he did to you?</p>
               <p>Larmond. He gave me the foul disease; I am ashamed to mention what he did; - he put his private parts into mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the other young woman do at the time ?</p>
               <p>Larmond. She ran out to call my mother.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she get out, you say he had lock'd the door?</p>

               <p>Q. How long did you stay in the room?</p>
               <p>Larmond. I went away directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other girl get any assistance ?</p>
               <p>Larmond. No, she was so much ashamed she went and look'd out at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you in the room in the whole?</p>
               <p>Larmond. I do not think I was above half an hour in the room.</p>

               <p>Larmond. That was when he was going to use me so.</p>
               <p>Q. And did she go to call the neighbours?</p>
               <p>Larmond. Yes: she went to call the neighbours at one house in our yard.</p>
               <p>Q. And did she leave the door open?</p>
               <p>Larmond. She did: but she came in again and shut it; then she went to the window, and open'd the window and call'd, and after I could get liberty I went out at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell your mother of it when you got home?</p>
               <p>Larmond. No, I was asham'd, and I was affrighted; for when she finds any thing amiss she is ready to kill me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you tell of it?</p>
               <p>Larmond. I never told any body of it.</p>

               <p>Larmond. You drank a full pot of beer with my mother.</p>

               <p>Larmond. It was not long after: he came up stairs to my mother when I was in the room, and sent for the full pot; he said, he was going away to his club, and did not stay long.</p>

            . About half an hour past four in the morning on the third of June, I met with the prisoner at the bar in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields; she had this kettle with her. Producing a brass kettle.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my property.</p>
               <p>Bennet. I ask'd her where she had that kettle; she first told me it was her landlord's, and she was going to take it home.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Bennet. I am a Watchman, and watch in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields: I knowing her to be a disorderly woman stopp'd her.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175907110010"/>Q. What do you mean by disorderly?</p>
               <p>Bennet. I mean a common woman of the town.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You are a big rogue.</p>
               <p>Bennet. At last the prisoner said, she found the kettle at the door where I catched her.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the distance from the prosecutor's house, and the place where you found the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Bennet. It is but a very little distance; I took her to St. Clement's watch-house; she stood stiff in it, that she found the kettle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I found that kettle in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields as I was going home; I do not know who is the owner of it; when I saw the watchman coming up I stood behind it, and would not let him see it; I intended to carry it to the Round-house, the place whence I came from; I had been taken up on the Saturday night, and kept there all night.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bennet. When you saw the prisoner first, was she walking along or standing still?</p>
               <p>Bennet. She was standing against a door in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the Fields?</p>
               <p>Bennet. It was in Portugal-row, the fourth or fifth door up, about a door or two on this side my Lord Keeper's; that was, she had it in her hand, and her apron not quite over it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What is the value of the kettle?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is worth four shillings.</p>

I had no suspicion of his robbing me; but the landlord of the house where he lodged, came and told me he led a very irregular life, and he had reason to believe he had robbed me, for that he had seen tea littered about his box in his lodgings. I went to his lodgings before I spoke to him, to see if I could make any discovery; there I saw his box, in which was a crack in the bottom, I shook it, and there came out some loose tea. Then I went home and taxed him with it, and told him, what information I had had against him. I told him, I insisted upon searching his lodgings; he hesitated a little. I then asked him, if he ever had taken any tea from me? he said, he believed a little matter, a quarter of a pound, or so. I said, have you never taken chocolate? to which he made much the same answer. I said, for your own character, as well as my satisfaction, I shall insist upon searching your lodgings. He went with me, but did not care for opening the box. He said he had lost the key. Then I said, I would get a warrant and have it broke open. Then he took the hinges off the box; there we found three pounds of chocolate, and five or six pounds of tea, in different parcels; and some sugar, in different parcels. The sugar I can't swear to. The chocolate is marked with the two initial letters of our names, W. T. I took the prisoner before a magistrate, and he committed him to Newgate. His lodgings being out of the city I took him before Mr Welch.</p>

            . I was going in at the Inn gate, I met the prisoner with a basket of butter on his shoulder. I call'd hollo; he made no answer, but walked as fast as he could. When he came to the gate he threw the basket from his shoulder and ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Drain. This was about half an hour after ten at night. I ran after him up Leaden-hall-street. I pursued him, and brought him back to my master's house. He said, are you sure I am the man? I said, I was. He was taken before an Alderman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him examined?</p>
               <p>Drain. I did. He denied the fact.</p>

               <p>Drain. I am sure he is. But he has altered his dress since I took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him before?</p>
               <p>Drain. No. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. How near to him was you when he went out of the yard?</p>
               <p>Drain. I was close by him, and followed him close to his heels as he ran.</p>
               <p>Q. How near the place where he threw the basket down was it that you took him?</p>
               <p>Drain. It may be 20 or 30 yards. I did not see him take it up, but before he had carried it three yards I saw him.</p>

            . On the 9th of June, after ten o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner at the bar with a flat of butter on his shoulder coming out of the Saracen's inn-yard, within Aldgate. He threw it from his shoulder and ran away, which made me imagine he had stole it. The chamberlain and I both went after him, and took him. The basket produced, and deposed to.</p>

               <p>I had been at Bow-fair, and was going along the street; they said I had stole a man's basket out of the yard. This woman said she saw me in the yard; but before the Alderman she said the contrary.</p>

               <p>Q. What business had he in your house so often?</p>
               <p>Noteer. He is one of his Majesty's Palace-Court officers, so am I.</p>
               <p>John Downs. I have known him about two or three years. I never heard any ill of him.</p>
               <p>Mr Ward. I have known him five or six years; he once lived with me, and my mother; we kept a Baker's shop in More-fields; I am a Carpenter, by trade; he never was drunk in the time; but he us'd to lay out money, and do the business, with care and industry; he has been trusted with twenty or thirty pounds, at a time.</p>

            . I went across Smithfield, to the Rose, to inquire about a waggon that came out of Northamptonshire, last Thursday was se'nnight.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Vialls. This was about ten o'clock in the morning; I met with two countrymen, and I staid there with them 'till about one o'clock; then we went down Chick-lane together; there were three women stood in my way; I said, let us come by; the prisoner took me by my cloaths, and took me up to a private place, a room, where was a bed; I told them, I had not above three-pence, or a groat, about me; the woman of the house said, I must go down; and said, there is no room for such customers as you.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any other person along with you?</p>
               <p>Vialls. No; none but the prisoner, and myself; the woman desir'd us to walk down again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Vialls. I was sensible, but I had been drinking wine; the prisoner took hold of my cloaths; and said, You must go down stairs, come along with me; she took me up a hill, and into a ruinous house; and up one pair of stairs, there was a door, lock'd, and one pannel of it cut out, at the bottom of the door, I imagine, for the purpose; to take others in, as she did me; she said, You must come in here; she got in first, and drew me in afterwards; I had a blue apron on.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business?</p>
               <p>Vialls. I am a <rs id="t17590711-14-viclabel78" type="occupation">Scowerer, and Dyer</rs>, by trade; I felt under my apron, and felt my watch safe then, in my pocket; she drew me into a little room, and laid herself down, and pull'd me over her; after that, she said she was sleepy, she must needs go to sleep, and would have me to go to sleep also; in about five or six minutes time, I might be a trifle dosing, I turn'd a little sickish; as soon as she found me stir, she said, I must be gone; for somebody wants me below; she went away; as I continued sick, I felt for my watch, and found it was gone; I made the best of my way after her; but, when I came to the bottom, I could not find her.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175907110013"/>Q. How came you to find her; at last?</p>
               <p>Vialls. I was told, by a countryman, that she would be at the Chequers in Chick-lane, at such an hour at night; for she was always there.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Vialls. This was the same night, I went and found her there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your watch again?</p>
               <p>Vialls. No, never; she had a black sattin hat on her head; I look'd at it, and said; I believe you have a piece of my watch on your head; said she, You had but three pence, in your pocket, when you was with me; she had on, when I took her, a pair of new pumps, and new buckles; which she had not on before.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the month was this?</p>
               <p>Vialls. This was the twenty-eighth of June last, much about one o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. You say she took hold on your cloaths, and she pull'd you; did you chuse to have been from her?</p>
               <p>Vialls. I can't say that; but I had as lieve been at liberty, as to have came there.</p>
               <p>Q. How near to the Chequers was that house to which she carried you?</p>
               <p>Vialls. It was pretty near the Chequers; it is opposite to it in Chick-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you obliged to go up stairs with her?</p>
               <p>Vialls. She push'd me up; so I was oblig'd to go up.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a watch was it?</p>
               <p>Vialls. It had silver cases, and a silver dial-plate.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had it in your pocket, when you went into the ruinous place?</p>
               <p>Vialls. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you miss it?</p>
               <p>Vialls. I miss'd it as soon as she was gone.</p>
               <p>

            . The prosecutor came to my quarters, (I am a Soldier) at Mr Ashby's, the Globe and Dolphin, in Liquorpond-street; he was my landlord's acquaintance; he was complaining to him, how he had lost his watch; and said, he believ'd he could find the person at night, if he had any assistance: my landlord desir'd I would go along with him; I went with him to the Chequers in Chick-lane, there was the prisoner: My girl, said he, I believe you have got some of my watch on your head; I said to him; if he could make it appear, that she was the woman that stole the watch, she was my prisoner: she said, she would not go along with us, without a proper officer; he went for a constable, and left me to take care of her while he was gone; she desir'd me to let her go out to the door; I told her, she should not go, 'till he came; said she, let me go but to the door; I went to the door with her; then I said, the gentleman says, if you will confess where the watch is, if it cost him a guinea, or a guinea and a half, so that he can but get it again, he will not trouble you: she said, the watch is gone, and I do not know the person it is sold to; but she wished she could know the person; we stay'd 'till the prosecutor came back; he could not find a constable, so we took her to the Watch-house, and left her there with the constable.</p>

            . Last Thursday was se'nnight, the Prisoner at the bar, had her mother's hat on: her mother said to me, I wish you would be so good as to call upon my Hannah, and ask her for my hat. I went to the Chequers, and she was not there; a young woman there, said she was at such a house.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Armstead. This was at ten in the morning: I went to her, and said, where is your mother's hat? said she, it is at the Chequers; said she, if I had money, I'd treat you with a pint of beer; I said, I have money: I told her, I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175907110014"/> going to Shoreditch, to tell my mistress I could not bring home any work 'till next week, and I would come back for the hat: then I went into Shoreditch, and came back again, at about half an hour after eleven; I staid with her, 'till within a quarter of four, and had four pints of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this ?</p>
               <p>Armstead. This was at the Chequers in Chick-lane: she never was out of my company, but only once, to go out into the yard to make water, (excuse me) all that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you ? how do you get your livelihood?</p>
               <p>Armstead. My husband is a Tinman; he works in Fleet-street, at Mr Monkland's.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Armstead. I live in Stonecutter-street, in the New-market, at Mrs Graham's, a Mantua-maker; we dined together at that house in Chick-lane, that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your husband?</p>
               <p>Armstead. He was at work.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does he dine?</p>
               <p>Armstead. He goes to an Ale-house commonly, every day, to dine.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to an ale-house in Chick-lane?</p>
               <p>Armstead. I went there for her mother's hat; and she said, I'll be with my mother at four o'clock, and bring it; the next morning, I heard she was in trouble; as for the hat, I can bring proof where that was bought.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you for dinner ?</p>
               <p>Armstead. We had a piece of boiled buttock of bee f, and cabbage; and the people of the house had beans and pickled pork.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Can you swear the prisoner at the bar, is the same woman that was with you in that empty house?</p>
               <p>Vialls. She is the same woman.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time can you say, it was, that you missed your watch?</p>
               <p>Vialls. It was much about one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see this evidence that day?</p>
               <p>Vialls. No; I never saw her, 'till I saw her in the Counter, the next morning, with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. to Armstead. Who saw you together at that time?</p>

               <p>Carden. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect what company you had at your house last Thursday was se'nnight ?</p>
               <p>Carden. I have great reason to remember that day, for if it had not been for me the prisoner had been rescued; she was taken up at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the prisoner at the bar come into your house first that day ?</p>
               <p>Carden. She first came in about nine o'clock at night: I know the prosecutor took her before the Watch was set, and she refused to go along with him; I told him he himself was a proper officer to take up a thief wherever he found her; and if he wanted any assistance I would assist him; at last she got out at the door; there the soldier stood over her while the prosecutor went for an officer; in a minute's time I heard a mob about the door; I ran out to the soldier for him to make use of his sword; and said, if he did not very smartly, they would rescue her. I assisted him from the door all the way up the court, and there I left him.</p>

               <p>Q. Had the prisoner ever used to dine at your house?</p>
               <p>Carden. She has come into my tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect her dining at your house that day?</p>
               <p>Carden. I do not recollect her coming into my house that day, 'till the men came in and charged her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she not in your house in the forenoon?</p>
               <p>Carden. I cannot be positive that she was; to the best of my knowledge she came into my house first, about a quarter of an hour before the prosecutor came in and took her.</p>
               <p>Q. Look well at the evidence

               <p>Carden. Yes, I should: but I do not remember the prisoner being in my house that day, 'till about a quarter of an hour before she was taken up by the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you for dinner that day?</p>
               <p>Carden. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you boiled beef ?</p>
               <p>Carden. I think I had not: the season is partly over for boiled beef.</p>

               <p>Q. If the prisoner had dined at your house that day, and spent about four hours there, do you think you should not remember it?</p>
               <p>Mrs Carden. The prisoner never in her life dined in my house except on bread and cheese.</p>

               <p>Mrs Carden. That I cannot say: I can't remember whether she did or not, I have too many in my family.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in your house from one o'clock that day 'till she was taken up?</p>

There was also a wrapping at the window shutters. I let it down; then the prisoner at the bar presented a pistol to me, and ordered me to deliver my money. I told him I would, and lean'd back in the coach, in order to get out my money. Seeing his pistol to be a long one, I thought it might easily be secured. When he advanced for my money I struck at the pistol, and he having his finger on the trigger I imagine was the cause of it's going off, and not by any design of his. He ran away from the coach; I jump'd out, and pursued him over a field to some new buildings, where he fell down an arch that was turned for a cellar at my Lord Foley's. I jump'd down, and Mr Hall after me. The prisoner ran along the cellar under the house, I seeing the light before me at the other end, found he did not go out there. I call'd to Mr Hall, and said softly; I heard the prisoner pant. Mr Hall had his sword drawn in his hand. I said, if he will not speak, run him through the body. Mr Hall found him, and desir'd him to surrender, or he would run him through the body; he immediately surrendered. We found him without his coat, which we found afterwards he had left near the place where he stopp'd us. We carried him to the round-house, and the next morning before Mr Fielding, who bound us over.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you be sure the prisoner is the man: Did you never lose sight of him in the pursuit.</p>
               <p>Kerrich. I never lost sight of him 'till he fell into the area, and ran under the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Kerrich. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body near you when your coach was stopp'd ?</p>
               <p>Kerrich. Mr Leheup, was with me in the coach, but is lame. He told me afterwards a man ran by him. He could not pursue; but it is impossible for it to have been any body else, I followed him so close.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the pistol?</p>
               <p>Kerrich. I had it in my hand, and by pressing his finger made it go off.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say when you took him?</p>
               <p>Kerrich. He said he was extreamly sorry in being guilty of what he had done; and that he was rather glad he was taken, because it might prevent him from being guilty of greater crimes.</p>
               <p>Mr Hall. I was in the coach with Mr Kerrich, and heard the word stop. As soon as the window was let down, I saw a pistol come into the coach, but did not see the man that presented it. I saw Mr Kerrich, instead of delivering his money, seize the pistol. I opened the coach on the other side, and got out, and drew my sword, and saw the man running away, and Mr Kerrich after him. The coach went on immediately on the pistol's going off. I pursued also.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you pursue him?</p>
               <p>Hall. I believe we might pursue him a hundred or two hundred yards. I never was that road before. We pursued him over two fields, and I saw him either jump or tumble down an arch that was turned for a cellar. Mr Kerrich was a little before me. We pursued him under the passage; there was a light at the other end. Mr Kerrich told me, he had not gone out there; for if he had, he must have seen him; he desired I would stop; we stopp'd, and heard him breathe. I felt about with the point of my sword, and found his cloaths, and said, if he would not get up, I would run him through the body. He got up, and we seized him, and took him to the place where he stopped us. There we found his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he own it to be his coat?</p>
               <p>Hall. I think he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he put it on?</p>
               <p>Hall. He did. He said he was very sorry for what he had done. Mr Kerrich said, then why did you fire the pistol. He said, he did not recollect he had fired it. He said, he was very glad that he was taken so soon, for he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175907110017"/> might have been guilty of other crimes, which might have brought him to the gallows.</p>

               <p>Stone. He went from me about three years ago, and lived with my father a year. I hired him from a neighbour, one Mr Gurney, where he had lived a year. After he went to Mr Parker he used to come to see me now and then.</p>

               <p>Stone. He is a Carver, and lives at Marybone. The prisoner always bore a very good character, and was he at liberty I would hire him again.</p>

            . I am a Carver, and live at Marybone; the prisoner bound himself to me an apprentice; he has served about eighteen months, and has behaved as well as I could wish. He might have robbed me had he been so minded, as I gave him opportunity in several respects with regard to money. He stay'd out all night, I think it was the 1st of June; it gave me some surprize; and while I was inquiring of my other people for him, the beadle sent a person to acquaint me that he was in the Round-house.</p>
               <p>Q. From his general behaviour, notwithstanding this, would you venture him in your house again?</p>
               <p>Parker. Yes, and down on my knees, and return the Court thanks, and so would his other masters. I have had great proof of his honesty. I have sent him to a Gentleman in London for five or ten guineas at a time, that I do not settle with sometimes for three years together: he has always brought it me just: he might have kept it a year unknown to me. Where I went out to receive money once, I have sent him five times.</p>

He said, the road he was in was a delightful fine road, and he would ride that road a little farther, and went on with me about a quarter of a mile. Then he asked me, what gentleman's seat that was which we saw? I said, the Duke of Argyle's. soon after, as I was talking to him, he clapp'd a pistol to my breast, and said, Your money. I was very much surprized, and desired him to take it away; and said, what I had should be at his service, and directly gave him my bag, in which, I suppose, were a 36 s. piece, a 27 s. piece, and three half guineas; but I am sure there was the money laid in the indictment, and a 6 d. Then he said, Your watch. I said, no watch indeed. He d - d me, and bid me dismount: he unbutton'd my waistcoat, and said, you conceal the watch, d - n you. I said, I have none indeed. Then he said, I must have your bridle; I was so affrighted I could not pull it off; he got from his horse and pulled it off, and drove my horse away with the bridle in his hand. He asked me my name, and place of abode. I told him, my name was Jibbet, and I lived in Bond-street; then he got on his horse, and was going away, and asked me, where I should see him again? I told him, his place should be mine; the Bell at Hounslow, if he pleased. He said that would not do, but if I would meet him on Monday morning by them five trees, pointing to them; if possible he would give me my money again. I said, Sir, if you please to give me my bag; he said, I'll give it you: he looked at it, and said, it was a common canvas bag, and that it would be of service to him; and he would leave my bridle about half a mile up the road. My horse made it's way to the Red Lion at Hounslow. I saw the man ride down to Hanworth; and I saw him, I believe, two miles and a half a-head. I went away to Teddington and sent the hostler for the bridle, and he brought it with the head-stall cut. He was cloathed in black, with spatterdashes buttoned up, and a piece of black crape about his neck. His horse was a brown bay, no white, only his legs. I took a great deal of notice of his horse when he went off. I have seen just such a horse since at Mr Tootings, a Hosier in Oxford road: I can't say it is the same horse, but as much like it as possible. I was before Mr Fielding when the prisoner was there. I believe the prisoner at the bar is the same man.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he any thing to disguise his face?</p>
               <p>Randall. I am very sure he is the man; I know him from a thousand.</p>

            . I took the prisoner on Saturday last, the latter part of the afternoon, at the house where he lodges; he came with a pair of black spatterdashes and a whip in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to suspect this man?</p>
               <p>Stokes. Mr. Green, where he was a lodger seven weeks, told an acquaintance of mine of an advertisement, and said, he believed he had an highway-man in his house. We went and looked at the horse in the stable, and while we were at Mr Green's house I jumped up and took him. He made no defence at all. I took this canvas bag out of his pocket. Producing one.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the canvas bag which the prisoner took from me, it is a very remarkable one, lined part of the way up.</p>
               <p>Stokes. Here are two pocket-pistols, and a paper of gun-powder, which we took out of his pocket loaded with balls.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was much such a pistol as this he held to my breast, it shone very much.</p>
               <p>Stokes. I asked him what he did with those pistols; he said, he carried them for fear of bailiffs. Going to Justice Fielding's he said, Pray gentlemen, if you can't do me good, do me no harm, don't mention the fire-arms.</p>
               <p>Richard Green. The prisoner lodged in my house seven weeks: I live in Fleet-street, opposite the Bolt and Tun-Inn: I am a Pen-Cutter. The prisoner came in on the Monday night (before the Wednesday on which the robbery was committed) and sent for a tankard of beer; drinking it, he said, he was going to dinner with some gentlemen, on one side Brentford the next day. He desired I would recommend him to a house: I told him a friend of mine had one to let. He went and the horse was to be ready for him the next morning. He left my house on Tuesday morning about five o'clock. I don't know what dress he went out with. He returned on Wednesday night between eight and nine: then he was dressed in black, and a black thing about his neck and spatterdashes on. He went out on Thursday morning in black, and came home with those on he has now, a red waistcoat and brown coat.</p>

               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Conolly. She had been with me, I believe, two nights; I do not exactly know the time: when her bed-fellow came home, she went to go to bed; she came and told, the sheets were missing; and said, the prisoner was a servant at the Bull-and-Mouth. I went there, and told the man of the house what had happened; and he said, if he met with her he would keep her, and send for me; which he did: I took her to Justice Fielding; going along, in Covent-Garden, she acknowledged to me the taking of the sheets; and said, she would go and pawn her stays, and get them again.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say she had done with the sheets?</p>
               <p>Conolly. She said she had either sold or pawn'd them, for 2 s. to Mrs Parsons, in Gray's-Inn-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell which it was she said?</p>
               <p>Conolly. I think she said she had sold them: I went with the constable to Mrs Parsons's, and we took Cannon with us, and ask'd for the sheets; Mrs Parsons produc'd them: produc'd in court; I cannot swear to them.</p>

               <p>Walker. Mr Conolly said they cost him 5 s. at first, and they are not at all worn.</p>

               <p>Eliz. Pitman, jun. I was gone into the yard about some business, and when I came in I found the prisoner leaning over the counter, close to the glass case. I came behind the counter, and asked her, what she wanted. She said, a half-penny worth of bread. I had some suspicion she had taken something, because I found the glass case not quite shut. I turned her cloak aside to see if I could see the ribband, and she had none. I served her with bread and she went home directly. After that I looked in the glass case, and missed several parcels of ribband. I went over the way but could not find the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before?</p>
               <p>Pitman, jun. No; I never saw her before to my knowledge. I went and told a neighbour of it. She had seen her lurking about at the door. In less than half an hour the prisoner came through the court; and the gentlewoman that I had told it to, beckoned to me to go after her. I went and brought her in. I asked her for my ribband and she took it out of her bosom, and laid it on the counter, and own'd she took it. Produc'd in court, and deposed to.</p>
               <p>Q. How much is there of it?</p>
               <p>Pitman, jun. There is about ten yards of it; but I lost a great deal more.</p>

               <p>Smith. She lives in Hedge-Lane. When I came back again the prisoner was in the entry. He said to me, My cock, how do you do? I said, I am very middling; I have lost so and so. He took me to an alehouse, and said, he was very sorry, and treated me with three pints of beer; and bid the man of the house to me have the value of a shilling in liquor, or let thereabouts, when I should come that way. I took the people of the house up that I took the room of. We could find nothing upon them. I had a suspicion of the prisoner, and had a warrant for him, and went and found him upon his own bed, and carried him before justice Cox. We had a search-warrant afterwards, and his box was fetch'd before Mr. Cox, in which we found 7 guineas and a half of my money, and my cloaths; my watch was found in his pocket, and a 6 d. that I can swear to. We also found in his pocket a pocket-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you swear to the money found in his box?</p>

            . I am a Constable. In the morning we got some women of the town and carried them before Mr Cox. The prosecutor came and asked for me, and said, he had been robbed of the things mentioned: mentioning them. I introduced him to Mr Cox. After that I went up to the watch-house with some girls. Mr Cox sent for me, (I left them there) he gave me a warrant to apprehend the prisoner: I went and found him asleep across his bed; when I had got him before the Justice, he pulled out a watch from his pocket and gave it me, and said, it was the prosecutor's watch. Mr Cox desired me to search his pockets. I took out a six-pence, which the prosecutor swore to as his property. We examined him, what was become of the rest of the things and money. He said to me, if you'll go and drink a pint of beer with me I'll tell you. I said, you may as well tell me here: then he said, they were in his box in his room. We went and found his box and brought it to the Justice's; and as I took the things out, I asked him whose they were: he said, the cloaths and money belonged to that young man. Meaning the prosecutor. The watch and money sealed up with the Justice's seal, and cloaths, produced in court.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure the watch and cloaths are my property.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to get into your room, did he lie in that house that night ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, he did not: I cannot tell how he got into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he use to come to that house?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He was frequently in the house; he had a great inti macy with one of the people of the house, two young women that I took the room of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this silver among your gold when you lost it?</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. No: my gold and silver were separate, my silver was in my left hand breeches pocket, and my gold in the right.</p>
               <p>Q. to Fitz. Did the prisoner tell you how he came by these things?</p>
               <p>Fitz. No, he did not: he said, with regard to the watch, a woman gave it him: and he cursed all women-kind.</p>
               <p>Q. What woman did the prisoner say gave it him?</p>
               <p>Fitz. He said, it was the maid to the woman that kept the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he say this before?</p>
               <p>Fitz. This he said before the Justice and myself: and then he said it was the prosecutor's watch.</p>

               <p>I had been out, and one of the girls was standing at the door when I returned. She asked me to go in: I went into the passage. She brought me this watch out. I asked her what I was to do with it: then she brought me out the cloaths, and desired me to take them while morning into my room. I told her I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175907110025"/> not know what to do with them. She said, you'll let them abide there 'till morning; the money was in the pockets. As near as I can guess it was between one and two in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Did you know these young women that lived in the house at that time?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were either of them in your room that night?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, neither was.</p>

               <p>Black. I never knew one instance of any bad behaviour since he has been with me. The time when he was taken is the proper hours for him to do his business. We begin to mash at two o'clock in the morning.</p>

               <p>Another witness. When he came first to Mr. Black, he lodged along with me for about six months: he behaved exceeding well.</p>

I trusted him all the time as my own child; he has behaved very regular n all shapes in the world. I would have trusted him with untold gold.</p>

            . I keep a Publick-house. Last Saturday between nine and ten o'clock, the prisoner and the deceased, and another man, came to my house to drink a tankard or two of beer; they staid in the yard some time. I got Miller to assist me to do a little jobb, and gave him a full pot of beer, and they were a penny or three-half-pence each towards some more: then said this Miller to the prisoner, I'll give you a touch at sticks for a full pot of beer. Said the prisoner, I never could play with a stick, but I'll play with you at your game, and after that you shall with me at mine. They went out into the yard and found two sticks, and went to fighting with them; the deceased broke his stick over the prisoner's head; after that they dropped their sticks and went to fighting with their fists. Miller came up to Price and took hold of him and tore his shirt; then Price resented it, and seemed to be very angry, and said, he had rather he had torn so much of his skin; then they went to fighting, and Miller the deceased ran his head into Price's breast; presently Price took the same opportunity and served him the same sauce; by running his head under Miller's chin, and he dropped down dead directly, never spoke nor never moved afterwards.</p>

I was along with the prisoner and deceased drinking at this time: the deceased gave the prisoner a challenge first for five shillings: at first it was proposed to fight with sticks: the prisoner said, Elick, I don't want to quarrel. The deceased started up soon after and pulled out six-pence and said, now I'll lick you with a stick: he threw his money on the table. Then the prisoner said, I don't value six-pence, come out at the door, if you lick me I shall hit you again; then the deceased ran into the yard and got a stick; the prisoner followed him; then they went to fighting with two sticks; they broke their sticks and took hold of one another, and went to work with their fists.

            . I live with Mr Darking: he is one of Church-Wardens of Stepney Parish. After the church had a second time been robbed I was in Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the second time the church had been robbed?</p>
               <p>How. The church was robbed on the Wednesday, and I saw the lead on the Friday in Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the month was the Friday?</p>
               <p>How. That was on the 23d of March: it was in a sand-cart.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day?</p>
               <p>How. It was a little after five in the morning: near the Green-Dragon Inn-door: but when I came back again, after I had been and loaded a cart with dung, then at seven o'clock I saw the cart standing opposite to Mrs Smith's door. I was going by and looked into the cart, and saw it to be sheet-lead, and I had a thought in myself that it was some of Stepney church lead.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing over it to conceal it?</p>
               <p>How. There was a little litter and dung-like stuff over it, and the litter had fallen down between it, so that I could see part of the lead; and it being in a sand-cart, made me suspect it to have been stolen. I went home and told my mistress, and she acquainted my master of it, and he came to Mrs Smith's house.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it you saw this lead in a sand cart by Mrs Smith's door?</p>
               <p>How. It was about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not all the shops in the street open?</p>
               <p>How. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so openly to be seen that any body by looking into the cart might see it?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175907110028"/>How. Any body might see it if they thought proper to look.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not publickly standing at the door?</p>
               <p>How. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it broad day-light?</p>
               <p>How. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs Smith's shop open or not?</p>

               <p>How. I cannot tell whether it was or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Some time after this, did not you go with Mr Hemsworth and one of my Lord-Mayor's officers, to look after the men he bought this lead of?</p>
               <p>How. I did: we went to Clerkenwell to examine the man. Mr Hemsworth said, the man had made a mistake in the receipt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the man you went after?</p>

               <p>How. No: I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you propose to go and see if you could find the two men?</p>
               <p>How. He proposed to go and see for the men, and said, he had made a mistake in the receipt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr Hemsworth ever advise the men to run away?</p>
               <p>How. No: he bid us go to a publick-house, and said, he would go and see for the men, and then he would come to us.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you mean?</p>
               <p>How. I mean Child and Guest.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>How. This was on the Saturday, that is, the day after I had seen the lead.</p>
               <p>Q. Who proposed to you to go to see for Guest and Child?</p>
               <p>How. Mr Hemsworth did.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had been desirous that they should have made their escape, would it have been proper to have taken you along with him?</p>
               <p>How. I can't tell that. I don't know what he had in his head; we did not all go into the house together, where one or both were: he bid us go to the publick-house.</p>
               <p>Q. And what was to be done then?</p>
               <p>How. He was to bring Guest and Child to us; he said so; he did not bring them; he said, the man was putting on his coat, and he would soon come to us.</p>
               <p>Q. Was one of my Lord-Mayor's officers with you?</p>
               <p>How. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. How near that house was you?</p>
               <p>How. We went just by the door, and Mr Hemsworth went in and spoke to the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him speak to him?</p>
               <p>How. No.</p>

               <p>Counsel for Crown. Where did Mr Hemsworth carry you first of all?</p>
               <p>How. From Mrs Smith's house to Justice Ives's in Spittal-Fields.</p>
               <p>Counsel for Crown. What did you go there for?</p>
               <p>How. To have the warrant backed in Middlesex.</p>
               <p>Counsel for Crown. Where did you go next?</p>
               <p>How. Then we went to Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Counsel for Crown. Did not you hear my Lord-Mayor's officer ask him, how he came to carry you about so?</p>
               <p>How. No: I did not.</p>
               <p>Counsel for Prisoners. You say Mr Hemsworth saw the man, how came you not to see him?</p>
               <p>How. He bid us go to a publick-house and call for a tankard of beer, and he went into that house by himself.</p>
               <p>Counsel for Prisoners. What opposition did he make to your going? did he say he would not let you go into that house?</p>
               <p>How. He said, the man was putting his coat on, and he would be there presently.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the agreement (before you came to the house) between the officer, Hemsworth, and you, that you should go to a publick-house, and he should bring the people to you?</p>
               <p>How. No: we made no agreement about it. I thought he would have brought them to us.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did he propose to find out Guest and Child?</p>
               <p>How. He proposed to find them out, he said, they had made a mistake in the receipt that was wrote.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you the lead was brought to his mistress's house by them?</p>
               <p>How. He did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175907110029"/>Q. Did he go to find them out in order to prove from whence they had that lead?</p>
               <p>How. Yes: he said, he would bring them to us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you he had seen them?</p>
               <p>How. He did.</p>
               <p>Counsel for Crown. Did he bring them?</p>
               <p>How. No: but he told us they would come.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he wait there expecting they would come?</p>
               <p>How. He did. We stay'd there some time and drank a tankard of beer; and then he said he thought they would not come: this was after we had been there half an hour.</p>
               <p>Counsel for Crown. Did he propose your going into that house?</p>
               <p>How. No.</p>
               <p>Counsel for Prisoners. Did he object to your going there?</p>

               <p>How. Yes.</p>
               <p>Counsel for Prisoners. What were his words?</p>
               <p>How. He bid us go to the publick-house and call for a tankard of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the Green Dragon from Mrs Smith's house?</p>
               <p>How. It is about a hundred yards distance; it is in the same street: I never measured the ground.</p>
               <p>Jos. Darking. I am one of the church-wardens of the parish of Stepney. On the twenty-third of March last I was just come home from the church, and my wife told me, that this witness, How, had told her, he had seen some lead at Mrs Smith's shop in Bishopsgate-street, that he suspected to be the lead that was stolen from off our church. I went there directly, and gave a little knock at the door; nobody coming, I opened it and went in, and asked for Mrs Smith. I went to the counting-house door; there was Mrs Smith. I believe she came up stairs; but I am not sure she came up stairs or down. I still kept going farther up into the shop. I said, I am informed you have bought some lead which was brought in a sand-cart this morning. I am church-warden at Stepney, and our church has been robbed, and I desire to see it. A little farther lay some lead. I said, this is it, She said, this is gutter-lead. I asked her, who she bought it of; she said, she bought it of some Carpenters that were pulling down some old houses, which she said was very often the case. Said I, I am in the building way, and I know it is not gutter-lead, for it is flat lead; and I believed it to be the same lead that came off Stepney church.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it obvious to every discerning eye to know, that was not gutter-lead?</p>
               <p>Darking. To a Plumber it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you know it by?</p>
               <p>Darking. I knew it by the spikes that were in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business?</p>
               <p>Darking. I am a Bricklayer. After I told her, it was the lead that came off Stepney church. I said, pray, who did you buy it off? She said, the persons names were

            , and shew'd me the receipt for the money which she paid them. I asked her, whether she had bought any lead of them before? And told her, we had lost such a quantity of lead from off the church about three weeks before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention the quantity?</p>
               <p>Darking. I did; about 900 weight and upwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What was her answer?</p>
               <p>Darking. She said, she believed she had bought it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say this without any hesitation ?</p>
               <p>Darking. She was seemingly in a flutter. She told me very freely, she believed she had bought it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask her, or did she tell you she had bought this of the same persons whom she bought the other of.</p>
               <p>Darking. She did not; nor I did not ask her that question, as she had told me she had bought such a quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. When she was before the alderman did she say the same?</p>
               <p>Darking. I believe she was ask'd the question, but I will not be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you advertise the first robbery?</p>
               <p>Darking. We did three times in the Daily Advertiser, Feb. the 9th, and March the 11th, were two of the days; I can't particularly tell the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175907110030"/>Q. Did you advertise any reward on the discovery ?</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first came to Mrs Smith's, you say, you asked for her?</p>
               <p>Darking. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appear?</p>
               <p>Darking. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she, when you ask'd her if she had bought lead that came there that morning in a sand-cart, own she had bought th at?</p>
               <p>Darking. She did without hesitation.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find at that time she was any way wavering?</p>
               <p>Darking. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not Child and Guest Carpenters?</p>
               <p>Darking. Child was a Weaver, and Guest was a Carpenter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear Child had been in another business?</p>
               <p>Darking. I have heard he kept a Broker's shop.</p>

            ; and told me where they lived; and shewed me the receipt without asking for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it wrote by?</p>
               <p>Darking. It was wrote by Mr Hemsworth.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she say those persons lived.</p>
               <p>Darking. She said some were in Old-street. Then I went immediately away to Mr Alderman Cokayne.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the lead in very large pieces?</p>
               <p>Darking. It was flat and cut, and thrown all in a heap, and some other lead mixed amongst it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at Mrs Smith's a second time?</p>
               <p>Darking. I was: then there was one Mr Walker there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give open and free answers to all your questions ?</p>
               <p>Darking. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she do the same before the Alderman?</p>
               <p>Darking. That you may ask the Alderman. I was not by all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this receipt - (he takes one in his hand.)</p>
               <p>Darking. This is the receipt which Mrs Smith produced to me. I believe Mr Hemsworth said, if I would go along with him to one Mr 
               <persName id="t17590711-27-person254">
                  Johnson

             a Weaver, he said, he belived he could give a good character of Child; and so said Mrs Smith; and Mr Hemsworth went with me to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a character did Mr Johnson give him?</p>
               <p>Darking. He said, he had known him six or seven years ago, but could not tell where he lived then, for he had-not worked for him a great while.</p>
               <p>Q. When was Mrs Smith first accused?</p>
               <p>Darking. I cannot tell the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. When was Mr Hemsworth first accused?</p>
               <p>Darking. He was not accused 'till after the prisoners were brought to London.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Hemsworth first to be accused, and where?</p>
               <p>Darking. It was by the evidence Child's swearing against him at justice Feilding's; but I was not there.</p>
               <p>Counsel for Crown. When Hemsworth said the persons of whom this lead had been bought lived at such a place, did you find that information to be true or false?</p>
               <p>Darking. I found it to be false.</p>
               <p>Counsel for Prisoners. Did you find they had lived there?</p>
               <p>Darking. They had lived there: they had lived in eight or nine different places. I went with him all the way up Chick-lane, and could not find them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you since learned that they had lived there?</p>
               <p>Darking. Yes; but not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you hear that they did live there?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175907110031"/>Darking. Somebody told me so, but I do not know who it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to believe, that at the time Mr Hemsworth told you those persons lived there, that he himself knew to the contrary of what he had told you?</p>
               <p>Darking. That is too deep a matter to be entered into by me. I cannot tell what he thought.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you did not find, (by enquiring at that very place where Hemsworth said he lived, and the neighbours said he had lived,) the place where he then lived?</p>
               <p>Darking. I did not hear where he lived that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not at that place find out where they lived?</p>
               <p>Darking. No; not at that place.</p>

               <p>Q. Whether you did not, by means of the information you received by Hemsworth, find where they lived?</p>
               <p>Darking. No; I did not at that time; nor no other time.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to find them out?</p>
               <p>Darking. By the rest of the gentlemen going. Mr Hemsworth and I went and we could not find them out.</p>
               <p>Q. from Hemsworth. Whether or no we did not get a direction from Mr Johnson.</p>
               <p>Darking. Yes. But we could not find them by that direction.</p>
               <p>Hemsworth. Mr Johnson gave us the direction out of his book; Child having work'd for him: did not we see a man at the place, who said, Child did live there but was removed?</p>
               <p>Darking. That is very true, but we did not find him by that.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell how they were found out?</p>
               <p>Darking. No; I went no farther with them in their inquiry after them, than the first day.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Johnson say, when Hemsworth brought you there?</p>
               <p>Darking. He said Child had work'd for him, four, five, or six years ago; and that he had lived at such and such places; but the man that wrote us the note, told us he could not be certain that he could direct us to him.</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Cokayne. On the twenty-third of March Mr Darking applyed to me, and said, he had found some lead at Mrs Smith's, a Plumber, in Bishopsgate-street, that he suspected to have been stolen from off Stepney church: I went, and saw the lead, and saw it weighed: I sent for Mr Walker, for his opinion of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs Smith insist upon it's being gutter-lead ?</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Cokayne. No; she did not to me.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the conversation you had with her?</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Cokayne. It was about who she bought it of, and what she gave for it: she shew'd me her receipt, I think it was to this purport.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she answer freely ?</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Cokayne. She did, very freely: I told her it would be necessary she should produce this said

            : she said she was very sorry, and that she believed it was the lead that came from Stepney church.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this at your first discourse with her?</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Cokayne. No, this was upon our examining the pieces of lead; and finding the nails in it, then she was of the same opinion that I was of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr Walker there, then?</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Cokayne. Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she mention where the man lived?</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Cokayne. She did mention some where in Chick-lane: I said, she ought to have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175907110032"/> known this man before she had bought this lead of him: she said, she took him to be a very honest man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say what business he carried on?</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Cokayne. She said, he kept a Broker's shop: then they got a warrant, and got it back'd, and went immediately in search of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she mention any thing of Guest?</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Cokayne. No, she said nothing about him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she speak about the place of Child's residence, as if she was certain of it?</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Cokayne. No, she did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any application to you, from either of the prisoners at the bar, in order to stop this prosecution?</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Cokayne. No, none at all to me.</p>
               <p>Q. At the Vestry, at Stepney, were there ever any application made of that sort ?</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Cokayne. There was some application made.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at that Vestry ?</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Cokayne. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the application?</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Cokayne. There was a proposal to put the lead in the same state as it was, provided the prosecution be dropp'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this made by?</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Cokayne. This was made by Mrs Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the lead correspond, when weighed, with the receipt?</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Cokayne. It did.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say, at that time, you thought she had bought it, knowing it to have been stolen ?</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Cokayne. I cannot say that I had?</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect you made use of such an expression: (it seemed to be a fair bargain.)</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Cokayne. It was pretty near it, it was within a shilling per hundred weight: Mr Walker told me, he would have given me thirteen-shillings per hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you suppose a credible house-keeper would buy stolen lead, knowing it to be so, for saving one thirteenth part.</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Cokayne. No, I cannot suppose it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then make her enter into recognizance?</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Cokayne. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you easily conceive, that a person would rather put as much more lead on a place, rather than to come here to be tried for it?</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Cokayne. I should easily conceive that.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you, from thence, imagine that the person acknowledged to have received it, knowing it to have been stolen?</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Cokayne. No, I should not, by that, imagine any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hemsworth attend at the Vestry ?</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Cokayne. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who attended there, for Mrs Smith?</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Cokayne. She attended personally.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing you yourself in the situation she was, by buying this lead, under these circumstances, as it appeared to her, when you had examined into it, would not you have proposed to have restated the lead, rather than be brought to a Court about it?</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Cokayne. I should indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Mrs Smith?</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Cokayne. I have known her twenty years, she lived in our neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. What is her character?</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Cokayne. I never heard any thing ill of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear she was suspected of buying stolen goods?</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Cokayne. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Hemsworth?</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Cokayne. I do, I have known him a long time.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his character?</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Cokayne. I never heard any ill of him.</p>
               <p>The Court did not think it necessary to call upon the prisoners for their defence; but told them it was an inadvertent act in buying lead of such persons, of whom they had so slender a knowledge; and directed the Jury to acquit them, without summing up the evidence.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was she married?</p>
               <p>Simms. She was married to Mr Harris, in her own house, in Botolph-lane; right against Mr Harris's house.</p>
               <p>Q. What was her former husband?</p>
               <p>Simms. He was an Orange-Merchant; and so was Mr Harris.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they married?</p>
               <p>Simms. The ceremony according to the Church of England was read over.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it, that you was there?</p>
               <p>Simms. Mr Harris desired me to come there, on a Sunday morning, to Mrs Jones's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you for what purpose?</p>
               <p>Simms. No, he did not, 'till I came there; then he said, he sent for me to be present at his marriage: he and I were very intimate, as two brothers, for twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came there, that Sunday morning, who was present?</p>
               <p>Simms. There was nobody there but Mrs Jones, he, and the gentleman that married them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her away?</p>
               <p>Simms. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did?</p>
               <p>Simms. The Minister that married them did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a Clergyman of the Church of England?</p>
               <p>Simms. He was in a Minister's dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you account for their being married in private?</p>
               <p>Simms. Mr. Harris's mother had propos'd another marriage for him, was the reason.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this marriage?</p>
               <p>Simms. This was the second of Oct. 1748.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his mother reconciled afterwards?</p>
               <p>Simms. She was, somewhat more: Mrs Jones had two children, by her former husband.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the mother live afterwards?</p>
