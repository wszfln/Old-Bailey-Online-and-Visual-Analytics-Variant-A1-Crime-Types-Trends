Last thursday I took her myself, and charged her with taking them. She confess'd she took them, and told me where they were; I took her before a justice of the peace, and she confess'd the same there; he committed her, I went and found the things accordingly.

               <p>Hill. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not sign-a paper to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hill. I did.</p>

               <p>Hill. He takes it in his hand (here is my name)</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the care of your sheep at the time you lost this sheep?</p>
               <p>Hill. No, he had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not the prisoner sheep of his own on the common?</p>
               <p>Hill. I believe he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he 20?</p>
               <p>Hill. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you come to suspect the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hill. I heard he had drove such a sheep to Brown's Wells on Finchley Common; I enquired of him where the skin was sold, and the person there told me it was to Mr. Slayter; I went and found the skin there.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Hill. This was I believe on the 9th of Oct. instant; upon finding the skin there, I desired Mr. Slayter to go with me to Mr. Cross; after he said he had the skin of Mr. Keyton, I got a warrant for Mr. Keyton, and the prisoner also, and served it on the prisoner at Brown's Wells that night, and the next morning I took him before the justice of the peace.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had serv'd him with this warrant, did you let him go at liberty, on the promise that he would come again the next morning?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176010220004"/>Hill. No, I did not: I do not know what the constable might do, but I found him there the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the same marks to your sheep?</p>
               <p>Hill. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not the common way to put the initial letters of your name on them, with a pitch brand?</p>
               <p>Hill. Our mark is a cross-bow.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this sheep mark'd with that mark?</p>
               <p>Hill. No; it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how can you be sure it was your property?</p>
               <p>Hill. It was a very remarkable one, mark'd with fresh oaker.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether people in general do not put the initial letters of their names on their sheep?</p>
               <p>Hill. They do, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the prisoner, who has sheep of his own, does not keep his sheep without any brand mark at all, on purpose to distinguish them from others?</p>
               <p>Hill. I have seen a good many mark'd with D. F. and oaker on the hip, which I suppose to be his sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never see any of his sheep without any mark?</p>
               <p>Hill. No.</p>
               <p>Q. As this skin that you found in the custody of Slayter has no mark at all, and your's are mark'd, how came you to imagine it to be your sheep?</p>
               <p>Hill. That sheep happen'd to slip out when we were marking the sheep, and we knowing it to be a very remarkable one, with the off leg behind black, and a red mark on the rump, we thought it had no need of any mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all this man's sheep mark'd with

               <p>Hill. All that ever I saw were: and red oaker on the rump, not the hip.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not discharg'd Fitzwater once?</p>
               <p>Hill. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what account?</p>
               <p>Hill. Upon a little affair; about ordering a boy to go of an errant: he said, he should not go till he had done something to the sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it for something dishonest?</p>
               <p>Hill. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner?</p>

               <p>Q. When had you seen that sheep last.</p>
               <p>Fitzwater. I took particular notice of it on the 3d of October, on the common, it was a very remarkable one.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe what was remarkable.</p>
               <p>Fitzwater. It was a thin-horn'd one, a black hock behind, and a speckle face, with red oaker on the rump.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not other sheep on the common mark'd with red oaker?</p>
               <p>Fitzwater. There were.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how the prisoner's sheep were mark'd?</p>
               <p>Fitzwater. Yes; with D.F. and a little dot of oaker on the hip, about as big as a crown piece.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain as to this sheep?</p>
               <p>Fitzwater. I knew it particularly well. I look'd after it two years, and I must know it, to be.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been servant to Mr. Hill?</p>
               <p>Fitzwater. I have been servant to him seven years and above.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you once from him?</p>
               <p>Fitzwater. I was, a little while; then the prisoner look'd after the sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you serve your master in any other capacity besides that of a shepherd?</p>
               <p>Fitzwater. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the mark your mastermarks with?</p>
               <p>Fitzwater. Yes; it is a cross-bow.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this sheep mark'd so?</p>
               <p>Fitzwater. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at the examination of the prisoner before the justice of the peace?</p>

               <p>Q. When had you seen that sheep last?</p>
               <p>Fitzwater. I saw it on the 3d of October, amongst my master's sheep; it was my master's property, and I am positive the skin that I saw at Slayter's was the same skin.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to put the cross-bow on it, as you have on all your master's sheep?</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a sheep was it?</p>

               <p>Keyton. It had reddle on the rump; and some dog or other had tore the neck all to pieces; it was very thin, very poor, and very rotten. I kill'd it, and carry'd the skin to Mr. Slayter's.</p>

               <p>Yaulding. I cannot tell the number of them, there might be 18.</p>
               <p>Q. Are any of them here?</p>
               <p>Yaulding. Yes, four of them are; he told me the fallen skins were his perquisites.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any body see you buy them?</p>
               <p>Yaulding. There were half a dozen people by at the time. ( four sheep-skins produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual for shepherds to sell fallen skins?</p>
               <p>Yaulding. I always thought it was the custom.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you distinguish whether the skins were skins of fallen sheep?</p>
               <p>Yaulding. Three of these are such, the other I think is not; that belongs to Mr. Hokin, a farmer at Paddington.</p>

               <p>Q. If any sheep die, is he intitled to their skins as a perquisite?</p>
               <p>Cluen. It never was known in the world as a perquisite in our parish. I have forewarn'd him touching mine many a time.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the value of it?</p>
               <p>Cluen. I put it in the indictment at 8 d. it is worth more money.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a fallen skin?</p>
               <p>Cluen. I thought it was not a fallen skin, but the felmonger says he thinks it is.</p>
               <p>Q. to Yaulding. What did you give for this skin?</p>
               <p>Yaulding. This skin I think I gave 8 d. or 9 d. for it.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to forewarn him not to sell your skins?</p>
               <p>Yaulding. I have lost more sheep this year than usual; and if I saw a sheep lie dead, I soon found the skin was taken off. I don't know but I have lost 20 or 30 this year, and he always said he did not take them.</p>

               <p>James Shoosmith. I met with the two prisoners at the Adam and Eve, hard by Pancras churchyard; Fagan was carrying a pot of beer out, to carry to two men that were cleaning a moat out; the two men ask'd me, if I wanted a jobb? I said, I did not care if I had a jobb.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Shoosmith. This was on a wednesday, three weeks, or near a month ago; the two women at the bar were there; I went to help them, and was to have a shilling for half a day's work.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was to give you the shilling?</p>
               <p>Shoosmith. The man at the Adam and Eve was to give it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you help them?</p>
               <p>Shoosmith. I did for three hours and a half; I had not had much victuals, and I found myself failing; I told the men I could not stand it, and I went out of the mud, and left my shoes in the mud, and could not get them out; I went and thought to go and buy myself a pair of shoes at St. Gyles's. I went down the fields about forty poles from the house, and lay down to rest me. Fagan followed me, and the other came just after her; they were soon both about me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you asleep?</p>
               <p>Shoosmith. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how can you tell what was done?</p>
               <p>Shoosmith. I felt Fagan's hand in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to her?</p>
               <p>Shoosmith. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you feel her hand in your pocket, and say nothing to her?</p>
               <p>Shoosmith. Yes, Sir, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Which pocket was it?</p>
               <p>Shoosmith. It was my right-hand pocket, as I was laying down.</p>

               <p>Shoosmith. No, she did not. I was not quite fast asleep, but I was doasing, then I awaked.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any commerce with either of the women?</p>
               <p>Shoosmith. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose?</p>
               <p>Shoosmith. I lost in all, to tell the plain truth, upwards of 30 guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose money was it?</p>
               <p>Shoosmith. It was my own money.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to have so much money about you?</p>
               <p>Shoosmith. I had had it seven years in my pocket. I have been earning of it ever since I was a little boy; I can bring farmers to witness it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been asleep?</p>
               <p>Shoosmith. I had slept I believe not quite two hours; when I got up, I felt in my pocket, and my money was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you sleep quietly two hours, when you felt the woman's hand in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Shoosmith. I did not sleep after I found her hand in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then charge them with it?</p>
               <p>Shoosmith. No; I got up, but could not tell which way they went, and I had no shoes to follow them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you drunk?</p>
               <p>Shoosmith. No, I was not; I was taken not over and above well.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet with the prisoners again?</p>
               <p>Shoosmith. I found Fagan at the black horse in Dyer's street accidentally, as I was going by the door; then I charg'd her with taking my money.</p>
               <p>Q. And do you swear she took it from you?</p>
               <p>Shoosmith. I do swear she did; they left two half crowns and a shilling in my pocket; she own'd to that going before the justice, just before we came to his house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176010220011"/>Q. What were her words, as near as you can recollect?</p>
               <p>Shoosmith. Said she, I did not leave the rogue desolate, he had no occasion to swear against me; I left him two half crowns and a shilling in his pocket, and I had that left in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of them know that you had money about you?</p>
               <p>Shoothsmith. They both clean'd me when I came out of the mud, and by scraping my breeches my money stuck out; they might perceive it: I bid them keep away, and said, I had no business for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your money loose in your pocket, or in a purse?</p>
               <p>Shoosmith. It was in two parcels, in a purse tied up, and in a bag, or linnen cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever your money again?</p>
               <p>Shoosmith. No, I never had.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say against Saunders?</p>
               <p>Shoosmith. I know she had part of my money.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Shoosmith. We took 17 guineas from her after she was taken; 16 old ones, and 2 half guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that?</p>
               <p>Shoosmith. In the constable's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing upon Fagan?</p>
               <p>Shoosmith. We found 12 s. and 6 d. upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Saunders say which way she came by that money you found upon her?</p>
               <p>Shoosmith. She said, she found it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you lost your money was it, that this money was found on Saunders?</p>
               <p>Shoosmith. It was found the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find either of your bags again?</p>
               <p>Shoosmith. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Jos. Mackdaniel. I am a constable; I search'd the prisoner by order of justice Welch, and found 16 guineas, and two half guineas on Saunders; it was in a little bit of a cloth. (he produc'd the money in a cloth) I am not certain that this cloth is it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is not my cloath.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the money: can you tell whether any part of it is your's?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There is nothing particular on any of them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mackdaniel. How did Saunders say she came by the money?</p>
               <p>Mackdaniel. She said, she found it.</p>

             I took the two prisoners. I took Fagan at the Noah's-ark in Dyer's-street; the other I took at the Turk's-head in the same street. When Fagan was my prisoner, she said to me, a lousy country dog, he had no occasion to swear against her, for she left him two half crowns and a shilling in his pocket; in searching her, I found 12 s. and 6 d. in silver, and a few half-pence ( produc'd in court.)</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What money did you find in your pocket after you had been robb'd?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There was left two half crowns and a shilling.</p>
               <p>Fagan's Defence.</p>
               <p>My fellow prisoner and I went out a gathering of black-berries; going by the church we met two men in the moat; they as'd me, if I would give them any beer; I said, with all pleasure; one of the men said, I will be 3 d to your 3 d. I said, with all my heart; he said, do you go to the Adam and Eve and order it; I did. I happen'd to meet a woman, she ask'd me, what brought me there, and desired me to go to her home with her; I said, another woman was come along with me to go a black-berrying. This man (the prosecutor) was standing by the other men, he stripp'd stark naked to go to fight with the men in the mud. he had not a bit of shirt to his back; he said he was out of work; he was so much in liquor, they help'd him out of the moat; one said, I'll be 6 d. and the other I'll be 6 d. will not you be 6 d. they said to us, we willingly was 6 d. The prosecutor had a pennyworth of bread and cheese, and paid for two pots of beer; he said, he would fight any of them, and stripp'd in the publick house to fight them; I said to them, sie for shame, how could you make the poor creature so in liquor? they said, what is that to you; I said, he will be drown'd if he goes in the water; then he went into the water, they stood on each side and he in the middle; he fell down; I begg'd for God's sake that they would help him out When he got out, he begg'd of me to go and have a pint of beer with him; I said, I will not drink with you; he said, I have money; he put his hand in his pocket, there was a shilling and a half a crown. This woman by me went from me, and she found that money, where she found it I do not know.</p>

               <p>I was in the field, this man wanted me to go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176010220012"/> and drink with him, I would not; he said, I should; we went and drank at the Adam and Eve; then he went to go to work, and fell down on his back in the mud and mire; we cry'd out shame; he call'd for help; the water was as high as his middle; the two men draw'd him out, and he lost both his shoes; I saw only half a crown and a shilling he had about him, upon my word; I found 12 guineas in the field.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner when Dixon pawn'd the saucepan?</p>
               <p>Benbury. I did not, she was not in the shop.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This sheet and saucepan are my property; the prisoner had lock'd up the door, and went away with the key.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she been in your lodging?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. About a month or six weeks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>Dixon took the lodging, and afterwards us'd me very ill; and I left him in the lodgings, and all the things were in the lodgings when I went away.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. She was gone three weeks before him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask her my character.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I knew her about three years ago, she then lodg'd with me, then she behav'd honestly.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you leave her in the house when you went out?</p>
               <p>Bull. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of your house was the money?</p>
               <p>Bull. It was in the till in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body left in the house besides the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Bull. Only a little girl.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you meet with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Bull. My wife found her the next day; we took her before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q What did she say for herself?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176010220013"/>Bull. She did not own it particularly; I was not there all the time, we were call'd by one at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say?</p>
               <p>Bull. I can't tell every word she said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your money again?</p>
               <p>Bull. The money was found upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to the money, or any of it?</p>
               <p>Bull. No, I cannot; there were also two linnen handkerchiefs found upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did they belong to?</p>
               <p>Bu ll. To my wife, as my wife says, but I don't know them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where are they?</p>
               <p>Bull. They are in the hands of the officer, belonging to Old Brentford, but he is not here. She was searched at the Plough at that town, the prisoner own'd she took the money and the handkerchief before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that?</p>
               <p>Bull. I am.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bull. I and my husband were at Hounslow fair on the 6th of this instant, and upon our return the prisoner was gone, and the money too; I found her the next morning, and accused her with taking it; she denied it; she had two handkerchiefs on, my property; we took them from off her neck, they are but of small value, the officer has them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is he?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bull. I have not seen him to-day.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bull. His name is Wheelwright; the prisoner was put into the cage at Old Brentford about three hours; I had an information she had some money about her; she was searched, and a guinea, a nine shilling piece, and two half crowns, and some shillings, were found upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her confess any thing?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bull. She did not own any thing at all, as I heard, concerning taking the money.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say about the handkerchiefs?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bull. She said they were mine, but she did not think of stealing them, but intended to bring them back again; she had lived with me about half a year, I never found her dishonest before; I imagine she was set on by some men to do this, she is very young.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to take them out to show to him?</p>
               <p>Morris. I did it at the desire of the prisoner. He said to me, as you are a stranger to this navy-affair, if you will show them to my friend, he'll let you know whether they are good or bad (I had never seen any seamen's tickets before I had these) one of them cost me 46 l. and upwards. The prisoner, instead of paying me my money, he dilly-dally'd me about from place to place.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Morris. This was on the 2d of Decemb. 1756; he desired me to go to John Hambleton's, at the Black-boy at the Hermitage; he said, he would treat me there, so he, I, and Glass went there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your bag of papers when you went in there?</p>
               <p>Morris. I had, very safe; I was very suspicious of the prisoner, for he would always be on that side me where I had them, and I thought he had some design of taking them from me; it was about four o'clock when I went there, and I continued there till half an hour after ten. Then I said, Mr. Anderson, can you give me any money? he said, he could not that night; we call'd the reckoning; I had observ'd the prisoner to take Glass out, to talk together several times at the door for four or five minutes; at the time I kept my hand on my bag of papers, the prisoner's wife came and inquired after him; Glass said to me, pray is your name Morris? I said, yes; (I had never seen him before) he said, will you give Mr.

               <p>Charley. It cannot be said to be worth any thing till it comes to be cast up, and comes for payment; they pay to the chest at Chatham is a month, and to Greenwich hospital 6 d. per month; there are four officers sign the ticket, the captain, the master, the purser, and the boatswain; there should be an account of what he is indebted to the ship's book.</p>

               <p>Q Whether, from the uncertainty of the instrument, it is such a warrant for the payment of money, as the act of parliament mentions, are you prepared to give in evidence how much is exactly due on this ticket?</p>
               <p>Charley. No; there are five books delivered in, before the ticket can be paid; they are all produced at the pay-table together, and all to correspond when the ticket is examined; till the time of payment, it can never be exactly known what is the value to be receiv'd. A ticket may be brought to the office, when the materials are not there to examine it by.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you can't with no certainty tell what is due on any of these three tickets.</p>
               <p>Charley. No, nobody can tell without the ship's pay-books.</p>
               <p>Court. Then those can be no warrants for the payment of any certain sums of money.</p>

               <p>E. Murrell. At the <placeName id="t17601022-13-crimeloc79">Barley-mow in Milford lane, facing St. Mildred's church</placeName>

               <p>Q. What did you lose?</p>
               <p>E. Murrell. I lost a stuff gown, a white callaco quilted petticoat, a pair of cotton stockings, a pair of stuff shoes, two colour'd aprons, a white apron, and several other things not mentioned in the indictment.</p>

               <p>Q What is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Rowell. I believe the last place he lived at was the Three Tuns in New street; (the goods produc'd in court, and depos'd to by their respective owners)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>Ask Mr. Price, if he thinks I took these things away with intent to keep them. We had been together all night; Mrs. Murrell lay along with Mr. Price and I, four or five nights running; and Mr. Price went out, and she said, she was going to him, and I went up stairs, and hid those things to frighten them, but not with intent to take them away; please to ask Rowell their characters.</p>

               <p>Q. to Rowell. What is Murrell's character?</p>
               <p>Rowell. I know nothing of the woman's character; she is a stranger to me.</p>

            . As I was going home on the saturday in the evening, after receiving my wages.</p>
               <p>Q. What saturday?</p>
               <p>Kircaldy. The 4th of this month; I being acquainted with the woman at the bar, and I was in company with her in her own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that?</p>
               <p>Kircaldy. It is in <placeName id="t17601022-14-crimeloc84">George court, East Smithfield</placeName>

               <p>Q. What money had you about you?</p>
               <p>Kircaldy. I had 13 s. and odd; I lost 9 s. and upwards; I found my waistcoat on her bed, and she own'd to me, that she sold my watch.</p>
               <p>Q How did she say she came by it?</p>
               <p>Kircaldy. She said, I gave it her; but that was false.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she say she sold the watch?</p>
               <p>Kircaldy. She said, she sold it to Mr. Harding in the Minories; I ask'd him about it, and he says he has sold it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in liquor?</p>
               <p>Kircaldy. I was a little in liquor when I went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you did not give the prisoner your watch?</p>
               <p>Kircaldy. I am sure I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not you leave your waistcoat on her bed?</p>
               <p>Kircaldy. I cannot positively say as to that; but she denied at justice Fielding's, that she ever knew me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss your things?</p>
               <p>Kircaldy. I never miss'd my watch and money till after I went away.</p>
               <p>Q Was any other person in her room besides she and you?</p>
               <p>Kircaldy. No, no other person; I have got my watch chain again.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet with that?</p>
               <p>Kircaldy. It was found in the same house she lives in.</p>
               <p>Q. Does she keep a public or a private house?</p>
               <p>Kircaldy. It has not been very private, it is a private house, public for all comers; the landlord of the house delivered the chain to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name?</p>
               <p>Kircaldy. His name is Callagan.</p>

I did live with the woman at the bar for some trifle of time; on a saturday night this man came; she and I had a few words, and I went and lay at another house; she came in the morning, and said, Polley come down; I was sleepy (we had had a pot of purl to dinner) said she, if you will make me a note of hand, I have got a tatler; I said, what is that? she said, it is a watch; she drew it out, there was a steel chain hanging to it; she said it was a Portuguese's; and that he had had a bad distemper, and she had him in cute. She took me up in the Minories, and sold it to Mr. Harding, a silversmith; I saw her sell it.</p>

               <p>M. Wilson. I can take my oath to the chain, that has since been found; she throw'd that away, and took the string from her neck, and put on the watch (the chain produced) - (she takes it in her hand) I will take my oath this is the same chain.</p>

               <p>Bamber Gascoyne, Esq; At the time of the robbery being committed. I was not in London; but when the prisoner at the bar was taken. I had word brought me in the country part of my goods were found upon him. I had a letter from Mr. Fielding, whose activity was great in it; he had some things brought before him my property, and I had set it forth 20 l. reward.</p>
               <p>Q. How was your house broke open?</p>
               <p>Gascoyne. My stable has a communication with the dwelling house by an arch; the place was broke where my postilion and coachman both lie when in town. I came up, and found the prisoner's wife was committed, and to be transported for another offence, (see No 232. in his mayoralty) and he was to be tried for his life for felony, but it was brought under value, and he was to be transported. I went to look at him, and had him before me at the goal-keeper's house.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that?</p>
               <p>Gascoyne. It was some time in September; I charged him with this robbery. His wife having these goods found upon her, and he was taken up with a number of picklock keys upon him (see his trial. No 275 in last Session's paper) the were such, that no lock could be safe where they came. I try'd to move him to give me an account, as it was a very particular robbery, thro' a laundry and places; after a most hardened manner he said, if I would give it him under my hand to get him to be made an evidence, he would. I told him, the law would not admit such a thing, but if I could get it I would; I observed he had a very fine shirt on. The wrist-bands were new put on, and very coarse, and very bad: I imagin'd it was mine; he laughed, and said, it was given him by a person in Cheshire four years ago. I made him strip; when I came to examine it, I observ'd; it having been used in hunting, was oblig'd to be mended. I knew it to be my shirt; I sent my laundry-maid to the keeper, and desired him to deliver it to her, and let the prisoner have any thing else to put on, which he did; as soon as my servant brought it in, she said it was my shirt; and upon her showing me, I saw upon the gusset the letters B. G. where they had been pick'd out, so that I am certain it is mine; the next morning I went to the goal again, in hopes to find him in a better humour; he still remained in the story, that it was given him; I said, I had it in my house on the 16th of April; he said, he had had it two years, and abus'd me again, for swearing to an old shirt, then he fell to one year; still I told him, it was in my possession at that time; I advis'd him to tell me where my things were; and do me justice; still he was extremely harden'd; then he told me, his wife could tell me. She was on board a transport ship; I got her from the ship; she gave-full and ample confession of the whole robbery, and by that I found my things in the pawnbrokers hands almost all over London. One of the women mention'd in the indictment, lost goods to the value of about 30 l. mine amounted to about 200 l. All my servants are here to prove the fastening of my doors, and that it was my shirt which the prisoner had on and the other things pawned at different pawnbrokers.</p>

            . I am Mr. Gascoyne's servant; I was in town when he was out, on the 18th of April, between six and seven in the morning; I first found the inward door open, we went a little farther.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176010220024"/>Q. Was the door broke?</p>
               <p>Aldridge. No, I believe it had been opened by false keys; it was unlocked, we went into the house, and found the door partly open; then we went and found the next door open; so that we imagined they came in by false keys that way, by the coach-house, I had seen cloths in the laundry over night, the next morning they were part gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the laundry?</p>
               <p>Aldridge. That is over the kitchen, the kitchen is under ground, the stable is level with the laundry; they came from the coach-house to the stable, from the stable to the laundry, and from thence to the house.</p>

            . I am, chamber-maid to Mr. Gascoyne; in April last, about the 17th, I was washing and ironing cloths; we had a great quanity of all sorts of linnen, some ironed, and some not.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed?</p>
               <p>E. Hutchenson. I went to bed, a little before eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you all go to bed at that time?</p>
               <p>E. Hutchenson. We did, and the doors were all made fast; we tried them all before we went to bed, except the door betwixt the laundry and the coachhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any of the stable servants in the house at that time?</p>
               <p>E. Hutchenson. No, none of them; the next morning we miss'd the things mentioned in the indictment. (a shirt produced)</p>
               <p>Q to Mr. Gascoyne. Look at this shirt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gascoyne. This is the shirt I had taken from off the prisoner's back.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Hutchenson. Whose shirt is this?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hutchenson. This is Mr. Gascoyne's shirt.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That shirt has been washed about 40 times.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Hutchenson. Tell the jury why you believe it to be his property.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hutchenson. Here is B. G. and a figure 14 on it, and my own work about it, that is, a piece on the side.</p>
               <p>Q. When a mark is pick'd out, is it possible to know what that mark has been?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hutchenson. The mark of the needle remains.</p>
               <p>Q. Will that never wear out?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hutchenson. No. (she puts a pin to the place, the jury inspect it, and find it visible)</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hutchenson. This shirt was taken out of the laundry, amongst the rest that night.</p>

            . I keep the king's Head, at the corner of Prince's street, Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what profession Talbot was of?</p>
               <p>Commings. No, I did not, till after he came into my house; they came in, and call'd for a tankard of beer; I brought it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any talk between him and the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Commings. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it?</p>
               <p>Commings. Mc Carty told him, if he would stay there five minutes he would come back and pay the money; or if he would go with him as far as Standup street, he would pay him. Talbot said, he might as well pay him then; they both went out together, and came back again.</p>

               <p>Q. When they came back again, was there any dispute between them?</p>
               <p>Commings. In about two minutes after they had left the house, there were four or five more laid hold of Mr. Mc Carty, and they came back again; they two, and three or four more, came into the tap room, and when they came by the bar, he desired them to loose him; and said, he would not be held by a parcel of Thieves, or to that purpose; he then walked up to the upper end of the room, and in the twinkling of an eye they all flew.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they fly for?</p>
               <p>Commings. I believe it was upon seeing a naked knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the knife?</p>
               <p>Commings. I Did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Talbot go with him to the upper end of the room?</p>
               <p>Commings. I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the stroke?</p>
               <p>Commings. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Talbot after he was wounded?</p>
               <p>Commings. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after they were gone to the upper end of the room, that he was wounded?</p>
               <p>Commings. I believe it was in less than a minute after; they were all in the room at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of the others follow them to the upper end of the room?</p>
               <p>Commings. I don't know but some did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the knife before he was wounded, or after?</p>
               <p>Commings. I believe he was wounded before I saw the knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear bloody?</p>
               <p>Commings. I can't tell whether it was or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mc Carty after that?</p>
               <p>Commings. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the deceased live after you saw the knife?</p>
               <p>Commings. I believe he lived about three minutes; he clapp'd his hand upon his side, and desired me to send for a surgeon; I believe he had receiv'd his death; he said, I believe I am done for, or something to that effect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say by who?</p>
               <p>Commings. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other men after this?</p>
               <p>Commings. They all ran out into the street, after Talbot was struck.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How many had hold of the prisoner in the street?</p>
               <p>Commings. I saw four or five had hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Talbot hold on him?</p>
               <p>Commings. I cannot say whether he had or not; I heard the prisoner ask, if they had any thing against him?</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the people that had hold of him?</p>

             was going to search him, because he was a dangerous man, and had often threatened to kill the officers. In going to search him, Talbot said, do not search him, for he will pay me the debt and cost; it was not very much above 4 l. 4 s. they were afraid he had got pistols about him; they found nothing in searching his outside cloths; and as they were going down lower to search, Talbot desired them to desist, and not to trouble themselves more. Then they went in at the King's head; Mc Carty went in first, and Talbot after, and we after him.</p>
               <p>Q. At which door did they go in at, it seems there are two?</p>
               <p>Palmer. At the Drury lane door; Talbot and Mc Carty went to the farther end of the room where the dial is, facing Russel street; the prisoner ask'd how much the debt was, and put his hand towards his breeches; Talbot told him he could not tell, it was 4 l. and upwards, and was going to pull out his pocket book; at that time I had no apprehension of danger or mischief; the prisoner put his hand to his pocket; I saw him pull out a knife, and directly turn'd towards Talbot, with a spring, and plung'd it into Talbot's left breast; I saw the knife go in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Talbot do any thing?</p>
               <p>Palmer. He attempted to guard his head, by holding his hand up before his head; the stroke came directly under his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Talbot any stick, or had he abused him?</p>
               <p>Palmer. No, neither, but us'd all the mildest words in the world. (a cook's carving knife produced in court, the blade nine inches long, with a sharp point) This is the knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Talbot say any thing?</p>
               <p>Palmer. He said, O Lord, he has done for me, or something to that effect.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he live after this?</p>
               <p>Palmer. He lived about two minutes after, as the landlord said, we went all out to cry murder.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner afterwards?</p>
               <p>Palmer. He came and stood at the door, with the naked knife in his hand, bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. Which door?</p>
               <p>Palmer. That in Princes's street; he stood at the door about a quarter of a minute, or half a minute, looking very full of revenge at the same time; then he walked very gently down the street; we call'd out murder; I walked down before him, calling murder; there was a soldier happened to come to our assistance; the soldier was at some trouble to get his sword out of his scabbord; then he took and cut a string that fastened it into the scabbord; he first stopped him in prince's street, then the prisoner went on; then the soldier stopped him at the corner of Vere street; I had a stick.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner offer to run?</p>
               <p>Palmer. No, he walked away with the knife in his hand, sometimes in the sheath, and then out again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you offer to stop him?</p>
               <p>Palmer. I struck at him several times; the soldier stopped him at a chandler's shop in Vere street; he did not think proper to cut him; the prisoner went two or three doors farther, and a man came out with a poker; I said, break his arm that has the knife in it; the man threatened to strike him with the poker; and another came and took the knife out of his hand, and held it up.</p>

Mr. Talbot said, Patt, will you pay the money; he said, yes, if you'll go into the house; then we all went in: there is a bar as you go into the room out of Drury-lane, Mc Carty went by that to the upper-end of the room, and said, how much is it, Talbot; Talbot said, upwards of 4 l. but I'll tell you the particulars; then Mc Carty said, he would pay him, and clapp'd his hand as though he was going to put it into his pocket, and brought a knife out, boo, said he. Talbot seeing the knife coming, whipp'd his right-hand up, and with the boo, he struck the knife in him. I saw the knife go in, and saw it come out again; Talbot fell on me, and clapp'd his hand on his shoulder, and said, Lord, he has done for me, he has kill'd me; I ran out of the house, so can't tell how long he liv'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Had either of you sticks?</p>
               <p>King. No, none of us had.</p>
               <p>Q. Had either of you used him ill?</p>
               <p>King. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the writ?</p>
               <p>King. I did, before Talbot went into the house; he show'd it him, (he takes the writ in his hand) this is the execution. I was apprehensive of danger, and went out of the house directly. The prisoner came out of the house into Prince's-street, and I went out of the door that goes into Drury-lane, calling out, murder, murder. I saw him at the door with a knife in his hand, and never attempted to run, but walk'd along, and said, it is a parcel of bailiffs and thieves, with the knife naked in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he secured?</p>
               <p>King. I can't say by whom he was secured; I saw him very attentive to the man with the poker, and a man took the knife out of his hand, and he was secured in Vere-street; I saw him taken, and went to Mr. Fielding's house with him; Mr. Fielding examined him, and ask'd him, how he could be guilty of such a crime; he said, if it was to do again, he would do it. Mr. Fielding ordered a person to go to see if Talbot was dead; he came and said, he was. I said to Mc Carty, you have made a pretty jobb of it; said he, I wish it had been you.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Talbot a palace-court officer?</p>
               <p>King. Yes, he was.</p>

            . I was one of the persons that Palmer fetch'd to come to the King's-head, Drury-lane. I saw the prisoner at the bar come out of the door in Prince's-street, Talbot was with him; King and Powell were up first, they had hold of Mc Carty; Talbot saw us coming, then he stood at the front of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the writ in any body's hand?</p>
               <p>James. No, I did not; I heard Talbot say, come into the house and pay the money, it is only Lenon's execution; said Mc Carty, let me go into the house, and I'll pay you the money. I was going to search him, and said to Talbot, don't let him go into the house, I don't think it safe, and was going to search him; upon that Talbot said, desist, and laid hold of my arm, and said, let him alone, he is as naked as a child, he cannot hurt any body; we let him loose, and walk'd quietly into the room; Talbot and Mc Carty walk'd before us together to the farther end of the room, facing the window that looks<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176010220029"/> into Russel-street, their backs were towards us; I heard Mc Carty say, how much is the money; said the other, I'll tell you, (feeling for his pocket-book) it is upwards of 4 l. Mc Carty put his hand to his pocket, feeling for his money, as I thought, and he whipp'd out this knife (here produced) in his right-hand. Talbot being appriz'd by the sudden motion, whipp'd up his right-hand to defend his head; hoo, said Mc Carty, and I immediately saw the knife go into the deceased's body, and I saw the prisoner pull it out again; then he said, you thieves you, Powell and King ran out of Drury-lane door. I was in the room, and seeing the door open that goes into Prince's-street, and no body in the room but Mc Carty, the deceased and I, I thought I would keep far enough off him; there is a sort of a settle; Mc Carty look'd round, and seeing no body in the house but me, and I was about four yards from him, he made a motion like towards me; I went out into the street; he came to the door, and stood on the threshold p retty near half a minute; we alarm'd the neighbours; he walk'd down Prince's-street unconcern'd (I call'd murder) he had the knife bloody in his hand; he was taken in Vere-street, Clare-market.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before Mr. Fielding when he was there?</p>
               <p>James. I was; I was the very person that charg'd him with the murder, and my information was drawn up, and before it was sign'd, I was desir'd to go and know if Mr. Talbot was dead, or no. I went to the King's-head, and there saw him all in a gore of blood, lying on his back dead. Then I went to the justice, and said, you may swear me now, for he is dead. Upon that I heard Mc Carty mutter with a low voice, by the Holy Ghost I wish it was you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear them words?</p>
               <p>James. I heard them very words; then I was sworn, and signed my information.</p>

            . I saw Talbot and Mc Carty about the King's-head door in Prince's-street, talking together; when I came up, Talbot said to him, I have got an execution against you in the suit of Mr. Lenon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him produce the execution?</p>
               <p>Powell. I did, but I can't swear to the identity of it now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he produce it in such a manner, that the prisoner might see it?</p>
               <p>Powell. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say, upon Talbot's producing it?</p>
               <p>Powell. He said nothing; we were afraid he had instruments about him, as he had threatened him; we catch'd hold of him; upon which he said to Talbot, what is it; said Talbot, it is an execution; we were going to search him; said Talbot. desist, Patt will pay me the money; then the prisoner said, go into the house, and I will pay you the money; they went in at the Drury-lane door; I was behind Mr. James and Mr. Talbot, by the corner of the bar on the left hand; Mc Carty ask'd, how much the money was; Talbot said, it is better than 4 l. and put his hand to his right-hand pocket; Mc Carty put down his hand, as if in order to pay the money; he drew out a knife, (the same as here produced) Talbot held up his hand; hoo, said Mc Carty, and gave his hand a fling round, and I saw the knife go into the deceased's body.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did Talbot live after this?</p>
               <p>Powell. I can't tell that; he clapp'd his hand to the wound, and said, O Lord, he has done for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him afterwards?</p>
               <p>Powell. I saw him bleeding on the floor out of the mouth and the wound, then he was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any stick in his hand?</p>
               <p>Powell. No, he had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any quarrel between them?</p>
               <p>Powell. No, not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner after he had wounded Talbot?</p>
               <p>Powell. Then he walk'd gently out, and we call'd murder; and he was taken in Vere-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with him before justice Fielding?</p>
               <p>Powell. I was; I heard him say he was very sorry for what he had done; but he had something else to think of, than to stand prattling there; they could hardly get him to the bar.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day was it?</p>
               <p>Baldwyn. It was either a quarter before eleven at night, or about eleven; they came from under the arch way, behind me; one laid on one side of my collar, another the other side, and the third took hold on the slap of my coat behind; they never let me go, but dragg'd me up a court to the second house in it, which is about 25 yards from the place where she seiz'd me.</p>
               <p>Q. On which hand-side the court?</p>
               <p>Baldwyn. On the left-hand side; they dragg'd me into a lower room, and lock'd the door, and one of them took the key out of the door; two of them fell to beating me in a terrible manner; they struck me over my face with their double fist, as hard as they could strike me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they a light?</p>
               <p>Baldwyn. There were a parcel of bricks in the fire place, and a candle was stuck amongst them alighted, by which I know the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you in that room?</p>
               <p>Baldwyn. I was there pretty near half an hour; the prisoners are two of them, I know them well; I saw them all three very plain. I look'd at their faces, resolv'd, in my own breast, to have satisfaction for the injury I receiv'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell which of the prisoners assaulted you, and what each did?</p>
               <p>Baldwyn. Oatley took my common prayer-book and gloves; the fellow pair to these on my hands?</p>
               <p>Q. Which pocket did she take them from?</p>
               <p>Baldwyn. From out of my left hand coat pocket; when she had her hand in my pocket, I turn'd about and said, let my pocket alone, there is but a trifle, there is only a pair of gloves; she said, d - n you, I don't care, I'll have it. Mary Burn stood on the other side, and had hold of my collar at the same time; she and the other kept fast hold on me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Oatley take your things by force?</p>
               <p>Baldwyn. She did;

               <p>Q. Was you held by any body at that time?</p>
               <p>Baldwyn. I was by the other two.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any thing else?</p>
               <p>Baldwyn. I lost 8 d. halfpenny in halfpence, and a 6 d. in silver, out of my right-hand breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took that?</p>

               <p>Q. Was you put in fear?</p>
               <p>Baldwyn. I was put in great fear.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do after that?</p>
               <p>Baldwyn. They kept me near half an hour, and beat me in a terrible manner, thinking I had gold about me; they demanded more money of me, and swore and d - d my eyes, if I did not give them all the money I had they would knock my eyes out of my head. Burn pull'd out a knife, and held it at my breast near twenty minutes on and off; whether it was a claps knife, on fix'd in the handle, I know not; at last they let me out. I apply'd to justice Welch for a warrant, and took one up the 10th of this instant, and the other afterwards, and I took them before the justice, and they were committed.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you in Drury-lane at that time of night?</p>
               <p>Baldwyn. I was going to Wild-street, to one that was very ill, to see if my wife could be of any service to her in sitting up by her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Baldwyn. I have lived many years in that parish.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business?</p>
               <p>Baldwyn. I am a <rs id="t17601022-20-viclabel120" type="occupation">livery lace-weaver</rs>

             bid me go to (I took her up first, and she told me where to find the other) there I took her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you in doubt about Oatley.</p>
               <p>Baldwyn. No, I always said I knew her; she took my gloves and prayer-book; I knew her on first seeing her again; her husband is waiter at a public-house or tavern near Charing Cross; I never saw him till the saturday after in the round-house; and when I saw him after that, he had inlisted, and was in soldier's cloths.</p>
               <p>Oatley's Defence.</p>
               <p>When that man took me up first of all, he swore I held a knife against him, and rifled his pocket, with two women with me; this was at justice Cox's; I was in the Gatehouse from the saturday o the monday; a woman that I never saw before told me the three womens names that did this robbery; this very girl said to the other girl that was going off, is that the man you robbed? she said yes; there was another girl that had a child, she left her child, and is gone off too; I never saw the man with my eyes before he swore against me, I innocently said; when he laid hold of me, he said I was one of the women; I said, I was not; but I knew the women, and that was no farther than hearsay.</p>
               <p>Burn's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never saw the man in my life, and this woman (meaning her fellow prisoner) I never saw her in my days; I own I was going by with one of them, that did the robbery, when they took me.</p>

            . On the 12th of October, Mr. Jacobs sent for me to his house, and told me, he had lost a bank note of a hundred pounds, and he suspected his servant to have taken it. I ask'd him where she was; he said, she was gone to Mr. Gregory's, in Crutchet Fryers; he and I went there; when we came there, they said she was not come, but they expected her to drink tea; I staid there, and in about half an hour she came in; her master told her, her mistress was taken ill, and she must come home; I followed her, and when she came there, I desired her to walk up stairs. She went up, then her master charged her with taking the bank note of 100 l. she said, she never had been guilty of any such thing; I being constable, ordered a woman to search her; she was searched, but nothing found upon her. Her master promised her, if she would tell where the note was, he would give her ten guineas, which he had advertised; she persisted in her innocency, and would make no discovery The next morning I was sent for to Mr. Jacobs's house, about eight o'clock, there was Mrs. Hancock; she said, she could give an account about the note: but said, she expected something for her trouble; Mr. Jacobs agreed to give her five guineas, and gave her a note of hand for it, to be paid upon its being produced. The note was produced by Mrs. Townsend; Mr. Jacobs was mistaken in the name, he call'd her Tompson; he gave Townsend ten guineas, and Hancock a note of 5, on her producing the woman with the note; the note was ordered to be returned by my Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Mr. Jacobs receive his note again?</p>
               <p>Jacobs. After Hancock had told Townsend's name, Townsend sent word, she would not come; if Mr. Jacobs had a mind to have his note, he might come and fetch it. I went with him to the seven Stars in Rosemary lane; then she said, if Mr. Jacobs would deposit ten guineas in the landlord's hand, she would produce it; and she delivered the note upon her receiving the ten guineas. Then I told her this note had been stolen by a woman that was to be examined before my Lord Mayor to-day; and ask'd her, if she knew the prisoner Duprose; she said, she never heard her name in her life: the next day I took the prisoner before Mr. alderman Alexander; and upon hearing these two womens names, then she said, she found the note at a cheesemonger's door in White Chappel, and that she had given it to Mrs. Townsend for her to see what it was. Upon that Mr. alderman Alexander committed her to the counter, and ordered a warrant to be made out against the other two women; the next day I took them both before my Lord Mayor; and upon his examining Townsend, she own'd she received the bank note of the prisoner at the bar. My Lord Mayor sent for the prisoner; she was ask'd, if she gave it her, and she said she did, for her to tell her what it was.</p>

               <p>E. Griffith. She said she came in at the back door, and we locked her in the house, and she took and carried all the things to her lodgings; we took her up but last night; she had pawn'd the watch, and here is a pawnbroker in court with whom she has pawn'd two white aprons, and one black silk apron, which he would not deliver; I ask'd her what she had done with the money; and she said she had spent that.</p>

            . I am beedle of Clarkenwell; Mrs. Griffith denied me to go along with her, her husband being now in misfortunes in Bedlam. I went, and we took the prisoner, and she charged her with taking the things mentioned; she own'd the fact; and here are part of the things which we found. I found the tea chest at the Half Moon at Islington, she delivered to us two aprons, some caps, and a pair of sleeves; she own'd she had sold the eighteen pieces of brass, which were shuffleboard pieces, for 16 d. I went to the pawnbrokers, nam'd Ellis, in Abel's buildings, Rosemary lane, for the watch, and told him it was stolen; he delivered it to me. ( produced and depos'd to by prosecutrix)</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to Ellis's?</p>
               <p>Clark. The prisoner went along with me there, and said she had pawn'd it at that house.</p>
               <p>Thomas Hall. The prosecutrix lives opposite me; she sent for me, and said, she had been robbed, and had a suspicion of the prisoner; we got a warrant, and I went with her, and we found the prisoner at Islington; there I saw the tea chest standing on a chest of drawers; then she confessed she had taken the other things; we went according to her directions, and got the watch, and some other things produced here.</p>

               <p>I did not pawn the watch; the woman that pawn'd them they had in custody last night, and they let her go; I know nothing about any of the things.</p>

On the 7th of July, between eight and nine in the evening, the prisoner at the bar came to me for two half pounds of tea; after I had weigh'd it, and given it her, she wanted change for a 36 s. piece, as she call'd it; I look'd at it, and told her it was bad; she would not believe me at first, then I carried it to one of the masters, Mr. Davidson, and shew'd it him; he came down stairs, and told the prisoner, it was had, and that he had a good many of them, and the first that brought him any more he was determin'd to prosecute, as an example to others. He said, if the prisoner could make it plainly appear how she came by it, he would release her, otherwise he wou'd go the next morning before the sitting alderman; she said, she did not know who gave it her; we detain'd the 36 s. and the next morning she came of her own accord, and went before the sitting alderman at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you send for a constable?</p>
               <p>Hudson. No.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the 36 s. piece to be a bad one?</p>
               <p>Hudson. Yes, I judg'd it so; it was very perceivable.</p>
               <p>Q. On your charging her with this piece as being bad, Mr. Davidson ask'd her, where she had it? what did she say?</p>
               <p>Hudson. She said, she receiv'd it in payment, but could not tell where she had it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she endeavour to use any art, or did she come in a common way to purchase goods?</p>
               <p>Hudson. She came in a common way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she seem surpriz'd, when you told her it was bad.</p>
