We asked them for whom they carried it? they could not tell the gentleman's name, but said he would be there as soon as they; we followed them there, there they pitched them, there was no person met them; then we spoke to the landlord to get a constable, to stop them till we could let Mr. Greenwood know about it; we sent to him, he came, and brought the mark on paper which we found stampt on the iron.</p>

I went to bed last Tuesday was a week a little after eleven o'clock, and left Donnelly and Cook in the house below; Cook brought me up the key of my cellar door, and said the other was gone home; after that he came up again, and said he wanted change for silver, I shewed him my money to take change; he lodged in my house, I thought I could have trusted him with untold gold; the next morning my door was found open, and the things mentioned in the indictment missing, (mentioning them by name) and he was gone; I made enquiry who was last in my house, and found they were Cook, Donnelly, and his wife; I went to Donnelly's lodging in Parker's-lane, I found his wife in bed, the said he was gone out along with Cook, who had been there; a woman there said she heard Cook say he had a sufficiency of money to carry them to Ireland, and when that was gone he had something to make money of. (Donnelly is a seaman lately come home in the Dragon.) I went to Justice Fielding, and got a warrant, and soon had information they were both secured at the Bull's-head in Stretton-street; we went there and searched them, I saw my coat buttons, my hat-band, and hat-buckle taken out ofDonnelly's left hand breeches pocket; he turned about and said to

             dear Cook, did I think you could rob a man that was so good to us? he said to me, I have got no more of your things, I did not know whose they were, he gave them to me to keep for him. Then we proceeded to search Cook, in his pocket there was found my green purse, my gold ring, a ducat, which I believe to be mine, and my little ladle, a 3 d. piece, and a chain washed with gold, which my child used to wear about her neck; (producing them) there was found also three quarter guineas, four half guineas, 2 l. 3 s. in silver, a French groat, a king James's groat, and four half crowns. Keney was in company with them, he went out and crossed the way. A coach-man said to me, If you are the man that has been robbed, there is a man that has been drinking with them all this morning; meaning Keney.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176304130005"/> Then I said, Mr. Keney, I want to speak with you; when he came in again he stood on my right hand, with another person between us; I desired Mr. Gay, who had searched the other, to search him; I observed Keney to stoop back and drop something which he took out of his right hand pocket, there was found upon the ground one of my watches by him, the case flew off with the fall, the other watch was found in the room thrust up the chimney.</p>

               <p>I have been guilty of a br each of trust; he trusted me with this money, and the taking care of his house. After the people were out of the house, I went up with the key of the cellar-door to him; his money was upon the chair. He knocked again; I went up. I took the money, to be sure, but there was never a guinea there; there was seven half guineas, and about 8 s. He had every farthing again.</p>

            . I am a constable; the doctor got a warrant from Justice Wright, and I went with the Pawnbroker's man to the Castle in Castle-street, Bloomsbury, where we found the prisoner, and took her to the Justice; then we went to her lodgings, and there we found the duplicates of the things pawned, which are to answer to the pawnbroker's tickets; they were in a drawer, and also a handkerchief, (produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutrix) and this paper, (producing a paper) the maid declared the mistress's silver cloaths were put in to keep them from tarnishing. I went to the lodging two days after, to enquire if I could find the man named Stoaks, who lived with the prisoner, but he had made off; there was found this key (producing one) in their room, which I got liberty to try, and found it opened the late Lord Warwick's door, it is an empty house, two doors from Dr. Hibbins's house; we went up to see in what manner they could get from that to the doctor's house, and found any body could walk with a good deal of safety to the doctor's garret window. When the prisoner was examined the second time, she confessed that Stoaks told her he got into the empty house, and so got the things.</p>

I was there and saw the two prisoners take it away; it was two pieces, they carried them to the south-side of St. Paul's church-yard, and pitched them on the stones by the rails. Paston called Tom; Tom was gone away from him. They had carried it from the ale-house up Distaff-lane into Paul's church-yard. After Waters had left him. Paston came to me and said, they had been at work and had got some lead, and his partner had left him, and if I would carry some of it to Chancery-lane, he would give me half a crown. I would not. Then Waters came again, and they took them up and carried them as far as Black-swan-alley, they threw it down and left it. Then I desired a young lad to go and tell the gentleman, they were gone and left the lead. Mr. Mitchel sent a man to me, then I carried one piece to his house, and then went and carried the other, he staid by it till I came. The young man that was with me, took the two prisoners, and they were carried to the watch-house.</p>

On Friday morning the 8th of March, about half an hour after 7, the prisoner Waters came through my house, and went into the yard, and returned, and called for a glass of gin, and said, I have left a bit of lead in your stable, will it be safe? I said, it would. After that he came again, and had a glass of something a bar. He said, he had lost a piece of wat e which he had set at the outside of the door, which a carpenter had taken in out of a joke; the carpenter said, it may be stolen to set it in so careless a manner, he had known a man hanged for such a pipe. After he was gone, the carpenter said, he thought the man had stole it; I said, he works for Mr. Mitchel. He went and fetched Mr. Mitchel. Mr. Mitchel desired, I would not let it go out of my house without watching it, that he might be able to detect the receiver. On Saturday at noon the two prisoners came and said, they would fetch it away at night. I sent to Mr. Mitchel to let him known of it, and he sent the last witness to be ready to follow them. The prisoners came about 8 at night, and asked for a candle to go backwards; I was in the cellar, and when I came up, they were gone with the lead, and the porter after them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mitchel. I am a Plummer, in partnership with Mr. Deputy Willis. Mr. Smith sent an order to have his soil pipe taken down; I sent the two prisoners at the bar to do it, on Friday the 18th of March, and expected he would send it to my house in his cart, I was then exceeding ill, I found the prisoners brought it in pieces on their shoulders; after that a carpenter came and told me there was some such lead at the Rummer on Labour-in-vain-hill. I went there and saw it, the man was described to me that left it there, I had great reason to think it was Waters. I desired the master of the house not to take any notice there was any suspicion about it, but to appoint somebody to watch, that I might come at the receiver. On the Saturday he sent a person to let me known he had been at his house, and he would fetch it away at night, on which I sent the porter to watch where they carried it. At night two gentleman's servants in St. Paul's-church-yard came and told me they had seen two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176304130008"/> men pitch some lead there, and they thought it was stolen. I said, I had sent a person to watch them. Soon after that they came again, and said they had flung it down and run away; then I sent word to the porter to bring it to my house, which he did at twice. I make no doubt but the two pieces are part of the soil pipe, there was one hundred and a quarter weight of them. I always had a good opinion of Paston till this affair; I have no reason to suspect him of any thing before.</p>

I have it; Mr. Matthews looked at it, and said it was his watch; I delivered it to him, for which he gave me this receipt; (producing one) this watch was dropped from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Nathaniel Hill. I am constable. Mr. Matthews sent for me on the 31st of March to take charge of the prisoner at the bar, for breaking his shop window, and taking a gold watch, ( produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor) the outside case was missing.</p>

            . I heard the cry of stop thief, the prisoner came running (by a parcel of chairmen, who never attempted to stop him) up Bell-yard, he forced by some people, and knocked one down; I knocked him down with my hand, there was assistance, and we secured him.</p>

               <p>I was going along Fleet-street about half an hour after 7 o'clock, I saw a man run his hand into the glass, and I suppose took out something; he slipped it out of his hand, I ran and took it up, and directly there was a cry, stop thief; I ran after the man, and lost fight of him in Bell-yard; I was knocked down by that person, I believe at the time I fell I hurt my hand against the watch-glass; then I was brought to Mr. Matthews's, and from thence to the Compter, and from thence to Newgate.</p>
               <p>He called four people to his character, who gave him a good character exclusive of this fact.</p>

            , and I, stole three quarters of malt from out of a lighter, and carried them to Mr. Murray's house.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he?</p>
               <p>Doughty. He is a public brewer in St. Ann's lane, Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the sacks marked?</p>
               <p>Doughty. I can't tell how they were marked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know how you came by it?</p>
               <p>Doughty. He did, or he would not have bought it so cheap; he had it for 18 s. a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. Do West, Johnson, or you, deal in malt?</p>
               <p>Doughty. No; I am a gardner, and we all lie constantly in his house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Freeman. I am constable; I went to search the prisoner Murray's house for the sacks the 28th or 29th of March; we found several sacks marked with different marks. Johnson sent for me and desired I would get him admitted evidence concerning<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176304130010"/> the matter. He confessed to me, he had stolen this malt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him any hope that he should be admitted evidence?</p>
               <p>Freeman. I did. (He produced two sacks.) These two sacks I found at Murray's house. When I took West, he desired I would get him admitted evidence; but I gave him no hopes that he should be admitted. He told me, he was concerned in taking the malt, and said, he had sold Mr. Murray thirty quarters; this was before the Justice. He also shewed us, where the malt was up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lyon. Look at these two sacks here produced.</p>
               <p>Lyon. These are the same marks of the sacks that I took into my barge from the wharf in Channel-row, Westminster.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the sacks?</p>
               <p>Freeman. We found some in the brewhouse, and some in the hopper; I found six together under some barrels joining to Mr. Murray's premises, where people may go out of his yard to that.</p>

            . On the 28th of last month I had a letter sent down to me to let me know, I had lost some of my malt. My servant went up on the Sunday to see after it, and it was safe; and on the Monday we missed seven sacks. I went to the New-court in Westminster, where they were examining the prisoner Johnson. One Child a constable said, he was the man that was found with some malt upon him; he seemed to make no confession at first. Afterwards he came in and made a confession, that he was the very man that stole part of my malt, and was carrying it in the night, when the watchman stopt him; this he confessed before the Gentlemen in my hearing. Mr. Freeman the constable went to search Murray's house, but by the way went in pursuit of West; we found him asleep in a public house before we came to Murray's house. He told us, he would go with us and shew us, where he pitched the malt, and told us, he put it in Mr. Murray's brewhouse. I had a sample of the malt in my pocket, that I had lost out of my boat, and by comparing it with some that I found, it appeared to be of the very same sort. We found six sacks of mine covered up under some bricks, in a little place by Murray's brewhouse, there was a way out of the brewhouse to that place.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not customary to have sacks left at one place and another where malt is delivered?</p>

            . On the 28th of last month I was requested by Mr. Ameck and Dunkin to go to the new Guildhall, Westminster, on account of the malt being stolen from them. I attended with them. Johnson came there, he pretended innocency respecting it. Soon after that, he came in again, and acknowledged to the stealing malt in company with Doughty and West; his confession seemed to be very intricate and dark; the Magistrates put him by. After that they sent out for West. When West came into court, he, without any promise, voluntarily said, I'll tell all I know. I have been guilty with Johnson and Doughty of stealing those different malts to the quantity of three quarters, or more, that we sold to Mr. Murray, from Mr. Graves, that they had carried away from out of the craft, for 18 s. a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. What might malt be worth at that time?</p>
               <p>Dolman. I am not in the trade, but I know at that time it went at 33 s. 34 s. and 35 s. and 6 d. a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Dolman. I am very intimate with Mr. Ameck and Dunkin, and some times see their books. West turned himself to me, and added farther, I am got in a sad hole, and (to the best of my knowledge) said, If I am not hang'd, I don't care if I am transported, I then said, you should not have stolen the malt; he said no more, than Johnson and West were concerned with him.</p>
               <p>From West. He says, I was concerned in selling three quarters of malt to Mr. Murray.</p>
               <p>Dolman. The malt that the prisoner means now is Ameck and Dunkin's malt, but the three quarters of malt now in question is Mr. Graves's malt; a distinct affair.</p>

            . I was at the searching Murray's house, I saw several sacks found with the mark HENLEY upon them; they were found on one side the hopper by Mr. Freeman and Mr. Dunkin, who took them out. I heard West say, he stole six sacks of malt, and sold them for 18 s. a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. What was malt worth a quarter at that time?</p>
               <p>Randal. It was worth 36 s. a quarter.</p>

               <p>Randal. The owners are so careful, that they will not let a sack be left if possible.</p>
               <p>West's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never had any concern in felling a grain of malt to this man, or any body else.</p>

               <p>Murray's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never had any dealings with any of these men in my life. The sacks that were found in my possession I can give an account of, what were found not on my premises, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Dunkin. In searching Murray's houses there were thirty beds in them, one bed we found made of nothing but sacks; there were on some of them marks in the same manner as these, part of west-country sacks. (He produced some pieces, the Jury inspect them.)</p>

            . A servant in the house fell lame, and the prisoner did her business for a little time. I missed a flower'd silk gown, it was in pieces, and a piece of flower'd linnen; I suspected the prisoner had taken them, we found part of the things at her lodgings. She told us where the gown was, we went and found it at a Dyer's in Knave's-acre. The Dyer told us he had orders from her to dye it of a dark brown.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they taken from?</p>
               <p>Spooner. From out of a box. I live in Mr. Moore's house.</p>

               <p>Spooner. I saw them the Sunday before she came into the house, I cannot say I saw them while she was in the house. The shift and petticoat were found upon her back, the black silk apron was found in her pocket.</p>

            . I am a watchman in St. Giles's, about 20 minutes after 4 in the morning, of last Sunday was three weeks, I met the prisoner at the bar in Buckle-street, with this iron here produced. I asked him where he was going with it, he said from Mr. Buttall's at the Gridiron, and was going to one Mr. Watkins's in White-cross-street. I said, I do not think you came honestly by it; he said, if you think so we will go to a night-house and have a pot of beer, and lodge it there till I bring proof where I had it; but instead of that, I carried him to the constable; the constable said he must go to the round-house; he ran away as fast as he could; and got quite off. On Monday morning I went to Mr. Buttall to enquire if he had lost such iron? he sent a man to see it, the man said it did not belong to him. It lay in the constable's hands about a fortnight till the prosecutor saw it. The prisoner was apprehended again in about 17 days.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Mr. Buttall let me know of this iron being stopt; I took the prisoner in White-cross-street, the constable brought him justice Welch's in Long-Acre, I sent for twenty my workmen, and desired the watchman to pick him out from the rest; he pitched upon him directly. I have been robbed within these 9 months of about fifty 100 wt. of iron.</p>

I went and took hold of him, and clapt my knee on his breast, and said, pursue the other, (there was another man in company with the prisoner that was rode off.) He pursued; while I was holding the prisoner on the ground, he begged for mercy, saying he was a gentleman bred, and if I would let him get up, he would go with me wherever I desired. I had not the presence of mind to search him; I let him get up, after which he clapped another pistol to my breast, and said, now d - n you, I'll shoot you dead. I knock'd the pistol from my body with my right-hand downwards, and as it pointed to my thigh, he snapt it, and it flash'd in the pan, but did not go off. I immediately kicked up his heels, and clapt my knee upon his breast, and with my garters tied his hands, and took his pistols; after which I delivered him into the custody of the constable; he took ten bullets and a bullet-mold from him; we found the pistol that he snapt at me was loaded with powder and one ball.

I said, I must go that way, it is my way home. I went on pretty fast; when I came within a quarter of a mile of my own home, turning a short corner of the road, I saw two men sitting on their horses, with masks on their faces; it did not much surprize me, because I expected to see them. I kept riding on, thinking I might release the man they then attacked, which was Mr. Brown; the prisoner discharged a pistol; I immediately saw Mr. Brown off his horse, I imagined he might be shot.</p>

               <p>Pope. I could not distinguish what aim he took, but I saw the smoak pretty near Mr. Brown's head; with that I clapt spurs to my horse, and rode up to the prisoner, took him by the collar, and pulled him down; his partner then made a retreat; Mr. Brown came and called me by my name, and said, I'll take care of this man, do you pursue the other. I was off my horse, I got up again, and pursued about three quarters of a mile; he found I gathered ground of him, so quitted his horse and got into the fields, and I lost him. I got his horse.</p>

While we were in this discourse one of them said to the other, go stop that other; then Lewis went from me, the other staid; presently he said to me, don't you stir or go away, or to that purpose; he left me, and at that time Lewis fired; I turned about upon it, and saw three men on the ground, and the other riding away; I went to their assistance, they sent to the Green, and assistance came.</p>

            . On the 31st of March I being at the war-office about some business, I was desirous of seeing his Majesty as he was then passing by; I stept down to the door, and observed there was but a few people under the piazzas; my coat was open, having a charge in my pocket, I clapt my hand to it; one or two people came and placed themselves by my side, I believe there was a woman on my left side; I button my coat, and placed myself close to a pillar; I found some body push'd me behind, I turned about, I can't say I took so much notice as to say it was this man, but there were but two or three men by me at the time; I said, there is no occasion to push me now, there is no crowd here; a man said, I want to see, I want to see His Majesty going by immediately, I took my hand from off my pocket in order to take off my hat, two or three people cried, O ra! I felt something immediately at my pocket; I turned about, the prisoner was then on my right side, he got between me and the pillar, he turned about shuffling his hand in his pocket, so as to make me suspect him. I clapt my hand to my pocket, not being willing to accuse a person till I was sure. He went by me; I said, stop, sir, I want to speak with you. He did not seem to mind me much. I said, you have got my pocket-book; then he fell to running as hard as he could, and got as far as the Iron-gate-way, that being crowded, he could not get through very cleverly, which gave me an opportunity of getting up to him. I said, you have got my pocket-book, a thing of too much consequence to loose. He got from me, on which I cried out, stop thief; the crowd made way for me, and a man or two seized him. When he got near the Tilt-yard coffee house window, there was a seaman very officious to search him, he cried, search him, search him! said I, don't be so officious, I'll search the gentleman myself. It was a red leather pocketbook with the notes in it as mentioned in the indictment. I put my hands by the sides of his pockets, and found nothing there, I said, you are the man that picked my pocket, I insist upon carrying you before a magistrate. I brought him into the guard-room, and begged a file of musqueteers to attend him. The seaman, whom then I suspected to have an intention to conceal this man's roguery, went voluntarily before the Justice, and swore he saw the prisoner strive to make his escape from me. As we were going, the prisoner seemed a good deal confused, when he heard the consequences of the pocket-book, and said in a kind of flutter, he would give 50 l. that I had my pocket-book again, but if any honest person has got it, you may depend upon getting it again; then, said I, you have thrown it away; he said, no, I have not seen it. (He mentioned the several numbers names and sums of the notes.)</p>

            . I am acquainted with Capt. Elrington. I was near the Tilt-yard coffee-house when the King went by to go to the house. I saw the captain have hold of the prisoner, the prisoner got from him, and run just before the king came through the iron gate; after that I saw the prisoner run a second time, after that he was stopped; he was carried to the guard room, and from thence to Justice Fielding's. I asked him, why he run away from the captain if he was not guilty? He said, he was not the man. I said, I saw you run. He said, that is nothing to the purpose, I am not the man: he said, he was not uneasy, he could get security for ten thousand pounds for his good behaviour: he said also, he would give 50 l. that the captain had his book again, and if it fell into an honest man's hands the captain would have it again.</p>

            . I was waiting to see his Majesty come through, and heard the gentleman cry stop thief, I went and took hold of the prisoner, and begged to search him. The gentleman suspected, I believe, I belonged to the prisoner, so I went with him to the Tilt-yard guard-room; he was searched, and a file of musqueteers guarded him to the Justice's. The gentleman had a coach; I thought he was going to charge me, but he said, no, he did not charge me; so I got up behind the coach. There I told the Justice I stopped the man, and searched him, and found nothing upon him. The captain said there was a sailor man whom he did not know but was concerned. So one came and snapt my a - c, and felt about me, and another came and did the same, but I had nothing about me. I never saw the prisoner in my life before that time.</p>

            . The prosecutrix lodged in my house. On the 17th of March the prisoner came and took Mrs. Hussey and Mrs. Wayland out in a coach; about 5 in the afternoon the prisoner came back with a woman she called her maid; she made as if she was tired, I asked her to sit down; I said, where is Mrs. Hussey? she said, at her house; she said, she had known her some years to have lived well, and she would keep her, and maintain her; she has lived in credit, and it is hard she should work for a bit of bread, which made her heart bleed to see it. She said she had got a little tenement, and she should dwell in it. I said, I wonder Mrs. Hussey did not let me know of it. She said, she did not know of it herself till she told her after she was gone out with her. I said, where is Mrs. Wayland? She said, she is making the room clean against the bed comes. What with her behaviour and appearance I believed her; she opened the prosecutrix's door, and brought the things out, with the assistance of others that she got to help her, and got a porter to carry them away. She said Mrs. Hussey had given her a strict charge not to meddle with any of Wayland's goods. She took all Mrs. Hussey's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176304130019"/> except the bedstead.

               <p>Engebore Janstadt. I am a stranger in this country. I lived in Lower-bell-alley, Wapping, I trusted the prisoner to keep my money 15 l.; three guineas, 3 half guineas, a 4 s. 6 d. piece, and the rest in silver. It was put into her chest about five weeks ago; she says, it is now gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear her confess taking it?</p>
               <p>Janstadt. No. I never found any of it again.</p>

About a month ago I had some people in my house drinking beer, there came two foreigners in my house, after they had been knocked down, that had met with some English sailors in the street, they had quarrelled; there came almost two hundred English sailors, the prisoner was one of them, they stripped my house entirely. The prisoner went into my cellar and drank four pots of porter; after that I saw him go up stairs, and break the lock of one of my chests; the rest of the sailors came to knock me down. I ran down stairs. The things mentioned in the indictment were all taken out of the chest by some body. They let my beer about the cellar.</p>
               <p>- Cole. I found the prisoner in the prosecutor's cellar: he let the beer about the cellar, and was very obstrepulous. I saw nothing of his taking the things out of the chest; I took him prisoner. The other sailors had ran away and left this alone, when they heard the soldiers were coming.</p>

The prisoner was on my right hand. A gentleman's going in, left the passage clear, the prisoner chucked me as if to push to get forwards upon my right side, and I felt my watch going out of my pocket, I instantly seized the prisoner; he endeavoured to force himself from me; he was close to my right side when I seized him; he pulled me four or five feet. I said, you have got my watch; he said, he had not. Immediately I called the constable, who took him into the church-yard; immediately a boy, named

I am certain he was the person that took it out of my pocket, and I apprehend he dropt it on the ground. I have sent a subpoena to the boy's mother, but she would take no notice of it. I have taken some pains to get him here, but cannot meet with him; I imagine he is kept out of the way. (The watch produced in court and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible do you think for any body that was behind you to take it?</p>
               <p>Edlyne. He was so very close to me that I do not think any body could. I found none of the crowd press upon me but the prisoner, and the instant I felt my watch go out of my pocket, I instantly laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not another man have put his hand under your coat and taken it?</p>
               <p>Edlyne. I cannot swear that; I can absolutely take my oath, that it could not be any body behind me.</p>

               <p>As I was going through the crowd, the gentleman charged me with taking his watch; I said, if you have any suspicion of me, take charge of me.

               <p>Mr. Mitchell. I have been acquainted with Mr. Rice ever since his father died, about 8 or 9 years ago. Before this accusation I never heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176304130023"/> any thing against him in my life. I have trusted him till within a month of his elopement, he sold out 300 l. of stock for me; I left it in his hand to sell when he thought he could get the best price; I received the money from his hand a very little time before he went abroad: In the course of business I have had with him, he has acted with integrity. Upon his father's leaving off, he recommended him to me, and I recommended him to the Amicable Society.</p>

               <p>Claxton. There was 9 l. 11 s. 6 d. in it, it was all gone. I went every night backwards and forewards for a fortnight to see if I could see this unfortunate woman, but could not see her; at last a man came and told me, she was to be found at the Red Lion in Poppin's-alley; there she was standing at the bar; as soon as she saw me, she quitted the house. There was a gentleman with her, he said, if any body came to molest her, he would knock them down. She was going up Fleet-street, I followed her directly, I went before her and said, do you know me? she fell to blasting my eyes and said, no; said I, I know you, and back again you shall go. I brought her to St. Sepulchre's watch-house, from whence she was sent to the compter. In two or three days after I went to the Red Lion to enquire what sort of money she changed there? he said, he had changed a moidore for her.</p>

I was serving the prisoner with a dram when the prosecutor came in; I asked him what he wanted? he could not tell me: the woman went out, and he after her.

               <p>Collins. I said, do you want a woman? he said, yes, a woman that robbed me. I said, there was but one woman here, and she is gone out. Then he went out after her. There was a gentleman name French drinking a three halfpenny glass of brandy with her, he often calls in at my house for a glass of brandy, he lives at the other end of the town.

He took a hanger out of a basket there, he hid it under his coat, this was near 12 o'clock; then he said, we will go out, and see if we can go home: when he came there he knocked at the door, and was locked out. I said, come home with me, I lodged at the Ship in Turn-again-lane, we went there, I could not get in, then we did not know where to go; then we walked along, and came into the Old Bailey; said he, I'll go and pick up a moll. I said, let us go and take a walk to pass off the night some way or other: we then went into Smithfield, and returned again down the Old Bailey. We saw the lid of the window lay open, he knocked his knee against it; said he, by G - d we will go down here. We both went down, and up stairs into the kitchen, we saw some fire, he lighted a piece of paper, and looked about and could not find a piece of candle; he found some matches, and took the value of half of them, and burnt them all out; he found a hammer, and drawed the nails of the bar door; at last he knocked the hammer through a pannel, and pushed up the window, and got in and opened a cupboard, and took out these things; then he came out and said, d - n you, I'll either have their lives or more money; being in liquor he did not care what he did. He went up stairs and drawed the hanger, and swore the first person that made any resistance he would run him through; he found a pair of pockets on a table, he took them, and in another room he saw a pair more, he took them; then we came down stairs, and opened the door and went out.</p>

               <p>Each indictment charged them, that in order to induce the Jury to believe the charge against Capt. Bolton, they swore, that the said Bolton did lick and beat the said Morgan (who told the captain, he was lame of his arm, and could not do as ordered) and forced him up upon the mizzen top-sail-yard, from whence he fell upon the main brace, and received such hurt by the beating and fall he never did a day's duty afterwards. There were other averments in the indictment, but this the Jury more particularly went upon.</p>
               <p>After the copy of the record of the trial and acquital of Capt. Bolton was read, T. Gurney, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176304130027"/> short-hand writer, deposed as follows: That he attended the sessions as usual; that Luthwait on that trial deposed, that Capt. Bolton drove the deceased Morgan up upon the mizen-top-sail-yard by licking, which he explained to be beating him up the shrouds, with a rattan made of cane woulded round with tar-twine; that Morgan made application to the captain, that he had lost the use of his hand, and was not able to go up; that he fell down upon the main brace, by which means he got a hurt on his loins, that he saw a scar there afterwards, and that he never did any duty after that, being quite incapable from that fall and the other usage that he had had.</p>
               <p>And on the trial of Simpson, he, the short-hand writer, deposed: That Simpson, on the trial of Capt. Bolton, swore, that Capt. Bolton did lick Morgan with a rattan, because he was not able to do his duty; that he wanted him to go upon the top of the mizen-top-sail-yard; that the deceased said he was not able, and if he chose to beat him he must, so he did lick him up, from whence he fell against a rope; that he complained afterwards of some bruises he had received, and never did a day's duty afterwards; and that Morgan had spoke of his arm being lame, and the captain knew of his being lame of it, notwithstanding which he forced him up.</p>
