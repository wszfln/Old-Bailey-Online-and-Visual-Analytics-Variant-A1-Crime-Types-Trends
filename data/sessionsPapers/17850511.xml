               <p>Was it day-light, Sir? - It was as light as it is now, except the sun.</p>
               <p>Had Honey any disguise over his face? - Yes, over part of his face; Honey stood on tip-toe on the foot-path to look into the carriage, and I observed his person, his face was towards me, he then had a disguise over part of his face; he says to Mr. Hammond, your watch; says Mr. Hammond I have never a watch; says he, I saw you put the seals into your pocket, therefore you have a watch; says I, no, I do not believe he has a watch, I have one, you may take mine. I am apt to be robbed, and therefore I bought a watch on purpose; it was a silver watch, and there was a steel chain, and a compass seal. I saw Honey's face, his handkerchief was not quite over his mouth, I saw the bottom part of his mouth very strongly; I knew them both again the next morning, I might not have known them two or three months hence, but I have not the least doubt now, I wish I had for their sakes; I cannot swear to Yeldham.</p>

Then Mr. Gray gave him his watch; he then said to Mr. Gray, have you given my partner your money; he said he had; then they shut the door, and wished us a good night; they were both of them dressed in green; their persons are so very clear to me, that I am very sure these are the two young men, I cannot say I know Yeldham: they had both handkerchiefs, I saw only their chin.</p>

               <p>I live at Acton; on the 21st of April I was at home all day; about four, or a little after four, I saw them three gentlemen walk by opposite our house, they seemed to be in liquor, and were playing and talking as they went along, and about six, I observed two of them come back again opposite my house, the tall one, that is Ivemay,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110004"/> and this man that stands on this side, that is Yeldham; I am very sure these are the three men that I saw at four o'clock; I saw Yeldham walk back the town way, then I saw the tall one, Ivemay, run after him, and talk to him; at last the little one seemed to be rather in a passion, and would go to town; then the other man reasoned with him, and they went down to Ealing common together; and about eight there was a piece of work about a man being taken up, and I went down, and I looked at the man, says I this man has got two more with him somewhere, for I saw them twice this afternoon; we went and searched every where, and we met three of Sir Sampson's men, and the next morning we brought Ivemay to Sir Sampson's, I had no doubt the next morning but these two men which I saw, were the same I saw the afternoon before; they went towards the Cock and Crown.</p>
               <p>Jury. What coloured clothes had Ivemay and Honey on? - They had both green coats, and black breeches and silk stockings: I had so much time to observe them because I was bled at twelve o'clock, as I was not well, and so I did not work for fear of setting my arm a bleeding.</p>

               <p>I am a silversmith, in King's-street, Westminster; I know the prisoner very well, he applied to me to dispose of some property on the 4th of April, it was a gold watch chain, this is what I bought of him, at the rate of three pounds ten shilling an ounce, I believe it came to near three pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. How much did you give him for it? - Above fifty shillings, he applied to me afterwards, on Wednesday the 6th with some gold and silver coins, and I suspected him, and I gave information to Mr. R. Abington, a Justice of peace, in King's-street, Westminster; he was apprehended in consequence of that information on Saturday the 9th, he was then I believe servant to Mr. Stanhope, he was apprehended in Tothill-street, at the sign of the Angel.</p>
               <p>Was any thing found upon him? - A key, a few halfpence, and a watch.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you know this man before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long before? - About two months.</p>
               <p>Had he before brought any thing to sell at your shop? - Nothing of any consequence, I did not know he was in service at that time, he told me the chain was left him by his father.</p>

               <p>This chain is my property.</p>
               <p>When had you last seen it, Sir? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>How long had he been in your service? - About a fortnight, this chain lay in a little box, made on purpose to hold various things of that sort, in a recess within my bureau in the upper drawer in my dressing room.</p>
               <p>Who had the key? - I had the key, which he said, he took once, I can swear to this chain by a very particular mark, it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110006"/> was a watch-chain of my wife's, and I made it for myself, it is much shorter than any other of the kind, I have no doubt of its being mine, it is gold.</p>
               <p>Was your bureau kept constantly locked? - Generally, I did not miss this chain till it was brought to me.</p>
               <p>Can you say whether you had seen this chain after he came into your service? - I believe I have seen it in that place where it lay, but had not taken it out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. Had not you a good character with this man, Sir? - An extraordinary good one, better than I ever had before, from a Mr. Moore, whom I believe to be a very respectable gentleman, though I do not know him.</p>

               <p>How do you know they were his lodgings? - His wife was in the room, and some of the things were found upon her, which Mr. Stanhope owned afterwards; and these things were in a chest in the room, and when the prisoner came home I found the key in his pocket which opened it, I unlocked the chest with the key, this was on the 9th at night; I suppose we had been three quarters of an hour in the house, before the prisoner came home. (Three gold snuff boxes, and a gold dish deposed to.) These things lay on a bureau in the room, but not in the bureau, these watches were all found in his chest, and all going. (A case of instruments deposed to.) I took the prisoner into custody he signed a confession.</p>

               <p>Court. How soon after was it you saw it at Tonks's? - I followed him up.</p>
               <p>Did he know you was present when it was taken? - Yes, he took it before me, and he laid it down in my presence; Mrs. Tonks was not at home; Mrs. Tonks desired me to bring it away four or five days before, but I would not; she said that the servant had promised to give it her.</p>
               <p>What capacity was you in at that time? - My master brought me a letter to go to St. Thomas's Hospital, and, as I was out of place, I was at Tonks's house.</p>

               <p>Court. How old are you? - Turned of fourteen; I am servant to Mr. Miller I go out with beer; on Tuesday the fourth of March, the prisoner came and ordered two pots of beer and change for a guinea, I heard her and saw her, I was to carry two pots of beer to Mr. Cobham's, in Stewart's Rents; the prisoner had left the house before, and at the top of Stewart's-rents, she met me and took the two pots of beer, and the change from me.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it is the same person that is now at the bar that received the change, and the beer from you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen her before? - Never.</p>
               <p>What time was it? - Between nine and ten at night.</p>
               <p>Was it a dark or a light night? - It was quite dark.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough for you to distinguish the features of the prisoner at the bar so as to know her again? - Yes, Sir, it was.</p>
               <p>Did she give you that guinea? - Yes, I took the guinea to the lamp afterwards, I hallooed out stop that woman! and she stopped herself; I then said, either give me another guinea or give me the silver back; says she, are you sure it is me, yes, says I, I am; then says she, I will go to your master, instead of which she run away; the girl from the Horse and Groom, a public house, came and told us where she lived, and I went to the house in Wild-street, No. 5, where I found her; she then took and clapped her foot against the door, and said, can you swear to my dress, she had a bonnet and a long dark Bath cloak on, I am sure; with that she brought out a red cloak, which she has on now, she was got into the house, and had a young child in her arms.</p>

               <p>Court. Then she had no cloak on at the time of this conversation? - No, none at all, but when I said her dress was a brown one, she brought out a red one, she was brought up to our house, and my mistress sent for a runner, and she was committed.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner at the bar was the person with whom you had all these transactions? - It is the person, Sir, I am quite confident.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Boy, do you know what an oath is? - Sir, I never took but two or three.</p>
               <p>Do you know what an oath means? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Do you know the nature of an oath? - I suppose, if so be you tell a lie in what you are saying, you can think of going no where but to hell.</p>
               <p>Were this woman's apartments searched? - Yes, they were the next morning.</p>
               <p>Was her person searched? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What money was found on her? - None, but her husband came with her half way up Poppin's-court?</p>
               <p>What money was found upon her? - A sixpence, and two or three halfpence.</p>
               <p>Do you remember her telling you her name was Chambers, and that she lived at No. 5? - No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110013"/>Did not you say to her at first, you did not know it was her? - No.</p>

               <p>I was standing at the bar window when the prisoner came to order the beer; I live within three doors, I generally go there, I saw her order two pots of beer to Mr. Cobham's, and change for a guinea, I am sure it was the same lady.</p>
               <p>What was her dress? - She had a brown or drab colour cloth coat, and a bonnet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. They are very distinguishable colours? - People give them names according to their own fancy.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you ever seen the prisoner at the bar before? - No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you call that coat you have on a brown one? - I call it a drab colour, some people call it a brown.</p>
               <p>Do you call the boy's coat a drab? - It is all fancy.</p>

               <p>I never was in the woman's house in all my life, I know nobody in Stewart's-rents, I do not know the sign, I never had a brown cloak on in my life; I was going down Stewart's-rents, that boy was crying out stop, mistress! I turned back, and said, do you want me, he said, no, he did not what he wanted, it was very frosty; he said, a woman had taken change for a guinea, there was immediately a mob of people; I said how could you be so foolish? I hope you do not think it was me, says he, I do not know whether it is or no; I said, to the woman at the Horse and Groom, says I, my name is Chambers, I live at No. 5, in Wild-street; I went home and told my husband the circumstance, presently there came a knock at the door, the boy came in, and said, I was the woman, he said, the woman had a long brown cloak, I immediately shewed him this cloak that I have on, I have witnesses to prove that I went out with this cloak, and came in with this cloak; I went to Mrs. Miller's house, she doubled her hand, and said, give me a guinea you wretch, or else I will prosecute you; and a constable was called, and the runner said to me, you bitch, have you one pocket or two? they searched me, and found sixpence and some halfpence; immediately my husband came in, they seized him, searched him, and took us both to the round house in Covent Garden, there we were till the next morning, and the Justice discharged my husband; then Mr. Miller came and swore that piece of money was delivered him by the boy, and that it had never been out of his possession, now Mrs. Miller had this piece in her pocket, turned out her money, and he damned her, and said, why did not she keep it by itself.</p>
               <p>(The piece of money produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It has been in my bureau.</p>
               <p>Boy. It is the same piece I delivered to Mrs. Miller.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Miller. I put it in my pocket among my silver, I never keep my gold and silver together, it never has been out of my possession and my husband's.</p>
               <p>Did your husband ever carry it to Bow-street? - He did not, he was with me.</p>
               <p>When had your husband it? - Out of my hand into his, to give it to the Justice, in my sight.</p>

               <p>I am a day labouring lad, my father and mother live opposite to this house, I never was employed there before; Mrs. Wallis, when she came down to the house, desired me to go and sleep in the house, till they came to take care of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you lay by yourself? - I had a little dog that laid with me, I laid below stairs in the kitchen, and I was going home to bed on the 12th of April as usual, it must be between eight and nine, it was moonish light.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any remains of daylight? - No; there is a gate to the garden about ten or a dozen yards from the house, it is a spring lock, I had the key with me, when I came there I found it bolted withinside; then I went over directly to my father's house, and told him the gate was bolted, and he said, are you sure of that? I said, yes; then he said, stop a bit, I will get a lanthorn and go with you, so he went with me and took a lanthorn, and I got over the wall by the gate, and unbolted the garden gate, and let my father who had he lanthorn, and the dog in; the dog went directly into the shrubbery, where two men lay, and he began barking at them.</p>
               <p>What kind of dog was it? - A little tarrier, I ran directly after the dog, and saw two men get up from the shrubbery and run away, and I run after them, and they jumped over Bushy Park wall, that adjoins to the garden; I jumped over after them, and the prisoner was the person I took, the other man struck me twice, and then run away; I took the prisoner into the first public house I came to, my father came to my assistance, and he and I secured the prisoner; we took him to the sign of the Maidenhead, and there I left him with my father, till I fetched the constable, I came to the house in about twenty minutes afterwards, and it was all torn to pieces, all the drawers were opened, two windows were broke open, and they had shoved the bars out of two windows, and had wrenched one off; and the door was unlocked, the kitchen is a little under ground; I found every thing broke open except one door, I could not tell what was stole out of the house, till Mrs. Wallis came down; the prisoner was searched at the Maidenhead as soon as the constable came, but nothing of Madam Goddin's property was found upon him, at the public house he had a silver spoon found upon him, but that did not belong to Madam Goddin.</p>
               <p>When you first discovered them, were they laying down or standing up? - Laying down on their bellies, I think they must be in the house as soon as it was dusk, by the damage that was done to the house; the man at the public house went with me directly, and I shewed him where he threw some things from him, when I had hold of him in the park, he struck me once over my face, and he went to strike me again, and it fell out of his hand; we took two candles with us into Bushy Park, and there we found this pistol.</p>
               <p>Was it charged? - No, it is the pistol he struck me with, and there were these two black cloaks, and three pair of stockings along with it, and these picklock keys, and a tea cannister, and this handkerchief.</p>
               <p>(The two black silk cloaks deposed to by Mrs. Wallis, as the property of Mrs. Goddin.)</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wallis. I made them, they are about six shillings value, this cannister was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110016"/> left in the closet with the plate that was stole, it is of no value, there is about an ounce of tea in it; here are three pair of silk stockings, value three shillings, and these five pair of cotton stockings are valued two shillings, they are all marked E. G. these three handkerchiefs were found, they are Mrs. Goddin's; the other things have never been heard of since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him how far it was from the gate to the trees, when he says, he saw me lay down? - It may be pretty near thirty yards, but I did not see him till the dog ran.</p>
               <p>How near was you when he got up? - About fourteen yards.</p>

               <p>These together are vastly above the value of forty shillings? - Yes, I was never in the house, nor anybody since we left it; they broke every lock in the house except one, and that they attempted in two places.</p>

               <p>Did you make him any promises, if he told you the truth? - None at all, never, there was a gentleman with me in the chaise; and when we put him in the chaise he had a guinea and eighteen-pence, and six-pence in half-pence; he said he had laid out five guineas in Holborn, in buying clothes of a salesman, part of which he had on, and some in the country: I asked him what became of the money he had taken out of the box; then he told me, as I have told you.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Was you present when I was convicted for this? - No, I was not, but I know he was convicted, because I frequently locked him in the cells; he was delivered on board the Censor bulk on the 11th of January, 1783; I went down with him.</p>
               <p>Court. It must be proved that the prisoner at the bar was the man that was convicted of this: how many more received the same sentence? - A great many more.</p>
               <p>How came you to recollect that? - It was long vacation, and it is the usual time they receive them.</p>

I own myself, my Lord, to be the person that was found at large; but through a good character, I hope you will take it into consideration, and shew me mercy: since I have made my escape, I applied to a friend, Mr. Matthews, and learned the business, and in the course of seven weeks I found I could earn a living; he recommended me to Mr. Dalton; when the watch business was slack, I applied to Mr. Woodchase, and I did at different times work at this business also; and through the mercy and favour that I hope the divine goodness will lead you to shew to me, I trust I shall find favour.</p>

I submit to your Lordship, that this woman is an accomplice; admitting her evidence to be true, she clearly was there from the first moment that that application was made, if she speaks truth, there was a power of attorney forged in her presence, with my Lord Mayor's name, and Bell's mark put to it.</p>

               <p>Did not Jackson acknowledge that he had given me a power of attorney, that had been signed by the Lord Mayor? - There had been a power originally signed by the Lord Mayor, he did mention that there was a power of attorney originally signed according to that date.</p>
               <p>Did he say, he had given that to Ley to come to your house to receive the money? - First it was an application of Jackson's, to know whether Ley had received the money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. When were these prizes taken? - In December, 1777, and in April, 1778, no later than that.</p>
               <p>Court. After Jackson came the third time, do you recollect any person coming to your house to enquire for him? - Mrs. M'Carthy came, and was talking about Bell's prize money, and I asked her in.</p>

               <p>How far back would it be possible to search that? - We make entries of all, that would take a considerable time; Jackson and Ley both said, that the real power was of that date.</p>
               <p>Did he say what he had done with it after he had filled it up? - Jackson said, that he gave a shilling to pay the fee upon the execution of this power of attorney.</p>

               <p>Court to Clementson. You said, that Jackson said, that that power was a very good one, and that he knew the Lord Mayor had signed it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Will you endeavour to recollect, whether afterwards, he said, it was a good power? - Afterwards, when they came to be examined before the Lord Mayor, he said, there had been an original one executed by the Lord Mayor, and that Mr. Ley had lost it, and had made them out that.</p>
               <p>But at first, he said, it was a good one executed by the Lord Mayor? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How long after this was it that he was taken? - It might be a fortnight, I told this person his name, and every thing; about twenty minutes past eight I went into Noble-street, and I told it to another witness that is here.</p>

               <p>Court to Edwards. How came you to take notice of this particular parcel of gloves? - Because they were to be called for the next day; they were in a paper, tied round with one string; they were a pretty large size, about twenty inches long, and six or seven inches deep: I heard of the alarm about half an hour after I put the things by, then I found that parcel was missing; I found Shipley at the door, when I came down he told me there had been somebody in the house, and he supposed they had taken something out.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you this somebody was? - No, he did not know then, but this lad Askew told him afterwards that it was Metcalf who went to school with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, to Mr. Penny. Do you send your goods to the waggon by your own servants? - Yes, this parcel was looked out by a gentleman of Chichester.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, when Mr. Clarke and that gentleman took me up, they said they would tell me by and by what it was for, when I came to the Compter, they said I should know by and by, they went and fetched that gentleman in green, and I was called out seperately by myself.</p>

               <p>Court. Then you delivered the ring to him? - I delivered the ring to him for sale, and I expected him to pay for it.</p>

            . chap. 24. there is a specific penalty imposed on persons who shall pawn the goods of others, without the consent of the proprietor: that is clearly the case of the prisoner; he, without the consent of the proprietor, pawned the goods: the Act of Parliament has provided the penalty of twenty shillings, and certainly as the legislature annexed that penalty to the offence, it shewed at that time it was not to be considered as a felony; I shall submit therefore to your Lordship, in point of law, he cannot be convicted on this indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. This is a question in some measure to be left to the Jury, with direction in point of law; it has very frequently occurred to my own mind, what difficulties must arise from the Act of Parliament which I have now before me, upon that particular kind of felony, of which we have a great many instances here; and I take it, (for otherwise it seems extremely difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile the law) I take the distinction to be this, that where things are taken with a felonious intention, and afterwards pawned, then the circumstance of pawning does not make the act less penal, it remains a felony, and requires no Act of Parliament to make it so; it is one way of disposing of stolen property; but where there is no offence but that of pawning without the consent of the owner, with an intention of restoring the property, it seems to me that if any offence can be within this Act of Parliament, it must be that offence; therefore I shall leave it to the Jury, to declare whether they believe that he intended to steal these things, and convert them to his own use; in that case I should be of opinion, that it would be a felony, and in the other, not a felony; for it would be a very strange construction that that which was meant to be the subject of this Act of Parliament was a felony; and it has been universally held that all Acts of Parliament inflicting lesser penalties, repeal greater ones.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hunter. During the time these things were first pawned, his father died, and he was intitled to have some part of the property, that is a fact within my own knowledge; and he was in expectation of some money, by which he could redeem those things.</p>

               <p>I missed these books about two months ago, or rather better; I advertised them twice in the daily papers, but I heard nothing of them, till Mr. Downham, the prisoner's landlord came to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do not tell us any thing he said to you. - He came to me after he had taken up the prisoner, I went immediately to Justice Walker's, where the prisoner was taken, and I spoke to the prisoner, and asked him, have you done any thing with any of my books? he was very much confused, and muttered something, I thought it was no, but I was not sure; I told him, if he had got them he had better be candid and open, and perhaps he might expect mercy.</p>
               <p>Court. After that declaration, the law will not permit us to hear what he said: in consequence of that did you ever find any of your books again? - Yes, I found them again at the pawn-broker's in Wych-street.</p>
               <p>What did you find there? - I found all the number mentioned in the indictment, I think it was eighteen, but I am not sure; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110036"/> found several books, many of which I had not missed: I knew them all.</p>
               <p>How did you know them? - Many of them I had wrote the price in which I had given for them; my book-case was open, and the key in it; I always let the clerks go and read there when they have nothing else to do; the prisoner was my <rs id="t17850511-18-deflabel104" type="occupation">clerk</rs>

               <p>Did he live with you at this time? - No, I parted with him the 26th of March, which is about three weeks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. This poor fellow lived with you one year and an half? - Yes, thereabouts.</p>
               <p>You had advertised your books without success? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And would never have learned any thing of them without his information? - No, I had not the least cause of suspicion before this unhappy affair.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cowper gave you no manner of information? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>These books I received of the prisoner, on the 4th of April, I delivered him four of these volumes on that day, and he brought another volume on the same day.</p>
               <p>When had they first been pledged with you? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Had they been pledged more than once with you? - I believe they have.</p>
               <p>How long had they been away? - About two or three hours; there are other books that I cannot speak to, because they have been pledged with Mr. Cowper before I lived with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. These were an incompleat set, were not they? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Not in a state fit for sale? - No.</p>
               <p>How long have you been a pawn-broker? - Eight years.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath do not you know that an incompleat set of books is much more sit for pledging than for sale? - I do not pretend to say it, I do not know the value of books.</p>
               <p>Court. It is a matter of inference; he is not bound to speak his opinion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I do it merely for the credit of the witness.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not think it goes to his credit.</p>
               <p>- MILLER sworn.</p>
               <p>I have taken books of the prisoner several times, I have not seen this parcel of books, (looks at them) I believe there is one book which I should know, here is one book with two others, which was pledged the 12th of March last, which I have taken of him before several times; I have left the business, only I was requested to attend here; I cannot identify them, they have been mixed.</p>
               <p>(The five volumes, and one volume deposed to by Mr. Tancred.)</p>
               <p>These are the five first volumes of the Harleian Miscellanies, I never had the three last volumes; I had them of some relation, and here are their names in them; he left my service the 26th of March; he called in once or twice afterwards, but I was there; I advertised these things, I think about a month before, he had no opportunity of taking these books after he left my service; and I do not think he could have brought them back without my knowledge.</p>
               <p>What was the state of his health? - I only know from hearsay; I hear it is very deplorable indeed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I will ask you, from my knowledge of your character, do you believe he was prompted to do this from necessity? - Upon my word, I think he could not do such a thing without it was from disease and necessity.</p>
               <p>Court. You have given a very good natured answer to the question; but I am bound in justice to ask you another question; how could this man be reduced to such distress, while he remained in your service? - I am sure, my Lord, I do not know what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110037"/> his distress was, I have heard nothing but about his health.</p>
               <p>Was it a sort of disease, an extremity of disorder, that does exhaust a man's money? - I observed he was in great pain when he walked.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. One can rather hint at the disorder than talk of it; but I will ask Mr. Downham? - I really believe he was in a most unhappy state, from a certain disease.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. In consideration of your former good conduct, and the distressed situation you have been in, these gentlemen have all of them very humanely interested themselves in your behalf, and they say they have an opportunity of sending you abroad, if your health was properly restored, which I think in point of justice you should; but you cannot be sent in the state you are in, and confinement in prison would be fatal to your health; therefore I will order you to be burnt in the hand for this offence, in confidence from these gentlemen, that when you are better, you shall be sent out of the kingdom.</p>

               <p>On the 9th of April, I was standing at Charing Cross, looking at the man in the pilory, and the prosecutor was coming by with a chair on his head, and another man with a box on his head, they were intangled together looking down, I saw the prisoner's left elbow against the prosecutor's right-side, and I saw him take the watch out of his pocket and convey it to the other person, I never took my eyes off the person till I overtook him.</p>
               <p>Did you observe a moment or two before the taking of the watch any conduct in the prisoner and the people about there? - There were a great many people round about.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any particular violence used to Lucas? - No more than they were at his right-side, I did not see any blow given, I saw no particular ill-usage, I never had my eye off the prisoner after he took it.</p>

               <p>Did you yourself see her at that part of the counter? - I did not, when I observed the handkerchiefs were gone, I called to my maid and told her to run after the prisoner, the girl went after her and brought her back; I accused her with stealing them and she said she had not, and I lifted up her cloak on the inside and heard the handkerchiefs drop from under her cloak, they were in a bundle and I saw them just as they had been in the shop.</p>
               <p>When had you last examined the bundle? - Not very lately, I stood very close to the prisoner, I cannot say the number of handkerchiefs that were in the bundle, but I can say with precision they were linen and cotton, the cotton are marked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110039"/> with A.

               <p>Was she so near that a parcel might fall off the counter? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Could you mistake that? - No, Sir, because she stood with her left side to the counter, and the bundle fell from the right side.</p>
               <p>Was there any gentleman in the shop at this time? - Yes, Sir, there was a young man a neighbour, that I called in from over the way, my husband was just gone out.</p>
               <p>Was that gentleman in the shop when that bundle dropped? - He came over before the woman came back.</p>

I asked him for the key, he said he had left it on board; I said that was surprising; I asked him what it contained, he said it contained a pillow, two Scotch blankets and a bed, and two pair of shoes, and some things; I detained them, and the next day they were taken before the Magistrate, and Smith came to give them a character, and Smith swore before the Magistrate, that the chest and contents were Manevil's, and signed his hand to the paper, and directly as Maneval saw him sign the paper, he gave an item, and Smith was ordered out; then Manevil confessed how they came by the chest; and I went in consequence to the prosecutor, in Wapping, in Milk-alley, he was in a very deplorable situation, having lost his all; I took him to Mr. Staples's, and the prosecutor described the property; then the three prisoners were all detained, the chest is in court, it has been in my possession ever since sealed up.</p>

               <p>What passed when you bought this parcel of lead, who was present? - Collins and Baptist, and I think Paul was present; I believe Paul brought it, nothing particular passed, but weighing the lead, and paying for it, I paid about twelve or fifteen shillings.</p>

               <p>What weight had you? - I do not recollect, it was all at a penny a pound, it was exceedingly old, and perished throughout.</p>
               <p>What kind of lead was it? - It had the appearance of old decayed sheet lead, it was in small pieces, beat up, I sold it again without rolling it out.</p>
               <p>Did you hear from either Baptist or Paul or from Collins, in the presence of either of them, where this lead came from? - No, Sir, that I did not.</p>
               <p>Did not you think it very odd where this lead came from? - It was very dirty and very old, it was dry to be sure.</p>

               <p>I am a constable, on the 28th of April last, between twelve and one, I charged the prisoner with robbing the prosecutor, he was taken by another young man, and brought in a coach, and I found upon him a watch and key, the watch was delivered to me, nothing was said to him before this, the watch was delivered to me by Mrs. Bergstrom, he said the watch was their property; I believe the key will open the door.</p>

               <p>I used to wear a watch which was kept in the room where my father and mother lay; I have many a time seen it in that drawer, I wore it the Sunday before it was missed, my mother gave it me to wear, she said I should have it, I returned it to her at night, and she put it by in the drawer; I should know the watch again among a thousand.</p>
               <p>(Deposes to the watch.)</p>
               <p>I wore it above a twelve month, it has the same chain and seal, the seal is a man's head upon it; I gave that notice to the pawn-broker, when he took it, there is a little bird upon a little branch on the other side of the seal: when the prisoner first came in, says I, here is Lundman, aye, says he, here is the thief.</p>

               <p>N. B. On the application of the constable in this last trial, who was a housekeeper in Wellclose-square, for his expences, the Court wished it to be generally understood that all witnesses that attend are not necessarily to be allowed for their attendance, but only those poor persons that lose their time, and daily labour; and that where a great number of witnesses, and constables, for instance, were bound over, such would not, in future, be allowed their expences. Mr. Alderman Watson observing, that himself, and the Jury, and every man that attended there, on the business of the sessions, were taken from their employments; but in doing what they could to protect society, their reward was with themselves.</p>

               <p>Who gave the instructions for the indictment? - The witness which I have here, going from the place with me, said the prisoners told him whose house it was, but I did not hear them.</p>
               <p>Court to watchman. Did you hear the prisoner say whose house it was? - I did, but I did not take notice; the prisoner told, at the Justice's whose house it was.</p>
               <p>Is there anybody here that was present at the time? - No.</p>
               <p>What Justice was it? - Justice Walker.</p>
               <p>PRISONER M'CABE's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>On Saturday night was a week I was standing at my own door, and this man came up to me, he was very solid and sober, seemingly to me, it was about two o'clock, he asked me to drink, I said I did not want anything to drink; and at the watch-house the man said I robbed him of four shillings and six-pence, on Monday he said I knocked him down upon the bed; this young woman was stopped coming to bring me my bed-gown at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>PRISONER GEORGE'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have nothing to say.</p>
               <p>Court to watchman. Did you observe whether this woman had her clothes torn? - M'Cabe had; I asked the man how she came to have her clothes torn, and he said it was because she wanted to run away after they had got his money.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. It is perhaps not necessary now to state the particular place where the robbery was committed, but wherever the party drawing the indictment, does charge the place, the proof must correspond with it; and here there is no evidence whose dwelling-house this robbery was committed in.</p>

               <p>I am a hair dresser, I have been backwards and forwards several times to the prosecutrix's house, and seeing the prisoner come with a trunk on his head, I had a suspicion he had taken it, and I run down into the gateway to see if the trunks were there, and I found one was gone, I hallooed out stop thief! and I saw that gentleman and another lay hold of him, and bring him back to Mrs. Blexley's house; the prisoner had the trunk on his shoulders.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was on my head, Sir.</p>
               <p>I asked him where he was going, he said, to Mincing-lane; I said, you are going the wrong way.</p>

               <p>Court. Did he give the same account when he was brought back to the shop? - Yes, he said, a woman offered him sixpence to carry it into Mincing-lane; he said, on my calling out stop thief! he thought the women were behind him in the room of me.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Dr. Burney, between six and seven in the morning, I came into my master's study, as I always do in a morning; whilst I was there opening the shutters, I heard a great noise, and I went to go down stairs, and I saw a table that stood at the bottom of the stairs thrown down, and the great kitchen poker laying along side of it, and a silver tea-pot and a silver salt cellar laying down altogether; when I saw that I ran up stairs directly to call my fellow servants, I begged them to come down, I ran down again, I saw a candle burning in the back parlour, and a poker jammed into the back parlour door, I ran up again; there is a door that goes out of the parlour into another room, this other room they had been endeavouring to break open, and they had left the poker in the door; then we went into the kitchen and we found the sash window open.</p>
               <p>Where did this communicate to? - Into a little area, the bar appeared as if nothing had been done to it; then a gentleman came over, and looking over the rails, says he, there is an iron bar sawn in two, and we found it was so, and there were two coat buttons laying in the area, the same time the bar was cut in three or four places; it was very easy to take that bar up and lay it down the same, the buttons were yellow; I had not been in that area the day before, it is not an area we go into frequently; I think I have seen those buttons before, upon the coat of a young man that lived there before, that was

               <p>The bar communicated with the area, I understand? - Yes, the sash was lifted up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you know, Sir, whether that sash was fastened over night.</p>

               <p>I am a smith, I know Dr. Burney's house, and know this bar; I was sent for that morning.</p>
               <p>Did you make any observations how it was cut? - I observed this bar was cut at three or four separate times, and withinside to the best of my knowledge, because every time it was cut it was rusty, because the snow laid upon the ground, there is a difference between cutting a thing up-handed and down-handed; and when I got it home I examined it, and to the best of my knowledge it was cut withinside.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Are you much employed in cutting bars that are fixed? - Very seldom.</p>
               <p>One of your reasons for thinking it was cut withinside was, that it was cut slanting? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that to the best of your knowledge, as a man of knowledge and experience, it is impossible from the outside to cut it in that way? - I think it is.</p>
               <p>Is not it necessary to cut it slanting, if it is to be laid on again? - It was cut close to the wall on the right hand.</p>
               <p>Did you ever cut through an iron bar with the assistance of aqua fortis? - No.</p>
               <p>Suppose a man was to take a sharp instrument to cut iron, and in order to make way, was to put aqua fortis? - It was cut with a saw.</p>
               <p>Over-handed or under-handed? - Under-handed.</p>
               <p>This is a bar over the area? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How wide is the open of the area to the street? - It may be a yard and quarter or half from the wall to the kirb stone of the area.</p>
               <p>How many bars are there over that? - That I never counted, I do not know; they run across the area.</p>
               <p>Then what may be the length of the opening? - About three yards long, or may be not so much.</p>
               <p>What distance distance may the bars be asunder? - About four or five inches may be not three, I did not measure.</p>
               <p>Were there more bars than one cut through? - No, it was cut as nigh as could be to the house, within four or five or six inches of the wall of the house, I think it was slanted from the wall, I would not be too positive, I did not take much notice.</p>
               <p>Which was the freshest part, the upper or the under? - The top part; the first part was rusty, the other was less rusty, and the other was quite clear; that appeared to me to have been done that morning.</p>
               <p>Could you form any probable guess how long before the other might have been done? - I could not; my judgment is it might be cut the night before, it had not the appearance of being cut some weeks longer, but a day or two longer.</p>

               <p>Was he examined in your presence? - Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110058"/>What was found upon him? - Two parcels of money; the first was fifteen guineas in a purse, which appeared to me to be the foot of a silk stocking, I searched again, and in a little while after I found twenty-four guineas in another purse, which I should not have seen, but for a boy, who said he had dropped something green in his pocket; I had no conversation with him where he was going.</p>
               <p>(The money produced.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Let it lay on the table, if it is evidence, it lays there.</p>
               <p>Doctor Burney. This man had several times asked me for money; he had been in my house but three weeks before he asked for money, he had money several different times during the time he lived with me, and when he quitted my service he had but 43 s. to receive.</p>
               <p>(The buttons produced.)</p>
               <p>These are the buttons, one is broke in the shank; I was present at the prisoner's first examination, nothing particular passed at that time, but the circumstance of the money being found upon him.</p>
               <p>Did he give any account how he came by so much money? - He said he had saved it in his different services; he was asked, if he had ever shewn this money, or told anybody he had such a sum of money; he said no.</p>
               <p>Did anything else pass? - I do not recollect anything; he said he was going to France, in expectation of getting a place at France, through my son-in-law's interest, but he had no letters of recommendation from me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have in fact a son-in-law in France? - Yes.</p>

               <p>The prisoner lodged next door to me, before she came to Mrs. Fonseca, she was a coal-heaver's wife, I recommended her to Mr. Fonseca.</p>
               <p>Do you know in what part of the house she lived? - In the one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Had she any other part of the house besides? - No more.</p>
               <p>What was her character? - So far as I saw, a pretty behaved woman: she was ill used by her husband, and I asked her if she would go to place, and I believed her to be an honest woman.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see her in her lodging, after she went? - She came down and staid four nights with her husband, and I persuaded her to go back to her place again; her mistress gave her leave to stay one night, and she staid four; I saw her the Sunday before she was taken up for the fact at my house, she was in her lodgings, I saw her come out, but it is a place I never go in, I only saw her come out of the house, not out of any particular room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I could speak in my own defence, if I was where I could get justice, but I leave it entirely to the mercy of your Lordship; I lived with this gentlewoman as a just and honest servant, I worked hard with her, and two nights before I went to service, I slept with this gentlewoman here, it was a house of common lodgers, I being a stranger knew nothing of it, he asked me where I lived before I went there, I said, I lodged at Green-bank, Wapping; he had no directions from me to go to search for any goods, I never had a farthing for my wages, I had not a gown till one was lent me to come here before your Majesty.</p>

               <p>On the 15th of April, between four and five in the afternoon, I lost a piece of linen cloth, about forty-four or forty-five yards, from my show-board, it was worth about 2 l. I was in the shop at the time; I did not see it taken; a man came in, and asked me if I had not lost such a piece of linen; I told him I could not say, I looked, and found I had lost such a piece; he told me he had the people in custody, if I would come and ascertain the piece of cloth, if it was mine he would deliver them up to the Justice; he went away, and I was going after him, but before I got there, he and the two women were coming with the piece of linen in their hands.</p>

               <p>The mark is 80 yards, it was made by the people of the Stamp-office; I have cut off so much, that reduced it to this quantity; the prisoners are the two women that were brought over.</p>

               <p>Mr. Wybourne, Council for the Prisoner. How long did the prisoner live with you? - Between four and five years.</p>

               <p>During that time in course he had several articles of value under his care? - Certainly he had; he used to take bills and receipts, he has taken a great deal of money.</p>
               <p>Did you dismiss him from your service? - I did, before I went into the country.</p>
               <p>How long is it since you missed these things? - In the course of last year, four or five months ago.</p>
               <p>Did you ever tax the prisoner with them? - No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner has left you five weeks? - Yes, thereabouts.</p>
               <p>When was he apprehended? - About three weeks ago.</p>

               <p>I am a headborough, I went to the lodgings of the prisoner on the 25th of April, as near as I can guess, with a warrant from Mr. Girdler, in search of the prisoner; I did not at first find him at his lodgings; I sat down with his wife, and had some little discourse, while Mr. Lock availed himself of the opportunity of looking round the apartment, there I found a tea-pot, a tea-canister, a flour-box, and a waiter.</p>
               <p>Court. These things were not in the lodging concealed? - No, they were hung up as their own furniture.</p>
               <p>(These things deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The waiter and mug were japanned at my house; if I had seen the waiter at the West Indies I could have known it; I had given no directions for any other man to carry them out of my shop.</p>
               <p>Court. Had not you sold the prisoner that waiter? - No, nor never intrusted him to carry it out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wybourne. Do you recollect ever japanning any article for the prisoner himself? - No never, I think not.</p>
               <p>What particular mark is there on that waiter? - None, I know it by the work.</p>
               <p>You will presume to swear that is the waiter belonging to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any thing particular in the painting that waiter not to be found in other shops? - This is a rose and a bird, and rose-buds and strawberries.</p>
               <p>Are not these the common ornaments on things of that sort? - They are often done, but we know it by the work.</p>
               <p>Does the man that you employ to paint for you paint for any other japanners besides yourself? - Not that I know of, he works for me constantly.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner, he is a servant of mine till he was taken into custody about these things.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner at any time purchase any articles of you belonging to your trade? - He bought this tea-pot, and a quarter of a pound canister; this is the canister, I know nothing of the waiter.</p>
               <p>Look at it again, is there any thing uncommon or particular about it in the make or the japanning? - It is what we call an old fashioned one, that is all that is particular in it, it seems as if it had been twice japanned; the prisoner behaved himself as an upright man, for anything that I knew or ever heard he was a diligent honest man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. James. You being a japanner as well as the prisoner, is it your opinion that a person of the trade can sufficiently judge of articles of this kind to speak to them again? - Not unless there is a mark made on them before; I before made a remark on this, not understanding the consequences but by their being in my possession, so long, I knew the marks on them, this jug I have had in my shop a long time, and the handle is not in the right place now.</p>
               <p>Now as to the other articles, is there any particular mark upon them? - It is rather uncommon for tea-pots to be made like this; they are all made of common tin; I never had any thing of the kind came under my care finished in this manner.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any letter or mark of the price on the tea-pot? - No, I know it by the workmanship, but the jug has a mark of 2 s. 9 d. put on by myself.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110069"/>Mr. James. I will give every thing up except the waiter.</p>

               <p>I knew the prisoner several years, he has an exceeding good character from the people in the trade as far as I know, and I know most of them; I saw the prosecutor about the latter end of April.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner then live with him? - Not the last time I saw him, he was then servant to Mr. Davison.</p>
               <p>Relate the conversation that passed between the prosecutor and you at that time? - I had been intimate with Mr. Davison sometime, and since he has been in the japanning business, I have employed him; I had employed Mr. Lock for these eight years, I now employ Mr. Davison being a neighbour, doing the work as well and cheaper, and being so handy; Lock came to me and asked me if he had lost my favours, I told him I believed he had; says he, I find he has got my man Wilmot, I said, yes, he has; says he, he is a very bad fellow, he made him out a thief.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Lock appear to you to be in a passion when he spoke of the prisoner? - Yes, and a great one, and said he would punish him to the utmost.</p>
               <p>Mr. James. Where was this? - He had then searched the lodging of the prisoner, it cannot be more than a fortnight ago, it was either the latter end of April, or the beginning of May.</p>

               <p>On the 8th of April, about three in the afternoon, I had been for a pint of beer, coming home, I saw two young men pass me, which I had a suspicion of; I went after them, and when I came to the bottom of the Court, there was only one, I came up the court again, and I saw one of them coming down the court again, I saw the prisoner Hooker going into Mrs. Clark's, and bring out the sheets, I was at a one pair of stairs window watching them; I pursued the prisoner and overtook him in Fleet-street, he had the sheets, and gave them to the other prisoner Wright who was in Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Was Wright the same person you saw with him before? - I cannot say, when he gave the sheets to Wright, I was about a yard and half off; the instant he gave the sheets to Wright, I seized Wright on the shoulder, and he threw the sheets into my arm, he had not time to do anything with them.</p>
               <p>What did Wright say? - He said, he picked them up, he knew nothing of the matter, he was quite innocent of it; he said, he did not know the other young man.</p>
               <p>Did he throw the sheets to him, or convey them to him with an intention to conceal them? - I was at his heel at the time, he did not conceal them.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether Hooker saw you before he gave the things to Wright? - I do not think he did, when I seized Wright, Hooker stepped into the middle of the street.</p>

               <p>On Friday the 8th of April, one of the prisoners at the bar went through our passage, which is the Three Tuns; he seemed to have a bundle, Stapleton was after him; I followed him, and I believe Stapleton<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110073"/> called stop thief! I saw Mr. Stapleton take the bundle from Wright and I pursued Hooker and took him.</p>
               <p>Did Stapleton cry stop thief! before the bundle was handed to Wright or after? - I think it was before.</p>

               <p>Somebody shoved the bundle at me, which knocked me up against the wall, there was a bundle, I stopped to examine it, and to my surprise there was a cry of stop thief; to prevent trouble I was proceeding on, and two men came and laid hold of me, and I went with them, the prisoner Hooker never saw me before; please to observe, my Lord, there is a reward offered in that parish of ten pounds.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman, on the 5th of this month, as I was crying the hour of two, as I was going to ring Mr. Selwin's bell, which I usually do to call the men up, I saw the prisoner Jefferies with a bag in his right hand, and the door which is a lowish door in his left hand; seeing them up I did not ring the bell, he pulled the door rather too with his left hand, the other witness was a little before me, and I told him I saw a man that used to go by the nick name of Bricklane Jack; he and the serjeant went and looked round the market, and under a basket in the passage in the market, we found this bag of flour, which I believe to be the same.</p>
               <p>Did you see that bag of flour left there by any of the prisoners? - No.</p>
               <p>Is it here? - Yes, it has been in my possession ever since, it is now in the same state it was.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it is the same bag the prisoner Jefferies had in his hand? - To the best of my knowledge, I cannot positively swear down right that it is.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is there any mark on the bag? - No, there is not.</p>
               <p>There is no mark on the flour? - No.</p>
               <p>Quick. Before the Magistrate he said, it was a bag he had made and bought the cloth; after that, he said, he had it made out of a towel or two, and he never had any but once before, and he sold that to a pyeman for for one shilling and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt to Prosecutor. Do you know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110074"/> what stock of flour you had in the house? - No, it is impossible.</p>

               <p>I am a constable, on Saturday the 24th of April several constables had been searching about in the parish, and as I was coming home along with another officer, at the corner of High Holborn, between one and two in the morning, I saw three men standing at the corner of Mr. Mackey's shop, a linen-draper; I asked them what they were doing there, and knowing the prisoner, I caught hold of him, and Taylor who was with me caught hold of the other, the other run away; in searching the prisoner, I run my hand down the outside of his coat, and I said this man has got an iron crow, and in searching him, I took this tool out of his left hand coat pocket.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. This is the tool I saw at the Justice's, and I knew it to be mine; I make them all myself, I never put any particular mark to know them by.</p>

I heard nothing of it till Friday, I heard it had been at Mr. Goodman's on Snow-hill, and I found it on the Saturday at Mr. Porter's, he asked me if it was mine, and I said it was; they told me the person who brought it was to be there on the Monday; I went, and saw the prisoner; she said she had the chain of a young man; the chain is of my manufacturing, by my people, I am quite sure of it.</p>

               <p>On the 9th of April last, about six in the evening, one Saunders brought this brass chain to me, and asked me if I wanted any; I asked to look at it, I sent for Mr. Wood, and appointed him to come on the Monday; Saunders came, and the prisoner came with him; she said she had the chain of a young man for debt for rent; I asked her how long she had had it; she said three weeks; I told her if she could not give a better account of it, I should send for a constable; she was taken before an Alderman, and committed to prison.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. How long did she lay in custody before she was fully committed? - About a month.</p>
               <p>For what was she committed at last? - For having that chain in her custody, knowing it to be stolen; the reason was because she did not bring ball that was approved of.</p>
               <p>(The commitment produced.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Are you a dealer in this article? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing peculiar in this chain by which it is distinguishable? - No, I could not swear to it, it is not my manufactory, if it was it would be different.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my chain, I know it by the make; it is my work and my young man's; it is in many pieces.</p>
               <p>Court. What quantity do you make of this? - To a large amount.</p>
               <p>How long has that workman made for you? - Several years.</p>
               <p>That which was in your shop window, did it differ from any other which he has made? - No; it is not in a state for sale.</p>
               <p>How long will it remain bright after it is made? - Half a year.</p>
               <p>If you was to put any other in a damp place, would it not appear as dull as that? - Yes, and a great deal duller.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to constable. Did the prisoner tell you she could tell you where the man lived that gave it her? - Yes; we went, and she wanted to go with me to a house in Golden-lane to enquire for him, and a woman said he was gone from there on the Saturday.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Of course, Sir, you know something about chains for scales? - Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Look at that, and see whether any person can with safety venture to swear that is his property, or whether any workman can swear that is his work? - I employ six people<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110080"/> at this time, and I cannot see any difference between one person's work and another's, it is quite a common pattern, we put these to counter scales for grocers for large weights; I firmly believe that no man can safely swear to the making of this chain; I have cut up a great many thousand yards.</p>
               <p>If it was badly made you would find fault with it? - Yes, we always look at it to see if it is well made.</p>
               <p>Jury. Have you chain-makers in your own house, or do you buy of six different people? - We employ them out of doors, they are called garret-masters, they are not made in our house; there is nothing made in any scale-makers in London.</p>
               <p>But you are not a chain maker yourself? - No, I am a scale maker, not a chain maker; this is a chain often used to scales, I believe.</p>
               <p>You formerly dealt with Mr. Wood? - I have several times, and do now.</p>
               <p>Wood. You have not had anything of me these two years?</p>
               <p>Astill. Yes, I have.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Monday last I lost all the property mentioned in the indictment, about two in the day, the prisoner was brought into my back shop for me to search her; I drew her cloak on one side and she had a piece of muslin under her arm, it was plain muslin, I imagine there was about five or six yards; it was a remarkable wide muslin; it was my property, I know it by the shop mark at the end of it, D. A. it is my writing.</p>
               <p>Court. When you send goods out of your shop do you ever send them with the marks on them? - Yes, if we send the ends on; I never had but two pieces of such muslin in my life, it is a very uncommon muslin, I had them about three weeks or a month: I asked her if she had any thing more about her, she declared she had not; I put my hand on her pocket on the other side of her petticoat, and felt something rather bulky, and I desired she would take every thing out of her pocket; she did so, and pulled out an apron belonging to me, it was a flowered muslin apron.</p>
               <p>Court. What did the piece of plain muslin cost you? - I have under valued it, it cost me fifteen shillings a yard; the apron is worth six or seven shillings; there was no mark upon it, we have been so much engaged lately we have not had time to mark our goods: I did not miss it till it was taken out of the prisoner's pocket; in consequence of that I sent for a constable, and he secured her; she declared she had nothing more about her, but he found a piece of tambour muslin upon her, which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110083"/> I knew by the marks: I saw the things within forty-eight hours before.</p>
               <p>KNIGHT BOWMAN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a journey man to Mr. Leake; this woman came into my master's shop on Monday last, and asked to look at some printed cottons; it was about two o'clock; she said it was for a bed-gown; she then went up to the counter, and laid her clock over several of the things that were on the counter, I saw her do that.</p>

               <p>In what manner? - She spread it a little over the things with her hands under it; I then shewed her several printed cottons, I suspected the woman as soon as she came into the shop; I believe she had one hand on the counter, I did not see how the other hand was employed, but her cloak was covered over it; I then shewed her several cottons, which rather hid her still more.</p>
               <p>Did not she move her cloak before you served her? - Very little; I served her, she appeared to be very difficult, and upon turning my head several times, I once thought I saw her pick something from the ground, not for a certainty, but it appeared so to me, I saw her near the ground, putting something in her pocket, but I was not certain whether she took it from the ground or not; I then observed a finer piece of muslin lay by the side of her.</p>
               <p>Was that the muslin that was missing afterwards? - Yes, that was the plain muslin; on turning my head to look for some more printed cotton, I soon missed this piece of muslin, and soon after that she bought one yard of the printed cottons; she appeared to stoop before I missed the muslin.</p>
               <p>Might she have taken the muslin at that time? - She might, I missed it just after; she bought one yard, I observed to her it was not a sufficient quantity for a bed-gown; she then said, that was quite a sufficient quantity for her purpose; she would buy it for a frock, and if I would give her a pattern of one that was on the counter, she would shew it to a person; I accordingly gave her a pattern; she paid for the cotton, and went out of the shop; I immediately got over the counter and followed her, as soon as she had got seven or eight yards, and brought her back to my master, and informed him, then the constable was sent for; but before that my master began to examine her in my presence, and he threw open her cloak, and found the muslin under her arm, and all passed as he has described.</p>
               <p>Were these things on the counter too? - I cannot answer only for the plain muslin.</p>
               <p>Did the plain muslin and the fine muslin lay together in the shop? - I am sure they did not, I saw the plain muslin before me; it was covered a little with her apron; I stood shewing her more cottons, but she covered several worked muslin with the cottons, but the plain muslin lay alone, I suppose it might be a yard from it.</p>
               <p>Can you swear with certainty that the piece of worked muslin and the plain muslin were in the shop? - I can swear that the plain muslin was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave myself to the mercy of the Court.</p>

               <p>I am messenger to the Stamp-office, Mr. Fryer brought the prisoner to the office, on the 1st of April, I took him to Bow-street, and the Justice desired one of the constables to go with me to the prisoner's lodgings, and in searching his lodgings we found these writs.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110086"/>Are there any stamps on them? - Only one, they are in the same situation as I found them in.</p>
               <p>Court. What stamps do you say have been taken off that writ? - Two of half a crown value.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I submit that is not the charge in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. The charge in the indictment is, that this man has taken off a stamp, which bore the impression of four sixpences, having been paid to Government; I produce a writ in which it appears, that not only these four have been taken off, but likewise a fifth stamp, I do not charge him with the last.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My learned friend has stated half the charge, and suppressed the other half, and it is this, that this man having in his possession a certain process which had issued out out of the King's Court, and on which four sixpenny stamps were paid, and denoted to be paid; he unlawfully got off the said stamp from the said process, with intent to use the said stamp upon a certain other process: is that the case here? this witness tells your Lordship, that there is now due and payable five and not four sixpenny duties on this, and that upon this, which the witness has said to be duly executed, there were originally five, and that those five were taken off; surely this is not the offence stated in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. I think this objection is taken up a little hastily, without considering fully either the act of parliament or the evidence. What is the evidence? the charge is, that he took off a stamp denoting four sixpenny duties from a certain writ, with intent to place the said stamp on another writ: the evidence is, that there appeared to be taken off from a writ, a stamp denoting that four sixpenny duties had been paid, and also another stamp denoting that another sixpenny duty had been paid; there is produced a writ on which there is a stamp denoting that four sixpenny duties have been paid, and another stamp denoting that one sixpenny duty had been paid, they may prove that he took off four; there are two stamps distinct and separate, why may they not prove that he took off one, without taking off the other; to this I agree, that under this indictment which states that he took off four sixpences, they could not prove five sixpences, but they have proved a stamp, denoting five sixpences had been made and taken off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, my objection is this, that the charge in the indictment is not only the getting off the stamps, but there is an intent which the act of parliament makes the capital part of the charge, that is the intent to put it on to another process.</p>
               <p>Court. At present there is no variance between the evidence and the indictment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester to Mr. Seabrook. Does that appear to have been used?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I object to that question.</p>
               <p>(The writ read.)</p>

               <p>- MAJOR, sworn.</p>
               <p>I am his Majesty's engraver, and chief engraver to the Stamp-Office; these stamps have been taken from other parchments and put on these: in the process of stamping these, the parchment has a hole cut thro' it, and they put this red on the parchment, with a particular paste that is made on purpose for the office, and there is a particular soil put through, and then it is stamped so that the lead takes the part of the impression; after that it is impossible to take that off, and put it on so strong again.</p>
               <p>Does the mark of the lead correspond with the rest? - No, it does not; this writ was stamped at the office.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>What are the stamps used on the bills of Middlesex? - We have two dies, one with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110087"/> four six-pences, and the other with one sixpence, which was laid on in 1783; we stamp none under five now, and that is done by two separate stamps, the four sixpences is in one, and the other has one sixpence; if the impression is made upon the writ it will appear on the parchment.</p>
               <p>Look at that writ and copy? - We make a hole, then we put on the scutcheon, then it is punched, then leaded, then stamped, and then cyphered on the other side.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Harris. Have you looked at that parchment which is said to be a bill of Middlesex, issued against Higgins? - I did.</p>
               <p>Are you able to swear that that piece of parchment has been legally and properly stamped at his Majesty's stamp-office? - No; I cannot swear that.</p>
               <p>How many years have you been in the Stamp-office? - Pretty near forty; I am supervisor, I superintend everything of that sort; I am conversant with the business, I have gone through all the duties.</p>
               <p>Mr. Major. It may have been legally stamped, and I rather think it has, but it is so tumbled and creased.</p>
               <p>Mr. Seabrook. It was very plain when I first took it before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. These three writs were sold by the prisoner to Mr. Fryer, now it is proved these were taken off some writs, but he had in his custody a writ, a copy of which he served on a defendant, and there is found in his custody three writs, with stamps appearing to be taken off from other writs.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Before the prisoner is called upon for his defence, I take the liberty of submitting to the Court several objections which occur to my mind, to shew that the prisoner cannot possibly be convicted; first it is stated that the prisoner had in his possession a process of our Lord the King, &amp;c. which appeared to have been before then duly issued against - Higgins and

                  </persName>
            ; I submit there is no evidence to call on the prisoner for his defence, to shew that he had in his possession such a writ; such a writ is indeed produced to the Jury, but in a state in which it is impossible it could have issued out of the court of our Lord the King, it is not proved to be duly stamped, so as to be signed; another objection is this, that it is stated to be a thing not described in the act of parliament.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Silvester. There is no averment in the indictment, that such a writ had been duly issued, but that he had in his custody a certain piece of parchment which purported to have then been duly issued against them; it is not averred that it did duly issue.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is proved that a piece of parchment was in his custody, on which was written that, which if it had been duly issued, would have been a bill of Middlesex; it is averred, that it did duly issue; my objection is that it does not purport so to have issued; my learned friend attempted to call a witness to prove that it had duly issued, but it must have been duly signed, it is proved by those who have been forty years in the business, that this never had been legally stamped, consequently it never had been legally issued; I say, this thing, as described by the indictment, has a description not named in the act of parliament, for it is called a process; I am aware there is a sweeping clause,</p>
               <p>"all other processes issuing out of the court of our Lord the King." I have another objection which I think will be perfectly sufficient for this purpose.</p>
               <p>Court. There is no such word as process in the act of parliament.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I have another objection: by this act of parliament there are two or three offences created, and the offence in this indictment is not one of them; it says first, if any person shall write or ingross, &amp;c. upon any thing which has already been used, it is not that; or shall fraudulently erase or scrape out any name or names of any person or persons, or any sum, date, or other thing written in such writ, &amp;c. it is not that; or if any person shall fraudulently cut, tear, or get off, any mark or stamp<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110088"/> from any piece of vellum or parchment, paper, playing cards, &amp;c. with intent to use such stamp or mark, in respect of which any such duty is payable; (which is, they say, the duty last enumerated) now the Court will look to the several things that the legislature meant to provide for; the Court will not take any collateral part of the act of parliament, and apply it to a new case, then comes the clause to prevent the transferring of stamps from one to the other, you will not extend the act of parliament, being a very penal one.</p>
               <p>Court. I certainly will not extend it; the act of parliament certainly refers to all the things beforementioned.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Silvester. I wish you would consider how far the intent that is specified by the act can be extended; the act had in contemplation mischiefs which had happened in practice before that time, and one was, that old deeds had been erased; another mischief was with respect to processes, here they would erase the names of one person, or put in new names, or take off the stamp, and put it on another piece of parchment, and then serve that writ; that was using it for the same purpose; it does not say as in the case of the receipt-tax, whosoever shall utter or expose to sale, or take off the stamp, to defraud his Majesty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. He sells it as a writ, he therefore does use a false stamp; and he was paid for them as good stamps.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I beg leave to suppose it was taken off for the purpose of a museum; suppose an antiquarian was to wish to have a collection of stamps, and takes one off from an old process; and afterwards sells his collection, is that a using?</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him an exceeding good character.</p>
               <p>The learned Judge summed up the evidence, and left it to the Jury, whether they were satisfied, that the bill of Middlesex against Higgins was ever stamped; and if it was, that the prisoner ever took off that stamp; and, if he did, whether he did it with intention to use it on a bill of Middlesex or Latitat; and, if they found the prisoner guilty, he desired them to state whether they were satisfied that the prisoner took the stamp off, and sold it with intention that it should be used, whether by himself or others, for one of those purposes described in the indictment, and if they were of that opinion, he desired they would say so, besides finding the prisoner guilty.</p>
               <p>The Jury withdrew some time, and returned with a verdict</p>
               <p>GUILTY Of taking a stamp from a certain instrument, and of affixing it to another, with an intent that it should be used by others.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Do you find that he had an intent on of using them himself? - No, my Lord, we conceive he could not possibly have that intention, because he sold them to the stationer.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. I will read the verdict to you. The Jury find that the prisoner took off the stamp from the bill of Middlesex, mentioned in the indictment, and affixed it on a piece of parchment, purporting to be the form of another process of the same kind, which he sold with others to Fryer, with intent that the same should be used by such persons as should purchase the same; but not with intent of using it himself.</p>
               <p>Jury. My Lord, that is clearly our idea.</p>

               <p>Mr. Attorney General. May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury. Gentlemen this is an indictment against the prisoner, under an act of parliament that passed in the nineteenth year of the reign of the late King, and it is for an offence of which, if the prisoner is guilty, the legislature have very properly thought that he deserves a capital punishment, and with respect to that I believe when you come to hear the motives on which the act of parliament passed, you will be of opinion it was a very proper act; and certain I am, that if the prisoner is guilty of the fact imputed to him, it is a fact, which from the circumstances of the present times, not only calls, but loudly calls for a very severe and strict exemplary punishment: the grounds on which that act of parliament passed, and the reasons that induced the legislature more strictly to inforce the laws against persons committing the crimes attributed to the prisoner at the bar, if ever they did exist, exist in their full force now. The act begins with reciting that whereas dissolute persons have associated themselves, and entered into confederacies to support one another, and have appeared in great gangs in several parts of the kingdom, carrying fire arms and other offensive weapons, &amp;c. and whereas, several officers of the Customs and Excise, and their assistants, have been wounded, maimed, and some of them killed in the execution of their office, to the utter subversion of all civil authority; it is therefore enacted that if any persons to the number of three or more, armed with fire arms or other offensive weapons shall be assembled in order to be aiding and assisting, in the illegal exportation of goods to be exported, or in the running, landing, or carrying away prohibited or unaccustomed goods liable to pay any duty, which has not been paid, or secured from any of his Majesty's officers, such persons shall be guilty of felony, without the benefit of clergy. Gentlemen, it is for the offence contained in this act of parliament, that is, for being so assembled for the purpose of landing, running, and carrying away, and also for rescuing goods of this sort after seizure, that the prisoner is now indicted. Gentlemen, I should have taken no notice of another part of the act of parliament, or why the prisoner was called upon to answer for another offence, if the learned Gentleman had not mentioned it, but the act goes on, and declares, that if an information shall be exhibited against any person guilty of any of the offences in this act, and that shall be transmitted to one of the secretaries of state, and proclamation inserted in the Gazette for such person to take his trial, if within forty days after proclamation he shall not surrender, then he shall be guilty of felony, in the same manner as if he had not been guilty of any offence whatever. Gentlemen, the prisoner at the bar after this offence was imputed to him, was called upon by a proclamation to surrender; he did not surrender, and it was not till a very few months ago that he was apprehended; no matter for what cause; being apprehended, he appeared to be the same man, he was committed upon, and he might have been tried upon that; but the learned gentleman says, I know I could not have convicted him upon that; how the learned Gentleman comes to be so well informed, I do not know; he will tell you if he pleases any reasons he may have for thinking the prisoner could not have been convicted under that proclamation: this I know, that the reason of that proclamation is this, that if persons guilty of those violent offences shall withdraw themselves from Justice, and then return into this country, that they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110092"/> shall be liable to be tried in this way, by shewing that they did not surrender; but whatsoever the learned gentleman may suppose, respecting me, if I did not believe the man guilty of the offence, I would scorn to prosecute him by that prosecution; and now, though it was in my power to prosecute him under that proclamation, I did not think my duty required it: but I assume no merit to myself on the occasion. Gentlemen, having before you now all the evidence that there could be on that original information, you will think with me that I do much better to prosecute him, as if he had not absconded. The offence I have stated to you from the act of parliament, whether the prisoner falls within that act, you, under the directions you will receive from the Court, are to decide: the learned Judge will state to you his opinion of the act of parliament; you will hear that, and then you will judge of the facts, and if you think those facts warranted, you will pronounce the prisoner Guilty. The prisoner is, I believe, originally a native of Hampshire, at least he has lived in that country for some years; and, until this offence was committed, I believe was continually there.

            , who is an officer in the excise, received information, that there was a great quantity of smuggled goods lodged in a house at Burley in Southampton, where they went and seized fifty bags of tea, and forty casks of Geneva; soon after a waggon belonging to one Shelly was coming by, and they desired he would permit them to take it to Ringwood; time enough had elapsed between the seizure and the time of conveying it to Ringwood, for a very considerable number of persons, of whom the prisoner is one, between thirty and forty, or some such number, that had concealed themselves behind the road to obstruct those by whom this seizure was to be conveyed to the Excise-Office; it will appear in the course of the trial, that some of them had the knowledge that the soldiers had no ammunition; and I believe the prisoner was bold enough, because he knew that fact, to take the part he did in this present business: as they were going along the road there rushed out from a wood not above three or four hundred yards from the place where the seizure was made, several persons, some of them with large sticks, and the prisoner was the most active man, crying out to the rest, damn it, come on, they shall not have a bit of tea; upon which they drove the officers away, and drove off the waggon full speed. Gentlemen, you will find these persons were as good as their words, for they got off the tea, drove it off, and no more was heard of that: this was not sufficient, which I should have thought might have satisfied these gentlemen, but they were determined to be guilty of another fact, which was one of the reasons that this act of parliament passed, which states that the officers were frequently maimed, and their lives sometimes taken away; the soldiers, as I understand, were young recruits, and they tempted them with an offer of some liquor, not to do their duty; the officers began to see that the smugglers and the soldiers were upon such terms on the road, that they thought it their best was to make off as fast as they could; accordingly all the officers endeavoured to make the best of their way; but when the smugglers found the officers were frightened and running off, they followed them, and beat them in such a manner that one of them was left almost dead. Gentlemen, this is the offence charged against the prisoner: it is necessary there should be three persons, or more, with fire-arms or other offensive weapons, that they should be assembled for the purpose either for the forcibly landing prohibited goods, or rescuing goods prohibited from the persons who by law were authorized to seize them; if they were so assembled with that view, they are guilty under this act of parliament, whether they do any thing or not; but in the present case there cannot be any doubt that the prisoner was one of them that assembled with that intent, the facts will leave no doubt of his guilt in that respect; the only question then will be whether<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110093"/> there were three persons or more in company assembled with the same common intent, or armed with fire-arms, or other offensive weapons. My Lord, will state the law, I take the liberty of stating, that if the persons so assembled had with them, or about them, those things which were used, as probably and possibly they might be used, by them as weapons of offence, that is sufficient, and then the prisoner is guilty under this act of parliament, although the weapon is not strictly and properly speaking a fire-arm, for what is an offensive weapon is to depend as well on the use of the instrument; I may make use of a thing as an offensive weapon, that is not in its nature intended as such; but I submit with great confidence to my Lord's direction, that if it appears to you that the prisoner and his comrades had at this time those things which they used as offensive weapons, as for instance, if I was to snatch that candlestick, and go about with it to knock down excise officers, I submit it would be an offensive weapon; and under that direction, I am confident you will convict the prisoner; but if there should be any doubt in point of law; if my Lord should have any doubts, and you should entertain doubts likewise, I am sure, in that case, you will not be at all averse to state what facts you find, and leave the determination of the law to all the Judges of England. These things are in your power; it is in your power generally to acquit; and in your power generally to convict: but, if you should have any doubts, though I do not know that any will arise, I am sure you will not be averse to finding the prisoner guilty on the facts, as they appear to you, stating those facts, that they may be reserved for the opinion of the Judges: but if you find the prisoner is not guilty, it will be equally your duty to say so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding My Lord, I hope Mr. Attorney-General will satisfy the Jury, that the matter of the suggestion he mentioned is quite foreign to this inquiry, for I could have given a most satisfactory answer to that suggestion, and therefore this case is not to derive any assistance from that.</p>

               <p>What were they? - Sticks, such sticks as smugglers generally ride with, rather larger than riding sticks in general, larger than walking sticks a great deal, but I never measured any of them, and I cannot tell you particularly as to the size, they are such sticks as a person would walk with to defend themselves.</p>
               <p>What next happened? - They then went to beat the horses that were in the waggon, in order to drive it away from us, then they endeavoured to keep us back, and they stood before us, and would not let us go by; the sticks that I saw, I saw them beat the horses with, and drive the waggon.</p>
               <p>Did they make any use of their sticks with respect to you or the other officers? - Not just at that time, they drove them on.</p>
               <p>Did they at any time make use of those sticks as against you or the other officers, describe what passed after that? - They kept us back from pursuing the waggon, and in turning for us to go forward, there was one of them struck the collector.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. What were the goods gone at this time? - They were gone on the road.</p>
               <p>How far were they gone? - I suppose at that time that they struck the collector they were gone a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Court. I think under this indictment after the offence is compleat we cannot hear what was done.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. What did they do at the time that the waggon was stopped? - Advancing the sticks and keeping us back.</p>
               <p>Court. Then they stopped you from coming up some of them holding up their sticks? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor. Where was the prisoner at that time? - He was amongst them.</p>
               <p>What had the prisoner in his hand at this time? - I cannot be certain.</p>
               <p>Had he any thing in his hand? - I cannot say, I did not observe.</p>
               <p>Where were those persons placed at the time they made the rescue? - They were at the left of us when they came to the waggon; they seemed to come across on the waggon at once, I never saw anything of them before.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the prisoner at the bar say anything? - No, I do not remember I ever did.</p>
               <p>Was anything said by any of these persons? - There was a cry (we were all in confusion) damn me, keep back, but who spoke it I am not able to say.</p>
               <p>What was said by any of them, when the prisoner was among them? - I do not remember hearing any of them speak but Early, and that was when the waggon was gone on.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Early call out to anybody? - He did after he passed by me when he came down the hill again, I heard him plainly and distinctly say, damn your eyes come out, on saying these words, some rushed out from behind the bushes.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner one of those? - I was at that time in confusion, I saw the prisoner there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I understand that at this place they were on horseback, of course some breadth of road was necessary to admit them? - It was a common, what we call a heath, where there is furz bushes and trees.</p>
               <p>Whether the prisoner was an accidental passenger there or not you cannot say, you heard him say nothing, you saw him do nothing? - I cannot take upon myself to assert, how he came there, or for what purpose he came there, only that he was there; I saw him but once, which was when the waggon was driving away, after that I apprehended he went away with the waggon, but whether he did I do not know; he went that way with the waggon.</p>
               <p>You saw him among that number, but you say that he did nothing, that he said nothing, that you do not know whether he had a stick in his hand or not, and that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110095"/> went away, and you saw nothing more? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. Did the waggon turn off quick or slow? - As fast as it could.</p>
               <p>Did he follow the waggon? - He went on with it.</p>
               <p>Which way was it he came? - From one side of the road.</p>
               <p>Did he go with the rest after the waggon? - Yes, there were such a number of people, some went with it, and some staid to keep us back, there were more than twenty or thirty; I only came here to tell the truth, and what I know of the fact: I shall say no more one way than the other.</p>
               <p>Court. When you first saw the prisoner he was with the rest? - He was.</p>
               <p>When you last saw him, was he with those that went away with the waggon? - Yes, as far as I saw them.</p>
               <p>This was within three or four hundred yards of Burley? - It is called Burley, it is a long straggling village, four miles round.</p>
               <p>Were there any people whom curiosity brought upon this occasion? - If I must tell that, I believe there were, for there were a good many at the house; for in such a place as that, as soon as the officers go to seize goods, the country people do assemble.</p>
               <p>I will ask you freely, you seem to speak fairly, could you from any act of the prisoner's, discern whether he was among those people who came with the rest, to see what was going forward; or whether he was one of those that came to rescue the goods? - He was with them that rescued them; but with what purpose he came there, I cannot say, I never saw anything of him, till Mr. Early spoke; where they came from I did not immediately see, there were some bushes or trees, that took away my sight, whether they been concealed or whether they were coming up at that juncture I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Were they upon the Ringwood road when you first saw them? - There are a number of roads upon the heath, but whether they were on the road I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Is there any made road in this place? - There was a road where we were with the waggon, and they were to the left of that, and they crossed towards the waggon.</p>
               <p>Did the people that so crossed towards the waggon, come up in a compleat body, or did all the other people come with them? - It appeared to me they came all in a body.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner one of those that so came up? - He came up with them.</p>
               <p>Did you give information before the Justice of peace? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Before the others came? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was it? - He met the waggon, and came past us, he then came back again, and said, damn you, come on.</p>
               <p>Do you know who he spoke to? - He hallooed out as he rode along, Damn you come on; then many came round us, they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110096"/> came out from among the bushes, and almost every where from every quarter.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner among those that came at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he on foot or on horseback? - He was on horseback.</p>
               <p>Had those people or any of them anything in their hands? - Three or four had sticks, and I saw one with a whip, I could distinguish properly.</p>
               <p>What was it that they did when they came up after Early had said, damn you come on? - Some of them fell a beating the horses, and drove the waggon away, and there was a great noise and confusion just at that time, I was on horse back, and so were the rest of the officers.</p>
               <p>Why did not you follow the waggon then? - They prevented us.</p>
               <p>In what manner was it that they prevented you? - They said, damn you, keep back, keep back; and we were apprehensive that we should be beat or hurt.</p>
               <p>Why so? - Because one or two of them had sticks, and held them up, and said keep back, keep back.</p>
               <p>Was it in consequence of this, that you did keep back, and did not follow the waggon? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know what number there might be of them? - I cannot say exactly, there were thirty or forty, as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the prisoner had or had not anything in his hand? - I cannot say whether he had anything or no.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him say anything? - No, Sir, I do not recollect I did.</p>
               <p>Did you see him do anything? - He was riding backwards and forwards with the rest, and there was a great confusion.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by riding backwards and forwards? - They kept in general riding backwards and forwards, and there was a great shouting and noise, they rode athwart and across the common, at first I did not take particular notice which way they rode, some of them took the waggon and horses, and drove it on.</p>
               <p>What became of the prisoner at the bar? - The waggon then kept driving on b those people beating the horses, and h went away with it as I believe, I never saw him afterwards, I am not clear that he went with the waggon, but he went away and I saw no more of him that day.</p>

            , and he passed on to the house where the goods were seized, then he returned again, and he called out, come on my lads, and immediately rushed out a parcel of men from the bushes, I cannot tell just their number, they were all on horseback.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner one of them? - The prisoner was one of them.</p>
               <p>Immediately when they rushed out what did they do? - They came to the horses, some riding a gallop, others walking a trot, and all manners; I do not remember what they said, they began beating the horses that were in the waggon; I saw one Jumper strike Mr. Boyd the collector, that was after the waggon was at some distance; I imagine we were about forty yards from the waggon.</p>
               <p>Were you in pursuit of them? - In sight of them, there were a number of men, smugglers, between me and the waggon.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110097"/>Was the prisoner there? - He was among the number.</p>
               <p>Were the smugglers all quiet? - They were all swearing and making a noise.</p>
               <p>What a very great noise? - A very great noise.</p>
               <p>What did they do to the people that were following? - I saw one knock down one of the soldiers.</p>
               <p>How far was you from the waggon then? - About ten yards.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the prisoner there then? - The prisoner was there then.</p>
               <p>What did they knock him down with? - A great club hedge-stake.</p>
               <p>Had they any sticks or whips in their hands? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What had the prisoner in his hand? - It was either a stick or a whip, I cannot tell which.</p>
               <p>Had he anything in his hand? - He had something; they brandished their sticks to keep me back, I imagine.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner among them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many might there be of those people that came in that manner? - There were ten and upwards.</p>
               <p>How many might there be in all? - There were seventy or eighty, or more of them in all; we followed them forty or fifty yards, and they drove down the road to the right.</p>
               <p>Where was the prisoner? - He was among them.</p>
               <p>What did he do? - I never saw him do anything; I never saw him after Boyd was struck, but he was there at that time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. We have heard this man did t ng at all, he happened to be there? - No, he had something in his hand, the party who stood there all drank together.</p>
               <p>If you cannot tell whether it was a stick or whip, of course you cannot tell what sort of stick it was? - It appeared to be largish, but I was in so much fright that I cannot recollect what sort of a one it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. His fear magnified it? - I did not see him strike any person.</p>
               <p>Did he brandish a stick? - He did nothing more.</p>
               <p>Did he do that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time did you see him do that? - Just as I got off the waggon, then I saw him brandish something like a stick or whip, I was then about ten yards behind him.</p>

               <p>(Examined by Mr. Silvester)</p>
               <p>I was in company with the other officer, at a seizure of thes teas and geneva.</p>
               <p>What was the first thing you saw? - I was the last that came from the house with the officer; before I came to the waggon the smugglers had possession of the waggon, and before I saw the prisoner; I cannot take upon me to say that he had anything in his hand; I saw him do nothing, but he was sitting on horseback, some persons ordered the soldiers to fire, and immediately I saw him turn his horse, and go the road the waggon went; I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. All that you saw him do was what I or anybody else would have done, that were drawn by curiosity, namely, to ride away when we heard an order for firing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. My Lord, I presume it will hardly be necessary for either of us to trouble your Lordship, on the law upon the present state of the evidence.</p>
               <p>Court. You will judge of that for your client.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Under the present state of the evidence, I feel myself perfectly confident that the Jury will acquit the prisoner at the bar, and I am convinced of your humanity, Mr. Attorney-General, that you will not agravate the law, as it now stands; the act of parliament says, if they assemble with fire-arms, or other offensive weapons; surely it does require consideration upon this subject, whether you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110098"/> will call a common riding stick or whip, an offensive weapon? first of all they mention fire-arms, I should conceive the most reasonable construction is this, if they are fire-arms, or other offensive weapons, such as cutlasses, &amp;c. but they never meant to extend it to sticks or whips.</p>
               <p>Court. It is impossible for the law to draw a precise line which will hold in all cases, as to what shall or shall not be called an offensive weapon; it must greatly depend on the circumstances of the case, for it would be going a great deal too far to say that nothing but guns, pistols and daggers, and instruments of war should be considered offensive weapons; bludgeons properly so called, clubs, and many others that might be described, all these are clearly upon the face of them offensive weapons: In short, anything that is not in common use for any other purpose but a weapon, is clearly an offensive weapon; but there may be pokers, shovels, tongs, very large knotty sticks, which under particular circumstances may be offensive weapons; for instance, if twenty people, every one armed with a large kitchen poker, were to come and commit an offence of this kind: loaded whips, larger than those that people ordinarily ride with, very large walking sticks - but it becomes a question of facts for the Jury; for that which may be offensive at one time, and under one circumstance, may not be so at another; and the Jury must judge: a common walking stick may be an offensive weapon in some cases, therefore, it is a question for the Jury, whether the man had it to walk with, or to attack others. I hold it to be indispensably necessary that the individual who is tried should be himself armed with some offensive weapons, for I do not think it will satisfy the words of the act of parliament that he comes in concert; there must be at least three armed, and one of them the prisoner; and three of these witnesses have not been able to say whether he had anything in his hand; and as to the fourth witness, we cannot lay much stress upon his word large, because he cannot tell whether it was a stick or a whip.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am going to state a decision of this Court, and I should not have done it in such a case as this, if I had not done so before, but, in the last case of this kind, I had nothing more to do than to hand up to the Court the opinion delivered by themselves in the preceding case. * Mr. Justice Gould tried two cases; in the last case the evidence was, that persons were assembled, armed with very large sticks, with forks or prongs to them: a witness said the prisoner had a large stick, but that their countrymen in the county of Devon did walk with such sticks; the Judges held that it would be a most gross construction of the act of parliament, to say that that which the evidences for the crown endeavoured several times in their evidence to call a bludgeon, that it would be a very gross construction of the act of parliament, to say that that stick which is equivocal in its use, and is a stick for defence, should be converted instantly into a weapon described by this act of parliament, and they laid considerable stress on the words of the act of parliament, which say, fire-arms, or other offensive weapons; the Court held, that the act of parliament must have meant some weapons as offensive, and they held that there must be a premeditated assembling and arming; perfectly clear it is that the person who is tried must be so armed, and, must be so armed with that intent; otherwise he cannot come there on the common purpose: in the other cases the Court unanimously held twice, that sticks described to be large ones, and with forks of wood to them; the Judges would not hold them to be offensive weapons, and they would not let them go to the Jury.</p>
               <p>* This was the Volume of Sessions-Papers in Alderman Peckham's Mayoralty.</p>
               <p>Court. I have some doubt whether the law absolutely put a negative upon anything being an offensive weapon, which may be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110099"/> used to injure man, even if it is in common use, as I have cited in the case of an iron poker, if I were to draw any line at all, which I do not mean to do, I should say, that to be an offensive weapon, it must be a weapon which may injure the life or limb of man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney-General. My Lord, I hope I never shall feel a desire that this man may suffer, or that that man may suffer; I want to have it ascertained what this offence is; the different constructions are at present so vague and indeterminate; I submit, my Lord, the question to be left to the Jury is, whether this person was together with three others, he being one, armed at that time with a weapon, either with a stick or whip, of some sort, brought by him for effectuating that purpose for which they were so assembled; the question is whether, from the evidence of the manner in which he used it, the Jury are satisfied that this was an instrument in his hands used for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Court. I have no sort of objection upon it, for I think it would be of extremely dangerous consequence, it would be insnaring people as well as lessening the effect of the law, that people should go away with an idea that nothing but a gun or a sword is an offensive weapon; it will be the province of the Jury ultimately to decide whether the prisoner is guilty, when I have summed up the evidence with some observations on the nature of the charge. Gentlemen of the Jury, it has been truly stated to you, that the offences described in this act of parliament are of a very dangerous public tendency, and wherever they have been committed, and can be clearly proved, it is a duty to see that the law is properly carried into execution. but no considerations, of public policy or of the dangerous tendency of particular offences ought at all to operate in lessening the degree of certainty, in order to bring home the offence to the person charged with it; for the heavier the offence and the more certain the punishment, the stronger ought to be the evidence to affect the party with its consequences. (Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence, and added.) it is clear under this act of Parliament the mere act of rescuing is not the offence, but it is the assembling for doing an illegal act; therefore the first question is, whether the persons who rescued these goods met the waggon accidentally, or whether you are satisfied that they were persons who had assembled together, and had armed themselves in someway or other for the express purpose: it is certain in point of fact, that the prisoner was amongst them.</p>

               <p>"Jones." He came first with the note and asked whether I would pay for it provided he brought it, he said the Captain would not send it unless I paid for it, and he went and brought the case, and put it into the warehouse; it was directed for the the Honourable Captain Waller, at John Lewes's, Esq; Colchester; when he first brought the case to me, I looked at the direction, and I very readily paid him twenty-four shillings, he said it contained glasses, he did not say what glasses, I did not refer to the note, he asked directly for a receipt for the case, which I gave him.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say about the contents of that note? - Nothing further respecting the the note, than the requesting the money.</p>

               <p>When he gave you the note, what did he say it was? - He said it was a note for a case of glass.</p>
               <p>Did he say whether that note contained an account of what the case contained? - He told me it did, when he brought the case again, he said that was the case.</p>
               <p>Did he say where he brought it from? - He did not, I looked at the direction, and paid him the money directly, I believe he was not in the house a minute, he went away; on the Monday following, the 28th I was sent for to the Saracen's Head, he was there, and afterwards he was taken to the King's Arms, and a case was opened, and there was rubbish and dirt in it, he said he knew nothing about it, I asked him why the glass was not in, he said, he could not tell, he went to the Saracen's Head with the constable, and two other boxes were opened there, and they contained nothing but rubbish and dirt, and he was taken to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Did he say who had sent him? - He could not tell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Council. Did you make any enquiry after this Captain? - I had no occasion.</p>

               <p>Was there any doubt as to the identity of his person there? - Not to my knowledge; I heard some person say in the yard, you have made a mistake, you have not put in the glass, he said I have not.</p>

               <p>Court.

               <p>Should you know the silk again? - I will not say.</p>

               <p>How much was you intrusted with? - Made and unmade 130 ells, what was not wrought was taken away in the round, as it was in the manner of weaving, there were about forty-six ells which were made.</p>
               <p>What sort of silk was it? - Black mode.</p>
               <p>In what condition was this silk when you first had it? - Fit to be wove.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester, Prisoner's Councel. Then this is what would be distinguished in your line of business as silk warp? - Yes, Sir.</p>

               <p>Was there any mark about this silk that you can speak with certainty to it again? - I saw it again at the dresser's, at Mr. Williams's, it was carried there to be dressed, the very day after thanksgiving day, that was the 30th of July; I can say it was the very work that I manufactured myself, it was together.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. That is part of the charge - He told me he was to see that nothing was moved off the premises. This agreement is a true copy of Mr. Smith's, there is his own hand writing for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. How many people came there? - I saw Mr. Griswell upon the premises; I spoke to him that night, but the next morning I saw Griswell there again, I did not see Mr. Smith upon my premises; but on Monday the 3d of January, Mr. Smith, and the Jew Keys, and another Jew also apparently, met me at the door in the street, and this Keys demanded my rent; I did not then know his name, I told him I did not owe him any; I says to Smith, I will pay you immediately; says Smith, I have let the house to this gentleman Keys; he was very mean in appearance, I assure you; they went over the way to the Golden Lion, and I went after them, and I tendered my rent to Mr. Smith, and not thinking myself safe, I returned a second time, and tendered my rent to Mr. Smith before a witness, which is here; the same day Mr. Smith came down stairs and shut the street door, I opened it, he returned and attempted to shut the door again, and said the house was his, and the door was his, and should be shut; and I told him the door was mine, and it should be kept open; he pushed me several times, and then he swore that the Jew should swear me in a day or two.</p>
               <p>What rent did they pretend was due from you to Keys? - One pound fifteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was you tried and convicted here? - I was tried in that other place.</p>
               <p>What fine did the Court impose upon you? - A shilling.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, there is no pretence for any indictment for conspiracy, he might have tried it by replevin or illegal distress.</p>

            , you were indicted and found guilty of stealing lead from Hendon Church, the lead was laid in the first place to be the property of the vicar, Mr. Carrington Garrick; in the next place it was laid to be the property of the churchwardens, and thirdly of the inhabitants and parishoners: the lead being affixed to the freehold, it was conceived that the property was not in any of the persons mentioned in the indictment, and it was left for the opinion of the Judges: by the act of parliament the words are general, that if</p>
               <p>"any person shall steal rip, cut, or break,</p>
               <p>"any lead from any dwelling house or any</p>
               <p>"other building whatever affixed thereto,</p>
               <p>"that they shall be deemed guilty of felony." Upon consideration the Judges were of opinion, that the church came under the description of</p>
               <p>"any other building</p>
               <p>"whatever;" therefore, the only doubt in your case was, whether the lead belonged to the vicar, or the church-wardens, or the inhabitants and parishoners; but the Judges were of opinion, that wherever the property was, under the act of parliament, the stealing from any building was a felony, and that it being said to be stolen off the church of Hendon, was a sufficient description, of sufficient certainty; and that the property was immaterial; and that the conviction was proper on the first count.</p>
