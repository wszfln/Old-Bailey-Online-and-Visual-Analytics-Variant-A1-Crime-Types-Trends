Emmett—I paid it into my bank on the 16th—it was returned, marked "Refer to drawer," on the 18th—I wrote to Horner to call and see me—he came on the 19th—I said to him, "Do you see this cheque has been returned?"—he said, "What is that mark?"—I said, "R. D."—he said, "Emmett would not have this happen for worlds; I will go to his address"—he gave me his address, 2, Hanway Street, Oxford Street—I called there; it is a newspaper shop; Emmett had his letters addressed there about two years ago—I did not find Emmett; they knew nothing about him—I did not see Horner till I was making the application for the warrant, and Emmett not till he was in the dock—Horner asked me not to prosecute.</p>

                  </hi>. On July 22nd last I hired a pony, trap harness, whip, and rug from Mr. Lyons, of Waiford, and drove towards London with my brother Ernest and Baker—on the way to Hendon dropped my brother, who was going on by train—I afterwards dropped Baker at Endell Street, Covent Garden, five or six minutes' walk from Ross's stables, in New Yard Queen Street, Long Acre—I was recom<lb/>mended there the same night by a porter at Covent Garden—Ross was a stranger to me and the porter—I saw Ross, and asked him if I could put a pony and trap there till the following morning—I told him it was not mine, and gave him my name and address—he said I could put them there—there was nothing paid—there was no one else there—I left them there—I went round the next morning and saw Ross, and told him I should not take the pony out that day, as I had not the money to meet the expenses of the man I hired it from when I left it there—I hired the trap for recreation, and not for stealing it—I had been there before—Watfordis fifteen miles from London—I had a drink with Ross and another man in his company—I afterwards found it was his brother-in-law, Neale—Ross suggested he wanted a pony and trap, and I told him it did not belong to me, and they were not for sale—they started talking me over, saying it would not be found out if I sold it, and that it could be done by putting it through a sale—I finished my drink and left them, having told them I did not want it put in the sale—I saw Ross again on Saturday evening at his greengrocer's shop—I asked him if he could lend me half-a-sovereign—he lent it to me—I then went back to my brother and Baker, and we arranged to go down to Brighton—we all went to Ross's stable on Monday morning at about 8.30—the trap was not there—I went round to his shop, which was shut—I next went to Covent Garden Market, thinking he might be there—I could not find him, and I went over to the sale at the Elephant and Castle, which I heard of on Saturday night—I did not see Ross, and I went back again where I was lodging—I saw Ross about 5.30 driving up Holborn in a pony and trap with John Smith—I knew him before they drew up, and I said he would see me at nine o'clock in the evening at the Wellington public-house—I went there and found Roos and Smith—Ross called for a drink and then called me aside, and said the pony and trap had been put through the sale, and had been sold 18 1/2 guineas, and he wanted me to take the ticket—it was a bluish one—he said it was a receipt of the horse repository—I looked at it, and found "George Cartwright" on it—he wanted me to keep it, but I re<lb/>fused—hetold me the best thing I could do would be to clear out of London, and to come up on Thursday when the money would be received—helent me half a sovereign to pay my fare—he said he had seen a couple of "splits" about London—meaning detectives—I was too glad to take his <hi rend="italic">tip.</hi> for I knew I should be arrested if I hung about there—he said he would give me a bit of the proceeds, which I agreed to—I was to</p>

               <p>give Smith 30s. or £2, as he had lost a day's work—I went down to Brighton on Tuesday, the 25th, and was arrested there the same day—I was taken to Watford Police-station with my brother and Baker—while in custody I had a conversation with my fellow prisoners—I could hear them speak quite distinctly—on the evening of the 28th I was having a conversation with my brother and Bafcer—towards the latter part of the day Ross joined us—he said, "I will look to you getting me out of it, and will see you all right when I come out"—that I was to say I did not know it was stolen property—I said I should speak the truth about it—he started using <hi rend="italic">language</hi>—the following day he paid the pony had been paid for, and no doubt he would lose all his lot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I only recollect two conversations—Ross pressed me to steal the pony and trap—I did not intend to be dishonest—it was not a thing to which I would lend, myself—my sense of honesty revolted against it I am a pianoforte maker—I was not in work at this time—I was last in work in May—I decline to say how often I have been convicted of robbing—Idid not steal a bicycle at Watford—I know who stole it—an accomplice of mine—I intended to return it—I did not try to sell it—I took it to a pawnbroker's to pledge—I had been in trouble before about bicycles—I had been in trouble for stealing books from St. Martin's Library—my last conviction for that was on April 21st, 1897—I got nine months' "employment"—that was at the North London Sessions—I had not been convicted twelve months before that for stealing bicycles—I had not been in prison for stealing bicycles or convicted—I did not get twelve months at Bow Street—I had been convicted before going to the Sessions for robbing furnished apartments—that was at Clerkenwell Police-court—Igot six months—my brother was not with me—I said just now stealing was against my conscience, because I had made up my mind to turn over a new leaf—I am not anxious now to do the best I can for myself—I have pleaded guilty. (<hi rend="italic">Harry Denning stood forward.</hi>) I have never seen him before—I never gave him sixpence if I drop down dead at this moment. (<hi rend="italic">Harry Perry stood forward.</hi>) I have seen him before—Ferrydid not bring me with the puny and cart to Denning, and ask him if he would buy them—Denning did not say that he would not buy them, or that Lucas had a spare tall, where it could be put up—I have seen Denaing in Westminster before I knew about the horse and trap—it is not true that instead of going to Ross on July 22nd the pony and trap were put up at the Black Horse Yard, in Westminster, and that Denning helped me to put it to and that I drove to Catherine Street—Denning did not drive with me to the repository, and enter it there—that is abso<lb/>lutely untrue—I did not give Bluck anything—I did not know what had become of the horse and trap until Monday evening—I knew when it was not in the stables that it had gone to the Elephant and Castle, because they mentioned it on Saturday—I saw Neale—it is not true that I offered the pony and trap for sale in Catherine Street openly—I do not know James Turner—he did not put the pony and trap to for me on Monday at 9.20 a.m.—nor did I give Ross any money—if Denning, Turner and others swear that I am the person who put the pony and trap to, and drove to the Elephant and Castle it is an absolute concoction—I never had the slightest dishonest intention as to the pony and trap.</p>

Cartwright entered the lot I bought, and took the lot home. On July 26th he handed it to me"—the sales would be Monday and Thursday—Police-constable Sullivan made a report to me on July 29th as to a conversation he heard in the cells, and showed me the notes he had made.</p>

I am a medical practitioner, of 89, Dawes Road, Ful<lb/>ham—Iwas called to 71, Reporton Road, by Mr. Perkins on July 11th shortly after 10 p.m.—I met the prisoner at the gate leading to the basement—I asked him if I had come to the right place—he said, "Yes"—goingdown the steps he remarked," She is dead"—when we had got into the room I said, "Yes, she is dead right enough," and asked him how it hap<lb/>pened—hesaid he had come home about 9.20 p.m. and found her on the bed, then he asked her if she was not going to make the bed, she said, "Yes," and got up to do it, he said "You are too drunk to do it" and gave her a push and she fell—later on he made a statement about what oc<lb/>curred earlier in the afternoon—the bedstead was iron—I examined her—abruised eye and a swollen and cut lip were all that were evident then—thebruise I eye was six to twelve days old—the cut lip was recent; within three days, probably within twenty-four hours, because there was a small quantity of blood on the side and a blood stain on the lip—that might have been done during the evening, within a few hours—what I saw then did not account for the death—I made <hi rend="italic">a post mortem</hi> on the 13th—I found a small bruise on the front and a large one on the back of the left arm—they may have been caused by a grip of the hand—there was a small bruise on the left buttock which might have been caused by a fall or a kick, and a deep bruise and extravasation of blood on the left side of the head, which was not evident till the scalp had been removed, which might have been caused by a fall or a blow—I found effusion of blood on both sides of the brain, and extensive effusion of blood at the base of the brain, which was probably the cause of death—the effusion at the sides of the brain might be accounted for by the bruises I have described—the effusion at the base of the brain was probably from a fell, and the back of the head coming against the floor—it would leave no mark of violence, because the hair would form a good protecting pad—the effusion at the base of the brain would cause death almost immediately—it would arise from the concussion of the base of the brain with the skull inside—a fall from a standing position would produce it.</p>

She did not, and I gave her one or two cracks on the face. I then went out, and came home at 9.25 p.m., and said, 'Ain't you going to get this bed made?' She said, 'I am going to make it.' I then pushed her, and she fell with her head against the head of the bedstead, and she fell down between the bedstead and the table. I then picked her up and put her on the bed, and bathed her face with water. I then went to a club and fetched the landlord of the house."</p>

"Sir, I am sorry I cannot meet your commands, I have a job to do and as soon as I can come I will"—on May the 15th I received this post card.

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital—the prosecutor was brought in about 6.30 p.m. on June 18th—I found he had an incised wound a little below the umbilical, about three-quarters of an inch long and about an inch and a-haif deep—there was considerable bleeding—he was in considerable danger fur some time—the next day his evidence was taken, with the idea that he would die—the intestines were wounded in three different places—I also iound an incised wound near his left eye, which could have been inflicted by a fist—the others were inflicted probably by a knife, and required a good deal of force—he stayed in the hospital nearly a month, when he discharged himself, and went to the French Hospital—he was practically recovered when he left—for the first fortnight his case was a dangerous one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was rather a long wound for a pocket knife to hive inflicted—I would not say it was not done with a knife which a man might not carry in his pocket.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's statement before the Magistrats;.</hi> All I can say is that I did not stab the man. I had no knife with me at all, and Lesage knows it very well, because an hour before he had asked me for a knife to cut something with, and I could not give him any. The woman Hegolski was not in the public-house when we entered, she came in afterwards. It was a made-up affair between Lesage and her, and led to what afterwards happened, I, being in drink, and after the words she addressed me with, struck her. Then Lesage rushed upon me. The woman is the inistress of Lesage. Then the fight ensued, and I went out. I soon returned and wanted to renew the fight at that time. About thirty seconds before he had already received the stab. There were a lot of Frenchmen there. When I say thirty seconds it might have been a minute. The woman Hegolski was formerly my mistress."</p>

At the station he charged me with being concerned with other people in stealing his watch, but while the charge was being taken, he said "Oh, I have not lost my watch; it is in my pocket." I was manager for three years at Manchester and have since been working at Crosby Square. When I got into the prison I was in the hospital with two black eyes and a kick on my knee. I was black and blue. He kicked me as if he was mad; so I asked the policeman to lock me up and was only too glad to go to the station. I work at 5, Crosby Square.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a marble polisher, of Rose Street, Islington—I was in Caledonian Road; going home, about 1.30 a.m., on September 7th having spent the day at Barnet Fair—I suffer from my feet, and was sitting on a doorstep unlacing my boots—the prisoner came up with two women add hustled me. "Come on," he says, "up you get or else you will be done," or, "I will do you." Before I could get up his hand was into my pocket; I said "Stand back, mind what you are doing." I had a half sovereign in my pocket, and he knocked my hand away and palled it out—he hit me on my ribs, near my heart, and I fell flat in the road—it hurt me—I was laid up for two days—I have felt it ever since—he ran away, and I heard the women he was with say "'Soldier' has got it"—I got home as well as I could and went to bed till Friday—I was perfectly sober—I came put about 11.55 on Friday and riding down on a'bus I saw the prisoner standing outside a public-house in the Caledonian Road—I walked up the road and then crossed—I went up to him and said "You don't remember me, do you? I remember what you did to me on Wednesday morning"—he laughed and jeered at me—I walked down to the "Cross" and went over to the point policeman and told him; he came up with me, but the prisoner was gone—I went to the police-station and gave infor<lb/>mation and a description and mentioned the nickname they gave him, "Soldier"—a policeman came up between 10 and 11 p.m. and told me they had got the prisoner—I went down—he was with ten or eleven other men and I picked him out without the slightest hesitation—I have no doubt he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer, of 54, Sandwich Street, Burton Crescent—on Sunday night, September 4th, I was crossing from Gray's Inn Road, when Battey and Davis jostled me into the middle of the road, and one of them put his hand in my pocket—I forced myself away from them, and spoke to a constable—I left him, and Battey came up to me and said, "I will give you something, you b—for giving me to the copper"—he smashed me in the face—Wilkinson was there—I put my hand in my pocket and lost my senses—I went to the police-court on the day of the trial—I was shown some forty or fifty men, and I identified Battey and Davis—I lost 4d. or 5d. in coppers besides a knife.</p>

We went into a public-house just by Gower Street, and stopped till the house closed, and left there about 11.5. Coming down Judd Street I met Davis coming along with a box, which he was going to take somewhere, and asked us to wait for him. We walked through Hastings Street, and a constable came and arrested us.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Davis's, dffence;</hi> About 11.10 I was up at King's Cross, when a lady clapped me on the shoulder, and asked me to carry a box. I would not refuse earning 2 1/2d., so I took it, and met the two others coming down Euston Road—the corner of Judd Street. I asked them where they were going, and they said, "Going home." I said, "You might wait for me," and they did, and we went together and met a police<lb/>man. If we were guilty we should not have gone that way. I knew nothing of what happened. We were arrested, and this woman said, "That is one, I know his face," and she had never seen me in her life. We were taken to the station and charged with robbery. The next morning the prosecutor came up, and looked round and picked out Battey and Wilkinson, and afterwards tapped me on the shoulder, and said, "That is one of them," and accused me of robbing him at 11,15 the previous night.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have made a report in this case—in that report I say, "he seemed in a very weak state of bodily health, and appeared to have been living very poorly, quiet in manner, decidedly of weak mind, but I could not certifiy him as insane"—I first saw him on August 29th last—from inquiries I have made, and from my conversation with him I came to the conclusion that he had had very great domestic misery—he stated that he was very much attached to his wife and children—he made use of the expression that a power of darkness over<lb/>shadowed him, that the idea came to him that he had better kill the children, that they might go to a better world—I questioned him as to his domestic and other relations, and as to what took place on the day in question and a few days preceding, and as to his motives and feelings at the time, and as to his regret and remorse afterwards—I found he did not seem to have much regret, but did what he thought was possibly the best for the children under the circumstances—I gathered that he really looked upon his act as rather meritorious than otherwise—that would certainly indicate a morbid state of mind—one of the symptoms of insanity is an entire change of character—he told me that his sister had died in an asylum a long time ago—not unfrequently persons in a fit of homicidal mania kill persons near and dear to them other than strangers—an insane person may show a certain amount of cunning with a sudden attack of violence—the border line between sanity and insanity is very sharp—I heard that he said he regretted that he had not Killed the fourth child, to whom he was very much attached—that would raise a suspicion—afterthe commission of a dreadful act an insane person may experience a sense of mental relief and indifference, and become more calm—there might be a sense of despair—he would not care what became of himself.</p>

I am a medical practitioner, living at Cambridge Park, Wanstead—about 11.30 oa August 4th I was called in by the police to examine the body of a child at Forest House, James Lane—that is where the pond is, the house is a branch of the West Ham Union Workhouse—the child was lying on the bank—it had just been taken out of the pond—it was quite dead—it had on this little frock petticoat, and chemise, but no shoes—I noticed the weeds on the clothing—as I turned the body over a small quantity of water came from mouth—there were no marks of violence—I saw it subsequently in the mortuary—on August 5th I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the brain</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Bailey, and live in Devonshire Street—on Saturday evening, July 16th, between eight and half-past, I went to a house in Red Cross Court, in the Borough—I did not know that it was a common lodging-house—I had never been there before, I went to inquire about my brother—I went into the kitchen—I saw a nam<lb/>ber of people there, amongst them the prisoner and a woman called Mrs. Loffehouse—she and the prisoner were quarrelling dreadfully—I heard nothing that they said—he said, "Will you be quiet; you are drunk now'—Idid not hear her answer—she made an attempt to pick up a ginger-beer bottle; she picked it up from the table and attempted to throw it, but did not do so—the prisoner then got on the table, and kicked her several times on the left side of the face and ribs—she was sitting down by the table—he had on heavy boots—she said, "Oh, don't hurt me," and she ran to another table—she did nothing to protect herself—her arms were resting on the table—he then came to the other table and picked up an iron-bar or poker from the fire-place, got on a form, on to the table and hit her with it twice—this (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi> is the bar—he hit her twice across the back of the neck, and once across the back—sheleant forward on the table—I did not hear her say anything—he said, "Oh, what have I done; have I killed her?"—he went out of the house soon after he had done it, but came back shortly with some of the omen in the room—he said, "Is she all right"—they said, "Yes, she is</p>

               <p>only in a dead faint"—I left the room soon after that—I came back in two or three minutes, and she was then lying on the floor—I don't know whether she was dead or not—a doctor came while I was there—before I left the house, as I was sitting on the form the prisoner came round to me and said, "If you screen me I will see you all right"—I had never seen him or the woman before—I had never been in the place before, I went there to see my brother, he was out of work, and I went to see if I could assist him, and do him a kindness.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner in Long Lane, Bermondsey—on Saturday night, July 16th, the prisoner and another man came for me to go and see to a woman whom he said had fainted, and was very bad—I did so, and on the way he said he had pushed her over or off a form—when I got there I saw the deceased lying on the floor between the form and the table—I could detect no sign of animation about her—I thought she was dead—there was a frothy fluid proceeding from her nose, which was a sign that there was animation, but she never recovered consciousness—I did not then notice the condition of the side of her face—Ihad her removed to a bed-room—I then noticed that the side of her face was slightly discoloured and swollen—on Monday, 18th, by direction of the Coroner, I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I saw <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> stains or decolorations on the sides of the trunk and back—they were the result of bruises—on the right forearm I saw a mark, oval in shape, about an inch in diameter, like a bruise, about two inches above the wrist—the left side of the face and neck were discoloured and swollen about two inches in diameter just over the junction of the hairy scalp with the skin of the neck—the skull was fractured—it was a comminuted depressed fracture—thebone was broken into several pieces—the part of the brain which rest on the bone was lacerated, and contained the broken bone forced into it—it would have required very considerable violence to cause that—it was such</p>

               <p>a fracture as might be caused by such an instrument as this iron poker—inmy opinion a fall on the bare floor could not have done it.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I am head waiter at the Pavilion, Kennington Oval—on August 11th, about 10.30 p.m., I was in a public-house in Waterloo Road and saw the prisoner there—I did not know him before—he asked me to have a drink out of his pot, but I had already got some and I said no, but I did ultimately drink out of his pot—when I got out<lb/>side he struck me on my mouth and knocked me down and kicked my head—I caught hold of his leg and struggled with him till a constable came—there were other men with him, but they did not strike me, I do not know whether they kicked me, but he did whilst I was on the ground, and one man held my legs up while another rifled my pockets of 28s.—nothingwas left in my pockets—I continued to hold him by the leg till a constable came—my younger brother came up and they took his watch as well.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went into the Hero public-house—there were twelve or fourteen men there—I do not know whether the prisoner was there when I went in—I did not know him—we did not have a fight three years ago, but he said in the public-house, "I know you, I have known you for years' and reminded me of an occasion when we had a fight and I got my face cut—I did have a fight three years ago, and my face was cut, but I do not know whether the prisoner is the man—I did not re<lb/>mind him of it—I had some drink at the Hero—I came from the house where I am living, three miles off—I did not walk, I rode on the tram because I went with my brother—I was perfectly sober, I only had one glass of ale in the Hero, and a drop out of the pot—I did not go back to the public-house after this assault and robbery and see a man named Feltham—I did not want to fight him—the conversation did not com<lb/>mence in this way, "I don't forget you for cutting my face open three years ago, come outside and I will show you"—when I got outside the bar I received a punch on the side of the head, and then he knocked me down—I went back into the bar—I did. not say, "They have taken Checkley"—Feltham did not say, "You are just as bad as he is"—if a man said that I do not think I could forget it—I was excited—Idid not say in reply, "I will make it hot for him"—I made a charge of I eing robbed when a policeman came up, and gave him in charge, and said that I had lost some money—I do not know whether I said anything before the inspector about having lost any money, I was so knocked about that I did not know what I said—I mentioned losing the money to the policeman before I went before the Magistrate—I do not know whether I said it to the inspector who took the charge.</p>

On August 11th, about 11 p.m., I was on duty in Waterloo Road, and saw the prosecutor bleeding from his nose and a bump on his head—he charged the prisoner with kicking him on his head, and knocking him about the face—the prisoner said, "I am sure you won't prosecutei me"—he was standing outside the Hero public-house—hehad hold of the prosecutor, who was walking away—I took him in custody,'and told him he was charged with assaulting the prose<lb/>cutor—hedid not speak about the robbery till next day before the Magistrate—the inspector who took the charge is not here—the prose<lb/>cutor seemed dazed, but not as if he had been having a little drop too much—the prisoner was searched at the station—no money was found on him—he said the prosecutor was a mate of his.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He told me he was head waiter at the Oval—he did not say anything about others being concerned in the assault on him—he said he had beon drinking with the prisoner and others.</p>
