I had not particularly noticed the window before the robbery.</p>

            . I am a porter, and live at No. 59, Tottenham-court-road. On the 12th of October, about six o'clock in the evening, I was on the opposite side of the way to Mr. Jackman's house, in company with Roberts, and saw the two prisoners in company, standing near the window; I observed Barry press his thumb against the window several times - he left, and Griffiths remained at the window; Barry returned, and I heard the glass shoved in; Griffiths took something out - Barry ran down the street, and they joined each other at the end of Denmark-street; we laid hold of them, and out of Griffiths' apron I took these shoes; they had only got to the bottom of the street; when Barry pressed his thumb I heard the glass fall inside - I found on Griffiths a little bit of iron, sharp at the end, and a knife all over putty.</p>

            . I was with Boston. I am a painter and glazier. I heard the glass fall; we watched them; I assisted in apprehending them, and saw the shoes found in Griffiths' apron - they were in company together. Boston's evidence is correct; a knife and a broken nail was found on Griffiths - they were both together.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JACKMAN. I have no doubt of these shoes being mine.</p>
               <p>BARRY'S Defence (written.) At the time the robbery was committed I was playing with my little sister in Denmark-street; Griffiths came up, and spoke to me, but I saw no shoes in his hand, nor did I know he had committed the robbery. I am innocent; I unfortunately was committed to the House of Correction for three months, and had only been out a week; the constable who took me thought I must be guilty, because I spoke to Griffiths, who had also been in the House of Correction with me, in the same yard; but I am innocent, and have kept myself innocent of robbery ever since I have been out of prison.</p>

On the 8th of July, between twelve and one o'clock in the day, I saw these four oxen safe in that field; and about seven on Monday morning, the 9th, in consequence of what my man said, I went into the field, and missed them; they were all black bullocks; one had his old coat on, and a white ring round his tail at the bottom; another had his right flank white - another had a white streak along his back, from head to tail, a white tail, and a grey star in his forehead, and a piece<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250004"/>chipped off the point of his right horn; the other had a brown muzzle. On Tuesday morning, the 10th, between six and seven o'clock, I saw two skins at Leadenhall-market; they were then marked F. on the nose. I saw the other two hides in a slaughter-house in Newport-market the same day - it was a common slaughter-house - they were marked D. on the nose.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. What makes you recollect that it was on the 8th you saw them safe? A. Because I was in the field; I had more than thirty-two head of cattle, but only these four were in that field; I had sold no beast that year; they were not fit for sale. People pay a commission to kill at this slaughter-house.</p>
               <p>JOHN FRENCH. I am in partnership with Mr. Whaller. I saw two of the hides at Leadenhall-market on Tuesday, the 10th of July, and knew them; we had no private mark on them; I knew them by the colours, and the natural marks; there was F cut on the nose; on the same day I found the two others in a slaughter-house in Newport-market, marked D. on the nose. I have no doubt of their being the hides of our bullocks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you take an active part in the business? A. I attend the market - we bought thirty-two in one lot; I was present when they were bought - Mr. Whaller looks after them generally. If they had been sent to market I should have marked them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were these four part of the lot of thirty-two? A. Yes. I saw them three or four times a week?</p>

            . I assist at the toll-gate on the Iron-bridge, at the beginning of the Plaistow-road. I sat up on Sunday night, the 8th of July, and on Monday morning, between two and three o'clock, four bullocks passed through the gate; they were all over dust, and were panting - it was day-light. I believe the prisoner Tarnan was with them - I am quite sure he is the man. The toll was 21/2d.; Tarnan gave me half-a-crown - I went in to get the change, and when I came out with it he had gone on a few yards without the change - I followed, and gave it to him; I had told him the toll was 21/2d. Mr. French's boy came up in about five minutes, with about eight score of sheep; a man came up soon after, and asked me if four beasts had gone over the bridge - I said Yes, and he went through the gate; he had 3d. in his hand - each foot passenger pays 1d. It was a person exactly like Tarnan, of his height; I am quite certain he is the man - I did not know him before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Why did you say just now that you believed it was him; had you not some doubt of his identity before you came here to day? A. Why, Yes - I saw one Sturgeon before the Magistrate, and said he was the man who went through the gate; there were two men before the Magistrate beside the prisoner. I swore to Sturgeon - he and the other man were discharged. I am in the habit of sitting up all night; I know it was the 8th of July, because Mr. French's boy came up to me. I had sat up till one o'clock the night before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was not what you said before the Magistrate, that Sturgeon was the man who came up and asked if four bullocks were gone through? A. Yes; I did not swear he drove the cattle through. Tarnan drove them through, and gave me the half-crown - I swore so before the Magistrate.</p>

            . I am a sailor. On Sunday, the 8th of July, I was employed at Newport-market - I slept that night in the bullock-pound in the market, under the shelter, close to the slaughter-house; the pound is a place where they keep cattle till they are slaughtered. Saville, the foreman, called me up at half-past three o'clock on Monday morning, and asked me where the keys of the pound were; I said I had them - he said, "Give them to me;" I did so, and he said I might go to bed again; I said I should not, but should take a walk to Smithfield. I did not go to Smithfield, but stood at the corner of Litchfield-street, and in about ten minutes I saw four black oxen; one had a white streak along his back: Tarnan and another person were with them - I had seen him before in the slaughter-house, and have no doubt of him; I told Saville there were four beasts - he said nothing to it; the beasts were very dusty. As I stood at the corner of Litchfield-street; Tarnan asked me if Frank and the other man were in the slaughter-house; (Saville's name is Frank - he is foreman of the slaughter-house;) I told him I did not know. The man who was with Tarnan had a white smock-frock on. I saw Saville and that man come out of the pound together, and when they came out Tarnan, who stood at the corner of Litchfield-street, called Frank; they all three went down Litchfield-street, towards Long-acre together; the beasts were then in the pound; I had seen Tarnan two or three times before, and have seen him and Saville going out of the slaughter-house before - he always called him Frank; they appeared to know each other. I never saw them drink together. I had heard Saville say, about three weeks before, that he expected a countryman was going to fetch him four beasts out of the country. I saw them again about ten minutes before eight o'clock that morning, in the slaughter-house. The tails of the beast had then been cut- when I saw them before they had not been cut. The beasts were then in their rough state; the tails are usually cut in Smithfield. When the beasts came to be killed two were marked D. and two F. on their hips, and the same marks were put on their noses after they were killed, to know who the skins belonged to. I never knew Saville get up so early before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose somebody is owner of this place? A. Yes - Mr. Baker. I had been employed there about three weeks, in the room of a man who was ill - he is now well, and I do not work there now; there may have been two or three hundred heads of cattle slaughtered there while I was there; the place is used for the whole market; there were eight more beast in the pound at that time: they are marked to distinguish whose they are: cattle usually come from Smithfield, but they sometimes come direct from the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been threatened to be prosecuted about this affair? Q. No. Saville is paid as a servant to Baker; I always sort the skins, and put them into seperate heaps for the owners.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do beasts which are brought to the pound come with marks on them or not? A. They come with marks on them; these were marked on the hip after they were put into the pound.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Do you mean to say they never come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250005"/>to the slaughter-house without marks? A. Not from Smithfield; I have known several come there without marks.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You did not know this slaughter-house before you were employed there? A. Yes; every body about there called Saville Frank - he was foreman of the place; he asked me for the keys about a quarter of an hour or more before the cattle came - he had to see the beasts killed - Monday is Smithfield-market day, when we often have cattle brought; we open the pound about seven o'clock, not before - we slaughter every day, and generally expect cattle on Monday morning. Saville's business is to see them properly put into the pound, if any are brought - the persons who bring the beasts bring a man to kill them.</p>
               <p>MR. WHALLER. I bought these beasts about the 2d of April, and always kept these four by themselves in the same field.</p>

            . I am an assistant slaughterman, in Newport-market. On Monday, the 9th of July, I went to the slaughter-house as usual, about half-past seven o'clock, and after eight, nine beasts were driven from the pound - eight of them were stale, as we call them - they were left from the Friday's market; the ninth was a fresh one: I marked the eight stale ones, as I knew them; Saville told me to put F. on the ninth. Soon after, seven others were driven in from the pound; I marked four of them, which I knew belonged to some butchers in the market; I did not know the other three, and asked Saville how to mark them- by his direction I marked two D. and one F. Thomas Page, who is servant to Mr. Griffiths, took away the two hides marked F.; the two marked D. remained - they were put into Mr. Challis' heap.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you worked at this slaughter-house? A. Six years, for Mr. Baker; Saville was there before I came; he was a servant like me: we slaughter for all the market, and mark all the cattle and the skins to distinguish the owners; we sometimes have them from the country; they are driven in in a rough condition; if a stranger brought cattle we should kill them; I saw nothing of the prisoner.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mrs. Doggerel, the proprietor of this slaughter-house; Saville was foreman; I have been there five years - he came there before me, and conducted himself well; he gave me an accountonce a week of the beasts that have been slaughtered; it is customary to put a clip upon all the hides; I saw four bides at Bow-street - they had no clip; I never knew four beasts brought together to be killed for a stranger all the while I have been there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you always on the spot? A. No; I live in the market, and leave a good deal of the business to Saville, but I never heard of such an instance; I do not examine the hides myself, but I know it is customary to clip them.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who takes an account of the beasts slaughtered? A. Saville; he gives it to me once a week.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Your employer is proprietor of the slaugter-house? A. Yes; she is a widow; we have so much a head for slaughtering - we should not refuse to kill for a stranger - they might come from a fair or from the country, without going to Smithfield; if I saw a beast without a mark, I should not order it to be marked; we have no notice of what cattle are coming.</p>

I apprehended Saville, and asked him who brought the beasts to him; he said two men, but he did not know their names - he did not give me either of their Christian or sirnames; he said they told him to mark two with an F., and two D.; I asked what address they had given; he said they stated they had taken a shop somewhere by the Regent's-park, and that he did not know them at all; I asked how they came to leave the heads behind, when they took the rest of the offal away; he said the man who took the offal said he understood the heads were sold, and would not take them, but would take the tongues; and they were cut out; I afterwards went with French to Leadenhall-market, and saw a cart full of hides belonging to Mr. Griffiths; I saw Page take from the cart two marked F. in red ochre; French claimed them directly; a witness, named Aldridge, has been out of the way ever since last Session - I believe he is a helper about Whitechapel-market.</p>

               <p>TARNAN'S Defence. I wish to observe, that I have been told by a man, who is now under sentence of death, that he was at the toll-gate that evening, and that he is the man who took the money instead of Pilgrim; and that his evidence is false. I declare I was never in the slaughter-house is my life, nor was I ever in the market but twice in my life.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH PILGRIM re-examined. I am sure I was at the toll-gate all night on Sunday; my partner Const was asleep in bed; I attended at the gate, opened it, and received the money. I awoke Const, the toll-man, to get the change; he gave it me, and then kept up a little.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time did Tarnan go through the gate? A. Between one and two o'clock in the morning - the gate is three miles from Whitechapel church; I did not look at the clock, but think it was between one and two o'clock.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HARRISON. Saville called me up about half-past three o'clock - I had no clock, but I heard the watchman calling half-past three o'clock when I came out, and it was a quarter of an hour after that when I saw the beasts.</p>
               <p>DAVID GEORGE ALDERSON. I think it is between two and three miles from Whitechapel church to Newport-market.</p>
               <p>SAVILLE'S Defence. I did not know they were stolen; the two men came with them a little after four o'clock. I called the witness up for the key, as somebody was coming to take the dung out: these two men came and asked if I belonged to the slaughter-house, and asked at what time they could have the beasts killed; I said when we began to kill, but we must kill the stale ones first, they told me how to mark them; they said they brought them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250006"/>from market; that they had a shop in the Regent's-park, and were to come in a cart in the afternoon for the offal.</p>

I went down the Strand in search of the street-keeper, and when I got by the Punch Bowl, a man asked if I had been robbed; he said he was an officer, and if I would walk in there the business should be settled, as he had the party in custody; this was about a quarter to four o'clock; I went in at a door which he introduced me to, and which I opened myself - it drew towards me, with a spring behind it; I opened it; the prisoner Vason was sitting on a bench - he came towards me, and stood at the door while I opened it; I found it was a dark passage, and was about retreating, when I was thrust into the passage by a blow on my back from this supposed officer; I turned to the left; the door was closed on me; my mouth was stopped, and the parties were immediately round me, and took the money out of my pocket; they dropped two sovereigns in the passage - they ran out; I picked up the two sovereigns, and one was left in my pocket; I went to the bar and told the landlady I had been robbed, but no notice was taken of it; I immediately went into the street, and told the street-keeper; he pointed out two officers in the Strand, whom I went to - one looked into the house, and said there were a set of thieves in the parlour then, I had better go in and see if I knew them; he went in with me; the prisoners were not there then - the prisoners who were discharged last Session were taken, and I pointed out Vason in the house as one who had robbed me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you seen any of them before? A. Never; the woman I met in the street was genteelly dressed; she asked me for half a pint of porter; she did not pick me up as a girl of the town - I am a married man; I never saw her before - I had not the slightest notion of her being an improper character; I prosecuted three women last Session for the first robbery, and swore that Palmer held me down while I was robbed; she was acquitted on that charge - I do not swear to her being concerned in this robbery - I knew none of the prisoners before that day.</p>

I had a silver watch, two gold seals, a gold key, and a gold ring in my fob, and 18s. in money, all of which were gone. I cannot speak to any body having robbed me.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live at Bethnal-green. On Sunday evening, the 16th of September, I was going towards home, and saw the prosecutor dragged out of this public-house; there were ten or twelve persons about him. I saw that all was not right, and suspected the men about him; I spoke to the witnesses Keyworth and Blaizey, to help me get him away. I went and laid hold of the prosecutor's arm - the prisoner had hold of his other arm: we tried to get him along between us. I saw the prisoner put his hand into the prosecutor's right hand breeches pocket - I told him to take his hand out, for he was robbing him - he did so; I saw him put his hand into the pocket again. I saw them tear his trousers in pulling him about; they pulled him down several times; the prisoner had hold of one of his arms, and forced him back, as I forced him forward. I saw the prisoner tear his fob right off; I could not see the watch in it, but saw the seals hanging to it; the prisoner then walked down the street. I conducted the prosecutor to the watch-house, for a place of safety, and did not follow the prisoner, but I knew him before perfectly well; he was generally about the coach-stand by Sun-street. I am certain he is the man who had hold of his arm, and tore his fob off, and went away with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How near were you to him when you saw him pull the fob out? A. I had hold of the prosecutor's arm, and saw the seals, but not the watch; he was leaning on me with one arm, and on the prisoner with the other. I had not been into the public-house - they came out of Norton-falgate into Shoreditch - it was just dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not try to take the prisoner? A. I went with the prosecutor - two witnesses followed the prisoner; I cannot say whether the prisoner was sober - he reeled about a little, but whether it was real or not I cannot tell - he walked down the street.</p>

            . I saw what Canch has stated, I have heard his evidence. I was a yard or two from the prosecutor - it was about half-past six o'clock in the evening; the gas was lighted. The prosecutor was very drunk, and the prisoner was in liquor; I saw the prosecutor on the ground, and the prisoner on him, and two others on each side; they lifted him up; the prisoner's hand was then in the prosecutor's pocket. I saw that he drew his hand out, and walked up Plough-yard2, and two others with him; the two others looked in his hands - he appeared to be showing them what he had got; I cannot say what it was - I saw nothing else; I did not see the fob taken - I and Blaizey followed the prisoner - we did not offer to take him, as we could see no officer near; he asked us to have something to drink - we said, "No thank you," and left him- we followed him for half a mile, and two others followed us at a distance behind; we left him opposite Shoreditch church. I have no doubt whatever of his being the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you first see them? - A. In Shoreditch. I walked after the prisoner for half a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not return almost to the spot where you had seen him at first? A. Yes; there were plenty of persons about. I did not meet many persons when I followed him, but when I saw him a second time there were several people passing, but the first time I did not meet above four or five people: he did not attempt to run; the prosecutor had not got his hat on when I saw him. The prisoner was not so tipsy as to be unable to walk.</p>

            . I am headborough of St. Botolph Without, Aldgate. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house about half-past eleven o'clock at night, quite out of breath - I asked him what he was; he said a hatter, and that he lived at the west-end of the town - I asked him where there; he said at Bethnal-green.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been ill for nearly five months; on the evening in question I had been to the Borough for a bottle of medicine - I met a friend, which kept me later than I should have been; as I came over Towerhill, I saw three or four men hustling together; I was four or five yards from them, and heard the prosecutor call Stop thief! I stepped quick to get out of the way, and was taken - nothing was found on me but the medicine; the witness told the watch-house keeper that he saw me knock him down, but he told the Magistrate he did not see me knock him down, but saw me run away; the prosecutor said I was the man who knocked him down, and held him down - that I tripped him up, and knelt on his breast; the Magistrate asked if he saw me kneel on his breast, he said No, he did not: it is not likely I could knock a man down and rob him, being in the state I am: when he came to the watch-house, he was in a heavy state of liquor - he admitted to the Magistrate that he had been at a raffle, and drinking beer: my friends are not here, not expecting I should be tried so soon.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GARDE. I had been at a raffle, and drank my share of two pots of beer among fourteen or fifteen persons - I was as sober as I am now.</p>

When he was gone I missed from my box a purse, containing ten sovereigns, four half-sovereigns, a quantity of loose silver, a brooch, four rings, and two silk handkerchiefs; I am sure my box had been locked, and I found it still locked; there were no marks of violence on it- I am sure the things were there when he came to the house, and I left it all safe on the Tuesday night before he went to bed; he slept in the room that night, and went away on the Wednesday morning - I had opened my purse that night to take some money out; I was present when he was apprehended, and pointed him out to the officer - he had then got one of my handkerchiefs in his possession.</p>

I was knocked down in the mud, and said, "Oh Lord! spare my life, and take my money;" I can swear to Wheeler - he is the person who kept his hands over my eyes and mouth, while the others robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the others doing while he held his hands over your eyes and mouth? A. I was robbed of 12s.; I felt my money taken out of my left-hand pocket - I cannot say who did it, but I am certain of Wheeler: I got up, and a private watchman came and asked me what was the matter; I said I had been knocked down and robbed by three persons - he said, "Which way are they gone?" he ran, and I cried Stop thief! as loud as I could: in five minutes I saw Wheeler in custody - he was taken to the watch-house and detained; as soon as I saw him, I knew him to be the man who had his hands over my eyes and mouth - I am quite sure he is the person; I saw the other two prisoners in custody on the afternoon of the next day - I cannot speak to them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. It was dark? A. Yes; I was not far from a gas lamp - about twenty yards;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250010"/>it is neither a field nor a street - it is a new road forming: I had been to Hammersmith.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you perfectly sober? A. Yes, comfortable; I do not exactly know what I had drank; I do not have a regular dinner - I eat some of my stock - I cannot say how many public-houses I went into, or how many I drank at.</p>
               <p>Q. After Wheeler was taken, did you not say there was another man whom you should know? A. No.</p>

            . I am an excavator, and live at No. 1, Conduit-place, Bayswater. I was going home about half-past eleven o'clock on this night, and at the top of Prague-street is a new street, called London-street - I heard a running; I suspected something, and stepped behind a stack of bricks, and in a minute or two I heard a cry of Stop thief! and Murder! the three prisoners instantly came along by me; I rushed out, and made a catch at Haines with my right hand; he slipped by me, to the right; Wheeler stopped, as if to hit me - I said, "What, will you hit me?" he said he was not going to hit me: up came a watchman, and I gave him to him - they were all three running in a direction from where I heard the sound of running and the cry of Stop thief! and Murder! they were together - I should think a good large handkerchief would cover the three; they were as close together as they could be to run: I have seen them before, in the neighbourhood, and have seen two of them in company; I am certain of them all three; Haines and Barlow were running with Wheeler.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you always been as certain? A. Yes - I was close under a gas lamp. I attended before the Magistrate; I said when Harrison came up that his face was all over blood and mud; they call him Brandyball Dick - he is known about there.</p>

I had 50l. or 60l. in Bank notes in a box in my bed-room; I saw them safe about three weeks before I missed them - they were 10l. notes; I had received 175l. in all, for cheques upon Messrs. Jones, Lloyd, and Co. Hooper lodged in the same room with me for about two months; I do not think he ever saw, me with the notes - I had had them by me about eight months; Hooper and Higgins are both butchers; I knew nothing of Davis till he was apprehended; there was the mark of a large knife where the hasp of the box had been wrenched off. This money had been left me, and I had sold it out of the funds.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Does Barber keep a general lodging-house? A. No, it is a public-house - she lets lodgings to single-men; only I, Hooper, and one Cutmore lodged in that room; he and Hooper slept together; I slept alone. There is another bed-room on the same floor, in which Prague and Webb slept; I was living upon this money; I had taken a shop, but was disappointed about it; Hooper was out of a situation: the room door was never locked. Higgins did not lodge there.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Jones, a silversmith, near Waterloo-bridge. On the 11th of September, the prisoner Higgins purchased two rings for 16s., and gave me a 10l. note; I gave him the change; I exchanged it for sovereigns a few days after at the Bank: I asked his name; he said, "Henry Marks, No. 22, Blackwell-street, Clare-market," which I wrote on it in his presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know him before? A. No; I did not take the number of the note - it was in my possession till I took it to the Bank: I produced it at the Thames Police Office three or four times, as Higgins was taken into custody on my charge originally, and discharged upon entering into recognizances to meet my charge; he came to our shop between twelve and one o'clock in the day, and remained there about ten minutes.</p>

The prisoner Hooper came to my lodg<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250011"/>ings on the 11th of September, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, and asked Higgins, who lodged at my house, to go out with him; I refused to let him go - I had seen Hooper before, but did not particularly know him; Hooper came to my house a few days afterwards, and asked me to go and get change for a 10l. note; I went to Waterloo-house, Cockspur-street, and laid out 8s. or 9s. in linen-drapery, and got it changed; I gave some of the change to Hooper, and paid some of it to a Solicitor to go down to the Thames Police Office; I believe Davis was present when Hooper gave me the 10l. note - I had not seen him before, but he came in with Hooper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did Hooper give you the note? A. I think on the 13th of September; Higgins lived with me; I gave Hooper four sovereigns; I paid the Solicitor, and paid some expenses; I could not read sufficient to tell the number or amount of the note, but he told me it was a 10l. note.</p>

            . I produce the knife which Mr. Barber gave me; I compared it with the marks on the box, and they tallied exactly - it is a very large clasp knife - it being a leather trunk, the marks are very plain; the point appears to have been under the hasp, and the shoulder of the knife has been prized down for the length of an inch and a quarter; the box is about a yard long.</p>
               <p>CATHERINE BARBER. I found that knife in the top drawer of the room where Mackay and Hooper slept; I had seen it in Hooper's hands before, and heard him say it was his.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS FAGAN. I recollect that all the three prisoners were examined before the Magistrate; when the witness Matthews was examined a second time.</p>
               <p>COURT to AMELIA MATTHEWS. Q. What did you say before the Magistrate at the second examination of the prisoners? A. I told him Hooper came to my house on the 11th of September, and asked Higgins to go out.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say about a key? A. Hooper came and told me he had taken the key out of Mackay's pocket while he was asleep, and taken some money out; he had locked the box, and put the key into his pocket again.</p>
               <p>ROBERT DUKE. I examined the box; the nails had been driven into the hasp again, but it had certainly been forced.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Were. On the 22d of October, between five and six o'clock in the evening, this cheese was about two yards within the shop - I had seen it safe about two minutes before it was taken - I saw the prisoner take it; he sat down on the iron-railing under the window - I saw him reaching the cheese with his left arm; he got it on his right thigh, and under his right arm, and ran off with it - I went after him, and never lost sight of him - I stopped him against Botolph-alley with it under his arm.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I not close under the window when you saw me, and I had fallen down on the cheese? A. No, that is impossible.</p>

On Monday evening I had been to Walworth, to see my sister, who is in service; a cart was loading at the warehouse, and the ropes were on the pavement; there is a cellar window, which leads into the warehouse - I fell over the ropes against the cheeses, which were close to the window; it fell off the step - I was just taking it up to put it on the pile; this man came and collared me, and said, "I have just caught you at it"- I was not in Botolph-alley.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had the female some things in her apron? A. Yes; he did not say he thought they were things which she had dropped out of her apron; she opened it at the watch-house, for the officer to see - I saw a shirt and a counterpane there, and inquired at a pawnbroker's, and found he had been, and taken some things out of pawn.</p>

I went into the shop with my sister, who had just come from the country; she wanted a pair of black stockings, but would not give the price he asked - I said, "Have them, and I will pay for them" - she said they were not worth the money; we were turning out of the shop - there was a board with stockings on it, and as I was going out I saw a pair of stockings under my feet - I thought she had dropped them, as she had redeemed some at Mr. Layburn's; they went to the pawnbroker's, and found the other things were redeemed - I refused to let the prosecutor have the stockings, till he saw whether my sister had lost them.</p>
               <p>JOHN HOWELL. He did not refuse to let me have the stockings, nor did he say he thought his sister had dropped them - I went to the pawnbroker's, as I knew the prisoner before, and if I could serve him, I should have been glad; he was once a temporary watchman in our district - I knew him by seeing him pass the door - I went to inquire if he had redeemed a sheet and quilt, as I did not wish to injure him - I have no shop mark on them; but they were in the paper; they are not black stockings.</p>

I opened the shutters, and saw two men fall, as if from the parlour window; I ran up stairs, missed the clock from the sideboard, and the spoons off the dumb-waiter; they were safe the night before.

The prisoner was waiting outside; a person came out of the window, and all three ran off together. The prisoner was close outside the railing when the bundle was thrown out - I am sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did any body besides me see your money? A.

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on the day after this Monday; I went with Holloway, and found him coming out of Angus' shop- I told him he was suspected of taking Holloway's money; he said he knew nothing about it: I took him into a private room of the Fulham Bridge public-house - I searched him, and found 3s. 6d. in silver and 71/2d. in copper: I then said to him, "Has your wife any money at home?" he said she might have 1s. or 2s. unknown to him; I asked what he received for wages on Saturday night - he said 17s.; I asked what he gave his wife on Saturday night - he said he gave her nothing on Saturday night, but gave her 2s. or 3s. of it on Sunday morning; I said I must lock him up while I went to his wife - he said he was very willing: I put him in the watch-house, and went to his house - his wife was not at home: I was directed to where she was; I went to the place, but she was not there - I waited till she came back; I asked her if she had any money, and went with her to the prisoner's lodgings (I knew she was his wife, and that it was his lodging) - and in a mug over the dresser were 10s. in silver; on searching further, there was a paper with a quarter of a pound of moist sugar - I was going to lay hold of it, but his wife laid hold of it, unfolded it, and gave me this piece of paper; I opened it, and found five sovereigns - I looked round on the floor, and saw a quantity of things rolled up in the form in which pawnbrokers roll them - they appeared to have been recently redeemed; there was a hat-box, and some things in it - I do not know their value; I found 6s. 9d. on the wife's person - the prisoner had told me there was no money at home, except his wife might have a few shillings unknown to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I tell you there was or was not money at home? A. He said his wife might have a shilling or two unknown to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the sovereigns in a box, or in the sugar-paper? A. On the sugar.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the Monday morning I went to work as usual; I had not been at work above half an hour, before the prosecutor came, and said, "How are you?" he said, "Shall we go and have something to drink?" we went and had a pint of half and half - he said to the woman,"Put this up to me." He went out again, and had some rum and milk, then went to breakfast, and after breakfast there was some half and half had - and after dinner there were two gallons of beer, which was placed to his account; we went to tea, and remained at work till seven o'clock in the evening: there were six smiths, four wheelwrights, and three coach-body makers at work in the upper shop; we left about seven in the evening, leaving the prosecutor and another man in the shop - we went into the public-house; this man came in, and called a man out; we remained there an hour, and then went home: I went to work, as usual, on Tuesday morning till one o'clock, when this man came and said he wanted me; I told him what money I had - he searched me, and said, "Have you any money at home?" -"Yes," said I: he said, "Where is your wife?" - I said,"I don't know; she was at home at breakfast - I am going to dinner, and expect to find her at home:" he said, "Have you any money at home?" - I said, "Yes; if I had not, how could I keep myself in the winter when I am out of work:" I told him a man had paid me 8l. 17s. - he locked me up, and went to Pimlico: I was taken to Queen-square, and remanded till Friday; I was brought into Court, and the Magistrate asked how I came by the sovereigns; I told him I had been in the habit of earning 30s. a week in the summer, and had put this by, except what had been paid me by a man at Pimlico, which had been 25l. at different times - Mr. Harmer has the receipt which was given for it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WOODBERY. He said he had no money, except his wife might have a trifle - he said nothing of having received 8l. odd.</p>

            . I live at No. 15, Arlington-street, Pimlico, and am a house-painter. I received 25l. for the prisoner more than twelve months ago, and used it in my business - I have paid him the whole at different times; I sometimes paid him 3l. or 4l., and sometimes 10s., just as I could; the largest sum I ever paid him was 4l. 11s. or 12s., that was since the 7th of August last; since that he has received 8l. from me - the last payment was on the 9th of October; it was paid at my house, to his wife - it was paid in cash, whether in silver or gold I cannot say, for it was given by my wife - I ordered her to pay it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give it to her in gold or bank notes? A. It was not in notes; whether there was a half-sovereign, or it was all silver, I cannot tell; when I made the last payment, I took a receipt in full of all demands, which I gave to my daughter within the last five days, and I believe it is in Mr. Harmer's possession.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the receipt given? A. On the 9th - I wrote it, and the prisoner signed it; I heard of the prisoner being taken the day after - I knew he was remanded for further examination - I did not attend before the Justice, to prove I had made him the payment - I did not think it my duty to attend to other people's business.</p>
               <p>Q. Then a friend lent you money in distress, and you did not think it your duty to attend for him when charged with a capital offence? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told the Magistrate I received the 25l.; he said if I could bring the man forward, it would be a great thing on my side.</p>
               <p>COURT. We have before us an account of what you said to the Magistrate; do you wish it to be stated.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>The prisoner afterwards desired this statement should be read. It was as follows: - The prisoner says, "I have nothing to say- I never meddled with his money, I have worked hard for the money the officer found - it is part of 25l. which I received from a friend."</p>

On the 4th of October, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I went up stairs, leaving a pair of silver sugar-tongs, a tea-spoon, and desert-spoon, on the kitchen-dresser; the rest of the plate was in a basket, which stood by the corner of the dresser; there was a dozen silver forks, a dozen table-spoons, ten desert, and two gravy-spoons, all silver; there is a door leading from the garden into the back kitchen. I came down, and on opening the back kitchen door, to go into the garden to shake the carpets, I saw a roll of pencils; I picked them up, and on going up the steps I saw the plate-basket, which I had left in the kitchen, standing on the steps, and the plate stated in the indictment was gone - the back door was only latched - the back and front garden are one; there is an area behind the street door. -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250019"/>I found all the plate at the Mansion House on the 9th of October.</p>

I was the only servant in the house; the family were in town; my brother called on me last Sunday - that is the only friend I have had there.

On Thursday, the 4th of October, about one o'clock in the day, I was coming out of Petticoat-lane, towards Bishopsgate-street, and saw the prisoner and another person on the opposite side - the prisoner crossed, and turned into a public-house - I laid hold of the other man at the door of the public-house, and gave him in charge; I then went through the public-house into a back wash-house, and found the prisoner coming out of the wash-house door; I said, "What have you got about you?" I opened his waistcoat, and the handle of the gravy-spoon was in his fob, with the bowl up, between his waistcoat and shirt, and on looking round, on a heap of saw-dust in the wash-house, I found this bundle, containing the rest of the plate; he at first denied all knowledge of the bundle, but afterwards said he picked it up in Old-street-road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The other man is not in custody? A. No - the Magistrate discharged him; I am sure he did not at first say he had found it.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On Tuesday night I heard the rattle, and ran out of the watch-house - I saw the prisoner running in a direction from Smithfield, towards Cow-cross - Price ran to stop him; the prisoner knocked him backwards; he got hold of him, and they swung round together - I collared him, went part of the way to the watch-house with him, and as I returned, I picked up a silver watch-case, very near to where he was laid hold of, on the spot where he tried to get from the patrol - Harwood appeared to give a very correct account of it.</p>

            . I am constable of the night. The prisoner was brought in, and the watch and case produced- the prosecutor did not appear insensible, but was under the effects of liquor - I did not hear him say he had received a blow - I noticed a mark of dust on his neck, and asked if he had been struck; he said No, it was only the dust of the cellar where he had been gauging liquor; he said the watchmaker's name was Lormier, but on opening it, the name of Edwards was in it; he afterwards produced a bill of it, as bought of Edwards late Lormier; the watch was bruised by the fall, and the glass broken.</p>
               <p>CHARLES THOMAS HARWOOD. The watch and case are mine, and are what I was robbed of - I said the name was Lormier, but immediately said I recollected that it was Edwards.</p>

            . I am a porter to the Salters' Company. I was coming down Cheapside, and saw a number of persons round Mr. Tidmus' door; Dent and the prosecutor were standing on the step, and Humphries seemed angry with Dent; they walked down Cheapside, and turned down Friday-street; Humphries followed behind, and put her hand into Dent's pocket, took something out, and put it into her bosom; she turned out of the street, and went towards Bow-church; I went and asked the prosecutor if he had lost any thing; he said Yes; I said, "The person who has left you has got it;" he followed and caught Humphries near Bread-street; I said, "You had better give the man his watch, you will only get into trouble:" she persisted in refusing; a mob came round, and she was taken into custody; I saw the watch found on her.</p>

On the 24th of September, about twelve o'clock at night, I put a pocket-book, containing all this property, between the sacking and clothes of my own bed; I went to bed then, and am sure it was secure; my wife got up at half-past nine o'clock to let Hurran into the room, to light the fire, as usual; my wife came to bed again, and we both went to sleep; I awoke at half-past ten o'clock, and found myself very cold, and on looking about, I found the window sash was open; we sleep on the ground floor; I called Hurran to shut the window, but received no answer - she was not in the room; I then thought I had been robbed- I opened my pocket-book, which still remained there - it was at the foot of the bed - any one could take it out; I opened it, and missed these notes and gold - the notes were taken from the middle of others which they were folded in, so that at first I did not miss them; Hurran had given us no notice that she was going; I immediately went to Watts' house, in Palace-street, Westminster; nobody was at home; I made inquiry, and saw Watts in the evening at her own house; she came home about eight o'clock- I said, "What have you done with your sister, and the money she has stolen?" she said she knew nothing about her, or the money; I sent for an officer, and in a small bundle, which she had in her hand, we found a pair of stockings and a new pair of boots, with three sovereigns in the toe of them; I asked how she came by that money; she said, "You can't swear to sovereigns;" I said, "But I can swear to one of the stockings, which the money is wrapped in, for here is the fellow to it;" she began to cry; I said if she would tell me where my property was I did not want to hurt her; I went next morning, with an officer, to No. 133, Bethnal-green, in consequence of what she said to me; it is a private house; Rogers lived there; I asked Rogers where my 20l. note was; I did not say who I was; he said he had changed it next door, at his cousin's; we went there, and found it - it was my 20l. note; I went down to Manningtree, in Essex, on the 26th, and found Hurran there; I got from her part of the change of the 20l. note; I had before that said if she would tell me every thing, I would forgive her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What are you besides a teacher of self-defence? A. I attend sales, and deal in jewellery or furniture, or any thing; I keep no shop or warehouse to deposit my things - I put them where I think proper; my wife hired Hurran as a servant, in my presence - she was to have wages; we did not ask her character, or where she came from.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, do not ladies and gentlemen come to your house? A. Yes; I was never here before - I have once been in a Court of Justice for assaulting an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I caution you, will you swear deliberately that you was never in a Court of Justice but once, and that was for assaulting an officer? A. Yes, I do; I swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever in a Court of Justice in Surrey? A. Yes; I was taken up in a waggon coming from the races with a party of six - a party of smashers; there was a parcel of bad money in the machine, and they called me a party concerned; I was tried and imprisoned twelve months, but I was innocent.</p>

            . I work at bristling stocks; I was fifteen years old last month - I am servant to Mr. Wise, a tailor, Castle-court, Birchin-lane - I have been two years with him: my father lives at No. 7, Fish-street-hill, and works at a bottle warehouse - I asleep at my master's private house, at Stoke Newington, and dine at my father's. On the 21st of September, about a quarter to five o'clock, I was going on an errand to Silver-street, Wood-street, and met the prisoner in Bartholomew-lane; he said, "My lad, will you go to No. 62 round this street here, and get me change for this cheque, in notes and sovereigns?" he said, "There is 6d. for yourself," which he gave me - he said nothing more; I went and got change for the cheque, in 100l. and a 20l. note - I was detained there five or ten minutes: when I came out I went to Bartholomew-lane, expecting to see the prisoner, as I had left him there, but he was gone: I waited about five minutes in the lane, and then went on my errand to Silver-street; I did not see my father till about two o'clock next day - I had not mentioned the matter to any body before I saw him; I gave him the two notes, which I had kept in my waistcoat pocket all the time; I told him how I came by them, and left them with him; I looked about to see if any bills were posted up, as my father ordered me, but did not see any. I saw the prisoner in a small room at the Mansion-house, about a week afterwards - it was three or four days before I was first examined as a witness - two persons were in the same room; I cannot say whether they were prisoners: I went to see if I knew any body there, and I knew the prisoner: I had before that described him to Mr. Gates, the solicitor, and his clerk, the night the officers came to me - I am certain he is the person; I presented the cheque at Grote and Prescott's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you went to the Mansion-house, were you not told if you went into that room you would see the person who gave you the cheque? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said you was told so? A. Yes, Sir - No, Sir. I have said that Mr. Gates told me it was thought it was the person, by the description I gave of him; one of the persons in the room was an officer, who had been to me at Newington - I do not know the other; he was short, and older than the prisoner: I can read - I saw the name of Evans at the bottom of the cheque, just as I opened it to give it to the bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Silver-street; do Campbell and Stewart live there? A. Campbell does; I saw him, but did not tell him of my having the money - I saw my master when I went to Newington to sleep; I did not tell him that night, nor in the morning; I carried the money in my pocket to Newington; there are two persons employed at my master's town house - I did not tell them or any body of it till I saw my father; I did not know the prisoner before - I thought it extraordinary, but did not go to the banker's to mention it.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, have you ever said to any body that you did not know, or did not think you should know, the person who gave you the cheque? A. No; I said so at first to Mr. Gates, the solicitor, and I told my master I thought I should not know the person.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How come you to be so confident now, when the very day or two after it happened you said you should not know him? A. Why, his complexion, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. He is not the only fair man in the kingdom? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you not said to Stewart that you should not know him, for you were in such a hurry you did not look in his face? A. No, I do not know Stewart; I know the young man who lives with Campbell.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said to that young man, that the bankers had promised to give you money if the prisoner was convicted, and that you were determined to hang him? A. No, nor any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say the bankers would not give you any money before the trial, but they would afterwards, and you were determined to have a good tuck-out on the day of trial? A. No, nor any thing of the kind; I have talked to Campbell about it, in the presence the person who lodges with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever said that if the bankers had given you all money, or notes and money, you would have kept the money and destroyed the notes? A. No, Sir. I have seen Campbell here this morning, and the person who lodges with him, and spoken to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell them this very morning you hoped they were not here, to tell what they heard you say? A. No - I said, "Have you come to say what I told you?"</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you tell them then? A. I told them the circumstance of Gunson giving me the cheque - that is all.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you know Sullivan and Bryan? A. Yes; Sullivan is a journeyman tailor, in Mr. Wise's service, and Bryan is his apprentice; I told them I did not know that I should know the man; I did not tell them that I was determined to hang the prisoner; I said he deserved hanging - that was after he was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you would be d-d if you would not hang him? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK (on the part of the prosecution) here stated, that having no one to confirm the testimony of this witness, he begged to withdraw from the prosecution.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250025"/>On the 17th of October, in consequence of information, I went with Edwards, Lloyd, Kirby, and Reynolds, to No. 1. Ponder's-place, Reynolds'-court, Ropemaker-street, Cripplegate - we are all officers except Reynolds; we got there about four o'clock in the afternoon, and found the street door open; I opened the door of the parlour on the right hand side, which was on the latch; Lloyd went in with me. I saw all the prisoners there, very near the fire place - Mrs. Cole was sitting very near the fire, close to the table - the other five prisoners were all round the table; Cole had her bonnet off, and nothing on but her gown; Smith was the same - Milton had her bonnet and shawl on - the men were dressed, and had their hats on: we forced them all from the table, up into the corner of the room, which is near another door of the room, which opens into White-street; it is a corner house, with two doors to it. The other officers then came in; they began to secure the prisoners, and I heard money drop - I cannot tell from which of them, but it dropped from somebody in that corner; after we secured them we sent for Mr. Powell, and in about two minutes the two Mr. Powells and Mr. Field, the inspector, came, and the prisoners were sent to the office; Edwards, Kirby, and Lloyd went to the office with them; before they went Edwards found some money in the corner, and picked it up; there was a basin with water in it on the table, with four counterfeit shillings, and four counterfeit sixpences in it; they were in a rough state, just as they came from the mould; before the prisoners were taken away we found two moulds, one on each hob; one for shillings, and the other for sixpences - I felt them, and they were quite warm.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the warmth such as they might acquire from being on the hob, or as if they had had hot metal in them? A. As if they had had metal in them; the hobs were brick; in my judgment the moulds had been recently used; the window of the room had a curtain from top to bottom, which made the room quite dark; nobody could see into it. Mr. Field felt the moulds as well as I did; when the officers returned we proceeded to make a general search; I found the four shillings and four sixpences in the basin of water on the table; it stood there when we went in; one mould was on each hob - that was all I myself took possession of. I found a linen apron on the back of the chair where Mrs. Cole sat; there are spots of white metal on it, as it has been dropped when hot - it is metal itself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Can you say whether you know Cole has been deserted by her husband? A. I cannot say that of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner SMITH. There is a curtain to the window, but it was drawn up when they entered. Mrs. Cole desired the officers to put it down. Witness. The curtain was down; there were people pulling it up and peeping through, and Edwards pushed them away. There are two windows; one is a glazed door, which looks into White-street, that had no curtain to it; people could look into the room through that, but I cannot say whether they could see the fire-place from there - I believe they could not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner SMITH. There are only three squares of glass, and one of them is broken in half; the curtain is green; Cole begged of them to put it down, that there might not be a bustle in the place.</p>

            . I am an officer, and accompanied Limbrick and the other officers to the house in question, and assisted in securing the prisoners; I secured Milton: I followed close behind Limbrick; there was a small table in the middle of the room, near the fire place, and they appeared to me to be all round it. Limbrick went nearest to the fire-place; Cole was close to the fire - I do not know whether she was sitting or standing; Limbrick went first - I took hold of Milton's left hand; she was standing near a chair at that time: she then sat down - I still held her hand; I stood up myself, and heard something fall from Milton, apparently from her right hand; I afterwards saw it was six counterfeit shillings, and two counterfeit sixpences. I found three of the shillings and one sixpence on the chair, on which she sat; I did not observe that chair before she sat on it; I found the other shillings and sixpence on the floor; there was no carpet - they fell on the boards; one sixpence was in the chair, and one on the floor. I took possession of them, and now produce them; I did not pick them up till we returned from taking the prisoners to Hatton-garden; I observed them in the place before I went away, but left them till I returned.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to Hatton-garden, did you leave any body in the room? A. Yes; the two Mr. Powells, Mr. Field, and Limbrick; on my return I found the money as I have mentioned, and on the table, close by where Milton sat, I found this piece of sand-paper, which appears to have rubbed some white metal; I saw some green baize on the table, close by where Milton sat, and here is a piece of metal adhering to it, which has been dropped on it in a hot state - there are several pieces of metal on it - there were two tables in the room; this was on the largest table; the marks are only on one side of the baize, but the other side has something white on it, like plaster of Paris; I found a piece of old carpet near the fire-place, with a quantity of metal adhering to it, like that on the baize.</p>

               <p>Q. By being secured, do you mean handcuffed? A. Yes; her left hand was handcuffed to another prisoner; she threw it from her right hand, which was at liberty; I picked it up immediately, and put it into my pocket, where I had nothing else; when I took it up I found it was shillings and sixpences, and they were quite warm;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250026"/>I afterwards counted them - there were fifteen counterfeit shillings, and twenty-four counterfeit sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that the warmth was from their being newly manufactured, or was it the warmth of the hand? A. The warmth of the hand; on our return from the office, having left Mr. Powells and Limbrick there, Mr. Field gave me some plaster of Paris out of the right hand cupboard; there was a tin cannister full, and some in a paper; on the left hand side of the fire-place I found two earthen pipkins on the hob; they have been on the fire, and in one of them is a portion of white metal; I found some glass-paper by the fender, and it has been used - it is finer than sand-paper, and would finish the coin after the application of the sand-paper; in the left hand cupboard I found this crucible, with a portion of metal in it: I found the frame of a mould, but it was spoiled, and a mould, the impression of which is defaced - it is made of plaster of Paris; I found on the hob a quantity of pipes, and metal has run right through them; I found two pairs of large scissars, which would clip metal.</p>

            . I keep the house in which the prisoners were taken - Mrs. Cole rented that parlour - I let it to her on the 3d of March; she came with her husband, as I supposed; he was there till the Wednesday before, or the Wednesday after Whitsuntide; when I missed him, I asked her where he was; she said he had assaulted a landlord, and was taken up for an assault - I have seen Austen come backwards and forwards there - I knew Smith for a fortnight before she was taken; she was there backwards and forwards as a young woman out of a situation, for that fortnight, and I believe was there by night, as well as day - I believe she slept with Mrs. Cole; there was no other bed in the room, except a small one, for a little boy about eight years old - I never saw Milton or Riley, till the day they were apprehended; Mrs. Cole told me she was a book-folder, and worked at a shop - I never saw her employed at home.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When she first came to your house, used she to go out early in the morning? A. Yes, and return to her meals, as if she was engaged some where; this continued till within a fortnight of her apprehension, and during that time she seemed to be very ill.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Who paid your rent? A. Mrs. Cole paid me weekly - sometimes she would pay me two or three shillings, or sixpences, and the rest in copper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has she any children? A. Two - one a boy, about eight years old, who lives with her, and a girl about twelve, who is kept by the grandmother.</p>
               <p>Q. Since her husband left her, has he come to give her any support whatever? A. No, and I believe she very often wanted bread for her child; she continued to work up to the fortnight, and then appeared ill; she appeared an industrious woman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner AUSTEN. Q. How long before the apprehension, had you seen me there? A. I believe it was some time before - I have seen him while the husband was at home, and since he has left; it must be three weeks or a month before he was taken, that I had seen him there - I have seen him there, three or four times - I cannot say how long he stopped, as he might go in at one door, and out at the other - I never knew him there long together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he remain there long enough to be engaged in any work in the room? A. Not to my knowledge.</p>

            . I am an inspector of counterfeit coin, of the Mint. I have examined these shillings and sixpences, and all the money produced; it is all counterfeit, and all of the same description; it is a white metal, generally called Britannia metal, which common spoons are made of; the money is all cast in a mould - I have compared it with the moulds found - I have compared one of the shillings produced from the basin found on the table, with the mould; it fits precisely; here is a lump on the side, which fits the broken part of the mould exactly - I have compared some of the shillings produced by Edwards, with the pair of moulds; there is a crack in the mould, from the heat; and I find on the coin, an impression of that crack; the moulds have evidently been used a great many times; the sharpness of the impression diminishes every time it is used; these have been used a considerable number of times - I went into the room a few minutes after the prisoners were in custody; the Mr. Powells were with me - Limbrick handed me two pairs of moulds from the hob - they appeared quite hot through - I felt them inside and out - I cannot say how the heat might have arisen - I apprehend, it is necessary to keep the moulds always hot, as the metal will then flow into them better, it does not chill; the coin produced by Edwards, I suppose, to be all in a state in which they would put it into circulation - I constantly find it in circulation in that state; there is one mould for sixpences, and another for shillings.</p>
               <p>COLE's Defence. A great many words the witness has said are false, for, when he entered the room, he stood with his back against the bedstead - I begged of him to pull the curtain down, and shut the door, that there might not be a disturbance, and one of them pulled the curtain down - I was not sitting down, but standing up - I do not think I have any body here to speak for me, as I thought my trial would not come on till evening.</p>
               <p>SMITH's Defence. I was out of place, and went to lodge with Mrs. Cole, about a fortnight before I was taken - I was not at home in the day time, not in the morning; I went to look after a situation; one day as I was going after a situation to Parr's office, Mrs. Cole was going part of the way up Holborn; she met Milton, and asked her to come and take a cup of tea with her; she had not been in the place half an hour, when we were taken - I had nothing in my hand, and dropped nothing - I never saw any thing of this kind going on whatever - I was out almost all day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner SMITH to MR. GIANNELLI. Q. Can you swear you have seen me in your place with Cole, for I never was in your shop? A. Yes, I have, I am quite certain - I had nothing particular to draw my attention to them; a great many persons come to purchase plaster of Paris, both men and women - Smith said nothing - Mrs. Cole asked for the plaster; I cannot recollect how long ago it was.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was she there more than once? A. I cannot say that - I know she was there once; she never came alone, that I know of; she did not ask for any thing.</p>

As soon as I had recovered the shock, which the circumstance had occasioned, I went up to the dray; the prisoner was then approaching; he certainly was not with his horses at the time of the accident - his was about the centre dray. I remonstrated with him on the impropriety of being away from his dray, and pointed out to him the consequences; he expressed great sorrow, and said a call of nature had kept him from his dray for a few minutes; he followed the deceased to the hospital, and there expressed his great regret. The deceased was Ann Hold, the wife of a man who lives at the Bull and Mouth stables.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Are you certain there were five or six drays? A. I am sure of five; each was drawn by three horses - they were going at a quick walk, in the usual way, at no improper speed; the near-wheel caught the post.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you he had stopped the dray while he expected to be detained? A. Certainly not - he could not have done so; he might assist to convey the woman to the hospital; he behaved exceeding well.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Have you examined the property? A. Yes - it is common crockery, but I am positive of it - there is no particular mark on it, nor on the bellows; my sheets were thrown into the middle of the room afterwards. I have had the bellows about two months, and am certain of them. I can swear to every thing - this tea-caddy I bought new, about a fortnight before; I used some of the crockery that morning at breakfast.</p>

On the 24th of October, about twenty minutes before twelve o'clock, I was going home, and saw the prosecutor with the prisoner in Lower Seymour-street - he was rather tipsy, and I suspected she would rob him - they were arm-in-arm; I followed them as far as Baker-street chapel; I then saw him turn round, and get from her; he crossed over to my side of the way, passed me, and turned up George-street; a young man then went up and spoke to the prisoner, and they then both ran after the prosecutor; the prisoner overtook him, and took his arm till he got to the corner of <placeName id="t18271025-49-crimeloc313">Charles-street</placeName>

I brought her into King-street, and met the prosecutor, who asked her for his watch; she denied it, and in the middle of the road in the mews, on the very spot where I apprehended her, I found the watch.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Directly I turned round he began to throw me down, which was the reason I ran; he knocked me about, and a young woman who was with him said I was not the man; he said, "I will send you where I have sent a good many more - I will transport you for life."</p>
               <p>SAMUEL BOWER. The lady who was with me, said,"How could you see him take it? you could not see him," but she spoke under fear. I am sure he is the man - he was a short time out of my sight; he struck me, and knocked my hat off; I lost sight of him while I picked it up. <rs id="t18271025-51-verdict326" type="verdictDescription">

            . I am a refiner, and live in Cox's-court, Little Britain. About the latter end of February 1826, the prisoner Scott came to my counting-house, with a brown paper parcel, containing broken silver plate; it appeared to be new plate broken in pieces - I afterwards put them together, and they formed two dishes with handles; he offered them for sale - I asked where he got it; he said it belonged to a friend, who requested him to bring it for sale - I said, from its appearance, I thought it was not properly came by, and requested to know who his friend was, and where he lived; he said he did not know his name, or where he lived, but he occasionally called at his house - I said it was extraordinary he should undertake to sell plate of that description, for a man he had no little knowledge of; he said he had known him many years, though he could not tell his name, and he expected to see him again in the evening of the day, and was then to give him the proceeds of the plate - I said, I had no doubt it was stolen, and should detain it, and he must send his friend to give a proper account of it; he said he was sure it was all right, and I had better give it him back - I refused; he went away, for the purpose of sending his friend, but before that, I took his name and address, which he said was, "James Scott, a <rs id="t18271025-61-deflabel384" type="occupation">weigher</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did Scott come to you three times? A. No, twice; he was to receive the money, if I had bought it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say his landlady would enable him to find the person? A. No - I stated my suspicion to him the first time he came - I was satisfied when he showed me his deputation.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Saltonstall came but once? A. No; he was about a quarter of an hour with me; his features were familiar to me, though I could not recollect who he was - I am certain I had seen him before; it was eighteen months before I saw him again - I am quite certain of him - I have not inquired whether<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250033"/>Scott's address is correct. I succeeded Messrs. Cox and Co. in business.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it likely a man would bring plate to you, if he had come dishonestly by it? A. Not if he knew what he was about; there are a variety of places where he could dispose of it more easily; it is not impossible for a foreigner to sell English plate - I understood him, that the foreigner had said it came from a fire; if I had come by plate honestly, I should not object to go to the Mansion-house; it has been in my custody ever since - weighers at the Custom-house do not come in contact with foreigners particularly.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Was it understood that Scott should send the man to you, whom he had it from? A. Yes - I had then done with Scott; he did not call about it afterwards - I advertised the plate; it was not claimed for some time - Mr. Griffin saw it at the office.</p>

            . I am a silversmith, and live in Cornhill. In 1826, I had an order from Mr. Hebbert, to make some plate, to go abroad - I was living with my brother, who is a manufacturer - I took it down to the Custom-house myself, and entered it for Calcutta - I believe it was to go by the Duke of Bedford; we receive a drawback of 1s. 6d. an oz. at the Custom-house; after it is weighed by the inspector, it is left in the Searcher's office, for the lightermen; an inspector from the Hall attends at the Custom-house; it was manufactured at Sheffield; there were two silver dishes and covers, two warmers, and four egg-cups, in the box which I took to the Custom-house - I saw them before I packed them - I saw this plate at the Mansion-house, when the prisoners were there; this appears to be the bottoms of the dishes; the edges were shells and gadroons, and these correspond - I left it to go by Aldridge's lighter - Barker, his clerk, was at the Custom-house when it was examined.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you see it delivered to him? A. No; it was left in the Searcher's office; it receives the Hall mark at Sheffield; all manufactured plate is marked; shells and gadroons are common - I do not swear to the plate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you ever take plate to the Custom-house before? A. Yes; we always leave it in the Searcher's office - I think it was in February that I took it; it was in a deal box, with a tin lining fastened at the four corners: but it was opened at the Custom-house, then soldered down, and would not be opened again.</p>

            . I am a silversmith, and live in Beaufort-buildings. The dishes and covers were made at my manufactory, at Sheffield - I saw the plate at Lambeth-street; the letter "I," which was the Sheffield-hall mark for that year, was on some of the pieces, and there are the initials S. and C. Y. for "Samuel and Charles Young and Co.," who made it for me at Sheffield, in 1826, for Griffin's order - I have no doubt of its being the same - I delivered it about the middle of February.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you afterwards see it advertised? A. No - I manufactured about 120 ozs. - I know these articles by the pattern - I can swear there was not another pair of dishes made by us that year of that pattern; we call it the Waterloo border, which is common; but we are the only persons who manufacture that handle; it was a new pattern made about that time - I cannot say how many we have made.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Is the hall mark different in Sheffield and London? A. I believe so; it is sent down from the Stamp-office every year - I will swear these handles have been made by us; I think no one else has this pattern, but will not swear that; I can swear to our mark; every body would know that was the maker's initials - it still remains on the plate.</p>
               <p>Q. Between January, 1826, and the middle of February, was there time for plate marked with the letter of that year, to go abroad and come back? A. It might have gone to France or Holland; I had no more handles made of this pattern; I have no doubt it is the plate.</p>

It was to go to India.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. It was put into your lighter? A. Yes; I was not on board when it was put in, but I made out a receipt for it, and must have seen it in the regular course of things. I know a box with that direction was put on board.</p>

I charged him at the office on suspicion of stealing some plate from a barge going to an Indiaman - he said he knew nothing of it. Next day I took Scott, on board a foreign ship, acting as a Custom-house officer; I told him it was for taking some silver to Alcock's - he said he took a brown paper parcel - that he did not know exactly what was in it, but he believed it was old silver; he said he got it from a person, but did not know his name.</p>

The brown paper parcel that I took belonged to my landlady; she asked me to take a small parcel of old silver, and directed me where to sell it; Mr. Alcock asked if I could produce the person it belonged to; I said I thought I could, and in an hour I went back to the landlady, and told her; she went out, returned, and said the person was gone to Deptford, but on his return no doubt he would call - I went and told Alcock so.</p>

I went into a public-house in St. Martin's-lane, and saw a man, who stated himself to be a distressed tradesman, and wished me to purchase this silver - I did not want it, but, after some persuasion, I said if he liked to pawn them, I would give so much more for the duplicates; he waited outside while I went and pawned them; I gave him 12s. for the tickets, and was going to redeem the desert-spoon, when I was stopped.</p>

George and Byers came to me afterwards, and told me they wished to have a trial; I borrowed a cart of my neighbour, harnessed the horse to it, and we went as far as Mary-le-bone, riding him about; they seemed to approve of it; they then said they wanted to call at a public-house in Southampton-buildings, Holborn; I think this was the Saturday before the 15th of September; I went to the public-house with them, with the horse and cart (I had not then seen Child); they seemed to be satisfied with the horse, and called for something to drink; Byers said "You had better take home the cart, and bring me a saddle and bridle, to lend me till Monday; I will ride the horse home, and send the saddle and bridle home on Monday;" I went and left the cart with the man I borrowed it of, and returned with the horse; my little boy rode the horse, and Harrington came with me, and brought the horse back to the public-house, with the bridle and saddle; when I got there, I met George at the door; he said he was poorly, and could not stop there any longer, for there was a smoke there; Byers and Child came out, and all three went down with George to a house in Chancery-lane; my little boy rode the horse there, and went with us; I thought they were then going to pay me - they asked if I had the balance of a bill, note, or cheque, or something; they produced a paper to me - I can neither read nor write - I thought it was a cheque - they were to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250035"/>give 25l. for the horse; Byers was the purchaser; they gave me the paper, and said it was as good as gold, and would be payable on Monday; they knew I could neither read nor write, for I told them so; I relied entirely upon what they said about the paper; both George and Byers said it was as good as gold; Child was close to them, and must have heard that; upon their representation I gave them four sovereigns in exchange; they gave me 1s. 6d. and the piece of paper - they said it was to be paid in Euston-square, by a man named Palmer; Harrington was close by, and said he would not sell the horse for that paper, for it was of no value; I said, "Here, take it, and show it to somebody, and see if it is right;" he took it to the bar, but the publican was not there; he left the room, and brought it back to me, saying,"I am not satisfied with that paper - I am certain it is not right; I would not take such a thing for my horse:" I then turned round to show it to a gentleman in the parlour, and while I was so doing the prisoners all slipped out, one after the other; and, when I went out, my boy was off the horse, and the horse gone: I went to the door as soon as the gentleman had read the note and returned it to me; I went, in consequence of what he said, to tell them I would not take the paper - they were all three gone - I could see neither of them; I gave the paper that night to the officer of the night; I did not go to Euston-square; I have not received the money for the paper - the horse was found in Fleet-market, about two o'clock the next day; at the door of a public-house; I laid hold of it - it was put into the Green-yard, and I have got it back; Palmer came to Guildhall when the prisoners were apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was this your horse? A. Yes; my master is dead; Harrington and I found the horse next day in the open street, harnessed to a chaise; I do not remember Byers telling me at what number in Euston-square Palmer lived; they called for gin and water, rum and water, and ale: I was not sober, but sober enough to know what passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell a man named Stone that you sold the horse? A. I might; I do not recollect that I did - I will not swear that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see George that very night? A. Yes; he was taken that night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. About what time did they go away with the horse? A. About seven o'clock, as near as I can say; I saw George in less than ten minutes, for Harrington kept his eye on him.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who was the buyer of the horse? A. Byers; George was with him, and said to him "I will take the horse, if you don't like him in a little time, by your taking a little less;" I did not see them go away with the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember riding over a man in St. Giles', when you were showing the horse? A. Not that I know of; the cart came against him; I did not stop to see if I had hurt him, for they kept calling out, "Keep on, keep on;" there was no cry raised after me - my horse was kept in Harrington's stable.</p>
               <p>Q. What house in Chancery-lane did this happen at? A. The Hole-in-the-Wall public-house, kept by Randull; no objection was made to Harrington's showing the note to the publican; I did not know George before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you given the change before you showed the note to any body? A. Yes; I threw the change down; I did not know whether I was going to have a cheque or not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BYERS. Q. Was not the bill read over to you before you handed over the sovereigns? A. No; I thought it was a cheque; he might tell me to bring the difference of the paper, when I went home with the cart; I do not recollect his telling me to bring a friend with me - I do not think he did, but cannot say whether he did or not.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not Byers charged before Sir Peter Laurie with having forged the bill? A. The man it was payable on happened to be there; Harrington said it was not a good bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the man acknowledge the name was put on it by his authority? A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BYERS. Q. What did you fetch Harrington for? A. To see me paid for the horse, as I was a little in liquor; if I had known it was a bill, I would have had nothing to do with it; I have seen cheques, but I cannot read, and do not understand them.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did you make to me when I asked you to let your son go home with me, and bring the bridle and saddle back that evening? A. I told you to send it home, and it would do as well.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he propose for your son to go home with him, to fetch back the saddle and bridle? A. I will not say that he did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BYERS. Q. Was not that three quarters of an hour after you had taken the bill and given me the difference? A. You did not let me show the bill to any body before you were off - George wrote a receipt for the money.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is this your receipt? A. It may be the same; I put my mark to a paper which George wrote, and which they called a receipt. (reads)</p>
               <p>Received of Mr. Byers, Twenty-five Pounds, for a horse, delivered on the 13th of September, 1827.</p>
               <p>£28 0 0. P. DESMOND, his X mark.</p>
               <p>Prisoner CHILD. Q. When the bill was given to you, did I represent myself as Palmer's clerk? A. I do not recollect that you did; you said you had come to pay Byers a bill for some eggs for a gentleman, that is all I heard you say: I gave the bill to a gentleman to read after they went out - I forget whether I heard it read before they went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Byers tell you he was disappointed in getting the bill cashed, but there was the bill if you would take it? A. I did not hear that - I did not know but that I was going to get sovereigns when I took the cart home: the bill had not been shown me then.</p>

I live in Cockpit-yard, and am a labourer; at the time in question I was a costermonger - I have known Desmond about twelve months; I went with him and his little boy with the horse to the public-house in Southampton-buildings; George came to the door, and said he could not stand the smoke - the other two came out afterwards; we all went to the Hole-in-the-Wall, public-house, in Chancery-lane, with the boy and horse - we went into the parlour; I left the boy at the door, telling him not to part with the horse till I came to him - I told him his father was tipsy; the three prisoners, I, and Desmond were all together in the parlour - several other gentlemen were there; they called for some gin and water, rum<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250036"/>and water, and ale - I considered Desmond at that time to be drunk; Byers and George both wanted me to drink, but I would have nothing but one glass of ale - I was perfectly sober; I told Desmond several times, in the prisoners' hearing, that he was drunk, and told Desmond he was an old fool for taking such a thing after they wrote it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they write? A. I am no scholar - I saw them write more than one paper; Desmond put his mark to a paper which George wrote, and I called him an old fool: Byers took a paper out of his pocket, and told him that was a bill for 28l. 18s. 6d., payable on the Monday following, and that it was as good as gold; Desmond put four sovereigns on the table - Byers took them, and gave him 1s. 6d. back; I heard him read the bill to us, but I told him I did not understand bills or cheques; it was after Desmond gave the money and took the paper that I called him an old fool; he then gave me the bill, and asked me to show it to some gentlemen, to see if it was right - I went to the bar - the landlord was not there; and as I returned from the bar, I met Byers and George rushing out of the parlour - I said nothing to them; Child and Desmond were sitting down at the table; I gave Desmond the bill, and told him to show it to some gentlemen: I then followed them out, and George had some gin in a half-pint glass - he wanted me to drink; he stood by the side of the horse, and the little boy was on it; Byers pulled the boy off the horse, and got on himself; he did not do it with violence, he took him off quietly; Desmond and Child were then in the parlour, not within sight of the horse; I told Byers the man was not satisfied with the bill, and I should like him to wait till he came out - George was by at the time, wanting me to drink gin; George told him the gin was not paid for - Byers pulled a red pocket-book out of his pocket, and gave him, saying that would settle for all, and galloped away on the horse: I then told George to go in and see if Desmond was satisfied, but he said he had nothing at all to do with it - Child came out, and walked away in another direction towards, Holborn; I laid hold of George, and kept him till I came up to a watchman - I said he had the pocket-book belonging to the man who ran away with the horse, and if he did not settle for the horse, I would deliver him to the watchman - I did so; he said he did not know any thing about Byers, or the bargain - he did not know any of the agreements, or at all about it; this was on Saturday night, after dusk: the next day, at half-past two o'clock, I saw the horse harnessed to a chaise, at a ginshop door in Fleet-market; I gave it to a constable to take to the Green-yard; a groom, who was in the chaise, was brought before Sir Peter Laurie, and discharged - I have not seen him since: on Monday, Byers and Child came to Guildhall - Byers threatened that he would lock me up, for taking the horse on Sunday; I did not go to Euston-square about the bill.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Nobody presented the bill that you know of? A. No; Byers and Child came voluntarily to Guildhall - Desmond told me they had been trying the horse; he was told the bill was for 28l. 18s. 6d., and gave the change in my presence - Byers did not object to my showing the bill to the landlord, but as soon as I went to show it, he ran out and took the horse away.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you and George sitting together in the public-house? A. I was there listening; I did not know but hey were going to pay for the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any force used to compel him to take the bill? A. Not in my presence; it is a very large room - there were eight or nine persons in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BYERS. Q. Did not you hold the horse while I mounted it? A. Yes; and I told you to wait till he came out, but you wished me good night; I heard you say, "Will you lend me the saddle and bridle till Monday?" Desmond said, "Yes, and the boy shall go with you if you like;" this was in the public-house, after he had paid the sovereigns; Desmond was in the public-house when he got on the horse - I bade him stop, and he gave George his pocket-book, and said, "That will settle for all."</p>
               <p>JOHN DESMOND. I am twelve years old. I rode my father's horse to Southampton-buildings, with the saddle and bridle; I afterwards went to another public-house in Chancery-lane; the prisoners walked with my father there- I recollect George and Byers; Harrington was with us; I staid outside on the horse for about half an hour, walking it up and down; a man came out with a white apron on - I believe it was Byers; I saw George with him: Byers pulled me off the horse, and jumped on himself. I said,"Sir, you must not have the horse till my father comes;""Oh, my boy," said he, "your father is paid, and it is all right:" he galloped away with the horse - I saw no more of him; George walked away down a street - Harrington followed and caught hold of him; I am sure I told him he must not have the horse till my father came out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Harrington present all the time after Byers came out? A. He was just coming out when he did; when my father came home with the cart I did not see him take any money out with him; George did not go away with the horse; he walked quickly away - Harrington kept his eye on him, and overtook him easily; he went very quick when he got into the other street. I heard nobody ask for the money for the liquor.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. - George was brought to the watch-house; I found three pocket-books on him - one was a red one; Harrington said Byers had given him that; there were several bills in George's own pocket-books, and some duplicates in the red pocket-book, which were returned to Byers; I did not go to Crescent-street myself. Byers and Child came voluntarily to Guildhall on Monday, the 17th, and were detained.</p>
               <p>The bill paid to Desmond was here produced - it was dated the 13th of August, 1827, at two months after date, for 28l. 18s. 6d., value received of Nicholas Byers, upon and accepted by Wm. Palmer, rag-merchant, No. 49, Crescent-street, Euston-square.</p>

            . I keep the Golden Horse public-house, Theohald's-road. On Monday, the 10th of September, Byers and a man named Geary called at my house, and had a pint of beer at the bar - Desmond came on his cob; Byers said he wanted a horse, and thought that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250037"/>would suit him very well - that he had got a broken kneed horse, and if they could swap he would do it. On Thursday, the 13th, George and a young man came, and said they understood I knew where they could see the horse; I took them to Desmond - his stable is near my house: this was about five o'clock in the afternoon, and in about half an hour Byers came and said they were two friends of his, whom he had sent to see the horse; he then went down to Desmond - he returned to my house with Desmond, and stopped there drinking till about eleven o'clock at night; they were both in liquor when they went away on the Friday evening. George and Desmond came again and were there above three hours. Byers said if Desmond would let him have the horse for two or three days, to try, he would leave the value in any body's hands - Desmond objected; he said he might have a trial, but he would be with him. I went with Desmond on the Sunday, and found the horse at Mr. Lay's wine-vaults, at the corner of Fleet-lane; the groom was taken before the Magistrate, and discharged.</p>

I had the care of his gelding: on the 23d of July I turned it out into the field about six o'clock in the evening - I put the saddle and bridle into the stable, and locked the door - the saddle had not been used that day - there are two gates to the field from the road: I put the gelding into a field through the gate leading out of the stable yard - there are two other gates to the field - one leads out of that field, into another, and one leads into the garden - that gate has hurdles set round an apple-tree, to protect the apples: the hurdles went all round the gate - the horse could not get through that gate without breaking through the hurdles, which were all closed, but I am not certain whether they were all tied; all the gates were fastened - the small gate leading into the garden was pinned, and the horse could not get out without the pin being taken out. On the following morning, between six and seven o'clock, I found the stable door standing a little way open, and the bolt of the lock forced out; I missed the saddle and bridle. I went into the field, and the gelding was gone; there was a poney and another horse left; I found in the field one girth of the saddle and the corn-seive, which had been taken out of the corn-bin. I saw that one hurdle was open, and traced the horse through the gate into the garden, by his foot-marks; he was peculiarly shod - he had then gone up a grass walk by the side of the field, through two gates, which had been left pinned, and had then to cross more fields into the road. I accompanied master to London next day, and went with Armstrong and Attfield to several places - and about eleven o'clock in the morning of the 25th, I saw the horse in Chenies-mews, near Tottenham-court-road, and saw the saddle and bridle hanging in the stable there; it was a dark brown gelding. I saw the prisoner, but not when I first went in - I saw him a little after one o'clock; I waited for him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you tell the Magistrate that you saw the prisoner that day? A. Yes; what I said was taken down; I was asked if I saw French, and said I did - I was there two or three times; I only signed my examination once - it was read over to me, and I signed it. I cannot say whether every thing I said was taken down.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 25th of July, between ten and eleven o'clock, I went with Armstrong and Petchy to No. 42, Chenies-mews; a woman answered the door - I went into the stable, and Petchy immediately identified the first horse in the first stall; he said, "Here is my master's horse" - we found a saddle and bridle there, which he also claimed; we waited some time, for the owner of the stables to come home - we did not see him, and we took the horse to a stable in the Curtain-road. On the 6th of October I, Garton, and Armstrong went to a house in Park-place, near Kennington-common - I knocked at the door; a woman looked out of the first floor window, and I knew her to be the woman whom I had seen at the stables in Chenies-mews - we were admitted at last; I went up stairs, and saw the prisoner there - it is above three miles from the mews. I said, "French, here you are" - "Yes, Mr. Attfield," said he; I told him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250038"/>I had had a great deal of trouble in looking after him since the 25th of July - he said he was exceedingly sorry for it, but he had been kept out of the way by the parties, who had allowed him 1l. a week - I said he must get ready and go with us; I asked him about the horses in Chenies-mews, whether the stables there were his - he said they were: we then took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He said at once they were his stables? A. Yes - he behaved very well, and came very quietly. He said that the parties had allowed him 1l. a week to keep out of the way.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's son, and am seventeen years old. I saw these horses taken away from the stable - I remember a dark brown one - I was present when it was taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know, of your own knowledge, how that horse came to your father's stables? A. I went out to work at six o'clock on a Wednesday, I think it was, and when I came back to breakfast it was there; it was not there when I went out; my father was at home when I went out in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who brought the horse there? A. A tall young man brought it; he was there on the evening before about it; his name is Thomas Shaw - I have seen him before at my father's stables; he lives in Osnaburg-street, New-road - I do not know the number; it is a stable-yard; he was to pay a guinea a week for the horse - I heard that said.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When did you hear it said, he was to pay a guinea a week? A. On the Monday morning - I cannot say what day of the month it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Monday would be the 23d? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it Monday morning that Shaw came to the stables? A. It was Monday when I came from breakfast.</p>
               <p>Q. You said before it was Wednesday? A. Yes; the horse came on Wednesday - I came home to breakfast at eight o'clock on Wednesday; my father was not at home then, but he was at six.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home on Monday night, was your father at home? A. Yes; he went out on Tuesday morning, after I went out - I found the horse there on Wednesday morning - I do not know who brought it myself; my father was out on Wednesday; only one horse was brought - there were two there before - I do not know who brought them - I have known Shaw twelve months; he is very well, I believe - I have not been to Osnaburg-street since my father was apprehended - I did not know before this morning that I was to come here to give evidence - Shaw keeps livery-stables.</p>
               <p>COURT Q. You went out at six o'clock on Wednesday - when did the officers come? A. On Thursday; it was Thursday; I was fetched from my work, when they came, as there was nobody at home with the children; a little boy who lives opposite fetched me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you came and spoke to the officers? A. Yes; the horse was brought on Wednesday, between six and eight o'clock - I saw the officers when I was fetched - I did not tell them when the horse was brought; they did not ask me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask why they took the horses away? A. No; my mother was at home, crying, as they took her away from the children - I did not ask them why they took my mother away; which way was I to interfere? they took the horse away with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, "That is the horse my father is to be paid for?" A. I told Attfield it was the horse that was brought in the morning, and my mother told them who brought it - I will swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did she tell them had brought it? A. The name of Young - I believe the name of Wright; the young man who brought it, said his name was Wright.</p>
               <p>Q. You said it was Thomas Shaw? A. Thomas Shaw came about the horse; he bargained about it; my father and I were in the stable at the time; my father slept at home the night before the horse was taken away - I do not know where he slept the next night; he was not at home, nor my mother; the officers had taken her away; they locked her up at Worship-street, and would not let me see her - I did not state at Worship-street, that it was Shaw's horse; they did not ask me any question.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to the officers, "My mother knows nothing about this horse; it was brought by Shaw, and you will find him at Osnaburg-street?" A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell any body, from that time to this, that the horse was brought there by Shaw? A. No - I have not been at home: I have been at work at Dulwich - Shaw keeps livery stables; he keeps them at this time; he had not room in his own stable for it - I was there the day before; he had three horses tied up under the shed then - I do not think I have seen him since that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go to him, and say, "My mother is taken, because your horse was found in our stable, come and get her liberated?" A. No - I have not been to him;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250039"/>my father has been taken up three weeks on Saturday - I have not been to look after Shaw - I have not had an opportunity - I have been at my place.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, but your father's life was concerned, and did not you go and inquire for Shaw? A. No - I had no idea of it; there were my sisters at home - I did not send them there - I was not present when my father was examined.</p>
               <p>Q. After your father was taken, did you tell any body Shaw had left the horse there? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the stables after the horses were taken away? A. There was nobody to do the business - I do not know where my father was, and did not inquire where he was - I have since been living at my place, with Mr. Berwick, coach-master of Dulwich.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. Berwick, that your father had been taken up for a horse, lodged in the stable by another man? A. No - Shaw is a tallish young man - I have not seen him since; my mother was kept in prison three weeks - I went to see her; she did not desire me to call on Shaw - I did not tell her Shaw had brought the horse; she was up stairs when it came, and could see if she liked - I was not there when it came - I have not talked with her about it, or how it came there.</p>

I saw the prisoner and the deceased there, but did not know them before; the prisoner sat having some steaks; the deceased sat on the opposite side with Young, and some more friends - Young went over and asked him for a piece of steak; he told her to take some; she put a fork into a piece, which he wished to keep; he shoved the plate forward to her, and said,"Take it all;" the deceased and Young then both called him names, and the deceased struck him; somebody said,"You are big enough to take your own part; why don't you have a fight?" the deceased then struck him again, and the prisoner fell back in his seat; he got up and struck the deceased in the chest; he cut his head against the fender - I did what I could to stop the blood, and left him in the care of Young - the deceased was certainly the man to blame.</p>

He came in for some beer, sat down with me, and we drank together; the prisoner came in, and was eating - there was a bustle - I saw Young there; Williams jumped up: I said, "For goodness don't interfere, you have nothing to do with it;" he struck the prisoner twice over the table: the prisoner said he would forgive that, if he could get his dinner comfortably; I said, "Oh, he is tipsy, don't take any notice;" he said, "I won't - only let me eat my dinner:" somebody said he was big enough to take his own part - Williams struck him again; the prisoner then struck him once with a sort of shove, and he fell with his head against the fender - it bled very much; the deceased was the person to blame.</p>

            . I had seen the deceased several times - the prisoner was eating his dinner; I asked him for some - he allowed me to take it; after he had done, he said I might take it all; I went to put a fork into one piece - he took it away, and put it into a piece of paper to put into his pocket; and while I was gone up stairs, words occurred between them - I saw Williams strike him twice; the prisoner then gave him a push, and, being intoxicated, he fell - I attended him to the hospital; he died on the Monday: he did not think himself at all in danger, but said he should soon be out, for no material damage was done.</p>

There was nobody near me; Prince immediately followed after her - Browning did not ask me to go any where with her, or say any thing, but immediately began pulling me about; she undid my waistcoat and the waistband of my trousers - I said nothing to her; Prince held my arm up - Browning searched my pockets; and on my calling out, somebody looked out of window - nobody came to my assistance till after it was all done; I then went down the court, and saw the watchman; I felt in my pocket, and the money was all gone - Prince took off my hat; they stood in the court with a man - I asked him to take the women away, but he refused to assist; I saw the watchman at the bottom of the court - he said he did not hear me call out - I told him what had happened; I cannot say how far the prisoners were off then: I went down Type-street and Grub-street with the watchman; he looked down the alley, but could not find them; I went to the watch-house and told what had happened - the officer sent the watchmen round with me again; we found Browning on the pavement, and Prince under the archway with a man - they asked the man whether he had got my money; he said No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to let them do this without crying out? A. I did call out, after they got my money; I attended at the watch-house, and gave the same account at the office the next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it not because you were afraid your master would inquire about your hat that you gave any alarm? A. I cried out as soon as they took my money; a man looked out of a window, and Prince took my hat off - I cannot say how long I was in the alley - it might he a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes; I was pulled into the alley; I did not want to go with them - the public-house was shut up, and there was nobody for me to call out to - I am not in the habit of being out late; I did not know there was any harm in telling them what money I had got - they were pulling me about, and searching my pockets; I was very much frightened - I do not know why I did not halloo before; I have seen Browning at our shop - she came to buy butter; I do not recollect seeing Prince before - she was tipsy - the man stood looking on all the time, and heard me halloo - both the prisoners were with me when the person looked out of the window - I was dragged into the court.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you get your hat again? A. Yes; Prince threw it down; they did not fondle with me, or attempt to entice me any where.</p>

            . I am a watchman. About a quarter past eleven o'clock, I was in Type-street, and saw this lad come out of a court, on the other side the road, crying- I was about nine yards from the court - I called him over, and asked what was the matter; he said he had been robbed of 11d. by two girls; I asked if he should know them again; he said Yes; I took him through the next court, thinking they might come into Grub-street, but could not see then; I then took him into the court he was robbed in - only two or three houses there are inhabited; I took him to the watch-house, and afterwards went out with him again; he pointed to Browning, who was about 100 yards off, and said, "There is the young woman:" my brother watchman took her; he said, "There is the other," pointing to Prince, who was talking to some man; she said, "What am I to go to the watch-house for?"</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you on your beat? A. Yes; it is about twelve yards from the court; I heard no hallooing; I had come up that moment from calling eleven o'clock - it is a very dark narrow court; there is one lamp there, but it gives a bad light; he could not see them, unless it was done under the lamp; the public-house had been closed sooner than usual that night; when I saw the boy his waistband, and his waistcoat were open.</p>

            . I live at No. 3, Type-court; I was in bed a little after eleven o'clock, and heard what I thought the cry of a little girl in the court; I laid a minute or two, and heard the voice say, "Pray let me go; I have got no more;" I jumped out of bed, opened the window, and called out, "What are you doing with that girl?" I then saw it was a boy - I saw Browning, as I suppose there - I could only distinguish her by her voice; I have heard her speak several times before; after I called out, she let go of the boy, and went down the court; Bruce called the boy to him, and asked what they had robbed him of; he said 11d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It is a bad light in the court? A. It is an oil lamp; I could not discern any body's features.</p>

I said, "No, not till you have got your dog;" I called Dupuis to my assistance.</p>

            . I am a salesman at Smithfield - I live in Essex. Seven or eight weeks before the 3d of September I bought ten beasts out of those belonging to Mr. Bosanquet - he had about forty. I looked at the whole, and drew ten out of them: I noticed the whole in selecting them. I particularly noticed one which I rejected as not fit for market. On the 3d of September I saw the prisoner trying to get two heifers into Smithfield-market; it being fair day he had a great deal of trouble - one of them passed close by my cattle - I knew it to be the one I had so particularly handled at Bosanquet's. I questioned him about it for twenty minutes - he said he was employed by a person named Brown, to bring them to market, and was not to sell them unless he made 17l. a piece for them before his master came - I had them tied up with my stock, as he said his master would soon he there. I made him stop, and kept my eye on him: I was very busy, and the first opportunity he had he made off. I let the beasts remain there till the market was over, and then sent them home by Gibbs to Mr. Bosanquet. I looked for the prisoner daily, and met him on the 1st of October, near Shoreditch church - I jumped out of my gig, and took him.</p>

When the watchman had called two, I heard a person come down the court, rap at the door, and call, "Jem, Jem - Harry, Harry - what are you about so long?" it was the same voice. I can swear the prisoner came up to the door, and repeated the same words; just as he had got Je out of his mouth, I came out, and turned the corner quick - the step of the next door projected, and he stumbled, and was secured; there was not another soul to be seen in the court.

On the 27th of August I saw the prisoner come out of the yard, with a collar; he went down Brokers'-row, and returned in three minutes, without it; he worked till eight o'clock next day, and left without notice - I told the foreman of it, but he expected his master home, and did not take him. I knew the collar, as I had worked there once - I had two horses to mind, or I should have taken him; he knew me well, but took it out publicly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. That young man went away ill, and I took his situation; the foreman and him were drinking for three or four hours together, leaving me at work; I complained to the foreman about it - he said he would discharge me - I said I should discharge myself, and get work before the winter came on. I was taken before the Magistrate, and acquitted - he said he would prosecute if it cost him 50l.</p>

I thought she might go into Petticoat-lane to sell the umbrella - I went and met her in about twenty minutes, without the umbrella; a man was walking before her - I asked what she had done with the umbrella - she called me every name she could think of; the man spoke to her in some language which I could not understand, and then told her to give me back my umbrella, but I said I wanted her; she was going to run away - I caught hold of her, and she bit a piece out of my finger; she gave me 3s. 6d., and asked me to let her go - I refused; she then gave me another shilling. Two men came up, and took her to the watch-house. She was quite a stranger to me; she said it was a lady's gold ring, and worth full 2l.

On the morning of the 22d of October I saw the prisoner come out of their shop-door, about nine o'clock - I followed him about one hundred yards, when he turned into the Gun public-house - I followed him in, and saw a man named Ryland standing up; he knew me, and said to the prisoner, "Be quiet" - the prisoner slipped into a box, and I saw Ryland give him some gin - I turned round, laid hold of Ryland, and handcuffed him - I then laid hold of the prisoner, who made some resistance - I called the landlord, who ran round, and the prisoner twisted out of my arm - I gave Ryland to the landlord, and followed the prisoner to the back door; he got out at the door - I followed him down a court, and seized him, without losing sight of him; we scuffled for some time - I brought him back to the house, and with assistance, took this tobacco from his breeches pockets, which were very large, and it was pressed down very tight indeed - I found on him 1 lb. 15 ozs. - it was not in paper; he had an apron on over his pockets - I found Ryland still in custody of the landlord - I then went to the prisoner's lodgings, in Rahere-street, Goswell-street, and found a bag, locked up in a cupboard, which had contained tobacco; there was a little tobacco dust in it; it was stained, and smelt of tobacco - I have kept the tobacco in my possession.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. How much did you find? A. 1 lb. 15 ozs. - I am certain he is the man who came out of Fish and Collins' house; no one came out with him - I tied the tobacco up in paper, and produced it at the office - it was sealed up - I now produce it; nobody would suppose, from his appearance, that he had any thing about him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM COLLINS. I am in partnership with Samuel Fish. We have a very extensive manufactory; the prisoner was in our service, and was employed to <rs id="t18271025-84-deflabel506" type="occupation">pack tobacco</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What work was he doing that morning? A. I do not know; he packs, and does any thing that is required of him; the tobacco is in a finished state; we give each man an ounce and a half every Saturday night - the men should be searched as they leave the premises, but it is neglected at times - I understand he was not searched that morning - I think I could swear to this tobacco wherever I saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to swear to your tobacco, finding it any where? A. To form a very correct opinion of it, I think<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250045"/>I could swear to this tobacco, if I found it in any other place - I can form a very correct opinion of it - I can swear to this, from its appearance, flavour and smell.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not all tobacco the same appearance, flavour and smell? A. Not all - there are many different descriptions; it is shag tobacco; there are various kinds of that - I swear to this positively; when we sell it, it goes out in paper packages; he has been eight years in my service - I did not suspect him till lately; he has not stolen any money from me - I know nothing of a 10l. note being detained. Our business is under the Excise.</p>

            . I was the prisoner's servant, and have lived nine months with him. I know that box, and have seen it in Ryland's room; I have moved it about when I have been cleaning - it was always heavy, and was kept by the side of his bed the whole time I was there; he lives in one room - I saw it in his room when I came down to light the fire at seven o'clock in the morning of the day the officer came - it was on a chair by his bed-side; I have seen Wright come to Ryland's, but not often - I was always turned out of the room when he came, and the door was locked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen the box that morning? A. Yes - I have often moved it; I once put it on the carpet - it was heavy then, but not so heavy as when it was full; it always seemed full of something, and was always equally heavy; I believe the first morning I went there I saw it open - I think there were a few clothes in it, but I did not look into it; I am sure it was not Mrs. Scott's box, for I saw it in master's room every day; I do not know how it got into her room - I was never in the room when master dressed.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Were there any servants in the house but yourself? A. No. Scott cleaned her own room - I fetched her errands; I never saw the box in her room; she left the house about three days ago: my master is a shoe-maker - I never saw him deal in tobacco; I am thirteen years old; I have been to a Sunday-school - I believe God will punish wicked people who speak falsely.</p>
               <p>MR. COLLINS. I accompanied Vann to the prisoner's lodgings; I saw a large drawer there, and it had a small portion of tobacco left in it - it smelt as if much more had been there; I saw this box in a room which I was told Scott occupied; I am certain the tobacco in it is ours - it is manufactured by a peculiar process, and is worth about 7l.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any body near enough to take them away beside the prisoner? A. Not a soul was near besides her and the lady - the lady could not have taken them; they were worth 5s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. She had been to your stall before? A. Yes - she never bought any thing; I never knew her husband before she was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not her husband stop you at Acton for hawking shoes? A. I never was a hawker in my life; I was selling shoes at Brentford - I go to public markets; mine is a stall, about eight feet long - there was no other person near enough to take them; the market was not crowded - it was between 12 and 1 o'clock; the market was nearly over; she was pregnant - I do not know that she was lame; I followed her as soon as I could, but could not find her - her artfulness prevented my finding her; I did not know whether she went into the crowd, or down the passage to her house - I understand the passage leads to her dwelling, which I did not know before; I sent for the constable and the market-keeper, and described her to them that day; I swear positively that she took them - I made this charge seven weeks afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it possible she could be about the market two hours without your discovering her? A. I think it was impossible; I never told her if she paid 4s. 6d. she she might go - I was three times before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, on one occasion, swear you saw her with the boots; and on another occasion, only that you missed them after she was gone? A. No - she was bailed; certainly, the solicitor wished to compromise the business, but the Magistrate said he would not allow a compromise; she attended the office voluntarily twice, when the Magistrate was not in attendance; the constable had given her notice to come forward.</p>

               <p>Q. You are not with her every Tuesday that she is in the market? A.

               <p>Q. Did he tell you on what day it was? A. No; I know I was with her, because she tried on the button shoes; and he said he lost his boots the day she tried on the button shoes - I was with her all that day: I went before the Magistrate, but was not called for; I was told not to say any thing before I was called - I was persuaded by the people in the Court-room not to speak; I have not mentioned to any body that I was with her all day, from that time to this - I have heard it talked of, but never told any body that I was with her; her husband is employed by a coal-meter - I am a shoe-binder.</p>

            . I am a labouring man, and live at Mr. Leader's, a pawnbroker, of Brentford. I was at the Magistrate's office. at Brentford, four or five weeks ago, when the prosecutor charged the prisoner with stealing the boots; he said he missed the boots after she left the stand; her husband fetched her to the office; the prosecutor said he would give up the charge if her husband gave him 4s. 6d. - she said she would do no such thing, for she was innocent of the charge, and would rather go to prison and perish than pay for what she never had; he said, "So you shall;" she was admitted to bail at the last examination, on the 16th of October - this conversation was on the 2d of October.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where was it you heard him say this? A. At Mr. Clark's office - no Magistrate was present that day; Mr. Clark, the Magistrate's clerk, was present, and must have heard it - he said nothing then, but he said afterwards, "Bowley, I think you had better pay the 4s. 6d., and have done with it;" he said, "No, Sir, my wife declares herself innocent; I don't like to pay for what she never received;" she was examined before the Magistrate a fortnight afterwards - this was said at the office - the charge was made at the office, and her husband fetched her there, but the Magistrate was gone; and on the next Tuesday he was ill; on the following Tuesday the case was heard; I was present, but I did not tell the Magistrate of it; I have told different people of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Robinson charge the prisoner with stealing the boots? A. Certainly, and Mr. Clark heard it; he said a pair of boots were taken from the stall, and he supposed that woman to have taken them; he charged her with stealing them.</p>
               <p>Q. And the Magistrate's clerk advised the husband to give 4s. 6d.? A. He said he had better give it; I know the last witness; she was by when the words were made use of; and more than that, Robinson came within ten minutes, and asked the husband to pay 4s. 6d.; the husband said she should go to prison, for she said she was innocent; he said, "So she shall;" he told the Magistrate the first time, they were leather boots, and afterwards that they were worth 5s. 6d., and if he had the 5s. 6d. it was all he wanted; the Magistrate said, "Most people like to have their rights; and some people want more than their rights." I am acquainted with the prisoner's husband.</p>
               <p>JOHN ROBINSON re-examined. I did not say if 4s. 6d. was paid, it was all I wanted; the Magistrate did not say what this man has stated, nor any thing of the sort.</p>

            . I am an attorney, and have a house at Hounslow, as well as in London; I attended the office twice, but in consequence of the illness of Mr. Crighton no examination took place; on my cross-examining the prosecutor before Mr. Clithero, I asked him if he had not offered to give it up for 4s. 6d.; he said he had not, but if he was paid for his goods that was all he wanted. Colonel Clithero said people often wished the value of their goods; he admitted having told the husband that if they were paid for, he would not go any further; I did not enter into any conversation with him the first or second time; I was attending on other business as well; as there was no Magistrate the prisoner was allowed to go away, and attended next time, and after the examination she was bailed - the witness Furze stood very near the prosecutor, for the purpose of stating what she knew, and I told Colonel Clithero I had a witness, who was with her at the time, but he said, "He has sworn to the thing being stolen, and you must put in bail;" I am certain, however, that the prosecutor acknowledged then that this woman was with the prisoner, explicitly and expressly; he said, "That woman was with her;" I put it to him whether any woman was with her at the time she stole the boots; he turned round, and said, "Yes, this woman."</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH THOMAS. I live at No. 27, Hart-street, Covent-garden; my son Edward William is seven years old. On Sunday evening, the 23d of September, he was with me; I had to call with some milk in Clement's Inn, which I brought from my master's place, in High-street, Bloomsbury: I gave a quart can to the child to hold - I was absent from him above three minutes; the child had walked from the door about two yards - I saw the prisoner, as I came out take the can from the child's hand, and walk away with it; I ran after him, and asked what he wanted with it; he said he wanted milk for his coffee - he was no customer of mine - there was a pint and a half of milk in it; I laid hold of it, and he would not give it up to me for some time; he said neither the can nor the child belonged to me; he did not run away, but stood there, and two patrols came up; I gave him in charge.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was coming up Wild-street, and saw several lads, of the prisoner's age, standing at the corner of Steward's-rents - he was about the centre of them - this woman came about six yards from him, and asked me to take him for taking the can from her boy; he said he was not the lad; he went quietly with me - his brothers would have rescued him if they could - they were tumultuous; the can was delivered to me - the prosecutrix recommended him to mercy, and the Magistrate bailed him, and I gave it up.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer's labourer, and live in Oxford-street. I was present when this happened; the prisoner's brother asked the child to let him drink; the child looked back, and then ran away; the mother came back to the young man, and asked if he wanted to thieve the can: he laughed at her, and asked if she was drunk - they jaw'd one another; two patrols came up; she went and told them that he took the can from the child; the young man who had asked to drink, walked aside; the prisoner stood with his back to the wall of Steward's-rents, and she gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In whose hands was the can? A. In the mother's; she took it out of the child's hand; it was never in the prisoner's hand; it was never out of the child's hand till she took it out - the two young men had drank a drop; there was no interruption to the patrol taking the prisoner, but I did not follow them - nobody drank out of the can; the young man who asked to drink, did not get any; it was two young men, two brothers; when she saw the child run away, she thought they had taken the can - I told the patrol, that was not the man who asked to drink, and that he had never touched the can - I was working last at Tyburn-gate - I do not know who for - I knew the prisoner, for about a month, by having lodged where he did.</p>
               <p>JOEL SPENCER re-examined. I cannot say whether this witness was among the persons - nobody told me the child had not had the can taken out of his hands, not that I recollect; some person did come up and say that was the wrong man; the person who stands there, and another, who has gone out, were the two who behaved disorderly; they laid hold of me on each side - I said I would knock them down; they then desisted.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he not tell you, he would knock you down if you interfered? A. He did not tell me exactly; there were a good many round - I touched him on the shoulder - I did not lay hold of him - I sell things about the street now.</p>
               <p>JOEL SPENCER. That is one of the young men whom I threatened to knock down, if he interrupted me; he was pulling me by the collar, and the other patrol, King, who was with me; he said I had got the wrong man.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Nobody took the can then? A. No - it is all a lie - I had seen a boy fetch water from the pump, in a can like it, but it had no top to it like this - I did not follow the patrol to the watch-house, or say any thing to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was standing in Wild-street; the woman came down with the child, who had the can in his hand; she was intoxicated, and asked if I wanted to take the can; my brother, who stood by, had asked the child for some water, and she gave me in charge - I was let out on bail, and have surrendered.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did you not give information of it, which would have saved his life? A. I was not aware of the consequences. I could not leave my work to go to see him on the Sunday; he was dead when I got there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not the deceased a stout man? A. Yes - he was stouter than Beard if any thing. I was not near enough to hear whether the seconds remonstrated against his continuing to fight - there was nothing at all unfair; there was no foul play - both seemed to be equally beaten about; Crow had called at my lodgings, and said Beard and him had had words, and were going to fight - it was not a prize-fight, but arose from a quarrel.</p>

I never saw any of the others before the fight; I went to Old Oak-common, and was there when it began; Beard and Crow fought: the other three acted as seconds; I saw the men go in and strip - they then shook hands, and commenced fighting; I saw no constable near: they fell down together at the last round - Crow was undermost; he seemed week, and much distressed - he was taken in a coach to the Green Man, in the Harrow-road; he was bled there, and afterwards taken to the hospital; I saw him next morning at the hospital, but not afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had heard so early as Wednesday that he was going to fight? A. Yes - he said he had got Beard to fight him at last - those were his words; he had often expressed a wish to fight Beard - he said before, that he had done all he could two or three times to provoke him, but could not get him to fight; he spoke with joy when he said he had got him to fight; he came and shook hands with me in the morning, and said he was going to fight his man, and challenge another. I know he has before fought with a stone-mason, and beat him - the battle was quite fair. I had seen Beard before the fight - we all three belonged to the same club; I never exchanged a word with him, but always understood him to be a very good natured civil man.</p>

            . I keep an eating-house, in Cross-street, Carnaby-market. I did not see the fight, but know there was a quarrel between Beard and the deceased - the last quarrel I heard was on the Wednesday previous to the Monday - I have heard the deceased challenge Beard on different occasions, in the most provoking manner - and on the Wednesday evening I saw him get up, when Beard was sitting down quite peaceably; he called him a cur and a coward, and said he was no man, or he would fight him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not say he would spoil his face for him? A. He did; Beard bore his expressions much more quietly than any one could expect - I do not think I ever heard a man bear such language better; but after the language used on Wednesday night he jumped up, and said, "Well, I will not be insulted night after night in this way, but will fight you now, and then;" I have known Beard eight or nine months - he was the most peaceable man I ever knew; Crow said he would not fight him there, but would have him out to fight.</p>

He said it was iron - nobody could tell what it was without opening the cloth; he was about a quarter of a mile from the foundry; he was asked where he lived, and said in School-house-yard: I then said,"I will be bound it came from the foundry;" I went to his house, and saw two or three children. I found a half-crown and a knife on him: his window leads out into the foundry yard. I found a ladder in the cellar of the foundry; it is not now used as a foundry. I found no lead in his house, nor any thing which appeared to have cut lead.</p>

I returned in half an hour - the prisoner was then sitting in the bar, taking a pint of porter: while he sat there I took 1l. worth of silver out of the bag in the drawer, and expect I left 5l. odd there, in half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences - I do not know how many of each. My wife and daughter attend the bar; they are not here. The prisoner remained there above an hour - I met him in the passage (he had paid his reckoning); he asked me to take a glass of gin with him; I declined. He had been there alone some time - he bid me good morning, and left; I have known him some years. I directly went to the drawer, and found the bag of silver gone; I ran out, and overtook him about two hundred yards off; I tapped him on the shoulder - he turned round, and said, "Is any thing the matter - is not all right?" I said I would thank him to walk back, and he did so - I took him into the bar, and accused him of stealing the bag, which he denied; I said several times, if he would deliver it up I would let him go - he refused. I then asked what silver he had about him - he said he might have 2l. or 3l. worth. I send for an officer, who found 5l. 4s. in silver in his breast pocket - the bag was found in the fire-place, close to where he sat; nobody but him had been in the bar; he said he had brought the silver from Bristol, as Bristol notes would not pass in London.

The prisoner was in my employ up to the 20th of September - it was his business to receive money from different tradesmen, to whom I trust goods; he was to enter the sums received in a book in which the names are entered, and to hand over the money to me when he came home. Teece is a customer of mine; I have the book here, which the prisoner kept, and in which he ought to enter his accounts; he has not entered the sum of 8s. on the <rs id="t18271025-96-cd573" type="crimeDate">17th of July</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. This was in the course of tally-trade, was it not? A. Yes. I cannot tell how many persons he had to collect from, perhaps one hundred and fifty. I have other persons who collect money - I do not mean to state their accounts are always correct; I have found them to bring me more money than they have put down; he brought home on the 17th of July, 24l. 9s. 8d. - it did not include the 8s., for I have gone all over the account: the cash he paid that days was 4s. more than he had entered.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Have you discovered any other sum deficient in the entry that day? A. Yes, there is one other sum I have discovered. The prisoner left my service suddenly - he has not accounted for this 8s. since; he was apprehended ten days after he left me - he came to my shop on the 25th of September.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did he come for? A. To demand his wages and clothes; I said I should not give them till I had looked over his accounts; he said I had no right to detain his clothes, he should bring an officer; I said he might do as he liked, I should be satisfied before I gave them up - I have not given them up. He had been in my service about twelve months - it was my intention to discharge him, in consequence of his irregular habits.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Thompson; the prisoner was in his employ till the 20th of September; he went away that day - he had not been discharged.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had there been any dispute with him and you about the irregular time he came to sleep? - A. Yes; my orders were, to admit no one after ten o'clock- he was out all night frequently, and used to return in the morning; I locked him out two or three times; we had some words about it; I know the nature of the business the prisoner had to transact - errors will sometimes happen in it - it does sometimes happen that more money is paid to my master than is down in the book.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Are not these things made right soon afterwards? A. Yes; it is set right the following week - the prisoner never gave an explanation of this 8s., to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. As I understand you, the errors in the book would be detected by looking at the book itself? A. Yes, if there was more paid than was put down in the book; I have known such errors so detected; or by going round the next week, we can see by the bill that more was received than was down; Mr. Teece still continued on his list.</p>
               <p>JANE TEECE re-examined. He called after the 17th of July, but that was the last time I paid him, as it was not convenient.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My master has been in the habit of putting down in his ledger such, and such a sum of money received, to make the book right, and he has done so when there have been errors; this book lasts thirteen weeks, and here are seven out of the thirteen wrong.</p>
               <p>MR. THOMPSON re-examined. Q. Who keeps this book? A. A young man named Chapman; here are seven weeks wrong, but the error was detected immediately I looked it over - it was an error in his putting it down, but he is a very bad scholar; the prisoner knows that; and is a very good scholar - here are thirty-six weeks of his without a mistake; he has contrived to make the accounts agree. I have no reason to suspect Chapman of dishonesty.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it not the duty of the prisoner to put down on the bill the sum he received? A. Yes - I do not go round to their houses, or I should have detected the mistake - he would go till the bill was settled.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Have you made a minute of the 4s. which was overpaid? A. Yes, here it is.</p>

            . I am a chandler, and live in Perkins'-rents. On the 20th of September, about seven o'clock in the morning, I saw Walker in Pump-court - I saw him receive a bundle from Thomas, tied up in a red and yellow handkerchief - he came past me with it, and went along the street - I afterwards saw Thomas go away without any thing - I did not see what was in the bundle, but it was in the shape of a bonnet.</p>
               <p>Prisoner THOMAS. Q. How far off were you? A. I stood at the corner of the street, eight or ten yards off - you was without your hat; it appeared to be like a bonnet - you then returned into the house, and went up Pye-street.</p>

               <p>Prisoner THOMAS. Q. When the Magistrate sent you with the prosecutrix, did you get the property at her place? A. I got the cap there, and then she took me to where the bonnet was altering.</p>

            . I am a coal-dealer, and live in Perkins'-rents. I saw the two prisoners together about half-past six o'clock that morning; they went into Old-Pye-street, and then Walker returned into Pump-court; Thomas was in Wilkinson's-court, which is at the back of No. 53, Old Pye-street - Thomas handed a bundle over the wall to Walker; he then came by me, within about five yards - they went up Old Peter-street; he had a bundle under his right arm, which appeared like a bonnet - it was in a yellow belcher handkerchief, which I believe was silk - I did not then know whose it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner THOMAS. Q. You say it was a yellow belcher handkerchief? A. Yes, a lemon colour; I saw it was a bonnet tied up in it, and he had it under his arm; I did not tell the Magistrate that it was in the shape of a coal-scuttle.</p>
               <p>WALKER'S Defence. I am quite innocent: I was at the Tower to meet my brother going to Margate in the steamboat; the witness said he thought it was a bonnet, and now he says it was a bonnet.</p>
               <p>THOMAS' Defence. I was in bed at eight o'clock: I got up and was going to work at nine; I saw the prosecutrix looking out of her window, and said to her, "It will be a fine day:" when I came home at nine o'clock at night, I went to bed, and she came to my bed-side with a parcel of neighbours, with a key and a Bible, to know if I had seen the things - I said I had not; the next morning she came to me, and I said I was innocent.</p>

On the 3d of October I went out to work in the morning, leaving my drawers locked, and the room door locked; I returned at one o'clock to get my dinner; when I unlocked my door I saw the curtain drawn in back, the partition between the prisoner's room and mine was broken through, and my drawers and boxes were open; I went down to the person who keeps the house - he came up with me, and then we went into the prisoner's room; I found some of my articles in the basket in his room, but the sheets and towels were gone; I have not seen them since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What time did you go out? A. About eight o'clock; I left one old box, which had two gowns and one shawl in it, unlocked - one was a brown gown, and the other a Norwich crape; some of the other articles were taken from the bottom drawer, which had been locked, and was broken open - I had nine locks broken - I missed one gown from a box; the money was taken from a small box; I told the Justice there was 22s., and I believe half of it was in sixpences - it was safe when I left; I did not say there were only nine sixpences - it must have been a mistake; it was exactly my rent-money, which I wished to pay on the Monday.</p>

I lodge in the same house: just as the prosecutrix got up stairs, the prisoner came down running - I did not see any thing on him; but the prosecutrix came down, and I went with her up to her room: I saw the things broken open, and a hole through which a person had burst into her room; I went into Turner's room, where I saw this basket, with these things in it - I saw the locks had been been broken in the prosecutrix's room; the next day, between three and four o'clock, the prisoner's little boy came and told me something; I went to Smith-street, and saw the prisoner leaning on a post - he saw me, and ran away - I took him in St. John's Church-yard; I asked him how he could be guilty of robbing Mrs. Cole; he asked where Jesse was, meaning his wife - I said she was safe, and he said he would give himself up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What time was this? A. At dinner time - Mrs. Cole cried out, "Mr. Cleal, I am robbed!" and then she came down stairs; you came down stairs very fast, two stairs at a time - my door was open - I was sitting at the window; I had blinds to my window - I did not see you pass the window; I saw him pass my door; I knew him by his footstep and his dress - he had a kind of dirty striped trousers on - I saw him go down eight or nine steps; I believe the things were in the basket in his room; the tea things were on the table: I did not state at the office that my little boy was sitting at the door, that I asked him who passed, and he said Mr. Turner - I say distinctly, I saw the prisoner pass; I did not see any thing in his hand: he was standing still, or walking gently, when I took him: I said to him, "Turner, what have you been doing?" he said, "Where is Jesse?" I said, "She is safe;" he said,"I suspected she was in Tothill-fields;" he said, "Then I will deliver myself up, as she is innocent."</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 3d of October I was sent for to No. 10, Marsham-street; I went into Coles' room, and saw a door broken through, which led into the prisoner's room - there is a kind of closet and a sort of door which divides the two rooms; I went into the prisoner's room, and Mrs. Cole said, "This is my basket, with the things in it:" I saw a hammer and this chisel and pinchers at the place where the breakage was; the chisel fits the marks on the boards: on taking him to Newgate, the prisoner said he was guilty of breaking into the room, but had not taken any property but what was in his room - that there was no money, and Mrs. Cole had made a mistake.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Which room did you go into first? A. Yours; I found the place open, and a little child had been in the room; your mother said these tools were what she had lent you - I have compared the chisel with the marks on the drawers; I found this property in the basket, as it is now - he said he had broken in the room, but conveyed no property away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It appears to me a very strange thing that the witness states that he had plenty of time to see me pass, and I had no bundle; now, according to the evidence, there is two pairs of sheets, four pillow-cases, four towels, and some other things, and it would have taken a large handkerchief to have tied them in; and how is it possible they should be conveyed away without his seeing them? and again, she accused me of taking eighteen shillings and nine sixpences, and now states that there was but 22s. in all.</p>
               <p>The prisoner then handed in a written paper, stating that the prosecutrix had several times made some very unpleasant insinuations against him, and acknowledging that he had broken into the room, and taken the property found in his room, but nothing more, intending to return it in a few days to surprise her; that immediately she came home, he repented of his folly, and being unable to return them without being seen, he absconded, but afterwards resolved on surrendering himself; and denying any felonious intent.</p>

            . I live in Eagle-court, Clerkenwell. On the evening of the 21st of September I was in the street, hearing a song; the prisoner came up. and asked me to sell some brass for him; he took me to Sutton-street, and said if I would go and sell it he would give me 6d. I went, by his direction, to Harcourt's - he went round the corner while I knocked and asked what they gave for brass - they said they would not buy it by candle-light - I went and told him; he then went to the house himself: I waited about five minutes - he did not come out - I went home, and put the brass behind a water-butt; I told nobody about it - my mother got up at half-past five o'clock; I got up, and was going out at the same time. I took the brass out, not knowing what to do with it; the watchman took hold of me, and asked what I was going to do with it; I was going to tell him, but he took me to the watch-house; and I there told all about it, and showed where he had told me to sell it; we went in there, and they gave us a direction; we went near Oxford-street, and found the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Nobody interrupted you when you went to sell it? A. No. I hid the brass because my mother would ask where I got it, and beat me perhaps. I told the watchman I was going to my master's, in Red Lion-street; I have no master there, but the prisoner told me to say so if any one spoke to me - I did not suspect any thing.</p>

I stopped Tyrrell with the bag of brass - I knew him, but know nothing against him; he said he was going to Red Lion-street, but I said he was going from there; he then said, "I mean Red Lion-street, Holborn."

            . I am an officer of the City. I went with Forrester to get a warrant backed, and then we went with Morris, of Bow-street, to the prisoner's house, in Monmouth-street, on the 18th of September; the prisoner was at home; I told him to open his drawers, and he did so; they were in the back room; a gentleman said that he wanted to find some broad cloth; we did not find any, but I found some silver of different descriptions - there were some watches and other things; he said they were his own property; we took the prisoner and plate to Bow-street, and Sir Richard Birnie remanded him; the prisoner is a general-dealer, in the clothes line.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you demanded the key of the drawer, did he put his hand into his pocket and take it out without hesitation? A. Yes; I understand the Magistrates have given him back the principal part of the plate; I said, when I saw the plate, "This looks suspicious;" I took the prisoner into custody at the time - he could not have run away if he liked - he made no such attempt - but I had my eye on him; Sir Richard Birnie said he would admit him to bail - very little of the plate was claimed: I know the manner of the Jews very well; I believe that the 22d of September is their new year's day - I know that on holydays they like to make a great display of plate; I never saw any thing more fair and honest than the prisoner's conduct on the occasion.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the plate exposed for sale? A. No; there were a great many new clothes in the shop; some of the plate was marked, and some not.</p>

I lost the property stated in the indictment on the night of the 16th of September - I went to bed at ten o'clock, when the house was secure; but some persons entered during the night; we were frightened, and gave an alarm - they entered the front bed chamber window, by meads of a ladder. I got up about two o'clock, because I heard a noise - the thieves were in the house at the time, but went away when the alarm was given. Among the articles taken were those now produced, which I saw at Bow-street on Monday, the 24th of September; it was on a Sunday night they broke in; I do not know any thing of the prisoner; there was a spoon, a gold watch, a brooch, and other things taken, which I have not seen since; they were in my bed-chamber. This is old family plate, and has my initials on it now.</p>

Yes; the prisoner opened the drawers, which was a place where I should expect to have found plate for family use; I dare say there was ten or fifteen times as much plate as this in value; excepting the articles in the indictments it has all been returned. We asked him how he came by it; he said, "I either purchased it, or got it in exchange;" it was exposed in the drawers; there was no concealment whatever.</p>

The prisoner had been in my service nearly three months; the money was taken out of a private drawer; the officer found a sovereign on her - I never had suspicion of her before, but I had lost money. On the night in question I heard the keys of my private drawer rattle - I was in the bar, and looked back; I saw her hand in the drawer, which was half open; in this drawer I keep my purse and brewer's books; I drew her away, and asked what business she had there - she then put her hand into her bosom, and pulled up her gown. I said to my wife, "She has robbed me, and put something into her bosom;" the prisoner said she would not be searched except by an officer; the officer did search her afterwards, and a sovereign dropped from her clothes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you see the sovereign drop from her person? A. No - the room is carpeted where she was searched; it was possible for the sovereign to drop without being heard or seen. I never said I saw it drop; she said she had only half a crown, which her sister gave her. When the sovereign fell she said, "There it is;" the bar in size is four yards by six yards; no person was in the bar but the prisoner and me; she was about six feet from me when she rattled the keys.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. My husband has spoken the truth about the sovereign; the prisoner refused to go up stairs at first, but said she would follow me; I took her to my room - when I said, "For God's sake, let me see what you have got in your bosom, and tell me the truth, and you shall not be hurt;" she said she would not be searched by a woman, but if an officer would come she would strip naked; when he did come she stripped very indecently; she was not left a moment after the robbery, before the officer came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not your husband very passionate at the time? A. Yes - I never quitted her; during the time we were in the room she had a nap - she had taken a little liquor, and was dosey; she had been out to buy butter that day, which is kept in a safe on the stairs, and not in the bar; it was a silk purse, with a snap, from which she took the money; the drawer was locked, but the keys were in it.</p>

            . I am an upholsterer. I went to Mr. Hopkins' shop, No. 60, Shoreditch, between the 5th and 11th of July - I cannot tell the day - the prisoner attended to me there; I bought of him four pieces of chintz, and ninety yards of bordcring; I had selected them nearly a week before, in his presence, and under his direction; I told him to lay them by for me, and when I went again he produced them; I asked him for a piece of striped chintz; he got the key, and went up stairs at No. 62, which also belongs to Mr. Hopkins; I there chose one piece, and brought it down; I was to give 18s. for it; he made me out this bill (looking at it) - it is in pencil, but the same writing is on it as when he gave it to me; he made out no other bill that I saw - the three pieces of chintz were 1l. each, and the fourth 18s.; I bought a piece of brown holland for 25s., being 6l. 3s. together; I paid him six sovereigns and three shilliags; these remnants are part of the chintz; I afterwards went there again to purchase more of the same; I did not see Mr. Hopkins, but in consequence of my going there again he came to my house, and I showed him the bill.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Have you any receipt? A. No; I swear this did not happen before the 1st of July - there is no date on the bill; my attention was not called to it before September; I did not at first recollect when it was, till I looked at some documents - here is one of them - it is a bill which I sent with some goods - it is dated the 9th of July, and is for a couch, which I covered with some of the chintz; I swear the purchase was before the 1st of July, without referring to any thing - the couch was made all but the chintz.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you certain it was after the 1st of July? A. I have no doubt of it whatever.</p>

The prisoner was in my service about fourteen months; I discharged him in August, as I took stock then, and found a deficiency of about 500l. - it was his business to attend in the shop, and sell goods; we have private marks on the goods to denote the price; when he sells goods, it is his duty to make out a bill, and give it to the next young man to sign with a letter - each shopman has a letter to describe him - the prisoner's letter was P; he was also to make out a cheque, and take to the desk to deliver with the money to the cashier, who receives the money, enters it in a book, and files the cheque; the prisoner also had a small book, in which he should enter the cheque - he left his cheque-book with me when he went away in August. In consequence of information from Jones I examined his cheque-book from the 5th to the 11th of July - here are entries, but none of 6l. 3s.; the bill produced is his hand-writing - there is no letter on it to denote its having been examined by another; I have my cash-book, which is balanced every night by the cashier; the shopmen then call over their own books, and if that differs from the cash-book, reference is made to the cheque file; there was no mistake of 6l. 3s. at this time; Jones produced some chintz to me - I saw the mark on it - the three pieces should have been sold for 35s. each - they cost me 31s.; the striped chintz should have been 37s. 4d. a piece - he bought them at three guineas less than the original cost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You keep several men? A. Yes; each man has his own department; as soon as they write a cheque they take it with the money to the desk; they always take them singly, not five or six together.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If another customer comes in and takes his attention, may he not sell again, and make another cheque? A. No; he puts down the amount immediately, and goes to the desk with it - I never knew such a thing happen; the desk is not six yards off - I never knew a cheque dropped; one transaction is always settled first.</p>

            . I keep the Pickled Egg. The prisoner and prosecutor came to my house, and had a pot of porter and two quarterns of gin; they called for more gin, but had no money to pay for it; they called for more gin, soon get money; she went out, and came back again twice; before she went out the second time I went into the parlour, and took the prosecutors's pack up stairs, as he was not able to mind it; he came into the tap-room soon after, and pulled off his hat - he said he had lost two handkerchiefs, and accused me of robbing him; I said, "I don't think you have been robbed at all - you have got two handkerchiefs in your hat now;" he said, "Yes, but there should be four;" I said, "If you have been robbed I can find the woman who was with you." I went out, received information from one Moore, and went to a pawnbroker's in Wardour-street- I found some property, and in about an hour I found the prisoner in the street, close by my house; Kelly did not then know that he had lost more than two handkerchiefs; I went home and asked if he had lost any thing else - he then described the other handkerchief and shawl.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were not they drunk? A. Yes; Kelly was turned out of the office that night, because he was drunk; the prisoner might be the worse for liquor; she said she had done nothing with the handkerchiefs. she went out at first between five and six o'clock; she was sober then.</p>

               <p>Prisoner JAMES. Q. Was the door open when you saw me take the coats? A. The door was a-jar - I was going to a job, and a coffee-woman, at the corner, sent me to tell the gentleman.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why not tell the gentleman sooner? A. My master was coming up the grove, and he hallooed to me - I saw Morris walk down the street with James; he walked to the bottom of Church-street, and then walked very fast.</p>
               <p>Prisoner JAMES. Two weeks ago I saw that boy with two others; he stole a hat from the corner of Homer-street and Crawford-street - I know the man who wears the hat now - he bought it of him.</p>
               <p>Witness. I never stole a hat in my life, nor was I concerned in stealing one; I was never at the shop he mentions; I was once taken up for breaking windows, but was discharged; I was never in the House of Correction.</p>

Yes, among several others; he at first said he believed one was his master's, by the rings on the neck- he said he could not speak to the others; he hesitated about the brown one; he did not select them - I pointed them out.</p>

This rope was removed two or three yards - a large bale of rope had been divided into three parts; they entered the warehouse through a bulk-hole in the top of the warehouse: my mother and the servant were watching, in consequence of our having been robbed shortly before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What did you strike him with? A. A stick - no one else struck him in my presence; my brother had some weapon in his hand, I think it was a stick - I dropped the poker; my brother did not strike him to my knowledge - I have not brought the stick here - it was about the size of my two fingers: I struck him once when he was down.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did not this occur in the dark? A. Yes; I was in danger of my life - I did not know who was there; I did not strike at him before the light was out.</p>

               <p>EDWARD JACKSON. I live in Brick-lane. I was in Old-street on the night of the 23d of September, and met the prisoner, who was a stranger; she asked me to give her something to drink- I took her to a public-house, and gave her something; we came out, and she accompanied me on my road home; I may have gone into another house with her, but think not; I was sober. We went to an oyster-shop, and called for some, but eat none, for I found her hand in my breeches pocket - she took out six sovereigns and three half-sovereigns. I seized her left-hand, and half a sovereign fell out; I looked at my money, and I was six sovereigns and two half-sovereigns short; when I accused her of it she said, "Come into the passage, and I will give you back your money;" I did so, and she gave me three sovereigns- while we were there some woman passed, who saw her take my pin from my bosom - she said to her, "Why don't you give the man his money." I then gave her in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Did you not first go to the Grapes public-house? A. I do not know the sign. I might go to the Angel public-house, in the City-road, but do not recollect it. I had two glasses of gin at one house, and had had two pots of half and half with two friends before I met her; she took me to a house in White Lion-street, and wanted me to go there, but I would not go in - she then asked me to take her to the oyster-shop- I drank nothing there; I lost no silver. I do not recollect going to any other houses.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you not fall down in the oyster-shop? A. I do not know. I left my friends between eight and nine o'clock.</p>

Bank-notes, in my pocket - I had been paid off the day before - my money was in a purse in my breast-pocket - they were all safe in the afternoon; when I came out of a public-house, about nine o'clock at night, I met four women - my money was safe then - they said they would take me home - they were leading me home - the prisoners were walking after me - there were more men; the women and men appeared to know each other - the two prisoners laid hold of me; I am sure of that; they made a stop opposite Old Gravel-lane - the woman ran her hand into my bosom - I thought to catch hold of her, but one of the prisoner's laid hold of me across my breast, and the other took hold of my arm - they both held me, and asked me what was amiss - they then gave me a shove into the highway, and ran off the same way as the woman had. I felt her take the purse while they held me - it was on Saturday, the 24th or 25th of August - I went home, and gave information on the Monday or Tuesday - I have not found my money.</p>

I had a share of four or five pots of beer - some people sat there - I treated them all as they came in - I was sober enough to walk straight, and know what I was doing - I had seven sovereigns and some silver besides - I know it was safe when I came out of the public-house - I had received it at Somerset-house - I know Catherine White - I had gone out with her between 5 and 6 o'clock - she drank nothing that I know of - I had some beer and a glass of gin or so - I recollect changing a sovereign to pay for liquor while she was with me - a quarrel arose in the house - I took off my jacket, and gave it to her to take care of - she returned it to me - the prisoners followed me all the way from the house - I looked over my shoulder and saw them - the purse was between my shirt and Guernsey frock - I called out that I had been robbed - the prisoners took hold of me the moment the girl took the money - she was convicted last Session.</p>

On the 1st of October, at nine o'clock at night, I met a man in Dorkin's-court, Shoreditch, with two bolts of canvass; this was two miles from Dunbar's - I watched the man into the prisoner's house with it, but I do not believe the prisoner is the man who carried it - I fetched the officer, and we waited some time- we saw a light in the cellar, and I saw the prisoner there; before I went for the officer I saw two persons leave the house, and go round by the coach-yard - the prisoner was not one of them.</p>

             - we met the three prisoners and several more persons with them; when I came up to them, Herring said to me, "You are a bl-y nose;" I had known him for four or five years, but was never in his company that I know of; I once sat in a public-house where he was, some years ago; I asked what he meant by that - he up with his fist, and knocked me down into the kennel; the other prisoners were there at the time - it was a violent blow, and knocked two of my teeth out; Bulpit said, as I laid in the kennel, "Now, Bill, chib the b-r," and Cuttle snatched my seals, and broke the ribbon; he did did not get them, as Crispin caught his hand, and he dropped them; he broke the ribbon - I went to rise up, and Herring kicked me, so that I was scarcely able to rise from the ground; Cuttle ran towards Tower-hill, and Herring ran down Gravel-lane; they all ran away - Crispin followed Herring, and I got after her, into Pennington-street, where she was holding him by the neck-handkerchief, and he was knocking her about the head - we called the watchman, who came up, and took him; the gang came round me again; the watchman gave Herring to another watchman, and he took me to the watch-house - I saw Herring and Bulpit at the watch-house; Herring came and took hold of my hand, and said, "For God's sake, forgive me - I have done wrong;" I said I would not. I afterwards met the officer, who told me to come to the Thames Police-office on Monday; I said at the watch-house, that I had been robbed and almost murdered.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Does Crispin pass as Mrs. Watts? A. No - I swear that; we had had a pot of half and half between us. I saw Cartwright that night at the watch-house - I did not offer to make it up with Herring; I was bleeding. I was never in prison, or before a Magistrate, I have known Bulpit five years, but was never in her company.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, in the presence of Cartwright, offer to make friends with one of the prisoners? A. No.</p>

               <p>ELIZA CRISPIN. On the night in question Watts and I were going home, and met the prisoners and several others; on coming up to them Herring stepped of the pavement, called Watts a nose, and struck him; he fell on the ground; he kicked him in the mouth and several other places; Bulpit said, "Go it, Bill, chib him;" Cuttle then laid hold of his seals; I went to see what he was doing - he broke the ribbon, but did not get them; they all ran off; I pursued Herring, and kept hold of him till the watchman came; he was beating me about the head; Watts came up - I heard Herring say to him, "For God's sake, George, forgive me - don't give charge of me to night - take a warrant on Monday morning;" the watchman came up, and took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Watts sober? A. Yes; we had had two pints of half and half; I live with him as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250079"/>his wife; I have gone by his name. I do not know whether he has heard me called Mrs. Watts; I was never tried any where. I was not in the watch-house myself.</p>

            . I am an officer of St. George's in the East, and have been an officer twenty years. The parties were brought into the watch-house for fighting in the street; both Watts and Herring were very much in liquor - their faces were both very bloody, I am certain; they called one another Bill and George; Watts said, "You had no right to strike me;" they shook hands and walked out of the watch-house: I was afterwards sent for by the Magistrate, to know why I dismissed the case; but they made it up themselves before any charge was booked.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see Swinglam? A. Yes - but nothing was said about a robbery; I did not hear of that for four or five days after, when he came and said, "Those persons should not have been discharged - they were accused of a robbery;" I heard Herring ask Watts to forgive him- Watts said, "I will not be served in this way."</p>
               <p>Q. If they had only been fighting, why should he ask forgiveness? A. He asked him to make it up, which he did; Herring said, "We will go and have a pot of beer;" if a robbery had been mentioned, I should have taken the charge; I know nothing of either of them; several persons rushed into the watch-house - there might be a dozen there.</p>
               <p>JOHN SWINGLAM re-examined. When I took Herring, somebody said, "He shan't take him to the watch-house tonight;" I took him there, but was sent out before the case was discharged; I heard that they had shook hands and settled it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HERRING. I was coming along, and saw the prosecutor ill-using Cuttle, who was a stranger to me I said, "George, don't ill-use him;" he turned round, and struck me in the mouth; I said, "If you strike me I will strike you;" he said, "I'll fight you for 1l.;" I struck him in my own defence - I had been to market with my wife.</p>
               <p>GEORGE WATTS. I had not struck him at all - I never quarrelled with him in my life; I did not shake hands with him in the watch-house; he came, caught hold of me, and said, "Forgive me:" I said, "How can I? you came to rob me, and I know you have been a thief for years."</p>

            . I am an officer. I found the prisoner at a house in Backchurch-lane, which I was searching for stolen property; he came in - I asked him about these boots; he said they were made for his sister; we have not found them - I was told the prosecutor had taken 10s. 6d. not to prosecute.</p>
               <p>JOHN BRIGHTWELL re-examined. I took the case before the Magistrate. I saw the prisoner take the shoes, as I returned from the public-house; he passed me on the stairs with them - I heard them rattle in his hand, and asked where he was going; he went out, and I followed, but a person stopped me from pursuing - I gave information - I caught a glimpse of them in his hand - his friends came to my mother's house, after the first examination, and gave 10s. 6d. - I wished to make it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My sister was measured for these boots; they were to be done on Saturday night - I went and asked if they were done; they said Yes; I said,"Give them to me, and meet me at Coats', in Whitechapel;" but he did not - I went to him; he was gone to bed, but got up, and we went and had some drink; he then let me have them; here his receipt for the 10s. 6d.; he told me not to let his father know, as he had made them unknown to him.</p>
               <p>JOHN BRIGHTWELL. This receipt is my writing - I wished to make it up, but the Magistrate would persevere;</p>

            . I was in Brick-lane, and saw the two prisoners (whom I knew), coming along with Starkey, who appeared very drunk - they were coming up towards me - Graham on his right hand, and Stone on his left - they went a few yards beyond me, on the other side of the way - I looked to see what they were going to do, and saw Graham pinion the prosecutor's arms - Stone drew out the watch, and drew it up his own sleeve with a jerk - he passed on directly from the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you gave an alarm? A. Yes; I alarmed my brother, and called to a man who came out of the Hare public-house - I particularly noticed Stone - he passed three or four lights, with his face towards me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. I keep a fruit-stall at the corner of King-street, Brick-lane, which is less than twenty yards from where the robbery was committed - I had come from my stall to the other side of the way - I told a man, who came out to take the prosecutor from the door - it was half-past nine o'clock - the watch does not sit till ten - I went to the Hare to ask them if they knew the prosecutor - I knew the man who took it; I went next morning to the constable, and to Worship-street on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you often go to the Police-office? A. No; only when I have a call; I never applied there for employ; the prisoners ran different ways; I saw Stone about a fortnight after, and Graham two days after.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not send for an officer and have them taken? A. There are such dreadful characters about there, if a man dare to interfere, he would be crushed under foot; Graham had a white jacket on; I did not notice whether he had a hat or cap on; my brother was against the public-house.</p>

            . I am a porter and watchman, and have known the prosecutor some years; I was present the night he was robbed; I saw two persons near him, one of them had a light jacket on, that was not Graham; he is a head taller than that man; (I lodge at the Hare) I said to them, "Where are you going to take this man?" they said, "Home;" I said, "Do you know where he lives?" one said, "Yes, next door to the Sugar Loaves public-house;" I said I would see him home; they then went away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see him robbed? A. No; he said he was robbed; he turned round, and said to another gentleman, "That is the person who robbed me;" I saw neither of the prisoners there; a young man and a lad were leading him; when I spoke, the tall young man let go; he said immediately that he was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not take these men? A. Because he at first said it was another man - I knew Graham before, and if he had been there I should have seen him. I have been a watchman nine years.</p>

I remember the night this gentleman said he was robbed; I saw Graham that night, sitting in our tap-room; he had a black coat and black handkerchief on - I went out with beer that night, and saw the prosecutor tipsy; the prisoners at that time were both in our house, and they were not the men who had hold of him.</p>

On the 5th of September, about ten o'clock in the evening I saw my harness in the cow-house; I missed it about six o'clock next morning. I saw the witness Hills on a Saturday, about a fortnight after, and went to the prisoner Cane's shop, in about three hours after that - he keeps a shop next door to the Cherry Tree public-house, Kingsland-road - it is a sort of harness shop, and he deals in marine-stores. Cane was in the shop - I asked if he could suit me with a good second-hand harness; he said he might, but it wanted looking out; I said if he could I should feel obliged; he asked where I lived; I said, at Enfield-highway, and I would call again - he asked when- I said in a week or two, or perhaps next week. I went again on the Monday, and asked if he had got it - he said, "Are you the young man that lives at Enfield-highway?" I said Yes - he then showed me one saddle, and asked if that would suit me; I said No; he showed me two more, to which I objected; he then showed me my own - I immediately recognised it, but the four W's were taken off, and four brass-plates put on in their places; there was no other alteration in it; I saw a friend pass, and said, "There is a friend I want to speak to" - I went and told him to send me an officer - I waited in the shop; two officers came: I said, "I want you to take charge of this, which I lost about a month ago" - and said to Cane, "You may as well fetch up all, it will make it better for you;" he then brought up all except the reins; I asked how much he might give for it; he said 12s., and that he had bought it of two young men whom he did not know; he had said he should expect about 2l. of me for the set of harness; the reins were found behind a door, which divides the shop from the parlour; he was then taken in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who is Hills? A. He is ostler at the Thatched House, Islington. I told him if he could do any thing in it I should be obliged; I knew him from having formerly lived next door to him for seventeen years; I thought he might get information, as he lived near town - I applied to every body to look out; I said I would give him a sovereign if he could get it, as I knew Camplin was a noted thief, and I suspected him; I did not give him the sovereign; it depends on how he swears to day; if I get my harness back I will pay him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell him the result of the trial depended on his fixing the guilt on one of these parties? A. No - he is the only witness against Camplin; he knows I shall not pay him unless I get it back.</p>
               <p>Q. Unless he does the business well to day, he will not get the sovereign? A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Cane showed you several saddles? A. Yes. I found all my harness there - it is common to hang reins behind a door; I have not found the four W's - I did not lose the collar.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You did not care about it? A.

On the morning of the 6th of September, in consequence of the report of my men, I went to the malt-house without an officer, and then went for an officer - I found the window looking into the skittle-ground had two or three iron-bars removed from it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250085"/>and a sufficient aperture made for a man to enter - the bulk of the malt was diminished to the amount of about forty quarters - the door leading to the river was in the same state as before. I afterwards went with the officer to search for the malt, to a place up the river, called the Broom-house dock, which is about half a mile on this side of Fulham-bridge, on the Middlesex side - it is between two and three miles from our premises - on arriving there, we saw some malt close to a wall near the river - it was scattered about, apparently as if dropped from sacks which had been pitched there, before they had been put into carts, as I suppose - it was near the Thames. I picked up some of it; it is in the possession of the officer - I have a sample taken from the bulk of the malt. I saw the prisoner Richard Parsons at Battersea that day, after I had been to the dock - there were several watermen there - he came forward alone, and the officer who was with me took him; he was taken to our counting-house - he said something to the officer when he was taken, which I did not hear. I asked him, at the counting-house, where he had been the preceeding day - he said he had been to one public-house only, which was the Yorkshire-grey. I desired him to recollect himself - he then mentioned three other public-houses, but omitted the Swan. I recollect one house was the Cricketers - I afterwards asked if he had been to Dodson's house, (who keeps the Swan) - he said he did not know the house. I again asked him, and after considerable hesitation and prevarication, he admitted that he did know Dodson's, and that he had been there - he was then taken on board the Police-ship. On the following day I continued my search, in company with another officer; we were going along the Fulham-road, and arrived at Mr. Poole's malt-house, which is about a mile and a half or two miles from the Broom-house dock; there is a road from the dock to Poole's malt-house. I knocked at the door of Poole's malt-house, but it was not opened; the flap of a window was suddenly raised, and then let fall again, as soon as I knocked at the door - the malt-house door was not opened to me. I then went to Mr. Poole's private residence, and Mr. Poole accompanied me to the malt-house; he had no key - he went to the neighbouring house, to the wife of Jefferies - there is a communication from that house to the malt-house. I did not go through - Mr. Poole went through, and opened the malt-house door to me; I then went in, and there were nine sacks of malt unground, and one sack ground. I cannot say whether any name was on the sacks - (my malt was all unground) - the malt was all removed to our premises. I believe the malt found there to be ours, and part of what we lost - neither Mr. Poole or any body attempted to hinder me from moving it. I saw a woman in the house adjoining the malt-house - she said she was Jefferies's wife; about an hour after I discovered the malt I found Thomas Parsons in custody in the Fulham-road, in a gig, being conveyed to our counting-house; he was taken there, but nothing passed in my presence - the value of the malt stolen is about 120l. I have been experienced in grain this seven or eight years; I was not entirely bred up to the trade. I have seen the samples of malt which are here, and compared them with the bulk; they appear to be the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Your father is one of your partners? A. Yes; his name is John, only; the door of our premises appeared the same as the night before - the malt could have been moved to where we found it by land, in carts; there were three or four other watermen with Richard Parsons; I do not know that he made use of any expression; he advanced towards us; I did not tell Richard Parsons what he said would be used against him, or that he need not say any thing without he liked; I saw Thomas Parsons in the gig, in custody - that was a quarter of a mile from the malt-house; I know nothing of his previous habits; my father is not here; I heard nothing pass between him, and any one else; the officer was not present when I questioned Richard Parsons.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Was there room for a person to have got the malt through the window into the skettle-ground, and from there to the water? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How was the door? A. It is fastened by a lock and two bolts; I am told by my servant that it was locked and bolted that night - I did not notice it myself - the end of the skittle-ground comes down to the Thames.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police surveyor. I was stationed on board the Thams Police-ship, off Arundel-stairs, Strand; on the 6th of September I went to Mr. Lyall's, Chelsea; I went to the malt-house, and saw a wire window, which looks into the skittle-ground of the Old Swan, had been bent inwards, so as to admit a person in; we then went down to the river - there were two or three carts there; I then went into a punt, which laid just off the door of the malt-house; I could step from the door to the punt; it is a cabin-punt, and there were muddy foot-marks on the top of the cabin; I stepped from the door to the punt gunwale without treading on the bank; there was one naked foot-mark very plain on the punt cabin, and some marks of feet in the mud; there is a cause way from there to the skittle-ground of the Old Swan; I then went up the river, with Mr. Lyall, in search of the malt; I saw Dawson, a lighterman, and from what he said, I went to a wall, close by the water side, and there picked up some malt, near to Broom-house dock; I have preserved it; I then went to Chelsea, landed Mr. Lyall, and then went in search of a barge, of which I had received information; I found it, and went on board - the name of "Waight, Chelsea," was on it; the oars were locked - it was at Mr. Batcock's wharf, near Cheyne-walk-terrace, about one hundred yards from Mr. Lyall's; I found under the head-sheets some loose malt, which appeared to have fallen through the cracks; I took it up, and have it here; while I was in the barge I received more information, and went in search of Richard Parsons; I found him, and took him; I asked if he had the key of Waight's punt; he said No; I asked if he had not borrowed her yesterday; he said Yes, he had borrowed her, and shifted her out of the hole where she laid afloat; I then asked if it was not to do a job for Mr. Mead; he said No, that when he came back after shifting the punt, the person, who hired him, told him he did not want him to do the job; he said the person was a stranger to him; I asked if he knew where he lived; he said No; he said he believed he lived at the top of the hill, but he did not know where; I took him at Battersea; there is a Mr. Mead, a colourman, who has some water-side premises there; I asked him what he was to have done; he said to fetch some wood up from Milbank, he believed: I took him, and said if he would come up to Waight, he would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250086"/>hear some more, but Weight was gone up the river; I then took him to Lyall's; I went to Chelsea, and took Thomas Parsons; I afterwards went into Richard Parsons' boat, and found a small quantity of malt under the burthen-boards, which are boards used to step upon when the barge is loaded; I then went to Thomas Parsons' boat, which laid aground alongside the causeway at Battersea; I there found nearly the same quantity of malt, at the bottom of the boat - I have preserved all those different parcels of malt, and have them here - their names were on their boats; I then returned to Mr. Lyall's, and, as Waight had not returned from Richmond, I took Richard Parsons on board the Police-ship, and left him in chage of Mitchell, the officer. I went next day, with Mr. Lyall, to Mr. Poole's malt-house; I left Mr. Lyall there, and returned to the Broom-house; I then went to Battersea, and on returning, in a gig, Thomas Parsons was pointed out to me by Bell; he was a good deal in liquor, and had a girl under his arm - he was not above five minutes walk from Poole's; we took him to Mr. Lyall's counting-house; when we had been there about an hour, he got a little sober, and I asked what he was doing at Fulham; he said he had been to Jefferies' to inquire about his brother Dick, that his mother gave him 6s. to take to him, and he meant to spend one of them before he took it; he then said, without my asking him any question, "As to Wednesday night, I slept at home." I had not then told him what I took him for; I said,"Where did you sleep on Thursday night?" he said, "I slept at home also:" he then jumped up, took a pen, and said, "No, I did not sleep at home; but, if you will give me some ink, I'll tell you where I did sleep - I slept with that girl you took me away from:" before the ink could be fetched, he hove down the pen, and said, "No, I shall tell you nothing about it - you may find it out." Mitchell afterwards came there with some malt in a cart; Thomas Parsons then began crying, and I came away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been a surveyor? A. About twelve months - I have been a constable nearly ten years - there were three examinations before the Magistrate; the prisoners were present at them all.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you say one word about the asked foot-mark to the Magistrate? A. I was never asked it - I do not know that I did mention it - I did not mention that I asked Richard for the key, not that he had said he borrowed the punt, and set her afloat - I said I asked him if it was to do a job for Mead - I did not state he said it was to fetch wood, nor that he said he did not know where the man lived - I was not asked about it - I did not tell him he need not answer questions without he liked, nor that it would be used against him; I did not caution him - my deposition was taken by the clerk, and read over to me, in the presence of the prisoners and the Magistrate - I stated what I was asked - it was but a short deposition - I think I stated to the Magistrate that I asked Thomas Parsons what he had been doing at Fulham - I did say he told me he had been at Jefferies' to inquire for his brother Dick - I think what I said was taken down - I did not tell Thomas Parsons he need not answer any questions without he liked, or that it might be used against him - I supposed it might - I will not swear whether I told the Magistrate he had said he slept at home on Wednesday night.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, was not the man drunk when he answered? A. He was, but he had got a good deal soberer than at first - I cannot say he was drunk; he knew what he was talking about - I did not state about his taking up a pen to write - my deposition was taken very short - I will not say that I stated he said he had slept with the girl, or his afterwards refusing to write any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, was he not at the time he was crying beastly drunk? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is this deposition signed by you? A. Yes, it is signed by me - there were three examinations.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the greater part of these three days' examinations occupied with other persons than the prisoners? A. Yes, three other persons were indicted with the prisoners - one person was there who had part of the malt in his possession, for I was examined about that affair.</p>
               <p>The witness' deposition being read, did not in any degree differ from his evidence, except that it was not given so fully.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police surveyer. On the 6th of September I was on board the Police-ship off Arundel-stairs - late that evening I saw Richard Parsons on board, in the hold, but I was not there when he was brought on board; when I saw him he was asleep - there was no other person there - I overhauled his shoes, which were off, and the only shoes there; and found this grain of malt in one of them (producing it) - I awoke him, and asked if he had been at work among any corn - he said No - I said "There is a grain of corn in your shoes - do you know how it came there?" he said he did not know, without it had been put there. On the following day I went with Lyall and Isbester to the Fulham road - I left Mr. Lyall at Poole's malt-house, and I want on to the Broom-house - Mr. Lyall came and fetched me back - I went into Poole's malt-house, and found nine sacks of malt unground, and one sack below ground - Poole's name was on all the sacks - after the malt was found I was left in charge of it till the dray came, and while there I saw Thomas Parsons, walking backwards and forwards, opposite Poole's malt-house, in company with a woman - I did not then know him - I afterwards saw him in Isbester's custody in the house, and recognized him as the person I had before seen with the girl - I went that evening to Walham-green, and there took two men, named Lake and Evans, into custody - I found two carts in Lake's shed with some grains of malt at the bottom of them - Bell, who was with me, took them - I took Lake before the Magistrate, and from what he said I went to a man named Higgs, at Pimlico, and found twenty-seven quarters and a half of malt, which I have now in my possession - I saw Thomas Parsons at Mr. Lyall's counting-house the same evening; he certainly was not sober - I had brought the malt there from Poole's - Thomas Parsons said he wished to speak to the elder Mr. Lyall, who took him up stairs, and I followed them - Mr. Lyall asked what he wished to say to him, and he said, "Oh, my poor brother, my poor brother! I do not care for myself, but for his wife and family" - he was not sober certainly - he was not beastly drunk - I will not swear it, but I think he knew what he said.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you carry away Poole's sacks as well as the grain? A. I did; there was no malt but that I brought away.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it had been mixed with any other malt you cannot tell? A. No; Thomas Parsons was not cautioned before he said any thing.</p>

            . I am a waterman. On the night of the 6th of September I went up with half a score of coals to Broom-house dock - I got up there at one o'clock in the morning; the water was not high enough for me to get into the dock; I laid-too, and a barge came dropping up; I hurried, for fear it should get before me - there was the name of Waight or Wick, or some such name, and "Chelsea," on it - there was one man in her; I did not see him using any oars - he appeared to me to be using a staff to get round the bank, there were some sacks in her: it came into the dock - there was room for us both: I said to the man,"Fellow-servant, are you going to unload here?" there was another man sitting on the bank - I cannot say whether either of the prisoners were the men; I saw a wherry pulling over from Wandsworth, with two men sitting in her and one rowing - they landed on the causeway; they were close to the punt; I did not see them do any thing, or say any thing - it was then between two and three o'clock; I saw three sacks carried out of the punt, and placed against a wall - what they contained I do not know; I afterwards saw a punt in the possession of the officer, and have not the least doubt of its being the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever say they appeared to be tall men, six feet high? A. I said they appeared less than six feet; they appeared to be taller than the prisoners.</p>

            . I am a lighterman, and work on the Thames. I was out in the night between the 5th and 6th of September, walking along the Cheyne-walk, near Battersea-bridge, about two o'clock in the morning; I saw Waight's punt go up the river, from London, towards Battersea-bridge - it went through the third or fourth arch; I knew the punt before; I saw a person towing her up in a wherry - I think I saw some sacks in the punt; it was a hazey morning; the person in the wherry looked like Richard Parsons, but I cannot swear it was him; I speak from his rowing; I cannot swear it was him, or form any judgment about him. I know Lyall's brewery - it was going from the brewery, towards Broom-house dock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far were you from it? A. I might be from eighty to one hundred yards; I cannot swear that it was Richard Parsons'; I knew them both as very honest men.</p>

            . I produce the malt found on the ground at Broom-house dock, that found in Richard Parsons' wherry, and that found in Thomas Parsons' wherry.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. In what state was Richard Par<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250088"/>sons' wherry when you took it from there? A. The burthens were a little wet, but Thomas' was dryer.</p>
               <p>MR. LYALL. To the best of my belief these samples are parts of the same malt; this one grain is the same sort; malt is dried in different manners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How is it dried? A. In a kiln: we dry ours pale; all pale malt would have the same appearance, if dried from the same quality of barley; this has no particular appearance, except that it is pale; the single grain appears the same; all pale malt is similar, certainly - if it got wet at the bottom of the wherry it would be more difficult to distinguish while wet, but when it got dry it would resume its former state.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. One man's pale malt, made the same way, and dried with the same degree of heat, would appear like another man's? A. Yes; we had pale malt in our possession that night: this resembles ours in quality of grain and mode of manufacture, the spears not being suffered to grow very high.</p>

            . I am an agent to brewers and malt-factors, and have been so this thirty years, and have had great experience in the quality of malt. I have no doubt these samples are all of the same malt; the description of grain is the same, and the degree of heat appears the same: if I was in the market, and received one of these samples, I should have been satisfied to receive the rest.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you swear to that single grain? A. Certainly, from the circumstance of the working of this malt - malt is dried differently.</p>

On the 20th of October five soldiers came to the house together, about three o'clock - I served them with beer and ale, in the room up stairs; they had three pots of ale; they went out about four o'clock, all together; nobody else was there - I went up stairs, and saw one of them rise on his toes, to see who came in - I leaned on the bannisters, and looked over the room - I cannot swear that the prisoners are two of the men - I saw one man on each side of the table; they put something into their pockets and caps - I ran and told mistress; she said,"Give me the key, and I'll go and see" - I was not watching them all the time; it is a large room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did not you stop them? A. No; mistress left me in the bar.</p>

I saw the prisoner the same day, in Rosemary-lane - he saw me following him, and ran through some alleys: he was secured, and taken to the watch-house - I had not charged him with any thing. There was not another lodger in the house - nobody went up stairs while I was at breakfast.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went on the Sunday night with the prosecutor to the prisoner's room, but could not find her - I afterwards saw her in Old-street; she said, "Tweedy, I want to speak to you; I picked up a man, and went home with him - we were both drunk; I lost 9s. 6d., and he lost his watch - I don't know what became of either." I took her to the watch-house; she begged to be let go, declaring she had never seen the watch.</p>
               <p>JOHN JOHNSON. I was the worse for liquor - she was not drunk; she might be the worse for liquor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I sat on the chair with him, and afterwards on the bed; a young woman brought in a candle, and he gave her 1s. to buy liquor; I went to sleep, and in the morning found him in bed - I lost 12s.</p>

            . I am officer of Bow-street - the prosecutor applied to me, and about nine o'clock in the morning of the 22d of October, I saw Wright come out of their premises - I followed him from there into a court in the Old Bailey, opposite Newgate - I waited on the New<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250092"/>gate side, and saw him go into a house. I presently observed a woman come out with a jug and go to a wine-vaults - she went into the court again, and went into the same house. Wright came out and I followed him into Smithfield - I then went towards Fish and Collins', and met Mr. Collins. I then took Wright into custody, and took him to the watch-house; I found tobacco dust in his waistcoat and breeches pockets - I locked him up, and returned to the house in the court, and found Nightingale in a room up two pair of stairs. I said, "Nightingale, you have some tobacco here, which a man has just brought;" he said, no man had been there. I said, "Have you any tobacco in the house?" he said, "Yes," and shewed me a jar, with about one pound and a half in it. I said,"Is this all you have?" he said, "I have got a little more." I then went to the cupboard, and found about 3lbs. more, which was warm. I searched further, but found nothing more - I saw a jug on the table, with a little gin in it; it was like that which the woman had; I asked if he dealt in tobacco; he said Yes - I said, "Who do you buy it of?" he said of a man at Chelsea or Chelmsford; I do not know which. I asked for his permit - he said he had none - I asked if he was a retailer - he said Yes - I asked if he had a licence; he said No. I then took him in charge. Wright lodges in Coleman-street, St. Luke's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. How many houses are there in the court? A. Two or three I believe; it is called Green Harbour-court. I cannot say how many - my eye was only directed to one house; I stood about fifty yards off. I had a reason for not following him. Wright had a tobacco box in his pocket; I found 1s. on him; he had left the court five or seven minutes before I searched him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long have you been an officer? A. Some years. I live in Brick-lane; I was never in the court but once before; I think there are only two or three houses there. Wright had a blue coat, trousers, and an apron; I saw nothing about him; I do not think his coat was buttoned up; he might have tobacco about him, and I not see him. I have put the tobacco altogether; he could not have 3lbs. I think.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would not the greater part of it go into two large breeches pockets? A. I should think so; his apron hung down before him.</p>

On the morning of the 22d of October, I went with Keys to the house in the court in the Old Bailey, and saw Nightingale. Keys said, he had come for some tobacco, which he had just received - he said he had none, and that no man had been there; Keys said he must know of some which had just been brought; he then produced a small parcel. Keys said,"You have more than this;" he said "I have a little more," and then produced more in a jar; Keys said it was warm; I put my hand to it and found it so; we had been drying tobacco that morning, which would produce that sort of heat; we never send it out in that state; this tobacco is all alike, and I have no doubt of it being ours; I can tell it by the smell and flavour; I believe it to be ours; we manufactures by a peculiar process, and this is of a peculiar flavour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Will you swear that it came from your place? A. I have no doubt of it being ours. I examined it at the time; we sell large quantities; it does not adhere to the hands by being handled; the men usually wash their hands when they leave work; I have handled a good deal, but never found it come off my hands by putting into my pocket; a man might have a particle stick to his hands; we allow each man 11/2 ozs. every Saturday night; it is our practice to search our men, but it is not always done.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What is the name of this court? A. Littlewood-court I believe - there is only a few houses there; it leads down from the coach-stand - I was not present all the time Keys was talking to Nightingale; when Keys said it was warm, he said, "It is, because it stands near the fire;" it was not near enough to arquire that heat - I think I should have known it to be mine, if I had seen it any where promiscuously - Wright generally wears an apron.</p>
               <p>MR. QUIN. Q. How much might a person carry? A. I think he might carry 3 lbs. in his breeches, if his apron was down, without it being seen; except from being warm, that tobacco would be the same as the parcel.</p>
               <p>WRIGHT's Defence. I went out with a man named Clark that morning; if I had tobacco about me, the witness must have seen it.</p>
               <p>NIGHTINGALE's Defence. When they came to my house I showed the tobacco very readily - Mr. Collins was very rough; he took me by the shirt, and asked how I lost my arm; I told him in the field of honour abroad; he said I will now send you to the field of dishonour abroad. The fact is, the tobacco was smuggled.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS KEYS re-examined. There was very little fire in Nightingale's room.</p>

            . I am a shoe-maker, and live in Bethnal-green. On the 4th of October, about ten minutes past six o'clock in the evening - I saw Smith in Artillery-lane, with these posts on his shoulder - Norton was walking behind him, and knowing Norton, I watched them down into Petticoat-lane, and saw them offer them for sale; they could get no purchaser, and left them at a public-house- I went to Lambeth-street; two officers came and took them away - I saw Smith next morning, in Norton-folgate, and secured him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner NORTON. Q. Did you ever say you would proceed no further, if you got 1l.? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Here is your mark, which says you have received 10s. 6d.? A. Yes; from the time I was at the office: his wife has been bothering me - I received 10s. 6d., and have it at home - I did not undertake not to appear, on receiving the rest; the mark on this paper is not mine.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. It says, "Mr. Briggs received 10s. 6d." - Did you make your mark to this? A. No - I never saw that paper before; ever since I was at the office, she has been after me - I would not tell her where I lived; she offered me several sums, if I would throw out the bill - I said I would not do any such thing, and the prosecutor, to get rid of her, told her where my sister lived - I took it from her, to get rid of her bother; she said if I would take 3l. she would get it me.</p>

(I did not see him with any bundle;) he then asked for a bundle; inquiry was made whether he had left one there, and nobody knew any thing of it; he wanted to go into the parlour; I stopped him, and twice put him out of the street door; a gentleman who lives on Ludgate-hill, came in presently; he went into the parlour, and called for a pint of beer; the landlady went in with it, and on coming out, she looked round the parlour, near the door where the prisoner had sat, and saw something lay; she took it up, and put it into my hand; it was a blue handkerchief, twisted up; I took it to the bar, untwisted it, and saw it was money. I went and asked the prisoner what he had lost; he said a blue handkerchief - I asked what was in it; he said he did not like to say; I said, "You ought to tell;" he said he would not tell me. I went and pushed him into the parlour, and said again, "What have you lost?" he said, "I don't like to tell you." I asked what was the value of it; he said there was 3l. in it - I said (in the presence of two or three persons, who had followed me into the parlour), "Is this yours?" he said Yes; I said, "Is what is in it yours?" he said Yes - I then said, "It is counterfeit coin, and I shall detain you;" he then tried to escape, but was detained till the officer came; there were seventy-nine counterfeit shillings in the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHER. Q. Do you carry on business on your own account? A. Yes; I am often at the bell; I was not in the parlour when the prisoner went out; he asked the landlady for his bundle; he was partly drunk, but capable of knowing what he was about, and walking about. I saw the landlady pick the bundle off the seat where he had sat, and feeling something in it, she put it into my hand; the money was so bad, every body could tell immediately that it was counterfeit; I would not have taken it; I should have refused it at first sight.</p>

I saw the prisoner there, and swore clearly and positively to him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long afterwards was he taken into custody? A. I think on the Tuesday or Wednesday morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHER. Q. Be so kind as to recollect exactly at what time this was? A. About nine o'clock, rather before than after - it was was very near nine - it was dark, of course - it had been raining, and was a damp dirty night.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the lamps do not, on a damp night, give so much light as on another? A. I believe not; there was a gas-light at the bottom of the court, which is about sixty yards long - that was not the light I saw him by; there is a light at Mr. Yarrow's, a grocer, at the corner of the yard- I was rather flurried.</p>
               <p>Q. You are rather a nervous man? A. That made me nervous; I have never been right since; I saw him as plainly as I do you, Sir; the moment he seized my arm, I was convinced I had seen him before - it did not last more than a minute, I suppose, or a minute and a half; I was not looking at him entirely; when I attempted to pursue the man, the prisoner stopped me - he came breast to breast to me; I had rather passed him; he came and stood before me - I was between the two men, and the light was, as it were, overhead, a little distance behind me - it was only the little distance they had driven me down the court.</p>

            . I live in King-street, Snow-hill, and am a grocer. On the night of the 22d of September my attention was called to this yard; I was in my own shop, and saw a scuffle at the top of the yard - I went out; when I got to my door, which might take me about a minute, the parties had dispersed; I went down the yard, on hearing a cry of Stop thief! from a faint voice, and met two men coming up the yard - one was in a white smock-frock, the other had plain clothes of some description; I spoke to the man in the smock-frock, as he was the nearest of the two to me - he was quite close to me; I asked him what was the matter - he said a gentleman had been robbed of his watch; I inquired if the thief was taken - he said, "He is not taken; we have been pursuing him, and he has made his escape through these courts."</p>
               <p>Q. Did this pass in such a light, that you could well see the features of the person in the smock-frock? A. Yes; I firmly believe the prisoner to be the man - I had not seen him before to my knowledge; I did not recollect him at the time; I have no doubt about his being the man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you any doubt of him when he was taken into custody? A. No - and I have now no doubt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHER. Q. Did you not express a doubt? A. No; I said I had not the slightest doubt he was the man, for he resembled him as much as two men could resemble each other; I knew him by his face and figure - but I was more positive to his face, as he had at first a smock-frock on.</p>
               <p>Q. When two men are dressed very much alike, may they not be easily mistaken in a dark night? A. This was not a very dark night; I cannot remember whether I heard him speak at the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you take a very accurate inspection of him at the Mansion-house before you swore to him? A. Yes; I said I should know him better with his hat on - it was put on, and I had no doubt of him.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHER. Q. Could you have sworn to him without his hat? A. I think I could; the robbery happened between half-past eight and nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you see Mr. Stapp there? A. No, not at that time; but in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, one of his men came to my house to borrow a candle, to look for the watch-case - that was the first of my hearing that it was Mr. Stapp who was robbed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you believe the story the man in the smock-frock told you? A. Yes; and returned to my house; there was a very good light - there is a gas-light at the top of the court.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What induced you to go to the Mansion-house? A. Mr. Stapp came with his man, and told me what had occurred; he knew me as a neighbour; I observed to him that a very able man ran after the thief, and he would have been of use - I said he was a very able man, in a smock-frock; Mr. Stapp said, "That is the very man:" he appeared extremely agitated - Mr. Cope fetched me to the Mansion-house.</p>

               <p>MR. CHURCHER. Q. When you heard the description of the man, you said you did not think the prisoner was the man? A. I said there was another person very similar to him: that man has been apprehended since - he is not quite so stout; the prosecutor said the other was not the man - there is a resemblance between them.</p>
               <p>Q. So great, that a person in great agitation might mistake one for the other? A. That I cannot say.</p>

            . I live at Mr. White's, the Hope and Anchor public-house, Hereford-street, Paddington - I am pot-boy there. I remember the night of the 22d of September; the prisoner was there the best part of that day - I cannot say at what time he came; I first saw him about two or three o'clock in the afternoon; he was there, in and out, till a quarter after nine - he then left; he was there at a quarter-past nine; he was there, with others, on account of a man stealing some sheep; they were drinking beer, and were in and out, watching for the man who had stolen the sheep, to take him: they had some mutton-chops for supper.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long had you been pot-boy there? A. About three months: three other persons were with him - one left in the afternoon, but the prisoner and the two others remained; I did not serve them with every thing they had - I served them with porter - they had nothing else to my recollection; I took in nothing but porter, they paid my master - I was then standing at the tap-room door - I cannot say how much it was; there was no dispute about it, and I did not hear what it was - they all divided it, and paid their share. Thompson, a police officer, was with them - he is not here to-day; he was only once in the house; he was after the man; I saw Thompson there in the afternoon once; they did not dine there - they did not have any thing till he evening; the butcher in our neighbour<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250097"/>hood brought the chops, I took the frying-pan in to them, and they cooked them themselves - it was on a Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a day was it - it did not rain, did it? A. I was in the house, and do not go out; I did not notice whether people came in wet or splashed; I cannot tell where I was on the Saturday before, or what company were there then, there are so many people come to our house; I did not know the prisoner before: I can tell who came on the Saturday night afterwards - it was the prisoner's brother and Mr. Broom; they took me to the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you particularly remember that this was the 22d of September? A. I do remember it, because the prisoner was there, and we do not have any cooking in our tap-room on Saturday nights; but I told master they had been there all day, and wanted something to eat.</p>
               <p>Q. Why does that make you remember it was the 22d? A. I cannot tell - this is the 22d of October, I think; I do not know what date last Saturday was.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHER. Q. Are you in the habit of observing your master when he takes people's reckoning? A. No; the officer was there in the afternoon; it might be a fine or a damp day for what I know; I observed the day very particularly; I attended at the Mansion-house on the Monday week, I believe - my attention was then directed to the day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know Thompson before? A. Yes; he came in once; he was once with them about sheep; that was about the middle of the morning; he went out looking for the man, and they were in and out; he was not with them afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by saying he was with them? A. He brought them in; they all came in together - he did not stay more than five minutes; I only saw him once- that was about two or three o'clock; our door is kept open; I serve in the tap, and go to the cellar; I do not think it was wet; I do not know what occurred on the Saturday before - the prisoner's brother came on the Saturday after, and had conversation with me and my master; his brother was not there with him - I did not know him before.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is it your duty to serve in the bar, and go up and down stairs? A. Yes; I very seldom carry out beer or collect the pots; I do when there are a great many out; I then go out with the man.</p>

            . I am nothing particular - the last place I lived at was a bake-house. I was at the Hope and Anchor on Saturday, the 22d of September; I went there about seven o'clock, and staid till about nine. I saw the prisoner there; I left him there at nine, and found him there at seven; they had mutton chops and roasted potatoes for supper.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What is your business? A. I am nothing particular; I went to assist at the baker's, Mr. Wells, Great James-street, Lisson-grove; I was about four months with him, and have had no place since; I was third hand with him, and carried out bread; I do not serve at the Hope and Anchor; I never saw the prisoner before; he sat in a box on the right hand side as you go in at the door; I was in front of the same box as the prisoner and his party - there were three of them. I had no share of their porter; there were three when I went in, and three when I left.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you take so particular notice of the prisoner as to come here, to swear you knew him again? A. Because a man who was with the prisoner talked about some stolen sheep. I did not see the Police-officer - the chops were cooked in the tap-room; a man came in with the potatoes, and they bought them; I saw nobody else buy any; I went to the Mansion-house on the Tuesday; I do not know the date. I am certain of the 22d; I do not know what day of the month this is.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be so well assured this was on the 22d of September? A. Because it was on the day I left my place; I was dismissed about the time I went there - I had been out that day with bread; I cannot say whether it was rainy or fine - there was no quarrel in the house while I was there; I live at No. 2, Union-street, Paddington; the prisoner's brother came to me, not to my house. I came into the Hope and Anchor while they were there, and they asked me if I was one who was there; I am sure this was on the 22d of September.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHER. Q. It was Saturday night? A. Yes; I never saw them there before or after; the people of the public-house know me; I am the last witness' brother.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who do you work for now? A. I have been out of place ever since - I had no mutton-chops - I saw them eat them; they were broiled; one of the men who is here cooked them, with a gridiron - I think it was a gridiron - I did not get up to look - I cannot say whether it was a gridiron or saucepan - I was in the same box with them; there was a box between me and the fire-place - I could not well see the fire without getting up; a man sat at the end of the box - I saw no frying-pan or gridiron brought in; the potatoes were roasted; a man brought them in to sell, just as the chops were ready - they did not give me any - I was not known to them - I was with some other young men - I could not see the fire.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How was the prisoner dressed? A. In the same dress he has now, except that he had a red handkerchief - I swear he was never out of the tap-room from seven to nine o'clock - I know the time I left the house, because I was going to the Crown and Apple Tree public-house, in Berwick-street, to see somebody - I slept at home - I have been there several nights since, and staid there a good many hours together - I usually go home about ten o'clock - I was there last night for about five minutes; the prisoner's brother was not with them, but the men who came with him were there, the night they had the chops, and those men asked me if I was there; they had sat in the same box with me; they asked if I was not the young man who was there - I was not surprised at the question.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know they were looking after sheep? A. I heard them talking about it - I did not know where they were stolen from; they were looking for the man; they knew him; he was a butcher up there - I did not think it strange they should remain so long in the house.</p>

There was a fourth person, who was rather in liquor, in the afternoon, but when I returned he was not there - I had left him there at four o'clock - I am sure, when I returned at seven o'clock, these three men were sitting drinking and talking to one another - I sat on the prisoner's right, in the same box, and on the same side - I saw George Weller right opposite me - I was near the window; he was opposite; there was a fire - I sat facing the fire; the chops came from Nicholl's, a butcher - Broom went for them, and the butcher brought them - Broom was one of the three - he went for them about eight o'clock, or a little after; they were cooked in a frying-pan - I do not know where it came from; there were a good many people there the latter part of the evening - I cannot say how many - I believe there were people in all the boxes - I knew one Farns, who was there - I cannot say at what time he came- he was there at four, and between seven and nine o'clock; he left before me - I lodge at No. 9, Bond's-place, Edgware-road.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to find you? A. I was coming into the public-house when his brother, and the other men were there; that was just about dark - I had been looking for a place on the 22d of September; it was not wet - I am not certain whether it was fine - I was not wet through, and therefore did not notice whether it was wet at all; the men who sat by me had some roasted potatoes - George Weller had some and Broom, and a man named Elgar bought a penny-worth himself, I believe, and the prisoner and his party had some; a man brought them in - Broom paid for some, but not for all - we had the remains of their potatoes, after they had done; the potatoe-man went to the other boxes, but whether he sold any more I cannot say; he is not here - I did not notice them talking about any thing but the sheep; the man who went away first was tipsy - I saw these men come in about two o'clock; that man was tipsy when he came in; four persons came in, and one was tipsy; they came into the tap-room; the prisoner had a fustian coat and blue apron; he was dressed something like he is now; he has no apron now- I do not know whether the others had aprons; but he was next to me, with a little dog in his arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of the three cooked the chops? A. A deaf man - Broom, or some such name.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Who sat next to you on the other side of the prisoner? A. John Elgar.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw a great deal of them? A. Yes; I went home to tea, from four to seven o'clock; I did not set in the same box with them in the afternoon, but I was in the tap-room from two to four o'clock; I will not say I did not step to the door; I only saw four in the party.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body else had come to talk about the sheepstealers, you must have seen them? A. Very likely.</p>

            . I am a drover, and remember the 22d of September - I saw the prisoner that day, at the Bull's Head, public-house, Smithfield. I went with him to the Hope and Anchor, Paddington: we were in and out there the best part of the afternoon - I did not leave till half-past ten o'clock; the prisoner left about twenty minutes past nine - I supped with him, off mutton-chops and baked potatoes; the chops were fried by a man who was with us. I am certain the prisoner did not leave till after nine o'clock, and am certain as to the day - several persons were in the tap-room whom I did not know; I was never there before I appeared at the Mansion-house to give evidence, and so did some others who are here.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time did you go with him? A. About half-past twelve o'clock; three of us went together; there were four of us at the Hope and Anchor; the fourth man was a drover - he joined us near Baker-street - a young man named Alby, who was one of the four, was tipsy - he is not here - we lost him there; I do not know where he lives; Thompson, a Police-officer, was there - I went for him about three o'clock; we got there about two. I did not go in with the rest, but left them a few minutes before, and then they went with me to a person named Watkins, a few doors from the Sun public-house, where we called first; I staid at Watkins' a very few minutes. I left the officer with Watkins, and he followed us to the Hope and Anchor; we were in and out between two and four o'clock, and staid out five or ten minutes; we might have gone out half a dozen times; we dined before we left town - we had some porter, and I had some gin and spruce at the bar - I do not know whether the others had any; we sat in the left side box when we first went in, and then changed to the right side; the young man left us about half-past four o'clock; we heard of Watkins, and all went out together, and in the course of that walk lost the tipsy man.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is not true that he got up and went away himself? A. No, we lost him in the walk. The prisoner was dressed the same as he is now, except a handkerchief; he had a kind of blood-red handkerchief - there was no other difference; I am certain he had not a smock-frock; he had no apron on, I am sure. The officer belongs to Bow-street - he was here yesterday, and would have come to-day if he was wanted; he was not at the Mansion-house - I met with him at his own house, No. 5, in the same street as the Hope and Anchor; I semember seeing Seller there very well - I cannot say when I first saw him - he was a stranger to me; I saw him in the tap-room; I first saw him in the left-hand side, and then he turned to the right; I think I saw him before four o'clock, but did not notice him till after that. I saw him in the evening; he was drinking porter in the tap-room - we did not drink to each other - I believe he was in the same box towards the evening. I am not able to say how many were in the box - it is a square box; my face was towards the fire - I do not recollect who sat next the prisoner; we had some muttonchops - Nicholls, the butcher, brought them; the prisoner and myself went to order them - I am sure of that; we cooked them by the tap-room fire -

               <p>Q. When you came away did you all pay and settle it afterwards, or did one pay? A. We paid between us; I cannot say how much it was, or what my share was; I spent 4s. 6d. or 5s. in the course of the afternoon; I paid part for the prisoner; I do not know whether he paid any; I asked him to walk with me from the Bull's Head, and did not wish him to pay much; the sheep lost I had to pay for, if I could not find them; we found the man, but he ran away from the officer, saying he would go and get the money; I got the money for them next morning; I am sure it was on the 22d of September; I made no memorandum of it; I was questioned about it at the Mansion-house on the Tuesday week; it was rather a heavy day; it mizzled a little as we walked there; it was heavy a great part of the day.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHER. Q. What time did Thompson go away? A. About ten minutes to six o'clock; he was not there afterwards; I told him he would not be wanted; I have known the prisoner some time in Smithfield, but was never in his company to spend an evening before; I never heard any thing against him; I considered him to bear an honest character.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long have you known him? A. Four or five years by sight; I was never in his company before; I never heard of his being in a Court before; I have heard of his being in custody for getting a little tipsy; I never heard any charge against him.</p>

            . I am a waiter at the Hope and Anchor. I have seen the prisoner; he was at our house on the 22d of September till twenty minutes past nine o'clock at night; two other persons were with him, a man with one eye, and another man deaf.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time did they come? A. Between one and two o'clock; I am sure two more came with him; we understood they were in search of a butcher about some sheep; I saw an officer there between four and five o'clock; I do not know when he left, as I had my business to mind; I only saw him when he came in with the three men, between four and five o'clock; they were the only men who came on that business; they were the officer, the prisoner, Broom, and Hill; I cannot say either of them were tipsy; they might be a little in liquor; I saw no tipsy man come in with them - they went in and out, and had mutton-chops in the evening - there were two or three bakers in the tap-room, George Weller and another baker - a great many people were in the tap-room - Saturday is generally a busy night; this was not particularly a busy night - I know it was on the 22d of September, because when they came in they were talking about some sheep, and about Watkins, and I said I had parted from him not five minutes ago - they did not go after him then; this was between two or three o'clock - the officer lives in the same street - he was here last week, and said he had no objection to come forward - they sat behind the door at supper - they had before sat in the opposite box - I cannot say when they changed - they went out between four and five o'clock, then came in, and sat behind the door - Elgar sat in the same box, and partook of some of the victuals - he had some potatoes - I do not know whether any body else sat in the same box - I could not attend to my business, and notice every thing - I cannot say where Weller or Seller sat - Broom sat close to the prisoner - the prisoner had a frock on under his coat - I believe it is called a smock-frock - it is a loose linen garment, which went down low, and covered his breeches - I cannot say what colour it was, but am sure he had one on - he had a red silk handkerchief round his neck - I believe it was a fine day - I did not pay particular attention to it - I go out with beer, but cannot recollect whether it was fine.</p>

            . I am a baker. On Saturday evening, the 22d of September, I was at the Hope and Anchor; I saw the prisoner there that night, sitting with two more men; he wore the coat he has on now, I believe; and I think a red handkerchief - he had a fustian coat and a dog. I think it rained a little in the afternoon; I saw him eat mutton-chops; I went away a little after ten o'clock; he went out, as near as I can tell, at half-past nine o'clock; I am certain he was there.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are you certain of the day of the month? A. I recollect it was the 22d, because I read the paper that afternoon - I read the paper yesterday - I have not seen one to-day, and cannot tell the date of to-day; I was working for Mary-le-bone parish that day; I have been with a cabinet-maker, and then a cheesemonger, and after that with a baker; I was never employed as a drover- I suppose I have not been at Smithfield market above a dozen times in my life; I believe the prisoner had a blue apron on, but will not swear it - he had a frock on under his coat - I am sure of it - I saw it under his coat - it would prevent my seeing his waistcoat - I think it was a short-frock - I am not quite certain that he had an apron - I think the frock was blue.</p>

            . I am a milkman, and live at No. 16, Harrow-street. I was at the Hope and Anchor on Saturday night, the 22d of September, and saw the prisoner there - he had a sort of dirty drab handkerchief on, and a sort of fustian jacket; I did not much notice his dress.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time did you go there? A. About seven o'clock, and left about eight - I think it was a fine day.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What makes you remember that it was the 22d? I did not make any particular remark, but the indictment was read to me, which stated it was the 22d, and I recollected the night I had seen him there; I think this is (hesitating) the 31st day of the month - I am sure he had a dirty drab handkerchief, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not blood-red? A. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a red handkerchief, was it as red as that? A. No; it might be a mixture of red and drab - it was dirty; he had a great coat on the table before him; I did not notice his having a smock-frock - he had no apron; I did not see his shirt frill; I sat alone in a left hand box, and they on the right; I did not see them eat any thing.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS, Q. Did you enter it in your book? A. No; but on that day I had a goose sent up out of the country; we eat it on Sunday - it was not sent for Michaelmas-day, and we were remarking that we should have goose before Michaelmas-day; I had seen the prisoner before in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you observe his dress? A. I think it was the same as he has now, except that he had a coloured handkerchief.</p>

About ten o'clock in the morning of the 27th of October I came out of my father's house, and passed the prisoner within a few yards of it; I crossed the way, and happened to turn my head; I saw the prisoner put his hand up, as if to open the door - he had his hand upon it; he was in for two or three minutes, and then came out with some things under his arm; I had fastened the door myself, and had not left it three minutes - I had not my eye upon the door all that time; I crossed the road and ran after him - I said he must come back to my father's, which he did, and dropped in the passage a pair of breeches and a shirt; another witness came up to the door with a key, and I saw my father try it to the lock of our room door, which it opened as well as our own - it was picked up near where I took the prisoner; he left the door open.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Why did you not take me directly? A. Because I went after the man with the bag; the prisoner and the other man came back in a quarter of an hour - I saw Barrier speaking to the prisoner, and said he was the man who stole the shoes - Mr. Howard came out and said there was a pair missing; the other must have taken them away, while I was gone to the public-house with the third man.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Thames Police. On the 24th of October, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner in King David's Fort, with a live fowl, in a smock frock, under his arm - I asked what he had got; he said nothing, but when I found it, he said he bought it of a man for a shilling.</p>
