Mr. Bidicey, who was standing at his shop door, came out and pursued him: he took and brought him back to his shop. I believe he was searched, but nothing found upon him. I have never got my money again. The prisoner attempted to push me down at the time the woman was at my pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bidicey This lady called to me, and said she had had her pocket picked. I offered to lay hold of the woman which she had hold of. She said, this woman has delivered it to that man [pointing to the prisoner]. He directly ran away, and I after him. He made down Pope's-Head Alley, and Swithen's-Lane, down Lombard Street, round St. Mary Woolnoth's Church. I took him in a blind alley that leads into Sherborne-Lane. He was never out of my sight, but just as he turned the corners. I told him he must go back with me. He was a good deal frighted. There were several people pursued him as well as myself. I brought him back to the prosecutrix. He was searched, but nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176207140003"/> thing found upon him that she could own. We found about seven guineas, and a bank note of ten pounds.</p>

I paid her a shilling, out of which she spent a penny. The constable pays the watchmen quarterly at my house, and I know nothing but she was the wife of one Newman. She came again, and wanted some more liquor. I had been out: I came in, and was told the prisoner had been at my till. I sent for her; they brought her back. She had some money in her hand, we opened it, and there we found three shillings. I desired to know, how she came by that money? and said it certainly was mine. I sent for a constable, he took her into the yard. Soon after he called me into the yard, and told me, she had confessed she had taken seven shillings. This was the 28th of May.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for to the prosecutor to take the prisoner in charge. They told me she had taken some money. She would not own it in the tap room. I took her out into the yard; she then owned she had taken seven shillings out of the till, and delivered three shillings to me, as part of the money. She was in liquor. I carried her before justice Welch, there she begged for mercy, and said, she never did such a thing before.</p>

            . I once lodged in the prisoner's house. She has been reduced. She came into my house promiscuously. Being destitute of a servant, I took her for her victuals and drink, She had been at my house the Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. She never lay in my house. Last Monday there was a few words among the people in the tap room. She went out of the house at that time. After that I saw a woman with one of my handkerchiefs on; I knew it by the mark. I took her to justice Welch. She said, she bought it of the prisoner at the bar. I took up the prisoner: she owned the fact upon being charged with the things mentioned in the indictment. She had the other handkerchief in her pocket, and the apron on.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence.</p>

            . I missed some of my goods on the 20th of December last: I missed two shirts (and caps I lost before), and two muslin neckloius, three napkins, two laced caps, a silk handkerchief, and a laced handkerchief. I gave her warning when I missed some money out of a little box. She made an excuse to go out for water. I told her there was none wanted. She ran away, and told me, I should catch her if I had a lighter pair of heels than her. On the 22d I took her. I charged her with two shirts and laced caps: I could not rightly tell then what I had lost. She told me where they were.</p>
               <p>Robert Hall. I am a pawnbroker; the prisoner at the bar brought a shirt about this time twelve months; she said it was her mistress's property, and that she sent her. I did not know who her mistress was at that time. She told me her mistress's name was Cooley. I have known the prisoner seven years. There were two neckcloths, and two pair of sleeves brought I believe in August.</p>
               <p>A Witness. I am a widow. I went into Mrs. Cooley's for a pint of beer; and the maid and she had had words about the linen. She was going for a pail of water. Her mistress said, there was no need of any. She run out of the door; and Mrs. Cooley cried stop thief. She said, Mrs. Cooley should have a lighter pair of heels than her if she catched her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>My mistress had set me to clean the house, and used me very ill. I took up the pail to fetch some water. I said, she should not serve me as she did the day before. I said she had better pay me my wages. I was not six yards from the house the whole time. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176207140005"/> pawned the goods for her, and she redeemed them at her own expence.</p>

               <p>Mr. Wilson. I am the constable that took up the prisoner. The fir st time I took her up, they made it up: she was charged at that time with two caps and some shirts: she stood it out that Mrs. Cooley gave her the things to pawn for herself, and on that they made it up; and Mrs. Cooley fetched them out of pawn at her own expence; she lived servant with her at the time, and they turned her away; and finding more things missing, I had a warrant against her; I believe that was two months afterwards. She insisted that her mistress sent her with the things to pawn the first time; but the second time she did not say much about it. I believe she said her mistress sent her with these to pawn; and she said the reason that she did not mention these before was, that in her fright she had forgot them. She did not say she had taken them but by her mistress's consent. She told me there was due forty shillings for wages: she did not mention it before Mrs. Cooley.</p>

I told the lady I was in company with that my pocket was picked. The prisoner stood by me: I said, that is the pickpocket. I saw him drop the handkerchief as soon as he heard the word pickpocket: he ran on the other side the way, and I cried out stop pickpocket, stop thief; and a young lad run after him, and I also; as soon as the prisoner perceived that, he turned short into a court. Just as he got to the upper end of the court he was stopped: the young fellow and I came up to him, and many people followed us. When I came up, I said, that is the man that picked my pocket. We carried him to the Poultry compter that night, and I appeared before my lord mayor the next day.</p>

The prisoner came up the court where Mr. Robinson lives, and looked on both sides the court. About a quarter after four he went down the court again, and went under a gateway in a posture to ease himself. I looked up the court to see if any thing was stirring, and afterwards we found him in the warehouse: the place he got over is upwards of seven foot high: we took him there. His excuse was, he came to look after a pidgeon.</p>

My next door neighbour told me the prisoner had taken something out of my shop. I live near the Cock in the Corner. I ran after him up the Old Bailey, and near Surgeons Hall I took him, and found them both upon him. I carried him before the sitting alderman. He said he asked one of the men for them as he knew. I had no man at home at that time.</p>

             on the 12th of June. When we got him in the coach, I told him, that the only way to have any favour shewn him, was to confess the fact, or otherwise he would be hanged. The boy immediately confessed a little before me, his master, and the officer; that was as we went along to the justice's. He confessed he had taken the gold and silver, and given it to an aunt of his, who sold it for him at sundry times; for which she sometimes gave him eighteen pence at a time, and sometimes half a crown, and that very rarely, I believe not above once; this he confessed again before the justice. On which we had a warrant to take up his aunt, who strongly denied the fact, or that she knew any thing of it, during the time of her being taken up to the time of her coming before the justice: but on confronting them before the justice, the boy taxed her so close, that by degrees she confessed almost as much as he.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you do with razors?</p>
               <p>Kettle. I shave myself; I happened to have them in my pocket. They said, if I made any noise or resistance there was a press-gang, and that I should go with them. I said, I was willing to go with them. They were going to strip me of my stockings and shirt. The evidence said, let him make the best of his way off.

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Rosemary Lane. I saw the prisoner at Sparrow's Corner, Little Tower Hill, on the ninth of June, between the hours of eight and nine: he had a piece of bacon in his hand. His wife was standing by a crowd of people; he went up to her, and desired her to buy a piece of liver to eat with the bacon for supper. She was very drunk, and so was he. She had fell down several times. She cursed and swore most prodigiously. A cart loaded with green beans was coming along Tower Hill to cross the kennel; as the cart was come near them, he gave her a blow, and she fell; the wheel run over her he stooped as though he intended to catch her up: as soon as the wheel was gone over her, he ran to lay hold of the driver.</p>

            . I left the prisoner to look after my door, on the 29th of June about eight in the morning. I went to the bake-house to fetch a two penny loaf.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you gone?</p>
               <p>Parker. I believe I was gone above a quarter of an hour. I found her on the bench where I left her. I had my money to pay away that day I took it out of the drawer, and put it upon the chest of drawers, fearing I should forget when I came back again.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you lose?</p>
               <p>Parker. There was nineteen guineas and a shilling, that made twenty pounds, four guineas, and half guinea, and five shillings and sixpence, which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176207140010"/> made twenty five pounds. I was to blame, not the girl. The chamber door was open, so she opened no lock. It had an acquaintance called that day that I had not seen a great while so I did not go that day. I intended to pay it on the morrow.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss your money?</p>
               <p>Parker. When I went up stairs to go to bed, I did not look for it. I did not go the next day; I went to hear a sermon in Broad-street, and did not miss it till Thursday night the 29th of June, then I hunted every where. I rummmaged up stairs and down. I was afraid to speak of it. I was afraid she took it; and on Monday morning I taxed her about it. I said, did nobody come into my house that took something out? She said, no, I said, somebody had taken something that did not belong to them, nor me neither. I said, if you took something, I will forgive you. She said, do not talk to me, and went away. I said, tell; you had as good tell; for if you have broke into it, I will forgive you. She would not hear me, she ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure she heard you?</p>
               <p>Parker. She heard me, and ran up stairs, and laughed at me. She lives in the back part of my house. A person told me I might have a warrant on suspicion. I said, I would trust the Providence of God. I would not have a warrant. Mrs. Bell saw her buying a cardinal. She came to me, and said, she had seen some of my money. Said I, it is my fault; I will forgive her, if she will deliver the rest. She would not come near me. I went and got a warrant from justice Berry: I would not swear she had it, but it was on suspicion: for several days we could not find her; at last she surrendered. On Friday morning following she sent word she would surrender to me, and was very sorry for what she had done. I went and told Mr. Berry; then Mr. Cragg brought me that message, this was on Friday. I asked the justice if I could make it up with her. I was contented with what was left, be it what it will. The justice said I must have a warrant, and sent to the headborough, and she was carried before the justice. When she came there, she said she would give me all that was left. The justice told her she need not part with any thing. She said she knew it was very hard with me, and she took it, and she would give me all the things she had bought with it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she return of the money?</p>
               <p>Parker. I believe about sixteen pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give an account how she laid the money out?</p>
               <p>Parker. She had bought a pair of stays, and other things; them I gave to her, as she had been so kind. I said God bless you, I never knew any m of you before. I hope the jury and my lord will take it in consideration to do you no hurt. It was my fault in laying that temptation in her way. I hope the court will it take into consideration; for God Almighty will provide for me.</p>

The prisoner sat in the room for three or four hours with two others. The box was left in the window where he sat. I saw it when the other men left the room. I just stepped from the bar, and the box was missing, and the prisoner was gone in the yard among the people. I caused the Winchester and Bath coaches to be unloaded; and it was not found; being in a hurry I thought it might be put in through mistake. The prisoner went out into the other yard; when he came back, I told him he must know something of the box. I laid hold of him by the collar. Before the constable came he desired me to walk into the room with him, and he said if we would forgive him he would tell where the box was; he went and took the lanthorn and candle, and took the box out of the boot of the Winchester coach; he owned he had taken it, and gave it to me.</p>

Then came the prisoner (to the best of my knowledge it was he, by his size and what I could observe of him, it being star-light) he said he would bring me to Limehouse; he spoke English; I cannot say I understood all he said, but I understood him that he lived there; I went along with him through several street till we came to the open fields; when we had walked a little way in the fields, I said, as well as I could I was wrong; as soon as I said so he struck me down by a blow on the back part of my head, and after that I remember he gave me one blow more; what happened after that I do not know. When I recovered my senses I found myself stripped; I was as naked as when I was born, only my stockings: I saw the man that knocked me down standing by me with my pocket book in his hand; I said, My book, my book. I was at that time lying on the ground, not able to rise; he was looking over the papers in it; [he produced three pieces of paper sprinkled with blood] these were some of them: I remained still on the spot till he was gone away; then I got down into a dry ditch, where I remained some time, I do not know how long; after that I got out, and seeing a light I ventured to go to it, which was at the new turnpike in the city road from Moorfields to Islington, where I knocked at the door, and the man came; I could not talk English to him, only let him understand I had been robbed; he took me in, and I lay down on his bed, and he covered me up: in the morning he went and got a surgeon to dress my wounds, name Goodman; he procured a lodging for me, where I lay till I was able to go abroad again, which was in about eight or nine days. Part of my things were found again.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Can you swear I am the man?</p>
               <p>Faye. I am sure the prisoner is the man as much as at that time my senses would allow me to say, and I am sure of it since.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner at the bar six weeks to day; I lodge in the same house where he did in Gray's-inn-lane, at Mr. M'Cullough's: I was in his apartment the Wednesday before he was taken up; I work'd for his wife; I saw a bloody shirt in a tub of water; this was on the Wednesday: he went out and came in about two on the Thursday morning; he had gone out with a sort of a fustian waistcoat without sleeves, without a coat. I saw a mark on the shirt in the tub; it had ruffles, and the wristband stitched to imitate work: [a shirt produced] this is the same shirt; I wash'd it for him on the Friday. He had beat the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176207140013"/> woman that went for his wife on the Friday night, when they came home from Sadlers Wells, so I wash'd and iron'd that shirt for him. After I had been in his room and seen several things, I came down stairs affrighted. I took the landlady up: she saw that bloody shirt, a pair of velvet breeches, with a silver buckle behind mark'd J G F; they lay in a box, and a pistol by it; some other things of his were in the box; there was his fustian waistcoat which he had on when he went out. On this I gave information to Justice Welch on the Saturday morning; I had heard of a robbery being committed; we got a warrant and a constable, and he was taken up. I had seen a pair of silver sleeve buttons in his sleeves with green stones; and in a socket in the middle were diamonds set; the prisoner said they cost him two guineas and a half, after that two guineas, after that he said his aunt gave them to him, and that he was the first of the family that ever wore diamond buttons.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Did you lose such a pair of sleeve buttons as she has described?</p>

I had one of the sleeve-buttons in my hand as the other witness described, (a pair of velvet breeches, the buckle, a pair of silver shoe buckles, a stock buckle marked J G F, a half-crown piece, a silver seal, a shirt marked H F 4, a silver watch, and a hat produced in court).</p>

On the Friday he was saying he had got a pair of buttons that cost him two guineas and a half; they had green stones and a little diamond in the middle; on the Friday evening he came to me at the Black Lion in Jockey's Fields at the end of Bedford row.</p>

               <p>Mr. Dawson. I live in Monmouth-street; the prisoner at the bar used to sell butter about in our neighbourhood; on Thursday the 17th of June last the prisoner, in company with two women and a man, brought me a coat to sell; the other man brought it; I gave the man half a guinea, and he was to give me six-pence out of it; the prisoner came and gave me the six-pence, and took the half guinea from the man.</p>

Immediately after their parting he heard a violent blow, and soon after two other blows, and in a very little time after Day brought to him the several things mentioned; and that Day pawned the breeches in Holborn near the French Horn; after that Day pawned the watch, which, upon inquiring, he found the pawnbroker swore to the prisoner's bringing them, and knew<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176207140014"/> nothing of Day, when he carried Day to them; and it appeared to his worship that Day had a good character.</p>

I said, Jack, where is my wig? said he, I have lost it last night; said I, I will be paid for it; he gave me half a crown, and two shillings for turning the hat, and six shillings for pawning the things. I saw his shirt was bloody; he said it was by fighting the other day, and for want of a handkerchief he wiped his face with his shirt. I took the things of him and pawned them, that is all I am to suffer for; if I do suffer, that is between God Almighty and myself.

               <p>P. Dowley. She continued in that manner three days.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the mother know of it?</p>
               <p>P. Dowley. Yes, I remember the daughter called to her mother one day to come and help her tie that girl up. The mother said, No, if you will have your crotches, you may do them yourself.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the girl do on nights.</p>
               <p>P. Dowley. The daughter came and untied her at nights, that she might go to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How had she her food or victuals during that time she was tied up?</p>
               <p>P. Dowley. She had none.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>P. Dowley. I was at meals all the three days, and saw she had none.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you your meals yourself?</p>
               <p>P. Dowley. In the kitchen in the summer; she had no victuals with us; and when we had done we used to go up to her, where she was tied up, and work by her. I saw none she had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the girl speak to you at them times?</p>
               <p>P. Dowley. No. She used to stand and groan. At the end of three days she did not move, I did not see any life in her: when we told the daughter she did not move; she said, I will go and make her move.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the mother see this?</p>
               <p>P. Dowley. She did, I believe; she was in the dining room when I spoke to the daughter about it; we did not go down, but called to her.</p>
               <p>Q. What posture was the girl in?</p>
               <p>P. Dowley. She hung double.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say when you called to her?</p>
               <p>P. Dowley. Miss Salley! Miss Salley! come up stairs, Nanny does not move; we called out aloud; the other apprentices were with me. The daughter came up and beat the girl with her shoe on her backside; she did not move then; she said she would make her move; she beat her hand; as soon as the beating was over the mother came up, The mother laid the girl cross her lap, and called Sall, my fellow apprentice, to bring up some drops: they were brought: the girl seemed dead to me: then we were all three sent down into the dining room immediately; that is me, my fellow apprentice

               <p>P. Dowley. Sall, my fellow apprentice, was sent up to fetch her down from the garret; we usually went up into the garret every day before this to wash our hands, but we had not been there for two days.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body bid you not go there?</p>
               <p>P. Dowley. The mother bid us wash our hands in the kitchen; sometimes we had a bason of water brought up in the dining room, but this was not usual before. About two-days after she was sent for to come down to dinner. Sall came down, and said the garret door was open, but nobody there. Then the mother made answer, she is run away; I suppose she ran away when we were at dinner; that they both said. They said there is a noise, but we heard no noise. Sall Hinchman said, if she is run away, she has left her shoes behind her. The mother said, she would not stay for her shoes?</p>

She said the witness told her so. Then the mother said to the witness, Miss Death! I will call you miss Death!</p>

             was; she was an apprentice about two or three months before me. I remember the time she was missing, about three or four years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. How was she treated?</p>
               <p>S. Hinchman. She was treated very ill; she had sometimes one meal a day, and sometimes two, and beat-sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the time of the milkman stopping her?</p>
               <p>S. Hinchman. Yes, she run away once before that, and was brought back again, that was about a month before; the time the milkman stopped her, was about Michaelmas time; the daughter called out to stop her; I believe she was hardly got over the step of the door when the milkman laid hold of her; she was carried up stairs, and beat with a piece of a broomstick by the daughter; then she was carried up stairs and tied to a door, and continued so for three days, during which time, she had no victuals. One night when we were with her, her sister cut the string.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your victuals regularly those three days?</p>
               <p>S. Hinchman. We had.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she had no victuals?</p>
               <p>S. Hinchman. I never saw any carried up to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to her?</p>
               <p>S. Hinchman. The last day she could not speak, she was senseless; that day she hung double, as she was tied by the waist. The daughter went up to her; she hawled her, and beat her with her shoe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give any reason why she beat her?</p>
               <p>S. Hinchman. No, she did not; the girl did not move then, and she called her mother up; the mother came up; I do not know which untied the girl; the mother sat down on the garret stairs, and laid her across her lap, and sent me down to fetch some drops; I brought them up; then they sent me down, and I never saw her afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the girl appear when you brought the drops up?</p>
               <p>S. Hinchman. She lay in the mother's lap. I saw no signs of life; but I did not know but that she was in fits. I never saw her afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any use made of the drops?</p>
               <p>S. Hinchman. No, I did not; I gave them to the mother.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you use to wash your hands before this accident happened?</p>
               <p>S. Hinchman. Up in the garret always; but then we were bid by the mother to wash our hands below, which we did for two days, sometimes in the kitchen, and sometimes in the dining room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember being called up in the dining room one of those two days?</p>
               <p>S. Hinchman. That was in the morning for two or three hours; that was the same day they told us the girl had run away.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were called up there?</p>
               <p>S. Hinchman. The girl that was examined before me, and the girl's sister that i s dead: after that we went to dinner; my mistress bid me go up stairs into the garret, and fetch

               <p>Q. How many shifts had the girl?</p>
               <p>S. Hinchman. We had all three a piece; her shifts were all marked No 4. She had three new ones and one very ragged one; she had one of her new ones on at that time. The milkman stopt her.</p>
               <p>Q. How often had you clean shifts?</p>
               <p>S. Hinchman. Once a week, and sometimes once a fortnight.</p>

               <p>She said, that she was once before the committee of the parish of St. George, Hanover-square, and there was asked how her mistress behaved to her; and she said she behaved well to her; but that was because her mistress had bid her say so. That the mother and daughter often quarrelled, and she beat the daughter many times. That her daughter left her, and went to live with Mr. Rooker as a servant; and that the daughter had given her sometimes a halfpenny roll; and sometimes a halfpenny; and sometimes other victuals unknown to the mother.</p>
               <p>Jer. Brown. I served the prisoner's house with milk. I remember about Michaelmas time in the year 1758, I saw the prisoner's door open, and the deceased girl come out at it: I took her in my arms. She desired and pressed upon me that I would let her go, and said she should be starved if she staid there. I said, my dear, you will not be starved. She said, pray, milkman, let me go, for I have had no victuals for so long a time (the time I cannot recollect). The daughter and the mother came running down stairs, and desired I would stop her. The daughter came to the door, and took the girl round the neck, and dragged her in, and put the door to.</p>
               <p>Q. from the mother. Whether I did not take milk sufficient of you for my family?</p>
               <p>Brown. I used to serve her a quart every other morning, sometimes every day, sometimes two quarts a day.</p>

            . I lived in the prisoner's house about three months, which is long since the child has been missing. I went there a little more than two years ago. I observed the children were very ill used with respect to their food. I have frequently heard them call down to the kitchen for their dinners; and if they had any food, they had never time to eat it, for they never were allowed above five minutes.</p>
               <p>Court. Confine yourself to the matter relating to the deceased child.</p>
               <p>Rooker. After I quitted her house, I went and took a house at the upper end of Hill street, Berkley-square; the old woman came almost every day, and insulted me and the daughter almost without intermission day and night; her behaviour was such, it was almost incredible; I put up with it expecting time would remove it; thus she insulted me and the daughter. I have often heard the daughter, when they have been scolding together, beg of her to let her alone in quietness, that she might get her living in peace. This the old woman paid no regard to, but went on making riots by my house daily. When she found I was going into the country to a little place that fell to me, she continued the same till I did go; and said once to me, that if I took her daughter along with me, I should have as little comfort there as in town; she kept her word pretty punctually: after I had been there but a few weeks, she came and behaved in the same manner. She once broke in, when I was with the gardener: I heard an extream crying out, which I took to be murder; I went immediately, and bid the gardener follow me: I found the girl in agonies in the little room, with the old woman, with her cap and handkerchief torn off; I found this was done by the old woman; she had drove the girl up into a corner, and had got a pointed knife in her hand; she had given the daughter a blow over her eye, which turned black, and scratched her face. I told her, if she would come to my house with a good tongue in her head, she should be welcome to see her daughter. She had mentioned some odd things about the Cock lane story. I heard the daughter say to the mother, Mother, you are the Chick-lane ghost; remember the gully-hole. The old woman used to call me old perfume tea dog. The daughter would say, Mother, remember you are the perfumer.</p>

               <p>Q. What were the mother's answers?</p>
               <p>Rooker. They were with desiance (if any) to the daughter. This behaviour was often repeated and was continued till the 9th of June last, when she was there early in the morning; I told her I was sorry for her own sake that she would not behave better. In the afternoon I received a letter full of abuses: it was wrote to my sister in Bloomsbury-square by the old woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you prove she wrote it?</p>
               <p>Rooker. No.</p>
               <p>Court. You must give no account of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176207140018"/>Rooker. Then the whole story of the murder of these two children came out. I demanded of the daughter what was the meaning of those words between her mother and she? The daughter with tears in her eyes, and great reluctance, desired it might be a secret; then she told me that these children were starved to death; that

             died first, whom the mother would not bury; and the reason the mother gave for it, she said, was, because it would be clear evidence that she was starved to death, by the appearance of the body: That in a few hours after the body was carried up stairs into the garret, and locked up in a box, where it was kept for upwards of two months, till it purrefied, and maggots came from her. The mother then took it out of this box, cut it to pieces, cut her arms and legs off, burnt one of the hands in the fire, cursing her that her bones were so long in consuming, saying, the fire told no tales: Then (I believe the same night) she tied the body and head in a brown cloth, and the other parts in another, being part of the bed furniture: that she carried them to Clnck-lane gully-hole: that her mother told her, as she was coming back, she saw one Mr. Inch, that keeps a public house near Temple-bar; when she came in there, the man cried out, What is the matter there is such a stink in the house? That she said he had it all to himself, for she smelt none: that she called for some brandy, and drank it, and went away immediately; in consequence of this I wrote a letter to the officers of the parish of Tottenham High Cross.</p>
               <p>On his Cross Examination, he said, It was pure compassion that he took the daughter to be his servant, on account of the ill usage of the mother: that the daughter said she did not know where to go, and she would make away with herself in some pond: that the daughter was always in the power of the mother, who was often scolding at her, and he has frequently seen scratches in the daughter's face.</p>

            . In the year 1758 I was overseer of the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn; on the 5th of December that year, near 12 o'clock at night, the constable of the night came to me with two watchmen, and told me there were some parts of a dead body lying at the gully-hole in Chick-lane; he desired I would come and take it away, or cause it to be done. I went along with him; we called at the workhouse and got a shell, and carried it with us; when we came within a little distance of the body, it smelt so very strong, that the watchmen did not care to take up the parts; the first that were taken up was the trunk of the body; then I ordered them to take their lanthorns and look about; and when we had picked up all the parts they could find, the hands were wanting to make the body complete. The body was carried to the workhouse that night; the next morning I went and acquainted Mr. Umfreville the coroner of it; he desired I would get the parts washed and put together in the best manner we could; they were washed in a tub of water, and laid upon a long board. The coroner came and took a view of the body, and gave me his warrant to bury it, and in consequence of that it was buried.</p>

               <p>The Mother's defence.</p>
               <p>The child was ill, she had been in an ill state of health a good while, green-sickly; she was ill at that time when I first went to her; she had sainted away; I gave her some hartshorn and water in a cup or glass, I don't know which. She came better to herself; we took her and laid her on the bed in the garret, and I let her lie on the bed because she was weakly, that was the reason I kept her up stairs; the children were kept from her only on the account she was not very well. She had victuals carried her up every day, to the day she ran away. As to the shift, she had slabbered that with hartshorn; and whether she had changed the shift or not, I cannot say; she was not kept without victuals, I scorn the word. When I sat at dinner, one of the three children said she heard a noise; and, upon some of them going up to look for her, and the other going down, they found her gone, and the door open below; I am positive and sure she went alive out of my house. They used to say, if they complained they were starved, and had not victuals enough, they might get out of their apprenticeship when they pleased. She always said she would go with the milk-boy; neither me nor my daughter's cruelty made her ill. She was pretty well the day she went away: her fainting away was owing to constitution; and the children being little was the reason I kept them away from her, because she was not very well.</p>
               <p>The Daughter's defence.</p>
               <p>The night before this unfortunate accident happened, I begged of my mother to let her have some supper. She made use of very bad oaths, and said she should have none; that neither she nor I should conquer her. She said I lived in laziness myself, and wanted them to live so too. About eleven o'clock she ordered me to go up for her to go to bed; I did not see any more of her till the next morning: I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176207140019"/> had told my mother the night before, when I went to put her to-bed, that I believed the girl would die, for she went up stairs upon all fours, she was so weak and saint. In the morning I went up by accident into the other room; I did not think she was tied; she had not been tied that morning: I spoke to her, she made me no answer; I did not stay a minute, but came down, and told my mother that she would not speak: She went up stairs, and staid about a minute, or two or three, and came down again, and gave me a dumb beckon that I might come, and the girls not know it. I took the bottle under my apron, that they might see it, and went up some minutes after, and saw

The girl held her hands up together, and looked up to her mistress, but could not speak; she then carried her up stairs and undressed her, and laid her on the bed in her shift; I was busy below a washing: I went down stairs, and left my mother with her, after I had been down a little while, my mother came to me, and told me she believed she would die; I don't know that I went up stairs till the afternoon; in the afternoon my mother had been up stairs, and came and told me she was dead.</p>

             came down frighted, and said, Madam, Nanny is not there; then my mother said, Girls, did not you hear a noise? The children answered, Lee, Madam, so we did; some of them went down, and found the street door open. My mother said to me, the first time the children were out of hearing. How cleverly they took it in! This girl lay in the fore garret; I desired my mother to apply to the proper people of the parish to have her buried: She said I was a fool; for, if she did, every body would see she was starved; and if the girls were asked, they could not tell how long she went without victuals. I then asked her to see if she could not get the other girls not to say how long she had been without victuals, in order to have her buried? She said, if the people were determined to know, they could know by opening her, for, upon opening her, every-body would know she was starved: She said I need not be so desirous to have her buried, for though you was not guilty, every body would say you was, because you was in the house: She said, if I would but be a good girl, and keep it a secret, it was no more than was my duty, she being my mother; and if I did keep it a secret, it was no more nor so much as many children have done, if I did but know it; and if I would but stay with her till she was out of danger, I should then go to service. When I thought she was out of danger, I begged to go to service, as she had proposed: She said, No, I should not, I should stay with her while she was in the house: She said I might tell it and be d - d, for, if I did, she would swear that I killed her, and that she secreted my crimes; and that she would swear first, and they would believe her before they would me, and that I could find no witnesses, for nobody would believe me. I have often spoke to her to let the children have victuals; we have had many quarrels on that account behind their backs; she was always very angry with me if I ever spoke any thing in the girls favour; and because she would not give them victuals enough, I have often done it unknown to her. She has said, they should see what they got by Miss Sally giving them any thing; she often made them go without two meals, because they have had one of my giving them; and she used to lock them up in the garret, and order me not to let them out, which I used to do when she was gone; and I used to give them the key when she knocked at the door, to lock themselves in, that she might not know it; when she found it out, she used to take the key with her: If I have taken a halfpeny in the shop, I have bought them a roll, and put it in through the window; and if I have had a halfpeny that I dared to touch, I have given it to them. The body never was buried: She wanted me one night to help her in parting the body to pieces, and said, I need not to be afraid of her now she was dead, for it would not bite me; this was two or three months after she died; I do not know the exact time; I told her, indeed I could not; I was then with her up in the room; I offered to go out; she told me I must help her. I got out of the room; she catched hold of my cloaths behind; I cried; she said, What would the girls think, seeing me cry so? She said, How could I be such a cruel brute to leave her? I said, She had brought herself into it, and she must get herself out. After that, she told me she had done the limbs up in one bundle,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176207140020"/> and tied the body and head up in another; she tried to take the head off, but could not; she brought them down stairs, and first took the limbs out, and carried them to the gully-hole in Chick-lane: She said she tried to sling them over the wall, but could not; then she came and took the other bundle, which she said she carried to the same place; and when she came there, the other parts were lying there. She told me, when she was coming home, she went in at Mr. Inch's house in Bell-yard, Temple-bar; she called for some brandy, for she was very sick, and the people mentioned there was a great stink; and as she stood there, she observed her gown to be very wet, and came away as soon as she could, fearing she should be suspected. One night, after the children were gone to bed, she brought down the hand which had a stump finger, which she told me she would make away with in the fire, because it tended to making a discovery, and fire concealed every thing. Afterwards she often said she wondered it never was advertised; that she never heard any thing about it. As to using the children ill, I never did; as to beating them with a piece of a broomstick, I do not know that there was one in the house; I have very often been badly beaten in their defence; I was always abused, and she would say it was my fault that the work was not done; she said the children conquered me, but they should not conquer her.</p>
               <p>The Mother. Indeed, my Lord, whatever story she may have made, if she has told it to the world, she must carry it on; as God is my judge, the story is false; God must be my judge; she may have made up the story, but it is not true; if the story had been true as to the hand, saying, the fire will make away with every thing, I might as well have done it with the whole body: If that had been the case, if I had put the body there, I should have looked into the advertiser. I suppose she has made up this story, and she cannot get off it; it is false, as God may be my judge.</p>
               <p>The Daughter. She said she wished she could have destroyed it all by fire; she would, but it would have made such a stink, that would have alarmed all the neighbours.</p>
               <p>The Mother. As God may be my judge, that thing was never acted in my house; if I could be admitted to take an oath, I could make oath of it, that the child went alive out of my house.</p>

I never was in her house but when I have seen butter and bread plentifully: I have seen her cut victuals for the children, I thought she used to help them to a sufficiency. Her way, after she had done tea, was to pour out a bason of tea, and give it to the children; she is the last person that I should have suspected.</p>

               <p>Ann Ware. About 9 o'clock in the evening on the 29th of June, I was coming from Mrs. Cockshed's in Lambeth Marsh.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>A. Ward. I live opposite North Audley street, Oxford Road, at the house of Mr. Bezley, a cheesemonger: I have lodged there about half a year.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you been a servant?</p>
               <p>A. Ward. I lived in one place a year and threequarters in Pall Mall, and a year at squire Hickey's in St. Albans street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you born?</p>
               <p>A. Ward. I was born in Warwickshire; my father and mother live there.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go out from your lodgings that day?</p>
               <p>A. Ward. I went out at 4 o'clock, and got to Lambeth Marsh about 8: I returned home through the Horse Guards into the Park; there the prisoner Caswell asked me to drink a glass of wine, which I refused at first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him before?</p>
               <p>A. Ward. No, never to my knowledge, nor any of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was you when he accosted you?</p>
               <p>A. Ward. As I was coming out at Spring Gardens; I was not got out of the park; he told me he would take me to his lodgings in Great Suffolk street, to the house of one Mrs. Allen.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he alone at this time?</p>
               <p>A. Ward. He was; I went with him there; he knocked at the door and drew back, and bid me ask for Mr. Sullivan: he did not go in with me. I asked for Sullivan; Sullivan was at the door, and took me up stairs; there was nobody in the room when I was first taken in. Sullivan went down again, and left me along a good while. Then Cas well came up; after he had been up a little time there came another young woman; she came by her self. They had got a bottle of rum, and made rum and water; we sat till near 11 o'clock, drinking rum and water. Then I wanted to come away, and they refused it; and, upon my being obstinate, they put me into a back room; they all of them wanted to hinder my coming away. They locked the back room door, and were all three with me in the room They put the other young woman in another room there I heard a crying out. Caswell lay with me and the other two assisted him the while.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he enter your body?</p>
               <p>A. Ward. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Fitzgerald do?</p>
               <p>A. Ward. He lay on the bed with me at the same time; and when I made any resistance, he held me.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176207140022"/> I arose up, and thought I was got clear of them, but Caswell knocked me down on the floor; and when I cried out for assistance, he beat me about the head and arms, and told me nobody would come to my assistance; and I believe he would have murdered me, if Fitzgerald had not said, Do not murder the poor creature; remember, you came of a woman yourself; do not use her ill. Though Fitzgerald took my part, yet he lay with me the same as the others did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any resistance?</p>
               <p>A. Ward. I did not make a great deal; I was not able. He entered my body too, then Caswell picked my pocket of 1 s. and 4 1/2 d. After that Sullivan lay with me in the same manner as the others did; then they left me, I believe; but I do not know when, for they left me senseless. When I came to myself, I found nobody in the room; I called, and they said the door should not be opened; I opened the window with intent to jump out, but I found it too high: I cried to get out; it was up two pair of stairs. I looked round the room, and found another door; I went down another pair of stairs: then it was light; I believe it was about five o'clock; I opened the street-door; Mrs. Allen called to me; she said she had been up all night, and had heard such a violent noise in the house, she was afraid of being murdered. She said one of them came down to her with a sword: she said she knew I had been very ill used by my being beat and bruised about the head and face. I had not a shilling to get a warrant; she said she would lend me one. I staid with her in her room near two hours; then I went to Justice Garnoa at Charing-cross for a warrant: I took up Mrs. Allen, the woman of the house, that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you take her up?</p>
               <p>A. Ward. Because she said he heard me crying out all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call the watch?</p>
               <p>A. Ward. No, I did not: the men were taken the night following, or the morning after; it was on the Tuesday night I was taken to that house, and on the Wednesday night Sullivan was taken at the same house; and the other two the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you, who had never seen these men before in your life, to go along with one of them there alone?</p>
               <p>A. Ward. He told me he would use me extremely well: he appeared in the character of an officer. I did not expect to be used any other way than well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did those men lie with you against your will and consent, or no?</p>
               <p>A. Ward. Yes, they did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go with Caswell for to this house?</p>
               <p>A. Ward. I had no other apprehension than that he took me there but to lie with me; but when I saw there were two more, I was not willing that any of them should lie with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you was locked up in that room, was there any proposal made by any of them to lie with you?</p>
               <p>A. Ward. No.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Then he pick'd you up in the Park, and you went with him, intending to lie with him?</p>
               <p>A. Ward. Yes.</p>
               <p>Counsel. That was very odd to lie with a stranger.</p>
               <p>A. Ward. It was, to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any opposition to going with him at first?</p>

               <p>A. Ward. The same that I have said here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you set your name to one paper or two?</p>

               <p>A. Ward. The first, I believe; but cannot be certain.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Here is no mention made of having been robbed.</p>
               <p>A. Ward. I believe there is not, but I told the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176207140023"/> justice of it: my information there was the same as now.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Allen. I live in Suffolk-street, and have for five years past: it is a house of lodgings for quality, that is, people of fashion. My husband was a cabinet maker; he is dead. The three prisoners at the bar took lodgings at my house on the 25th or 26th of last June.</p>
               <p>Q. Which took the lodgings?</p>
               <p>Allen. Caswell did; and said, Mr. Fitzgerald was his guardian, and that he must have another bed for his guardian in the same room: it was a two pair of stairs floor. I never saw him in my life before he came to my house, or either of the others.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire to know their characters?</p>
               <p>Allen. I never dispute the character of an officer, if he has a sword by his side and a lac'd hat on.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they take the lodgings for?</p>
               <p>Allen. For a week: I never let them but from week to week. They were in my house but three days: I think they came on the Friday, and I desired them to go out on the Monday, because I did not like their proceedings: they told me they would not go out</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of the matter?</p>
               <p>Allen. Sullivan came down on the Tuesday night and wanted a tea-kettle of water; I boiled him one at ten, and he came down again for another at eleven. I said, I could not light a fire, my maid was ill; he said, if I would not, he would double me and put me up the chimney, and called me old b - h: he threatened me very much, and said, he would do as he pleased</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard at that time any noise in your house?</p>
               <p>Allen. To be sure I heard a noise of racketting, and I desired them to be quiet; then they said, Do not molest us; we'll do as we please. I went to bed in the kitchen under ground; I always lie there; that was soon after eleven, and got up rather before six. My servant had scalded her leg, and she was in bed in the garret; some distance from them, not over their heads, but over another part of the house; she had not been down some days.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any cries of a woman?</p>
               <p>Allen. Indeed I could not distinguish the voice of a woman so far off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any body cry out for help?</p>
               <p>Allen. To the best of my knowledge I did not. I heard a noise between eleven and twelve; but I was weary, and went to bed: when I got up the young woman was standing at my street-door. I hearing the door open, and not shut, I got up, because there were two people in the garret that were to go out at six. I had put my cloaths on, but being very ill, lay down again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen Ann Ward before?</p>
               <p>Allen. No, never to my knowledge. I asked her what brought her there, or to whom she belonged? she told me she was pick'd up somewhere about Spring Garden, and decoyed into the house by one or two gentlemen, and they had ravished her, and robbed her of 1 s. and 4 d.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of condition did she appear to be in?</p>
               <p>Allen. She seemed to be a little flurried: I did not examine her. She went away after staying about half an hour. She told me she had been very badly used: she went immediately to Justice Garnon, and fetch'd a warrant for me; she had told me she would fetch a warrant for them, and she had no money; I said, if she came to me I would lend her a shilling, because I did not like their proceedings, and I would be gl ad to get them out of my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lend her a shilling?</p>
               <p>Allen. No, I did not, because I had no silver I was taken with a warrant before Justice Garnon about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the prisoners in your house at the time the girl was with you in the morning?</p>
               <p>Allen. No; Caswell and Fitzgerald went out between five and six.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Sullivan?</p>
               <p>Allen. I suppose he was in bed; but I did not go up to see, for I dare not. I saw Sullivan about eight at the street door; he came down stairs; the other two never came more into my house They would make me find those gentlemen: Justice Garnon granted a warrant in order to take them up. Sullivan came in between eight and nine at night; we took him: I never saw the other two till I saw them before the justice.</p>

               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I am an assistant to the maid, because she has scalded her foot. When she went up stairs I saw the skirt of her gown; I did not see her face.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Stevens. It was about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went up with her?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176207140024"/>Stevens. Nobody went up stairs but herself; and Sullivan called to Mrs. Allen for a candle, and in the mean time she went up stairs; when Sullivan had a candle he followed her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Fitzgerald or Caswell that night?</p>
               <p>Stevens. No, I did not: I went out into the street, being willing to see, and I saw two women sitting in the window, and there was no noise among them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you lie in the house?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I do; in the one pair of stairs room.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I went to bed about half an hour after eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get up the next morning?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I got up a little after seven.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you lie in a fore or back room?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I lie in the fore room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise?</p>
               <p>Stevens. No. I did not the least noise as is.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you sleep sound?</p>
               <p>Stevens. No, I never slept sound at all that night. They lay a great way from where I lay; they might have made a noise, and I not heard them: our house is a double house, and the room they were in is three rooms from mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first see your mistress?</p>
               <p>Stevens. She had her cloaths on sitting in the kitchen. I did not see the young woman at all till I saw her at the justice's: her aunt, I believe it was, came between seven and eight o'clock, and said her kinswoman had been ill used; she asked for Mrs. Allen. Soon after Sullivan came in I asked him how they came to use the young woman so; he said he did not use her ill. There were two or three women there, and he turned them down stairs; one of them wanted to pick a gentleman's pocket.</p>

               <p>Caswell to Prosecutrix. Pray, how did I meet with you in the Park? Did you not catch hold of my sword behind, and ask me where I was going?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Caswell. Did you not ask me where I lodged? and I said at Mrs. Allen's; and you said, that was a house that entertained girls.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I told you I did not know; and I asked you what a house it was.</p>
               <p>Caswell. Did you not go into the bedchamber willingly?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. No, I never saw the bedchamber till after I was forced into it, after eleven at night.</p>
               <p>Caswell. Did you not lie down on the bed of your own accord?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Caswell. Did I strip?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. That I do not know.</p>
               <p>Caswell. Did I catch your hand in my pocket?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. No, you did not.</p>
               <p>Caswell. Did I not bid you go out of the room?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. No, you locked me into the room.</p>
               <p>Caswell. Did I go to call the watch?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I believe he did go to call the watch, but there was no watch came.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the watch called for?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. That I do not know.</p>
               <p>Caswell. Did you lay your hands on Fitzgerald's neck and say, pray do not call the watch, for if you do I am ruined for ever.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I believe Fitzgerald did hinder me from being murdered.</p>
               <p>Caswell to Allen. What kind of a house do you keep?</p>
               <p>Allen. I keep a very sober house, and I desired them to go out of my house, for I was afraid of my life. I had put off my cloaths, and put them on again; for I was afraid of their coming down and murdering me, that is the truth.</p>
               <p>Caswell's Defence.</p>
               <p>The girl that lay in the next room all the night is here to be examined.</p>
               <p>Sullivan's Defence.</p>
               <p>I have nothing to say. She came to the door, I was getting a bowl and glasses ready, and a gallon of shrub, against my master came home; I said half a gallon would not satisfy them.</p>

               <p>Q. to A. Ward. Did you go into the dining room after you had been in the bed room?</p>
               <p>A. Ward. No, I never did; I never was out of the bed room till I found the way out myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they stay in the bed room?</p>
               <p>A. Ward. Two of them staid with me; but Sullivan did not stay above a quarter of an hour.</p>

               <p>A. Ward. I charged him with having a hand in my pocket, and then he charged me; this was after he had laid with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the watch being called?</p>
               <p>A. Ward. There was something about calling the watch, but that was from the dining room.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that?</p>

            , Esq; I live in Poultney-street; I am a student in the Middle Temple, and am a justice of peace in the county of Kerry in Ireland; I was sent for by Caswell to go to justice Garnan's; he was in distress there. I told Mr. Garnan I should be glad to see what was the charge against these young men. He took out the examination which was given against them, he read it to me; when he had gone through them, I asked, what was to be done for these people? I said, by the case they are bailable; because to the best of my judgement I thought so.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you think so?</p>
               <p>Rowen. There was nothing charged positive; it was rather an attempt to ravish I told them I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176207140026"/> would get the best bail I could. Sir, said the justice, are you a house-keeper. I said, I am not, but I would join with them. I sent for my taylor, and desired he would come down; he accordingly came down. I applied to the prisoners to know if they had any body else to be bail for them. Then the justice said he would do nothing in the affair till he saw the prosecutrix. Sir, said I, is she to think them sufficient, or you? Upon which I waited a considerable time, and found there was nothing to be done in it; I thought there was something singular in it. I went for advice. After that I was told the prosecutrix was come, and was at justice Garnan's. I went to Caswell, and asked what was done? He said, nothing; the door was locked; Mr. Garnan said he was not ready for us yet; and in a quarter of an hour there was word sent he was ready; then there was an absolute rape sworn; then I said, it is an odd affair, and made some little annotations of my own; that this lady's place of abode was not mentioned; and, in the second place, there was a rape sworn only against Caswell; then the girl said the other men had done the same; then that was interlined. I found there was nothing to be done, either good, bad, or indifferent, but they must go to gaol. Said I to Caswell, put it out of your head, you must go to gaol; they were carried to the Gatehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of your own knowledge of this affair?</p>
               <p>Rowen. On Monday the fifth of July

             came to Mrs. Allen's while I was there. Mrs. Allen had a mind to lock the door; I said, you shall not while I am here. I said, Miss Ward, you see what an unfortunate condition these poor creatures are in, tell me the case. I asked her where Caswell picked her up? She said, in Spring Gardens. I asked her, did she consent to go to his lodgings? She said, she expected genteel treatment; but she had the contrary. She told me Caswell gave her a box, and she got a mark, pointing near her eye; she declared solemnly she had been robbed by these people of one shilling and four-pence; and said, she could swear to a guinea, if she pleased: then she swore she would lose her life or have satisfaction. I asked her, what satisfaction she expected? She bid me go to justice Garman, and he would tell me. I said I had been there, and could not meet with him. I said, in the name of God, can you be so bitter to take those peoples lives, when you confess you was a street-walker? Then she abused me for what I had said before the justice. I beg my lord she may be confronted by me; I know she will not deny a little.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the prisoners?</p>
               <p>Rowen. I have known Caswell from his infancy: he is a man of character.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he would be guilty of such a thing as this?</p>
               <p>Rowen. Since I see this affair before me, I will not pretend to say.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Caswell's business?</p>
               <p>Rowen. His father is an attorney in Ireland. He came over here to raise forty men for the government's service: he has lodged in three places; the first place he was eaten up with bugs: he left that and came to Mrs. Allen's, and that was not of the best character; there are women of bad character come there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lodge in Golden Square?</p>
               <p>Rowen. No, he never did; the last lodging he was in was next door to me; he was not there long, for he was sent to the Gatehouse.</p>
               <p>Justice Garnan. I am ready to be sworn, if the court think proper.</p>
               <p>[He is sworn.]</p>
               <p>Justice Garnan. There was but one examination taken of this young woman; this is it [producing one]; she came and made a complaint on the Wednesday morning, and told me the story almost exactly as she has done here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she complain of an attempt to ravish her, or that she had actually been ravished?</p>
               <p>Garnan. She told the circumstances as now, and I apprehended it a rape; but I was tender, as she had told me of having been picked up in the park, and it made me a little delicate; the circumstances were extreamly strong.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the first and only examination?</p>
               <p>Garnan. This is the first and only examination which she signed; there were, previous to this, papers taken down, and I ordered my clerk to reduce them into one; there were what she said at first; what she said when I granted my warrant to take up Allen; and then what she said on other examinations: the old woman promised to do the best she could to take them; she said she thought they would come in the evening; and in the evening Sullivan came and was taken; he was brought to me, and I sent him to St. Martin's round-house. Mrs. Allen declared he came down stairs with a drawn sword, and threatened her. The young woman did charge all three with having lain with her.</p>

            . I live in the Strand. I have known the prisoner above a year by sight. I had kept the prisoner out of charity for near a month.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is she?</p>
               <p>Moise. Her brother told me to-day she is twenty years of age. I left her in charge with these things, and went out last Sunday, about twelve o'clock. When I came home she was gone, and left my door open. She did not come home. I went to bed, and in the morning I missed the things mentioned in the indictment. She owned she had taken the things, and had pawned them at different places.</p>
               <p>Three different pawnbrokers produced the several things, and deposed the prisoner pawned them.</p>

               <p>Q. What did she die of?</p>
               <p>Thatcher. I believe of that wound on her head. She said the prisoner gave it her by flinging her down.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she tell you this?</p>
               <p>Thatcher. About 3 or 4 days before she died.</p>
               <p>Mr. Allen. I am a surgeon. I attended the deceased. The two women were drinking together.

             desired the deceased to go out of her house several times. The deceased said she was afraid of her husband, and chose to stay all night.

             took her by the right arm, and desired her to go out; the other catched hold of the door-case, and desired her to stay in. There were then high words on both sides. Then Cooper said, if you do not get out, I will knock you down, and kill you.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those her words?</p>
               <p>Allen. I think so. They were both very much in liquor. At last the prisoner got her out. She went a little way, and came back again, and said, the people that lived here before you were hanged you b - h. The prisoner had not struck her then, but desired her to go out. What shall I be hanged for? said the prisoner. The other replied, if you kill me, you will be hanged. The prisoner gave her a push on the breast, and said, you b - ch get home. She fell on her back, and received three wounds, but the scull was not fractured in the least. The prisoner's husband came and took her up. Then she and he went in and shut the door. Afterwards the deceased came to the threshold, and said, mistress, I am not gone. She put her hand to her head, and found it bloody. I took her home, and dressed her head. Next morning she was brought to me by two women. The wound seemed to be in a fair way. She lived very irregularly. I do not look upon it that this wound was the cause of her death. I believe the prisoner did what she did with intention to put her from the door.</p>

As soon as I came home a lady wanted some muslin, then I missed a piece, and mentioned it to my man. On Saturday the 19th she came again, she bought a yard of muslin, and away she went. I followed her, and got an acquaintance, Mr. Lewis, to go with me to dodge her. She went into Mr. Webster's shop in Bond-street. I sent Mr. Lewis into the shop to tell him we suspected her to be a shop-lifter; they searched her, and found a piece of muslin upon her. The next morning she confessed she had taken mine, and had sold it to Mrs. Freeman the other prisoner, who lives in Germyn-street, for 13 s.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was there of your muslin?</p>
               <p>Vere. There were upward of 14 yards of it, it cost me 4 s. 2 d. a yard. Justice Wright granted a warrant to search Mrs. Freeman's house, where we found about 7 yards and a quarter. I was certain it was part of the same I lost. Freeman said she bought it of Seward.</p>
