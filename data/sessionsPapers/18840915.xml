I live at 11, Powis Square, Bays-water—I am a private gentleman, married, and have been travelling in Europe with my wife about four months—on Saturday freeing, 2nd August, about half-past 8, I was in Hyde Park, in the neighbourhood of the Marble Arch—I had come into the park by the Marble Arch—while I was walking along a man accosted me—he asked me for a light for hit pipe—I gave him one—I then continued to walk on, talking with him, some hundred yards—I then sat down on the grass; the man sat down beside me—about a minute and a half after we were sitting on the graft the prisoner came up and said, "I am going to take you to the police-station for improper behaviour unless you give me some security"—I then saw with whom I had to deal—he was alone; the other man was sitting by my side—in order to gain time I said to the prisoner, "Come oat of the park, and I will settle with you"—the other man told him not to take me or him to the police-station, and he would give any guarantee, he would give all he had—the prisoner said he wanted the settlement there and then—he caught hold of my watch chain, and finding myself in a lonely spot I took from my purse, without taking it out of my pocket, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and gave them to the prisoner—this occurred between the police-station and the reservoir, two or three minutes' walk from the Marble Arch—I don't know the park well—the moment I gave the money to the prisoner I saw a constable about 20 yards off, and I ran up to him and made a communication to him—the prisoner saw the constable before I did, and he and the other man ran away together—I and the constable ran after them—the other man got away; the constable caught the prisoner—I and the other man had not been seated on the grass above a minute or a minute and a half; I know the time, because them oment I sat down I rolled a cigarette, and had not time to light it—there is no truth in saying that I had conducted myself improperly in any way.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I said at the police-court that I had 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. about me—I did not mention it at the station because I was not asked—you said I had exposed myself—I got up a few moments after<lb/>wards, and you caught hold of my chain, and then I gave you the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have no recollection of having stated before the Magistrate that I had walked 500 yards with the strange man—I wanted to get you out of the park to be in sight of a constable—I was not smoking at the time you came up, I had not had time to roll a cigarette—I was within 20 yards of the road; it was not a secluded spot, but I afterwards found that the park was a rendezvous of you gentlemen—when I gave you the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. you did not say that was not what you wanted—when I got up from the grass I did not begin adjusting my dress—I was at the police-station four or five minutes.</p>

On Saturday night, 2nd August, a few minutes past 10 o'clock, I was on duty in Hyde Park, coining off duty, midway between the reservoir and the police-station in the park—I saw three men having an altercation; they stood on the grass, the prisoner, prosecutor, and the man that escaped; they were about 100 yards from me—the prosecutor came up and complained of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. being taken—I saw the other two men running away in the direction of the Marble Arch; I ran after them; they were then about 300 yards from me—I got up to about 20 yards of them, when one of them said, "Here</p>

               <p>he comes, separate"—they then separated; one went towards the Marble Arch, and the prisoner towards the top end of the reservoir—I ran after him and caught him—I said, "How is this?"—he made no reply—I took him back to the prosecutor, who had come after me—I said, "Is thin the man?"—he said, "That is the man that took my 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—the prisoner said, "You gave it to me"—the prosecutor said, "Yes, as you threatened to take me to the police-station"—the prisoner made no reply to that—I took him to the station; the prosecutor went with me—at the station the prisoner was charged—he gave his name as Henry Phillips—I asked his address—he said, "I shall hold that from you"—I searched him and found 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver and 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze, two pocket-knives, and a latchkey—he took 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of his pocket before I searched him and said, "There is your money, take it back, I don't want it"—he also said that the prosecutor had his trousers undone at the time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Wright said:</hi> "I am the man that's done this. I carry the revolver not to frighten but to fight them. I first got over the wall, and then into the yard and tried the door, which I found was secured. I tried to force it, but found it would make too much noise to do it. I got up again on the roof of the shed in the yard. I threw the catch off the back-parlour window and opened it. I searched it thoroughly, and took what I thought was worth taking out of it. I found I could get no further, as it would make too much noise. I managed to climb up to the bath-room window. I came downstairs and opened the back yard door. I then retained to the parlour, back and front. I got a few sealskin bags together, and put them outside on packing-cases. I was opening the plate cupboard when I heard some one coming downstairs. I then went out of the place quiet. I walked up to the churchyard. I should think it was about 3.15. I got over there and sat down. I was there about two hours, when I heard a gate open the other side and footsteps coming up the pothway. I see it was a constable that came towards the railings, which parted both me and him. Prisoner Wheatley was then on my right-hand side. As soon as the constable came I challenged him; I bid him keep away or I would send a bullet through him. I was the nearest to the constable. He got up on the railings to get over, when I walked from where I was to the gate to gel over. I did not lake notice at the time of this man (<hi rend="italic">Wheatley</hi>) where he was. I let the constable get over the railings, and I told him if he didn't keep silence, or moved another toot, I'd shoot him. I backed to the railings about four yards; I put my foot in the middle, and I was up on the top, when I heard a rush. I jumped over quickly and turned round; I see the constable about a yard off at the other end. This man (<hi rend="italic">Wheatley</hi>) at the time was getting over the railings, when I see him catch hold of Wheatley. I then came a foot near the railings. I see Wheatley turn round; he had no revolver in his hand. I was going to get over, but a man came up who the constable Garner called on, in the name of the Queen, to assist him. I bid him stand away or I'd send a bullet through him. About three minutes the constable and Wheatley was struggling together. I fired a bullet at the constable's right shoulder about Id yards away. Another man on the right-hand side was there who was called to assist the constable. I told him to keep away or I'd shoot him. I felt some one throwing some things at the back of me, when I stepped across the road and told him if be didn't come down I'd send a bullet through him. I came back again and stood in the gutter, so as I should have both the men in front of me. Constable Garner called several times to assist him id the name of the Queen. I told him if they attempted to get over the rails I'd shoot 'in. I then see Wheatley draw his revolrer; as noon as he did the constable catched hold of him; it seemed to be a very easy matter to get it away too. He pointed it at my head; I moved about from side to side as quick as I could, so that he could not get an aim at me. About two minutes after he had the revolver his body was swung a little on one side, when I pointed my revolver and fired at him where I thought I could <hi rend="italic">drop</hi> him; I fired at the lower part of him. I then turned round and saw I was pursued in all directions, and see it was</p>

               <p>useless to fight any more for this man (<hi rend="italic">Wheatley</hi>), so thought I'd have a try for my own liberty. I ran about 20 yards down a street opposite me, and walked about 10. I was in the middle of about eight men and two constables, who was running up the stroet, when a man from the window on the other side shouted out, 'That's one of 'em, catch him hold.' I challenged one constable, and told him to keep away or I'd send a bullet through him, when the other one came rushing up at my left side with his stick drawn; I turned round and fired. I then made off for my liberty. I ran down a court where I thought I could get over some yards, and I found it was blocked up. There was a pair of steps there; I ran up these steps and jumped on to a low house; from there I got on to two more higher still. I knocked out my three empty cartridge cases and put three full ones in. I fired but three shots in all. I made my way round to see if I could get away round East Road way, when a man came up about 6 foot; I was about 35 yards away. Told him if he didn't go back I'd shoot him. He asked me if I had shot anybody. I walked up towards him about 20 yards; I said, 'No, if you don't get down I'll b——y well shoot you.' He said, 'All right, and away he went. I then made towards Britannia Street towards the yard. I found I could not get the way I wanted to go, so I come back again. Several policemen were up there, and two or three civilians and a rifleman; they were calling out to the rifleman, 'Shoot him.' I got behind some stacks of chimneys about 40 yards away, and worked my way up towards him; when I got near enough to take an aim at him he ran away. Several more constables were there: I told them if they'd come a foot nearer I'd send a bullet through them. I was holding on to the chimney-pots at the time. I made my way towards Nile Street When I came back again I found they were there. I challenged several, and told them if they didn't go down I'd shoot 'em. When I cleared the roof of them I made my way towards the timber-yard down the East Road. When I was crossing by the timber-yard a little boy shouted out, 'There he goes,' which caused all the mob to come the way I was going. I then came back again, and tried to make my way back to Nile Street backways. While I was jumping from a high house on to a low one my left foot went through the roof; the chamber of my revolver hit on the ridge of the roof, and the chambers bounced right out, I am sorry to say. I tried to put it together again, but found I couldn't. When I got back again the constables and several others got on the roofs again. I pointed my revolver, and bid them stand away or I'd shoot them. They began throwing stones and bricks at me in all directions. I had plenty of the same sort, so I let them go as quick as I could pick them up. I was on the roof for half an hour after my revolver had broken. I was aiming tiles and bricks at them. I challenged several of the constables and the rifleman to keep away or I'd send a bullet through them. When the rifleman got too near I hit him in the chest with a brick. I was getting from a high house to a low one, and I shlipped a bit. I was surrounded in all directions, when two or three made a rush at me. I had no weapon to defend myself with, when a mob of them. I had hold of me and split my head with the butt part of a rifle. I was kicked and fairly slaughtered. I might have shot more. I was fighting for my liberty; if they had not come near me I should not have shot them."</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of A. and R. Scott, of Glasgow—we deal in oatmeal biscuits and oat-flour—in December last we advertised in the Times for an agent in London, and received this answer, signed "F. Carver." (<hi rend="italic">Offering himself for the appointment.</hi>) I ultimately saw the prisoner, who referred me to Benjamin Dormer, of Plymouth—I wrote to Mr. Dormer, and received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">starting that Mr. Dormer had gone to reside in Devonshire and changed his address.</hi>)—I then wrote to Mr. Dormer, and received this reply: "Jan. 30th. Mr. Carver represented our firm eight years; lie is a man of integrity."—I then consented, and among other orders which I received from the prisoner was one from Mr. Corbyn, of Wetge Road, Hammersmith, for six cases, at Km. 81., subject to discount—I dispatched the goods by the Caroline steamship, on 20th February, and in March we received this second order for six 10 lb. tins, value 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we dispatched them by the Tay, and in April received an intimation from the prisoner that he had supplied other goods from stock in London in his custody, and another order in May from stock—we sent invoices with all the goods to Corbyn, believing that he was a different person to the prisoner, or we would not have supplied them—we believed that it was a genuine order, and that Corbyn was carrying on a genuine business—this letter of June 21st (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is from the prisoner, announcing Corbyn's removal to 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Hanway Street, Oxford Street—I addressed some letters there, which I have received back from the police—my partner came up to London in July, and the prisoner was dismissed—we did not then know these cir<lb/>cumstances with regard to Corbyn, but on ascertaining these circum-stances we instituted this prosecution—Corbyn has not paid us anything, nor has any one else with regard to these goods—we have not entered into lay arrangement with the prisoner to trade in an assumed name.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We have given the prisoner the value of about 71<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—I believe he began civil proceedings against us—he did not serve any writ, but the solicitor wrote a letter threatening legal proceed<lb/>ing—my partner went to the prisoner's office and burst open his desk</p>

               <p>and took away his papers—I did not know anything about this charge at that time—I have seen the statement of accounts sent by his solicitor—I know that the name of Corbyn figures there; it is in the list as a liability to himself; he debits himself with the goods supplied to Corbyn—com<lb/>mission would be deducted—the prosecution was not undertaken for some days afterwards—the prisoner was offered the choice of canceling the agency agreement—I have never heard of wholesale houses supplying retail customers through branch establishments—the prisoner took the premises in Finsbury Square in March, about a month after the agree<lb/>ment—we did not Bend any goods before the premises were taken because he had no place to store them—goods were sent to his orders in March, but not to Finsbury Square; the order is sent by Carver and the goods are sent to Corbyn—the prisoner agreed to pay 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the office rent, but he did not pay it—we did not consider that any commission was due to him, because we never received payment for a single order in London—we invoiced the accounts to hi Borders, but received none of those amounts—all the articles except Corbyn'e were sold <hi rend="italic">bond-fide</hi> to respectable cus<lb/>tomers to the best of my belief, and we shall get the amounts in due course, and the commission will be due to the prisoner on his bond-Jib orders—he wrote to us very frequently about the business and got us several customers, and pushed our work to a certain extent—a good many of these goods were supplied in the names of people given to me—Mr. Spratt was one, and Mr. Williamson, of Bournemouth, another—Hamilton, of Brighton, was the only other person supplied through. Corbyn—the phrase used was "Spared by Corbyn"—he was to work for us from February 5th—there had been no settlement of his commission.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My partner broke open the desk at our office in Fins<lb/>bury Square—the books, papers, and furniture, were ours—we have not received a farthing of the 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on this list, and irrespective of that there is a balance of 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. due to us from the prisoner—we received this letter from the prisoner.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I opened a desk belonging to the firm at Finsbury Square—the prisoner was not using it, he was dismissed, and I was using it at the time—the prisoner was to pay 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year out of his commission towards the rent—he was our only representative in London—we received no money, and there was paid him no commission from us—he receded this 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in this list—he would have had his commission, but all money was to be sent to us in full to Glasgow—the rule in trade is for the agents to send us the money, and we send the commission back—we only send samples of oat flour at retail prices; after that we refer the customer to Mr. Glendinnng, of London Wall—I told the prisoner that if he would cancel the agreement we would not proceed against him, but</p>

I live at 6, Steven's Acre, Poplar—I am single—the prisoner and his wife lived at No. 3, Steven's Acre—it is a three-roomed house; they occupied the whole of it—they had two children, Johnny, aged seven, and Tommy, aged four—on 23rd July, about 6 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner was playing with the two children outside the house; he had bought them some sweets—his wife was there too—later on, at a quarter to 10 o'clock, I was in the street speaking to Mrs. Kelly's daughter, Ellen, and saw the little boy Johnny come out of the buck way of the house crying—his head was bleeding—Tommy then came out crying, his head was also bleeding—Mrs. Sapsford came out of her house; she took Johnny and I took Tummy and carried them down to the bottom of the court, and then two men took them to the hospital, and I followed—I afterwards came back from the hospital and saw the prisoner taken away in custody—the prisoner's wife was there—she was quite sober—I afterwards saw Tommy's dead body at the hospital on the following Wednesday—I also saw Johnny at the hospital.</p>

I am a pork-butcher, at 318, High Street, Poplar, about two minutes' walk from Steven's Acre—on Wednesday night, 23rd July, about 20 minutes to 10 o'clock, I was in my shop; the prisoner rushed into the shop—I may have seen him before, but I did not know much of him—he appeared very excited, in a half-mad state—he appealed to me to give him a saveloy, saying "It is the last one I shall have in Poplar"—I gave him one, and he began to eat it—while he was there Mr. Mace came in and spoke to me, and said "This man is mad, he has got a hammer"—the prisoner was near enough to hear—I said "What do I care about his hammer? my knife is equal to his hammer"—I had not seen that the prisoner had anything with him, but afterwards I saw this chopper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said to the prisoner "Hand the hammer up", and he then passed this chopper to me across the counter—it is a plas<lb/>terer's hammer—he said "Take this chopper, I have just killed my two little children with it"—I said "Nonsense, man, I don't believe it"—he said nothing more—Meedon, the constable, came in through the crowd that was standing at the door—he spoke to the prisoner and told me to take care of the chopper—I afterwards gave it up to the police—when I took possession of it there was some slight blood on one corner; it looked like moist blood.</p>

I am house surgeon at Poplar Hospital—on 23rd July, a little before 10 o'clock at night, the prisoner's two children were brought there—the elder one, John, was about seven years old, and Thomas, the younger one, about four—I examined the head of Thomas, and found a compound depressed fracture of the skull on the left side of the frontal bone, about three inches long—the membranes of the brain were torn through, and the brain was ruptured, and protruding through the fracture—he died on Sunday night, 3rd August—I made a post-mortem examination; the cause of death was <hi rend="italic">meningitis</hi> from the injury to the brain—a blow from such a chopper as the one produced would cause those injuries—the boy John is still alive; he left the hospital this week; he also had a compound fracture of the skull.</p>

I live at 48, Herries Street, Queen's Park—the last witness is my sister—on Saturday night, 9th August, I was at that house—I could not form any opinion at all of the time—my sister said something to me, and I heard a noise down in the basement, a kind of scuffling—then the door burst open, and Mrs. Harris rushed out and exclaimed "Oh" twice—I followed my sister to the foot of the stairs—I heard something and said, "He is pouring water over her"—I went back and got a light, and looked down the stairs; I saw the prisoner's wife standing at the foot of the stairs in 'her nightdress, bleeding from the throat—I went downstairs then with the light, and saw the prisoner standing at the kitchen doer in his shirt only—I pushed him up against the door and called him a scoundrel—I looked in his left hand to see if he bad anything in it; he had nothing—I said, "You have killed the woman outright"—he said, "I meant to do it; I have done it like a man, and I will die like a man"—I said, "What did you do it for?"—he said, "she has not given me anything to eat for two days"—I said, "What did you do it with?"—he made no reply—I noticed that his right hand was covered with blood—he returned into the back kitchen and offered me some papers—I followed him in there with the light—I told him to place the papers on the desk and give them to the constable when he came—he put them on the drawers—there was more than one piece of paper—I did not take them—I told him to get himself dressed, and he</p>

The other part was taken by Inspector Morgan; I was present and saw him write it—when the charge was read over to the prisoner, and he was being searched, this was all read over to him, and he said it was quite correct—at a later period, when the evidence of the last witness was being taken, the statement of Inspector Morgan was made, and the prisoner said "What I said was that I had done it," and Inspector Morgan wrote that down at, the time; it was merely a correction of the other man's evidence, who said "I am the man that done it.".</p>

I am a widow, and lire at 14, Cursitor Street, where I carry on a general shop—on 18th August the prisoner, whom I knew by eight, came into my shop about 10 minutes to 2 o'clock for a pennyworth of shag—he put down a shilling—I gave him the change and he walked out—directly he had gone I looked at the shilling, and found it was bad—there were no other shillings in the till—I gave it to the police—I went and looked for the prisoner out could not find him—next day, the 19th, a man came into my shop and tendered me a shilling, which I found was bad—I bit it, it felt very gritty, and I broke it in the tester—I laid down the pieces to show him it was bad, and he picked them up and walked out—I did not go out, as I had to serve another customer, but I looked through the window and saw him speak a word to the prisoner, who was waiting outside—I went to the door and looked, and he walked away at once—I did not see anything done—I had seen neither of them before that day—when I saw it I sent for a constable, gave him the shilling, and told him what had occurred, and gave a description, and James Eagle took the prisoner on the 20th, the day after, at the Na<lb/>tional Chambers, Took's Court, Cursitor Street—I was there when he was brought down, soon after 7 o'clock in the morning, and I identified him among the three men who were standing there—I said "That is the man"—he made no answer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab driver, and live at 12, Stafford Mews—about 2 in the afternoon of 10th August I went into the coach-house there to put a perambulator in—it was my coach-house—I had some rabbits and chickens there, and a goat belonging to a friend of mine—the prisoner went into the stable with me—I am landlord of the whole place, but I let the stable and part of the coach-house to a man named Chandler—the prisoner was employed there; he did No. 1 at few shillings a week—I saw him deliberately kick the goat under the jaw and on the point of the elbow—I told him for that brutality I would not have him in my place, for his blackguarding my wife also—when I spoke about the goat he said he would serve me the same—I then went into the stable to lock him out—he was outside—I told him I would send for a policeman—he made a rush at the door and forced the door open and I pushed him away and locked the door—with that he made a deliberate stab—I did not perceive that he had anything in his hand at the time, but I closed with him I found he had got a knife—I felt that I was stabbed; the blood flowed down—I closed with him; he then made a second stab and cut me on the forehead, there are the marks now—the knife was open in his hand and it shut and cut my thumb in trying to take it away—I then got the stable fork and struck at him—he took the fork away and struck my wife on the head—I do not think I hit him, I was bleeding so I could not see—I then went for the police—the prisoner ran away and we could not find him for some time—about 5, or a quarter past 5, he came into the mews and he was taken into custody and charged—the doctor attended to my wounds and sewed them up at 5 o'clock—before the prisoner stabbed me he drew his hand from his coat, he did not take his coat off—he did not want me to fight him—he never mentioned about fighting—during the struggle he fell to the ground, and I was uppermost for a time—I cannot tell what became of the knife.</p>

                  </hi>. On 10th August, about 2 in the afternoon, I was coming downstairs and heard Buckingham tell the prisoner not to kick the goat—the prisoner said the goat had no right in the stable—Buck<lb/>ingham said it had, it belonged to the man that had the stables; and he said he would get a constable and have the prisoner put out, that he had been abusing me—the prisoner said he would not be put out, and then he began attacking Buckingham; he got hold of him and got him down, in fact they both fell—I did not see anything in the prisoner's hand at that time, but he came in afterwards and picked a knife up; I saw it lying in the stable in the place where the struggle had been—it was open—I saw the prisoner pick it up, put it in his pocket, and go out of the stable—I could not say for certain whether he shut it—I saw Buckingham's head bleeding dreadfully, and I said to him "You are bleeding, run and fetch a constable"—Buckingham got the stable fork to defend himself, and the prisoner wrenched it from him and struck me across the head with it, and I said "Oh, Jim, he has hit me"—while Buckingham was gone for a constable the prisoner came back again to take the key out of the stable door—I said "Don't take that away, Arthur, it has nothing to do with you"—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188409150041"/>
               <p>gave me a push and said "You get oat of the way, you b——mare, it has nothing to do with you"—he then went away—he came again about 5 o'clock to see to his horses, and he was given in custody—the knife was a white handled pocket knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We used to call the prisoner Arthur—we knew him very well; he was on very good terms with my husband—he had abused me a fortnight previous; I told my husband, he was very indignant about it I told him not to say anything to the prisoner, but to treat him with contempt—he abused me on the Saturday before the Sunday also; he would not let me get my water, he fastened the door up and said, "You shan't come this way, you b——"but I did not tell my husband of that till the Sunday morning—he was very much annoyed about it; I said, "Don't take any notice of him," and he said "Very well," but he did not seem to fall in with my peaceable way of looking at it—my husband used to call the prisoner Arthur—there was a pail in the stable under<lb/>neath the window, about a yard and a half from the scene of this struggle—I was standing by the knife looking at it, but did not attempt to pick it up; I could have picked it up if I had liked—I was somewhat excited and flurried about this occurrence—when I came down Buckingham was remonstrating with the prisoner about the goat—I am quite certain I did not say to my husband, "Oh, Jim, you have hit me," meaning accidentally.</p>

About 2 o'clock in the afternoon I was sent for to the mews—I saw the prosecutor there about half-past 2—he appeared to have an injury on the forehead, it was bandaged up—at 5 o'clock the same afternoon I took the prisoner in custody at the news—I said I would charge him with assaulting the prosecutor, who was landing there—the prisoner said, "Very well, I will go with you"—nothing was said about what it was done with, or anything about a knife, at the mews, but the prosecutor said, when we were in the Malvern Road, that the prisoner had stabbed him with a knife—I did not hear the prisoner say, "I used no knife"—I went to the prisoner's house and searched, but found no knife there.</p>

I live at 72, Gloucester crescent, and am divisional surgeon—at half-past 5 on the evening this occurred I went to the station and found the prosecutor there—I examined his forehead—I found two incised wounds about an inch in length and about three-quarters of an inch apart, two separate and distinct wounds, on the left-hand side of the forehead—there had been excessive bleeding, which had covered the man's face and chest—I examined the upper wound, some part of an artery had been divided; the wound went right down to the bone—I stitched it up and attended to him, and he went away—he is all right now—I should not call them dangerous wounds—I saw him again just as I was leaving the station; he was brought back again, and I found that my stitches and patch had all been knocked off from a fresh assault—he had been assaulted by some other man as he went into the mews again—they are such wounds as might have been inflicted by a stab by an open knife.</p>

I am a cab proprietor, of 8, Stafford Mews—on Sunday, the 10th, I saw prisoner come very rapidly out of the stables shortly after Buckingham had entered the Fame stable; then before he could recover himself he ran back towards the stable, and with both hands spread out he pushed the door open which had been shut, then I went from my door to see what was the matter, and when I got there the prisoner was on the ground—I stood at the door; the prisoner was just inside the stable lying on his back on the ground, and Buckingham on top of him, down also—then he managed to get up and rushed towards Buckingham, and he stepped back three or four paces and struck him several times in the face with his fist as hard as he could strike, whereupon Buckingham at once turned round to his left side, and took Hold of a pitchfork which was standing against the partition of the stable, and with both hands he struck the prisoner straight down across the head with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed by the London General Omnibus Company as foreman of the yard of the Windsor Castle, Hammersmith—Ayckbourne was a driver of an omnibus for the Company called Y Y G up to 11th June last—all our omnibuses are ear-marked in that way—on 11th June I had a report from Mr. Hare and directions to suspend him—I showed Ayckbourne the report a few days after I received it—Mr. Hare is the road manager of my district.</p>

Mr. Farrell says they are two as big blackguards as you have working for you"—that is all there was in the letter—there was a signature to it, "Yours truly, J. N. Hare"—it was addressed to me—I only have control over the drivers—Mir. Hare has control over the whole thing—when I am told to suspend a man that means to stop him from working till he sees Mr. Hare—when suspended we sometimes give a man his licence back—we do not write "Discharged" upon his licence and send him away—I wrote it upon Ayckbourne's licence because I thought he would be discharged, but if he had come back he would</p>

I live at Reeves' Cottage, Beech Street, Dalston—Reeves' colour works are at the corner, the cottage is opposite the side of the chapel—on the night of 1st December, 1882, about five minutes past 10, I went out to fetch the sapper beer—I passed by the chapel and down Ashwin Street, and along Dalston Lane to the Crown and Castle; I got my beer and was returning the same way back when my attention was first attracted by a policeman who had got hold of a man by the collar—I was then outside the coffee-house—I had turned the corner from Dalston Lane into Ashwin Street—the policeman was in the middle of the road, opposite the Railway Tavern, holding the man, and they then commenced struggling—they struggled back towards the chapel—they kept struggling till they got to No. 3, and then I heard a shot fired—I could see the reflection—it was then about a quarter-past 10—they then struggled again still down towards the chapel till they got to No. 7, which is next door to the chapel, and then another shot was fired—they struggled again till they got outside the chapel between the two doors, and then the constable fell—I did not hear either of them speak till the constable fell, then he cried out for help four times—I then turned back and went out of Ashwin Street into Dalston Lane to get assistance—up to that time I had seen nobody in Ashwin Street but the policeman and the man struggling with him—I did not see Mrs. Shepherd—as I was going out of Ashwin Street I heard two more shots fired—that was about two minutes afterwards—I had just then spoken to two policemen outside the oilshop; I had got there when I heard the last of the shots—the man that was struggling with the constable was wearing a long dark overcoat and a light pair of trousers, and it seemed to me like a</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The bill was put in and read in part; it gave a description of the murderer: age 21, height 5 feet 2 inches, complexion pale, round face, slight mistake; dress, long dark overcoat, light trousers.</hi>) I gave a description of the hat; the description was a black soft felt hat—on 1st February, 1884, I went to Coldbath Fields Prison—I went in with a warder—there were about seven men there in one of the large waiting-rooms of the prison—I went there for the purpose of seeing if I could identify the man I had seen on the night of 1st December, 1882—I first picked out a man on the left of the prisoner, he looked very much like him, but as the men were filing out of the room I caught the prisoner's side face, and I at once told Inspector Glass—I had not seen his side face before—the prisoner could not hear what I said—they were all taken out, and brought back again and placed in a different position, and I then picked the prisoner out—I have since had opportunities of seeing him, and I am positive he is the man I saw on that night—the day after 1st December;, 1882, I went with another police-constable to Ashwin Street, and there found under the stonework of the doorway of No. 3 and 6, 7 feet from the top stone step, a mark on a brick—it looked like a bullet mark—I found a similar mark by the gutter pipe between Nos. 3 and 5, Ashwin Street; they adjoin, and underneath the place on No. 3 where I saw the bullet mark there was some brickdust, as if just cut away—I am accustomed to pistol shots; in my opinion a pistol shot would make a mark like that—in consequence of a statement made by two men, Frederick Miles and Henry Mortimer, I went on 28th July, 1884, with Miles to Tottenham Marshes, and he pointed out a tree to me with a small wooden post in front of it—the spot where the tree is is halfway between the Ferry Boat public-house and the railway bridge over the Lea, in consequence of a statement made by Miles to me I examined the tree, and from it, about 4 feet from the ground, I cut out this bullet with a chisel (<hi rend="italic">This bullet was is a packet marked</hi>)—I went the same day, in consequence of what Miles said to me, to a place called Vicarage Road to endeavour to find the place where the pistol was bought, but I failed to do so—Nos. 21 and 23 were empty houses—it took me 10 minutes to run from Reeves Cottage to</p>

I am surgeon at the German Hospital—on 1st December, 1882, I was at the German Hospital—Mr. Krauss was house surgeon—on 2nd December I saw the dead body of Cole brought in, and Mr. Krauss in my presence made a post-mortem—there was a pistol-shot wound in the head over the back at the left ear, the bullet lodging in the brain; the bullet penetrated the skull—I saw Mr. Krauss extract a small pistol bullet similar to the two bullets that have been shown to me—there was a second wound at the back of the head fracturing the skull, which might have been caused by a fall on the pavement—Mr. Krauss has left this country—in my opinion the pistol-shot wound was the cause of death.</p>

                  </hi>. I now live at 9, Eudell Street, Shacklewell, Stoke Newington—on Friday, November 1st, 1882, I was living at 2, Welling<lb/>ton Road, Stoke Newington—I knew the prisoner at that time—I have known him somewhere about 10 years—I met him that day by accident—I afterwards saw Evans—I met Mortimer at the corner of the turning where he lived—I and the prisoner and Evans were together part of that day, and later on we went to the Star and Garter, and afterwards to the Walford; we got there between 5.30 and 6 o'clock—I went home from there and had tea, and came back afterwards—we three were together there about 8 o'clock—the prisoner said he was going to the Baptist Chapel in Ashwin Street to fetch away some plate—he asked me if I was going anywhere particular—I said "No"—I told him I would go with him—he said "Very well"—he said he wanted me to help him to carry the plate away—he said he was going to take it to his brother-in-law's, Tilley—he said he used to pay for a seat at the chapel—I saw some chisels; these are the two that I saw; the 1 1/4-inch and the cold chisel—he had some more, but he gave Evans those—I did not see them—I saw these in his hand in the Walford when I came back from tea—he did not say anything about these chisels—I did not see any revolver that night or any wedge—nothing was said about a revolver that night in my presence</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188409150057"/>
               <p>—I knew that he had a revolver before that night—I, Orrock, and Evans left the Walford together arid went to the Railway Tavern—we stopped in there a little while, and Orrock went out and came back again—that was somewhere about 9 o'clock—he said there were too many people about—he went out again; Evans went with him—then I went out; I did not join them then—I walked to the corner of Dalston Lane, and I saw Orrock and Evans coming across the road opposite Paternoster's lamp shop, against the Crown and Castle—Evans said that Orrock was going to buy a lamp—Orrock was then walking towards the lamp shop, he afterwards came back—I did not see the lamp—he did not say anything about it—he came back and joined us, and we went and had some drink in the Railway Tavern—Orrock went out again—I did not see where he went—I did not see him any more that light—Evans went out for some time, and came back, and when we were there together I heard a report—we thought they were some fog signals going off; I heard two or three reports—we came out; I saw somebody running by the door, and I looked down Ashwin Street, and went down to opposite Paternoster's stables in Beech Street, and there saw the policeman lying on the ground—I saw blood there; I saw Sergeant Ash, and asked him if I should fetch a doctor—I don't know where Evans was; I don't know whether he left the Railway Tavern with me—they did not want me to fetch a doctor—they said they would take the poor fellow to the hospital—I saw Evans afterwards standing at the back of me; near where the constable was—I afterwards went away home, and Evans too—the prisoner was dressed that night in ft long black coat, dark trousers, mixture trousers, and a soft felt hat—Evans put on the hat during the day; he took it from Orrock and tried it on, and said it fitted him nicely—I say the hat produced is the one he wore that night—I never saw the prisoner again till I was at Bow Street—in October I met him and Mortimer in Stoke Newington Road, and they told me they were going down to Tottenham to buy a revolver—the prisoner said it was advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Exchange and Mart</hi>, and he showed me the advertise<lb/>ment—I read it—I and Mortimer and the prisoner went together to Vicarage Road, the place mentioned in the advertisement—the prisoner left us there—I saw him go about a dozen doors down Vicarage Road to a private house—he returned in a short time, and said he had bought the revolver; that he had seen a young woman, the governor was not at home—he showed me the revolver; it was a small silver-plated one—smaller than this produced, I think—a smaller handle than that I should think; otherwise it was exactly the same as that; it was a pintire—there were also some small cartringes, 20 or 30, with a pin sticking out of them—on our way back it was suggested that we should try the revolver, and the prisoner fired at a tree—Mortimer was still with us; it was at some place between Vicarage Road and the railway bridge at the Lea, in Tottenham marches—I knew of this bill being issued—I never gave any informa<lb/>tion to the police until Sergeant Cobb came to me at the end of May this year—he spoke to me, and I then made a statement to him—I told him about this matter; I should have done so before it it had not been for that bill—I did not want the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not want people to think I wanted the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took Sergeant Cobb, and pointed out the place where the shot had been tired at the tree, and I saw him find the bullet.</p>

               <p>came back as the fog-signals, as I thought, were going off—I went out once before that, I went to the corner—I did not go out at all between the time Orrock went out and hearing the fog-signals—I have known the prisoner a great many years—I don't know about his giving me an overcoat at any time; I used to have a lot of clothes of him at one time—he had not given me an overcoat about 1st December, not of any kind—I was going to be a conductor of a tramcar about that time—he did not shortly before 1st December give me a long overcoat for the purpose of my being a conductor of a tramcar; I am quite sure about that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker, living at 19, Lever Street, St. Luke's—the prisoner was apprenticed to my father, a cabinet-maker—I read of the shooting of the constable on the 1st December 1882—the prisoner used to wear a hat like this one produced, a soft felt hat—in February, 1883, he sold a pair of light-coloured trousers to me; they had been split at both knees, and neatly mended—I also bought, about the first week in March, a long dark-grey overcoat of him—I after<lb/>wards gave that coat and another one of mine to a man named Green to pledge for me, and he gave me the money and the ticket—they were never redeemed, as I lost the ticket—the trousers were worn out and sold as old lumber.</p>

I live at 4, Diamond Court, Spitalfields, and am a cabinet-maker—I have known the prisoner for the last four or five years—I heard of the policeman being shot—I knew that the prisoner was apprenticed to Mr. Pottinger then; he was not at work at that time—about three or four weeks after the 1st December, 1882, I saw the pri<lb/>soner in the London Apprentice public-house—I said to him "This is rather a serious affair, shooting a constable at Dalston"—he did not take much notice of it, but merely smiled—I said "Tom, I think you know something about that, where is your hat?"—he said "I have left it at home, or somewhere else"—he was wearing a hard hat then—I could not swear that the hat produced is the one prisoner used to wear—I said "Where is your revolver?"—he used to have one in the shop—he said "Well, it is where no one will find it, at the bottom of some river, I believe"—I pawned two coats in March last for young Pottinger, and gave him the money.</p>

I live at 29, Greek Street, Soho, and am a cook by trade, but am not just now, I go out when I am called for—in August I saw the prisoner at the Three Greyhounds public-house, Greek Street—he said he had bought some gloves from a man for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and would let me have them for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him to give me two or three pairs to see what they were like—he went out of the bar and came back in a quarter of an hour and gave me three or four pairs similar to these, red, and blue, and black, unsewn—I did not settle with him then—about three days afterwards I saw him at the same place again—I told him to fetch the goods, and he fetched a big parcel of them, 112 dozen and eight pairs in a large cloth—they were the same as these in quality, but different colours—he gave me the parcel outside the Three Greyhounds, and I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I sold them all to a gentleman who trades under the name of Lemotte in Tichborne Street, Haymarket—he gave me 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the 112 dozen and 8 pairs the same day I got them—some little time after the police came to me, and I had some conversation with them.</p>

I live at 8, Tichborne Street, Haymarket, and carry on business as a glover under the style of Lemotte and Co.—on 14th August I believe a foreigner came to my shop with samples of gloves, of which these are some—on the 15th the same man came with Lebay and brought the bulk of them, between 112 and 113 dozen—I afterwards gave them to the police—they were all gloves of this diecrip<lb/>tion, different colours—I paid 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them; considering their state, only partly manufactured, they were not worth more to me; they were in fair condition—the price was low, I looked at the marks on them—I am not aware of having seen the man before who brought them to me—the other man called three times before Lebay came, bringing a few pairs each time.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective E</hi>). On the morning of 7th August I went with Sergeant Fox to 47, Neale Street, Long Acre, O'Keefe's lodging—O'Keefe was lying; on a mattress with Murray, a woman, and a child—the woman was Murray's wife; I believe they occupied one room—I began searching the room; I found 11 skeleton keys and a small <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> in a little recess at the end of the room covered over with some linen—I have since tried the keys at Mr. Steele's premises, 89, Great Pulteney Street; one of the skeleton keys opens the door quite easily—I found marks on the front and back parlour doors and a cupboard of that house which corresponds with the end of this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, which is very irregular—before the arrest, for about three weeks, I had kept observation on Haywood and O'Keefe—I had seen them constantly together at different hours—I went to Haywood's premises, 39, Colonnade, Russell Square, with Sergeant Fox, and took Haywood in custody; I found 10 keys, some of them skeleton, one of them fits Miss Hutchinson's house, 15, Burton Crescent—I was present with Inspector Sergeants Reader and Fox and two or three other constables at Chard's premises when they were searched—I saw the clocks found and the piece of cloth at the extreme end of the back shop—there was a large cupboard outside the wall that had the appearance of another wall, but it projected some few inches out—the cupboard was covered with some paper, and apparently had been whitewashed, and was nailed up; it had</p>

               <p>the appearance of a papered wall—I observed a crack in the paper, that led me to believe it was a cupboard—I forced it open, and found a quantity of spoons and forks in it, since identified by Mr. Large as having been stolen from his premises, and other stolen property—I made this list of property, the proceeds of different burglaries within 12 months, found at Chard's, and identified by persons who are here—I checked the list—it is correct.

I examined the premises very carefully—I did not examine Chard's room—I did not notice the walls of the room where this cupboard was found very particularly—there were a lot of small cupboards—I cannot say whether the walls of that room were papered or not—I will swear the cupboard did not stand about a foot from the wall—I should say it contained more than a hundred articles—there were shelves, and the large shelf was a foot wide—I should think the cupboard did not stand out a foot from the wall, because it was in a little recess—I cannot say if the back of the cupboard was the wall, I did not examine it—I should think it stood less than a foot from the wall—I do not know how it contained a shelf a foot wide—I do not wish to withdraw my answer about it being a foot wide—I cannot say if the paper on the cupboard was the same as that on the wall, it had the appearance of being whitewashed, I cannot say if the wall was white-washed—I saw no glass in the front of the cupboard; I will not swear there was not glass there—stolen articles were in the cupboard—the whole front of the cupboard was pasted over with paper—there was a crack right through where the doors swung open—the cupboard did not reach down to the ground, and only up to within three inches of the ceiling—there was a space between it and the wall on one side—you could not see the bottom of the cupboard till a heavy machine in front was moved away—it had no appearance of a cupboard—I watched O'Keefe and Haywood prior to their arrest—I did not see them going to Chard's house—I know Debenhain's in Garrick Lane—I cannot say that a good deal of stolen property is sold there—I don't know whether the lists of stolen property are sent to Debenham's, I have no doubt it is done—a list is given to pawnbrokers, Debenham is not a pawnbroker—the clocks were covered up in different pieces of dirty linen—it was a private house—I did not hear that the room in which these things were found was going to be whitewashed, and that was why the things were covered up—Chard got boisterous when Langrish appeared, and tried to escape—I believe he had lived in the same house for 30 years—a great number of his neighbours are here to speak for him—there was no lock on the cupboard, it was nailed up.</p>

On Thursday, 7th August, I went to 9, Lee Street, Burton Crescent, where Chard keeps a jeweller's shop—I saw him and said, I made a note of the conversation, "Have you purchased any clocks within the last week?"—he said, "I have had two or three left here to be altered"—I said, "Can you tell me who left them here?"—he said, "A dealer who lives in Albany Street"—I said, "Can you give me his name and address?"—he said, "Well, to tell you the truth, I bought them; I gave 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for one, 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for another, and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for another"—I said, "Do you know from whom you purchased them?"—he said, "From the same man in Albany Street, but I don't know who he is"—I said, "Have you any other clocks on the premises?"—he said "No"—I said, "I shall charge you with receiving these clocks, well knowing them to have been stolen"—there were three—I said, "Do you occupy the front shop of this house?"—he said, "No, it has nothing to do with me"—this conversation was in the passage of the house—he endeavoured to make his escape, was very violent, and two or three of us secured him without using unnecessary violence—the woman who said she was his wife told me the front room was Chard's—I searched it, and found there from 30 to 40 clocks, besides a number of other articles of jewellery—I asked him if he could account to me for the possession of one single article—he said, "They are all jobs"—I said, "Can you give me the names of any of your Customers for whom these jobs are being done"—he said, "No. they are all jobs, but I cannot give you the name of any one"—the clocks were all wrapped up in linen—I took him to the station and searched him—I found three keys on him, one of which fitted a locker—he said all the jewellery was in the front room, which did not belong to him—I there found a diamond ring and a loose stone identified by Mrs. Meshum, a watch and chain identified by Mr. Large—500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property was stolen in the case of Mrs. Meshum.</p>

I am the mistress of St. Matthias Infant School, 33, Hare Street, Bethnal Green—I produce a book of the scholars, among whom is William Francis, that is the little boy Barnett Jacobs—he was brought to the school on 6th May—my sister admitted him; I was away at the time—he was being brought up a Christian—he was a healthy little boy, well cared for and nourished, not very well clothed, but as well as poor people can afford—he brought his fee, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., week by week.</p>

There was a warrant issued between five and six years ago charging you with stealing a little boy"—she said "I didn't steal it; I went to try and find the mother, but could not"—the prosecutrix said "Did not you say, Mrs. Hall, that that was my little boy"—she said "Yes, that is your boy"—I then took her to Bishopsgate Street Police-station—on the warrant being read she said "I don't think I stole the child, he has cost me a lot of money"—she said she liked the child, and kept it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames Police Sergeant</hi>). On the morning of 11th August, about a quarter to 11 o'clock, I was with Francis in America Square, about 400 or 500 yards from Fenchurch Street Station, and saw a covered van belonging to the Great Eastern Railway standing in the square—the tarpaulin was thrown over behind—I heard some knocking, which attracted my attention to the van—I made a communication to Francis, and while passing the van I looked through the side and saw the prisoner hammering this large chest—there was nobody else in the van—I waited a minute or so, the knocking ceased—I then went quietly to the front of the van, and there saw the prisoner tilting up the end of this small chest, and the tea commencing to run out on to other tea lying on brown paper on a sack at the bottom of the van—I stood a second, and said "What are you doing? I am a police officer"—I was in plain clothes—he made no answer—I then went to get into the van; the prisoner dropped the small case—he had something in his right hand, I heard it drop on the floor on some straw—I searched and picked up this file—I get into the van, and found this tea exactly as it is now, on the brown paper—it does not weigh quite 3 lb.—I said, pointing to the tea, "How do you account for this?"—he said "It came out of this chest," meaning the large one on the ground—Francis said "Show us where it came out"—the prisoner turned the chest over two or three times, but failed to show any hole—he then said "Oh, I was going to put it back," pointing to the large case—I paid "That won't do for us, for that is the case you have just nailed up"—it was nailed up and intact then—we opened it afterwards and had it weighed—I took him then to the Seething</p>

I am a van boy in the Great Eastern Railway's employment, and was so on 11th August, when I was van boy to van 457, of which the prisoner was carman—I went with him on that morning to St. Olave's Warehouse in the Minories, and collected five caddies and three chests of tea to be forwarded to Colchester, where Miles comes from—when we had taken these in the van went on to America Square, where the prisoner sent me round to Fenchurch Street Station—before I went I noticed he put the sack in the van, and just as I got round the corner I saw him pull the tarpaulin over the back of the van—if that is down no one can see into the van—I went to Fenchurch Street Station, where we have to call every day, and when I came back the van had gone in charge of the police—when Mr. Miles let down the packages by the crane I put them in the van—they were all sound.</p>

               <p>have had to carry partially broken with the tea coming out, and this file has been used to nail them up—since the prisoner left I have noticed tea in the vans with the chests broken, and the other carmen with me will tell you the same.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cashier in the employment of Mr. Hudson, furniture remover in Wilton Road—about 27th July I received this order: "Sir,—My furniture warehoused with you I wish handed over to Mr. Cunningham for sale. Yours truly, A. Timms"—at this time there was some furniture at Mr. Hudson's in the name of Timms, of which we had furnished this inventory about December, 1881, I cannot say whom to—after I received this letter, on the same day, Monday, 28th July, the prisoner called at the repository and asked me about the sale of the furniture—I told her we had received her letter that morning, and I had received certain instructions from Brighton; I could not deal any further with the matter, but that one of our managers at Brighton would be up on Wednesday, 30th July, and if she would call then she would be able to see him about 11 o'clock—on Wednesday she called and saw Thomas Bateson, our manager, in my presence—he asked her what her name was—she said, "I am Alice Timms"—he asked her what proof she had that she was Mrs. Timms—she wanted to know if her word was sufficient—he said, "Of course it is not"—afterwards Mr. Stimpson was brought in, and he said, "You are not Florence Timms, you are Alice Graham"—she admitted she was—this order was shown to her; she admitted she had sent that, and that it was her writing; that was the letter which I had received on Monday—she said, "I wrote this order because my sister has given me the goods."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was in Hudson's service in 1881—this document C, "Gentlemen,—I request an estimate of my furniture taken to-morrow, I intend warehousing the same on Thursday," is one of the letters we received before any furniture was deposited—these notes at the back of it are written by some one in our employment, "T.

               <p>this would have gone—the clerk who made out the inventory is not here—the date of the rent beginning is not shown here; if merely gives the month of December—it is part of the written contract that if persons leave furniture without paying rent for three years Hudson's can sell it to defray expenses—we do not advertise before selling: we cannot sell if it is left for a less period—the charge has accumulated on this furniture up to about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should think, and if the real date was 17th of December three years would have been up on the 17th of December, 1884—I had no knowledge of this property until this matter—this has been called "The Chelsea Mystery."</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the medical officers of Kensington workhouse—Alice Timms has been an inmate and medically under my charge since April, 1883—when admitted she seemed suffer<lb/>ing from debility and mental depression, and was under medical treat<lb/>ment for six or seven weeks; she improved considerably, so that she was able to take her place in the house, and I have not been called to see her at all since that time—her memory was somewhat weak—I think she it capable of understanding the nature of an oath—I have seen her lately—her memory is much the same now, her mind seemed perfectly blank for a time after her so-called husband's death—she cannot give any account of that time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> From what I could gather it is utterly hopeless to rely on anything as regards her actions for a time after her husband's death—she was not classed as a lunatic—it is an entire effacement of memory—you cannot rely on anything she says from the time of her husband's death—I did not hear her evidence at the police-court—I should not be surprised if she had forgotten every house she lived in from the time of her husband's death to the time of her being in the workhouse.</p>

I am now an inmate of Kensington Workhouse—at one time I lived with a Mr. Nightingale as his wife, at 56, Brompton Square; he was then going by the name of Timms—he furnished the house there—it was my furniture—I have been shown some articles at Hudson's repository—I recollect those as some of the articles at 56, Brompton Square—the prisoner is my sister—I did not give her the furniture, nor did I authorise her to deal with it by taking it away from the repository—I was too ill to remember when Mr. Nightingale died; after he died I was very ill and was put into st. George's Hospital, my memory has got very weak since—as far as my memory goes I never gave that furniture to my sister or authorised her to sell it.</p>

Please to let me have inventory of my goods warehoused with you five weeks ago. Yours, Alice Timms"—I was at Messrs. Hudson's on 30th July with Kelly when the prisoner came in—I met the prisoner by appointment at Victoria on that day; if asked whom I was addressing, she replied Alice Timms—I asked her to produce the inventory—her reply was that it was not in her possession at that moment; she volunteered to fetch it—I said before doing so I might ask her a few more questions with a view to her identity being established—I inquired where she had been during the interval—she said she-had been in Canada—I inquired when she returned; after some hesitation she replied about three months ago—I then asked if she could produce any one who knew her, as we were anxious to be satisfied we were about to give the goods up to the right owner—she said "Why should my word be doubted?"—I asked her again if her name was Alice Timms—she said "Yes"—I then called Mr. stimpson forward, who identified her at once as Florence Graham, which she admitted, and added that she did not know where her sister was.</p>

               <p>Worcester Street—at the end of February or beginning of March two years ago I remember the prisoner and Mr. Baker coming to my house to take lodgings—they said they had an imbecile sister and asked if we would mind her—they gave me two references, one of which was Inspector Marshall, Scotland Yard, and came to lodge with me at the end of February or the beginning of March, 1882—they stayed with us till, I think, the be<lb/>ginning of November—I used occasionally to see Timms, she used to seem rather strange at times, she used to ask the same questions every morning when she came down to breakfast—in November Mrs. Baker took her sister away on the Thursday, and she and Mr. Baker left on the Saturday—Mrs. Timms came to the house the Saturday afterwards and asked for her sister—I took her to her sister's house and left her on the doorstep—about a week after that I saw her again, but she used to come frequently during the week and knock at the door and ask for her sister—after that time I did not see her till I saw her at the police-court.</p>

"Friday, August 1st, 7.30: I am a married lady and reside at the above address but not with my husband. I last saw my sister, Alice Timms, as far as I can remember, about 18 months or two years ago at a house in Lamont Road. She had furnished rooms there with some people named Sweetlove, I think; she was alone, but I went to see her occasionally, I cannot say how long she resided there, I have never seen her since. I never went to the police to find her until the 30th" (that is the 30th of last month) "but tried to do so myself. Before that she resided with meat various addresses in Pimlico, I never lived anywhere else with her. I once put her in St. George's Hospital about two and a half years since in her own name. I think she was there two months; and then I took her out and went to Lamont Road, where she resided with me for 18 months or more, and then she went to other apartments in the same road, I never saw her again. I took her front Stimpson's South Parade, to the hospital; I cannot give the number, but Stimpson was the landlord. He was a builder. She was a widow, I cannot say who her husband was except that he was a gentleman. I went to Canada about 12 or 18 months ago with my husband, or Mr. Baker. We sailed from Liverpool on the Sinai, but I cannot say the date, it must have been two months ago. We resided at Montreal, where my husband is now living. I cannot understand what this has to do with finding my sister. I returned about a fortnight or three weeks ago to Liverpool to find my sister. I have been trying to find her in the streets and also in the Lamont Road, which I took her from to the hospital"—after she said that she said "I believe you have come from Hudson, and I shan't say any more"—I said "Well, I know of Hudson's matter, and the way you have received me, and the statement is not satisfactory to me. Your sister cannot be found. I shall arrest you on the charge of forging and uttering a note for the delivery of the goods to Messrs. Hudson"—she then declared I should not do so—I Called a ser<lb/>geant—she tried to destroy some paper and took out the key of her room, which she said I should not search—I told her I should do so—I took her to the station and then returned to her room, where I searched her box, the keys of which she subsequently handed to me; and in that box I found the inventory (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and a number of letters and memo<lb/>randa which I conveyed to the station—while there she said "There is a letter among my papers which I wish to send to my husband"—I pro<lb/>duced the whole for her to point it out, and she selected this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I took possession of it, read it, and finding it had reference to the case I refused to allow her application.</p>

On 26th August, about 1.15 a.m., I was on duty in Ford Road, and heard a noise as of shutters falling—I looked round the corner and saw two persons standing in front of Mr. Vandy's shop—I waited a minute or two and they came towards me, each with a box under his arm—I advanced to meet them, and got within twenty yards of them—they ran across the road—I ran across at the same time—they went down Dane's Place, and as they ran under a lamp I distinctly saw Wright; he was the nearest to me—knowing him perfectly well and where he lived, I did not follow him, but turned to my left in the Roman Road—I thought he would go home, bat he crossed my front again, as they crossed the Roman Road again—I knew Wright by the nickname of "Comic," and called out "Comic, it is no use your running away, you are known;" with that he dropped the box and I caught my toe against it, which caused me to stumble, and when I recovered myself they were thirty or forty yards ahead of me; Harvey turned down Wright's road, and Wright went straight down the road and indoors—I picked up the box of herrings and called Mr. Tandy up—his shop was all open—I then went and took Wright; I found him undressed—he said "You have made a" great mistake this time, I have been in bed ever since 11 o'clock"—this was at 1.30, about a quarter of an hour after the affair happened, which was 400 yards from where he lives—I was some time talking to Mr. Vandy—I gave information to a constable, and Harvey was taken the next night and I identified him—I knew them both by sight perfectly well.</p>

Barrow, lives at Whitton, Hounslow, has offices at Temple Chambers, Fleet Street, and is editor of the <hi rend="italic">Cyclist.</hi> Aubrey is employed at the Legal and Mercantile Creditors' Protection Association, 28, Borough High Street. I wrote the letters to the Foreign Office, but Mr. Fowler knows all about it. James Gibson is a commercial traveller in the fancy line. I met him one day in the Four Swans Royal Hotel, Bishopsgate, when he said he was going abroad, to Germany, I think, and asked me to get him a passport. I wrote the letter and he signed it, and after getting the passport I handed it to him at the Four swans. Gibson is a short, stoutish, good-looking man; I knew him when I had offices as a solicitor in Devonshire Chambers. I cannot say in what part of the Chambers his offices are situated. One of the clerks from 23, Borough High Street, came into the Globe, Borough Market, when I was there, they all use that house, and said 'George' (meaning Borman), who is secretary to the Legal and Mercantile Creditors' Protection Association, was going abroad, and wanted a passport. I said 'Oh, I will get him one.' I went to Mr. Fowler's office in Dowgate Hill and wrote the letter, and left it with the head barman at the Globe for Borman to sign when he came in called for it a day or two afterwards, when I found it signed. After I got the passport I left it at the Globe with the head bar<lb/>man for him to hand to George; the clerk, I don't remember which one it was asked me, paid me the money for it; I only charged him the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I paid for it. Carlton Carlton I have known from childhood; he lives at 17, Russell Road, Kensington. I was present at his sister's wedding; I don't think it is so long ago as November,' 1882. I am a trustee to one of them. I met him at the Cannon Street Station on the day the letter is dated, and he said he was going to Italy and required a passport. I said 'I will get you one,' and I went into Dowgate Hill and wrote out the application while he waited at the station; he signed it on my re-turn. If I had obtained the passport I should have posted it off to 17, Russell Road, as I thought he still resided there. I Know they hare a country house near Chester somewhere. I shall be staying at my daugh<lb/>ter's for the next few days, and you can always find out where I am from her, or from one of my sons. People apply to me to get them passports because I am so well known; they call me the 'Walking Directory.' I don't do anything for a living, I have enough to live on without doing any work.")</p>

I have met this man in the neigh<lb/>bourhood, and did some work for him some short time ago," pointing to Hislop, "he owes me a small account, and not having sufficient cash in his pocket to pay me, he said if I could get this cheque cashed for him he would be able to do so"—I said "Who is this W. Street?" pointing to the name—he said it was W. Street, a chair manufacturer, of Old Street Road—I then referred to the Post-office Directory in the bar-parlour to see whether what he had asserted was corroborated, and I found that man was in existence for some years there, as the directory was five years old, so on the faith of what he said I cashed this cheque—he then asked me for a pen, ink, and paper to give Hislop the receipt for the money that was about to be paid over to him—I handed them to</p>

Bianchi instead of Antonio Bianchi—he answered that the firm did not bank with the Central Bank of London, but that Antonio Bianchi had given it to the man from whom he (Hislop) received it—I asked his name, he said "Westrup, of Hoxton," and he said he received this cheque from Bianchi, a looking-glass manufac<lb/>turer for whom he worked, for work done—my friend would have cashed it, knowing Bianchi, but had not got the cash, and I took it home with me—on Tuesday morning, 5th August, I met the prisoner again, and handed him the cheque—he said "I quite thought you would have been able to cash it for me, as I wanted the money badly"—I then went to my lawyer, Mr. Duke, in Chancery Lane, and asked him to cash it—Hislop was not with me—I got 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Duke for the cheque—I handed the prisoner 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., promising him the balance when the cheque had been passed through the bank, and he arranged to meet me on Thursday morning, the 7th, to receive the balance—he met me then, I had not received the balance, as the cheque had not come back, so he was to meet me on the Friday morning—I saw Duke and went with him to his bank through which the cheque had been passed, and he brought the cheque to me marked "No account," as it now appears—I was very wroth and went back to the prisoner—I did not show him the cheque—I said it was too bad of him to bring me a cheque like that, and that he had better see Mr. Duke, as Mr. Duke as well as myself was very wroth about it—he said he would see Mr. Duke—I said "You had better find the man Westrup from whom you received the cheque, where does he live?"—he said he could find him in the evening, and I said I would meet him if possible at the public-house opposite the Britannia—he gave me the name; I forget it—I did not go there, and did not see him again till I saw him at Worship Street police-court.</p>

I am an oilman at 68, Dalston Lane—I knew Hislop before 19th August—on that day he asked me for the amount of an account he owed me some three years old—I told him I had written the amount off some time ago, and I could not look up the old book for it, but if he was anxious to pay I had no doubt I should accept any amount he might estimate it at—he then proposed 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I accepted it, and he then tendered this cheque (<hi rend="italic">For </hi>4<hi rend="italic">l. </hi>7<hi rend="italic">s. </hi>6<hi rend="italic">d., signed "Charles Allen" payable to J. Smith or bearer, and endorsed "J. Smith"</hi>)—the endorsement was on it at the time—I do not know the writing, only from comparison with the cheque—when he handed me the cheque I said he had better wait till he could pay me in ready money—he said, "You need not fear about the cheque being all right, it is one of Mr. Allen's cheques, whom you know very well"—I said, "Very good, if it is Mr. Allen's I will give you 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account, and will leave the balance till the cheque is returned from the bank"—he then asked me when he should call for it—I said "Saturday morning"—the 19th was a Tuesday—I asked him to give me the name and address of the payee and his own—this he wrote on one of my bill-heads, "A. Hislop, 139, Curtain Road, Essex Road"—I went to that address; he was not known there—on the following Friday night he came for the balance; I did not give it to him—he came again on Saturday morning about 8 o'clock, when I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which, deducting the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he owed me, was the balance—I did not then know the address was wrong, not till the cheque was returned on Saturday afternoon about 5 o'clock marked "No account"—after I had paid the balance I was going out of town till Tuesday, and when I returned I saw Mr. Jenman about the matter, and he went with me to Mr. Allen, and we made inquiries at that address and at the address Hishop had given me.</p>

I am a clerk in the Central Bank, Shorediteh branch—these three cheques came out of one of our cheque-books, which was issued to Mr. Charles Westrup in the year 1872—we have no customer at our bank of the name of A. Bianchi—we have one of the name of Charles Allen, but his signature is nothing like this—this is not the signature of any customer of ours—we have a customer named W. Street; his signature is nothing like this—there is a great resemblance between the "J. Smith" as payee and the endorsement "J. Smith," and the writing of the "A. W. Hislop," the endorsement, and that on the bill-head, "A. Hielop," seem to be the same—we judge by the general character.</p>

On 27th August I received some information from Mr. Eltham, and on 1st September took Hislop into custody in the Englefield Road, a turning out of the Kingsland Road, leading into the Essex Road—I said to him "I shall take you into custody for forging and uttering a cheque on Mr. Eltham, of Dalston Lane"—lie said "I had better say nothing"—I afterwards took him to the station, and he made a statement there which I wrote down at the time in his presence: "I received the cheque in good faith from a man named West-rup who lives, or lodges, in the Kingsland Road"—he gave me his description, which I wrote down—he went with me and Sergeant Armstrong to a lodging-house in Kingsland Road on the morning of the 2nd, where we saw Westrup—Hislop pointed him out—Armstrong took him into custody in my presence; when we came out on the bridge Hislop said "That is the man I received the cheque from"—Westrup said "It is a lie"—I had only mentioned Mr. Eltham cheque at that time—I knew nothing about any other one at that time—they were both taken to the station and charged to<lb/>gether—previous to that Hislop had told me where I could find another cheque which had been cashed at the Lion and Lamb, Clerkenwell—West-rup was not present then—Hislop told me he went with Westrup to a flat-fronted house near the prison, I think, in Clerkenwell, and "we cashed a cheque for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he did not know the sign of the house, but from the description he gave me of it I went to the Lion and Lamb, and saw Mr. Kynaston—after they were charged with the two offences, Hislop said "I had no intention of defrauding Mr. Eltham; I received the cheque in good faith; I believed it would be met; I received it, the cheque, from Charles Westrup, the other prisoner," pointing to him—I wrote that</p>

I was asked by Mr. Hislop to fill up a cheque, he telling me at the time it was only for the purpose of showing it to a relation of his; that would enable him to make believe that he was entitled to receive some money in a few days, and of course his relation would then lend him some, knowing that he would pay him back again when Hislop received money from the cheque. When Hislop asked me to do this I said I would do so for him providing he faithfully promised me he would not have to negotiate it saw Hislop again after a few days, and he said he had not seen his relation, the party being out of town, and of course the cheque was too old to show, and would I write another one for him. I asked him to give me the other one back or to tear it up before me, and he replied that he had already torn it up. I believed him and wrote another.

On Sunday morning, August 24th, a little after 12 at midnight, I was called to a row in Inkerman Road, Kentish Town—I went with another policeman named Manns—there were about 100 persons collected together there—I saw the prisoner standing in the crowd; I asked him what was the matter—he said he bad been struck by another man—a man named Kennivan then came up to Mann, and made a complaint, and subsequently he was taken in custody—linen told the prisoner to go away quietly; he went away as far as spring Row, the crowd following; I followed the crowd—I lost sight of Bangs—when I got into Spring Bow I saw him commence fighting with another man named Nelson—I told the prisoner I should take him into custody—he said "You b——I will stick you"—he drew his bayonet from the sheath, which was hanging at his right side, and stabbed me in the stomach, about two inches below the navel—he then ran away in the direction of Inkerman Road—I ran after him—the people were trying to stop him, and a man named Fox worth coming from Inkerman Road tripped him up on the pavement—he then put his foot on his neck and one loot on the bayonet, and I took the bayonet away from him—he had not it in his hand—he was not dressed as a rifleman; he was in plain clothes—when he was charged I heard him tell the inspector that he had just come straight from parade—he did not say where from—I was off duty, in uniform.</p>

I reside at 44, Willis Road, Kentish Town—I am the prisoner's father; he has just turned twenty-one; I have had him under my eye all his life; he bears a character in the neighbourhood of being a respectable, peaceable man—he is a member of a volunteer corps—on Saturday night, August 23rd, I was outside the Crimea Tavern in Inkerman Road—I had been in the company of my son—a party of cricketers were at the Crimea drinking; the prisoner being a little the worse for drink created a little disturbance with them—I think some of them were the worse for drink—I tried to get my son away, and was struck and knocked down, I don't know who by; I believe it was one of cricketers—my son saw that and interfered, and he also was knocked down as well as myself, and another young man who interfered on our behalf was also knocked down—I do not know his name—this was just opposite the Crimea—about five minutes after this a young man struck me in the eye—I said "You scoundrel, I will give you in charge"—I saw a police constable, 526 I think it was; I ran towards him—I said "This man has struck me in the eye, I will give him in charge"—he then in retaliation said "This young man has struck me and I will give him in charge"—that was my son—the constable took both their names and addresses, and said "If you don't go away I will lock you both up"—the prisoner said "All right, governor, I know you, I will go away"—the other one did not and he was locked up—on the road to the station some man, I do not know who it was, said "What did you want to lock that man up for? it was not him that struck you," and immediately I was knocked down again—that was in Raglan Place—my son was near, he saw me knocked down—I tried to get up and was struck down again—I heard my son say "Let my father get up"—on getting up I saw him in the hands of constable James; the prisoner struggled with him and the policeman threw him—he got up several times and was thrown down—go which way he would he would not give him any chance of going away—as he fell I heard the ring of a bayonet on the ground—I saw the prisoner get up with it in his hand; the sound was something like silver, a sharp metal sound—James immediately closed with him, and in the struggle, I don't know if they were struggling for the bayonet, the constable was thrown, or fell; he rolled over on the pavement—some one in the Crimea called out to my son "Run away"—he ran away about forty yards—I followed him, I did not see him thrown, but I saw him on the ground, and I saw constable Pearce come off his steps and go to assist James—Pearce had not been engaged in this thing, that I will swear—my son was then taken to the police-station. on Sunday evening he was admitted out on bail for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the case was heard at the police-court, he was admitted to bail, and he has surrendered here to-day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon—on Saturday night, about 9.15, I went to the prisoner's room on the ground floor; he was sitting on the bed, and the woman was sitting by his side on the bed—I found her throat was cut—I asked her how it was done—she replied "My husband did it"—I then turned to him and said "Is that so?"—he made no reply—I bound up the wound—besides that one there was an incised wound on the left hand between the forefinger and the thumb about an inch long and deep—the other wound was about five inches, extending from the centre of the throat a little to the right outwards and downwards to the left—I thought it was a wound that she could not have inflicted herself, it began at the centre of the throat directly downwards, and a little to the right of the windpipe—if she did it herself she must have been left<lb/>handed—I had her sent to the Great Northern Hospital—she had evidently been drinking, and was very hysterical, but knew perfectly well what she was doing—the prisoner was quite sober, but became very violent when I told the constable to take him to the station—I saw two knives in the room, one was quite dry, the on her had got some stuff on it of an oily character—I should think it was a much sharper pointed knife than either of these that inflicted the injury.</p>

There are two or three iron bars in the beadstead broken at the end and very sharp; it was dark, and I could not see where she had got to. I turned the bedstead back again and found she was under it. I went to lift her up and found she was wet. I left her there and called some one to get a light.

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, of 402, Edgware Road—Price was my cashier, and Finlay and Pearson countermen—when a customer purchases the counterman enters the amount in a cheque-book, casts it up, tears the ticket out, and hands it to the customer, who taken it to the cashier at his desk and pays him; the customer then takes the ticket back to the counterman and gives it in exchange for the goods, and the counterman puts it on a little wire file, and at night the grand total of the whole day is written on a slip of paper, and he hands it in with the book and the tickets, and next morning, if the cask is right and corresponds with the grand total of the various books, the tickets are taken no notice of, but put in the waste-paper bag, but if the cash is not correct the tickets can be compared—the cashier only keeps a book in which he puts down the totals of each book for the day—this is the counterfoil check-book kept by Finlay on 26th January; the total is 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there are erasures on that day; on counterfoil 165 "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." has been rubbed out with indiarubber, but it is readable; it is in</p>

               <p>Finlay's writing, and it is not included in the total of that column—the other erasures that day are "2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." rubbed out on counterfoil 202, "3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>" on counterfoil 215, "2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." on counterfoil 258, "4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." on 261, and "3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." on 391 (<hi rend="italic">Examining the figures with a magnifying glass</hi>)—they are all visible and all in Finlay's writing—the erasures that day amount to 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on March 15th "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." is erased on 409 and "2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." on 438—those are in Finlay's writing, and they are not included in the total—on 18th March, on counterfoil 533 "2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." is rubbed out and not accounted for, and in the pence column a 7 has been altered into a 1; that makes 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that day—in Pearson's book of 29th March, on counterfoil 152 "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." is rubbed out, and on 178 "4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." is rubbed out and "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." put, and on 182 "3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." is rubbed out; that makes 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on 3rd May in Pearson's book counter<lb/>foil 296 is rubbed out, and I cannot see what it has been—on 4-41 "3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>." is rubbed out and "8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>." put in—on 4-67 "3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." is rubbed out—on 4-71 the amount has been rubbed out and "6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>." put in—on 4-89 "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>" is rubbed out and "4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." put in—on 4-100 "9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." and something is rubbed out and "6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>." put in—at 4-20 the amount is rubbed out and "8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>." put in—the total of that day is 29<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have compared the amounts paid in according to the cashier's book with the total in the counterman's book; the amounts have been paid in minus the erasures, and the addition is the same in each column in Pearson's writing—Coulter was an apprentice who generally acted as a checker—it was his duty to carefully compare them and see that everything was in order—here is Pearson's book, but all that purports to be on 7th June is in Price's writing, also a ticket given in with the book—Price had no right to have a book of that kind; it was not necessary because it was only used in serving customers, and Price served no customers that day—it purports to be Pearson's book—Price has entered this in his own book, intending to represent the amount Pearson received that day—that is the only book I have got purporting to be Pearson's—the police have shown me portions of a book which I identify as one given to Pearson to enter his own amounts and to issue his pay-tickets from on 7th June—one or two entries are in Pearson's writing and one or. two in Nardy's, a counterman, which is peculiar—the first communication I had was a letter from the Isle of Wight on 9th June, before which I had no idea that Pearson had destroyed the book—in the book shown me by the police there is an entry of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but it is torn, and it may have been 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on Friday night I called Price into my bedroom and said, "Coulter has confessed what you have been doing, stealing the money, he has told me all about it, will you confess?"</p>

               <p>what Finlay and he took was shared between them, and what Coulter and Pearson took was shared between the three, and that Pearson did not know that Finlay had had anything—10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was missing one Monday from Saturday's money, and he said that he did not know anything about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was shared between him and Pearson and Coulter; that was on 7th June—Pearson had gone to bed, and I went and got him up, and told him I was going to give him in custody for what he had done; stealing—he said that it was nothing to do with him, he knew nothing about it—I had no conversation with Finlay—I called him down from where he slept, and the policeman took him on the stairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had six or seven apprentices between January and June—Coulter was the youngest—I do not think he was 16; he was checking clerk, and the most confidence was placed in him—when I began to suspect him I advertised for a clerk to do the work—one came for three or four days, and could not do the work at all, and I put him to the counter—the next came about May—I did not pay the apprentices any wages, but Price was to have 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the third year, which had just arrived—I had paid him—he had some medicine, and that was paid for out of it—I think he got 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash—there are fines for apprentices who waste goods, and unless they come at 8.30 they are fined a halfpenny for every five minutes afterwards—there are fines for five or six other things, varying from a halfpenny to a penny, but they have never paid them; they are kept as a black mark against them—I promised to forgive Coulter, and have not prosecuted him—his friends have not paid me 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not say that I was entitled to 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in consequence of the indentures not being carried out strictly, but that I would take 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have said "His father wished to take him away. I said he could not. I was entitled under his indentures to receive 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but under the circumstances I would take 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that is true; to part with Coulter and release him from his indentures I required 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not want to withdraw the case against Price before the Magistrate—I left it to the solicitor to conduct the case as he pleased, and I believe he did not wish to press it, and asked the Magistrate's leave—I was there, but I am rather deaf—I can hear here, because the Court is quiet—I have been in business at this place eight years—I failed at the end of last year—when a mistake is made it should be scratched through, and the figure written above it—I said that when a mistake is made they should call me or a cashier, and put their initials against it, and here is an instance of it initialled by Price—this scratching out on 95 was by my instructions—the foreman is married, and has 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week and board and lodging—I had then 20 men and boys in my service, and two of the apprentices would be out with a traveller—ever time a boy made a mistake he had to come to me to get it initialled—that was not always carried out, but they put a stroke through, and wrote the other figure—I connived at that, but I think I objected to it at first—whenever there has been a rubbing out in the books I say decidedly that there has been a fraud, because there was no reason for it, and it is new—I know that on June 7th Pearson was serving customers all day, and sold from 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods—it would be impossible for him to serve all day and only serve 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—this 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. does not appear in the books at all, only on this piece of paper, which is part of a book produced from the Welsh Harp; it is 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but the other "1" may possibly be torn off—it was the prisoner's duty at the close of the day to hand over the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188409150132"/>
               <p>books—strictly speaking, Pearson would hand his book to Coulter if he was checker then, but often they would just throw them to the cashier's desk—we close on Saturday nights about 12 o'clock, and the books are just laid there—there is no lock-up place to put them in—all Pearson had to do was to lay his book on the desk and go to bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Price</hi>. I filed my petition for liquidation in December—you were cashier the whole of the time—I had sums from, you to the amount of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not tell you to falsify the books that the receiver might not know you had had the amounts—I did not send my solicitor to you in the House of Detention to withdraw the charge against you—the receiver's man was cashier the whole time and had charge of the whole of the money, and it was accounted for to the receiver—I opened a letter from you to one of my apprentices and read it with him, and a very improper letter it was—the figures erased in the books were not detected, because Coulter was checking clerk and was conspiring with you—the other check clerks did not detect it, because they simply entered up the totals, when it was discovered one of them ran away because he had neglected his duty—you paid for some medicines, and we had 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. booked against you because your cash was short and you declared you knew nothing about how it was so—as I understand, the 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which you took and divided with Hunt was taken on several occasions—that was not done by erasing figures, but by entering 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the counterfoil and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the pay ticket—this was going on before my liquidation—I can prove that you were cashier on some of these occasions—an apprentice I named John Jones left because he was dishonest—his parents paid me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. compensation, and I cancelled his indentures—I did not give him a good reference, I said that he was naturally a good boy, but he had been dis<lb/>honest through your evil example.</p>

Styles to Mr. Harvey</hi>) The bill ought only to be 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have never received any of that money—I never received a farthing of the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. due from Mr. Band, nor of the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not write this letter, and made no charge for it. (<hi rend="italic">This letter stated that Mr. Styles agreed to let Mr. Woodbridge have judgment, and would pay </hi>1<hi rend="italic">s. </hi>6<hi rend="italic">d. per month, and that the writer was going, to Court that afternoon and would pay money in.</hi>) All moneys received by the prisoner were to be paid to me directly he saw me—I visited my Brentford office about three days a week on an average—the defendant is not a qualified solicitor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I applied to the Magistrates in their private room, and they wanted me a warrant for his apprehension a few minutes before the Court sat—I had seen the prisoner that morning at my own office—I swear he gave me no particulars about some case I was to appear in in Court and out of which I should make something, nothing of the sort occurred—I did not know until an hour previously for certain that he had received this money from Mr. Band—Mr. Band had met me some few days previously and told me he had paid him something—I did not know whether it referred to this special 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and therefore I asked Mr. Band to show me the receipt—there was more than that account due from Mr. Band to me—I have a running account; with him, but there was only one account in respect of which I had sent the prisoner—when I wrote the letter of 1st July Mr. Band owed me several other amounts besides the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the other matters were not completed—in these small cases we make it a rule to get the account in as soon as possible—when I met young Mr. Band two or three days afterwards he said he had paid him some fees—I do not believe he mentioned any sum, he may have done so—I said I would not do anything till I had seen the receipt because I could not believe he had received it—I do not know that I know Airs. Whitman by name, I might know her—there are one or two families in the house where my offices are, they are the prisoner's friends—I do not know that she is the landlady's daughter—I do not think I could tell for certain if the name Whitman is on the door, I think it is, but the door is very dirty—I do not know where Mrs.</p>

               <p>Whitman is; I never had any conversation with her—I know Mrs. Such; I suppose she is the landlady of the house where my offices are—I entered into an agreement with Such when I took the offices, and I pay her the rent—I do not know that Mrs. Whitman is her daughter—I know Mr. Perry, a solicitor—I will swear I never paid the prisoner commission on work he brought me—I have given him extra pay sometimes when he has been employed extra time—I swear that on no occasion did I promise to pay commission on work he might bring, nor to pay him a portion of any fees he brought to the office—I promised to pay him something besides the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week when he was employed beyond his ordinary hours, according to the time he was engaged—sometimes I required his services in the afternoon; sometimes he went to my other offices for me, and I then paid his railway fare and something extra for the time he was employed—he worked for me at Market Place, Brentford, at copying, attending the County Court, getting money out, and issuing summonses, sometimes taking down witnesses' evidence; probably he would Some<lb/>times see clients—if he brought in a client I had never seen before I used my own discretion about accepting him—he may have introduced two or three clients to me, or perhaps more—he may have brought them there or they may have come by themselves—my name is on the door—I found them at my office—the prisoner has never touted for me at my request—he has endeavoured to obtain clients for me, and I have accepted them—I swear I have not promised to give him a certain portion of the fees or profits, and I have never allowed him any special portion—I have given him something sometimes, but not as remuneration for the introduction of clients, that I swear, nor have I promised it to him—I have an indistinct recollection of a case of Bradbury and Newman, a burglary—I will not swear that I did or did not act in that case—I keep a diary—that case no doubt came on at the police-court in the morning and was disposed of at once as far as I was concerned—I believe I was concerned in the case—I will not swear that I attended Court once—I could not tell what fee I got for it—they are paid before I go into Court—it might be two guineas, or one, or a half—I will swear I did not give 25 per cent of it, whatever it was, to the prisoner; I gave him none of it—if he was engaged in the case after hours I might have given him something—the Brentford Justices sit at 11o'clock—I believe I conducted the case on one occasion, and the prisoner had nothing to do with it except to stay by me in Court—I swear I gave him nothing out of my fees—if he brought the man to me and drew the brief I might have given him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I cannot say who received the fees in Bradbury and Newman, it is a long while ago—the prisoner certainly did not deduct a quarter of the fees in that case—I am prepared to swear that I should never have agreed to such a transaction—I will swear the prisoner has not received fees from clients and handed them to me less a commision deducted for himself, at any time—I have not got a diary with me; I have had notice to produce it—the notice alluded to the diary which I produced in Court, and I produced no book in Court on the date you allege—I acted on the advice of the Magistrate—a similar notice was served at Brest-ford—I had the book in Court, but no extracts were read from it—it can be here in five minutes—I swear Mr. Perry did not tell me, with regard to the case of Bradbury and Newman, that Baynham had given him a half-sovereign, and that he (Perry) had returned to Baynham a half-crown</p>

At a quarter to 11 on 19th July I was at Plaistow Police-station, when the prisoner was brought in by George Kidd and charged with uttering this counterfeit florin, which Mr. Kidd gave me—I said to the prisoner, "Have you any other money about you?"—she then took off this bag from underneath her apron, and in it there were two shillings, three sixpences, and 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. bronze, all good—I asked her if she had a purse about her, and from her frock pocket she took out this purse and handed it to me—in it I found this tissue-paper—I find that marks on the two-shilling piece correspond with marks on the paper—I can see marks of seven coins on the Paper—I said, "You have had some coins wrapped up in this"—she said, "No, it is what I have had some pennies wrapped up in"—the charge was read over to her; she made no answer.</p>

                  </hi>.

I am an engineer of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade at Woolwich—on the morning of 11th August I was called to the fire at the Earl of Warwick by telegram—I got to the house about 2.45—it took me about 23 minutes to get there, and I had to get the engine ready—Mr. By field, who is now ill, had been there with an engine long before—mine was the third engine—when I got there the premises were still on fire—the place is just on four miles from my station—after the fire was put out Mr. Bayfield and I examined the premises—the bar was partly burnt out, and the fixtures severely damaged—the place smelt of paraffin oil—I then examined the passage at the back of the bar, and found it was very much burnt, more so than any other part of the bar—it appeared as if a fire had started there—I still smelt the paraffin oil—I examined the taproom at the back of the bar, and found part of the skirting-board burnt away; the flooring was slightly scorched, and the match-lining was burnt—there was no con<lb/>nection between the three different fires that I have spoken of—that is all that I found on the ground floor—I then went upstairs to the first floor, and in the front room, which is used as a club-room, I found the floor saturated with paraffin oil, which had not been lighted—I then went into the front bedroom, and found a heap of burnt paper close to the head of the bed—there was a piece of carpet lying on the floor, and the flooring was slightly burnt; paraffin was on the carpet and the boarding—it was quite a separate fire—I then went to a back empty room on the same floor, and found a heap of burnt paper nearly in the centre of the room—the flooring was slightly burnt, and was saturated with paraffin oil—that was also a separate fire from all the others—I then examined the passage leading from this room, and found a heap of burnt paper and the floor saturated with oil, it was slightly burnt—I then took Mowforth over the premises with Byfield, and showed him the separate fires and the state of the flooring and paraffin—Byfield asked him in my presence how he could account for the separate fires in his house—he said he could not account for them at all, that he had been away all day and had not come home till late; he said he was sitting in the bar-parlour when he first heard of the fire, and that he rushed upstairs to fetch the barmaid, that he found her in bed, that he dragged her out and brought her downstairs, and that he had got his whiskers</p>

               <p>slightly burnt, and the barmaid's shoulder was slightly burnt—he had no whiskers, but was just as he is now—I afterwards saw the barmaid Duggan, and asked her where she was at the time of the fire—she replied, "I was in bed"—Byfield said, "How did you know that the house was on fire?"—she said, "I heard Mr. Mowforth calling from the bottom of the stairs, 'The house is on fire,' "that she jumped out of bed and ran downstairs—she appeared to be fully dressed except her hat—I asked her about her shoulder, and she said it was slightly burnt, but she did not show it—her dress was intact, and she had no burn on it—Mowforth came up and said, "I dragged the barmaid out of bed and brought her downstairs"—she said, 'It is no use asking me any more questions, I know nothing more about it"—there was very little furniture it the front bedroom, and there was no other room furnished except the bar-parlour—the kitchen had a few plates and dishes in it.</p>

I remained there till the 11th August, when I was taken into custody on a charge of Arson. On Saturday, 9th August, at about 7 o'clock, I saw Mr. Mowforth with a letter in his hand. He said to me, 'This is from the brewers; I have to go there on Monday morning. I know what they intend to do, they are going to take the house from me.' I said 'Why, the collector was only here a few days ago.' He said 'I am not going out of the b——house without a shilling; before the b——rs shall have it I will fire the b——place.' He drank freely all the evening, and about 11 p.m. he said to me' I would do it to-night if I had the stuff.' I said 'What stuff?' He said 'I mean paraffin oil.' I said 'I am sure you would not do such a thing.' He said 'I have not got a shilling in the world; if I could get the insurance money I could have a big house and have you as barmaid.' I went to bed leaving Mowforth in the bar-parlour smoking. The next morning, about 9.15, Mowforth said to me' Hurry the tea, as I want to go to London, I am going to get something.' I said 'What are you going to get? it is Sunday.' He said 'I have got a friend in London who will let me have a gallon of paraffin oil, and that will do for it.' He said 'You need not be frightened, no one will be injured by it or no one burnt.' He said 'I have a friend in London who has fired five or six houses.' He went out and returned about 1 p.m. in a cab, and had with him a stone jar bottle without a handle, and placed it on his bed. We afterwards had dinner together. He then told me that the bottle con<lb/>tained paraffin oil, and that it was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. expense that morning, He said 'For God's sake, Rose, don't breath a word to anybody, I do not think I can trust you. I said 'Don't you?' About 4 p.m. he sent the potman with the portmanteau to the Dockyard Station, and Mowforth left immediately after. He returned about 6 p.m. without the portmantean. While Mowforth was away, between 4 and 6 p.m., I examined the bottle and found it contained paraffin oil. The house closed at 11 p.m., and the potman left at 11.40. About 12 I was in the bar parlour and Mowforth said 'The house must come down to-night; if I go to the brewery to-morrow morning they will take the house from me, and if I do it afterwards they will suspect me.' I said 'I thought you said you had other houses in London.' He said 'I have not, I have not a shilling. There will be nobody know anything about it, and you won't tell anybody, will you? for if you do I shall get it for life.' I said 'I don't believe you mean to do it.' He said 'Yes, I do, you had better get your things together,' and I accordingly put my clothes in the Gladstone bag At the same time he packed some of his things in the. bag, and some money and tobacco, etc., and bills and receipts, "after which he packed our things. Mowforth took up the paraffin jar, took the cork out, carried it upstairs, and I followed him and stood on the landing by the club-room, and I saw him sprinkle the floor with it, and he said</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188409150158"/>
               <p>'This will bring the b——house down quick.' He went into the other room and sprinkled the floors, and the bottle was put down into the spirit room at the back of the bar. A few minutes after he went into the spirit room and said 'I will start it here at the back of the spirits.' He said 'Give me something to break the jar.' I did not do so. Immediately after a quantity of smoke issued from the room. I opened the door in about a minute, and Mowforth put the luggage, etc., out in the passage. After the fire was out I went to a neighbour's to sleep, and saw Mowforth about 8 o'clock. He said 'It is a bad job, but they won't touch you, it has nothing to do with you.' I said 'I won't be locked up, what have I done?' He said 'Oh, Rose, are you going to round on me?' I kept saying 'I won't be locked up for you or anybody else.' I have been taken into custody and committed for trial. On Monday, the 18th, I was going to the police-court in the prison van and Mowforth said 'Rose, are you going against me?' I said 'I don't know.' He said 'I shall get off to-day, but keep your tongue quiet and say nothing.' (Signed) Anastatia Duggan."</p>

I am a corporal in the Royal Artillery—on 15th July, about 10 minutes past 12 o'clock, midnight, I was turning the comer of Waterloo Place, New Gross, and saw the two female prisoners together—Cheeseman asked me to accompany her down Waterloo Place—I went with her down the passage leading to Charles Street—she asked me for and I gave her a shilling—Gilley then came up, and Cheeseman asked for another shilling, and on my refusing to give it I was struck on the head by Gilley, I believe, by something hard; I don't know whether it was a stone, but it cut my head—they both then ran away—I followed, as that was my nearest way into Dudley Street—when I got to the top of the passage leading to Waterloo Place I was surrounded by five or six men and another female—I was struck by, I believe, Parker in the face, I cannot swear to the man, I believe it was him—I was knocked against the wall by two or three of them, struck in the face several times, and thrown on the ground by somebody from behind; and when on the ground I was kicked on the head and about the shoulders, and the left side of my jaw was fractured—I got up again and closed with a man taller than either of the male prisoners, who had struck me in the eye—I lost a good deal of blood and was insensible when on the ground, but I came to my senses and got up and fought with this other man—then a police constable appeared on the scene and the whole lot ran away—a person living close by gave me a basin of water and I went straight home—next day, 16th July, I went to the hospital and have been there ever since—I believe I have recovered now, but am an inpatient—I was not wearing my soldier's belt at the time, but this one, which had 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in a kind of pocket from which I took the shilling.</p>

I am a hairdresser, in partnership with my brother, at New Cross—on this night I was on my way home through Waterloo Place; I heard screams from women in the alley, about 150 yards off—I went to see what it was, and saw the soldier challenging Christopher Wannop to fight; up came a young man, and the soldier said "Is that you, Jim?" he said "Yes;" the soldier said "Hold my hat, I will fight him," and he made the first blow, Christopher returned it—the fight con<lb/>tinued a good 50 minutes—afterwards the soldier said "Well, I am done"—after a few minutes he went up to another man and said "You are the man that fought me"—the <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> said for a lark "Yes"—the soldier said "Never mind, I am drunk now, when sober I will give you as much as you have given me"—I did not see anybody else touch him—I did not see John Wannop do anything, barring brushing him down, and putting on his hat; and he said "Take my advice, go home"—the girls were crying—I did not hear them make any complaint.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I knew John Wannop before, as a customer—I did not know Parker before—I had seen the women walking in the New Cross Road; they are not customers of mine—I was with Wannop and George Smith, we were coming home together—the first thing I saw was the soldier challenging Christopher Wannop to fight—I noticed that the soldier's head was bleeding afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tram-car washer, of 2, Abbey Street, Church Street—on this night I was going through the alley—as soon as I turned the corner I heard screams from the two female prisoners; one of them was on the ground, and the soldier was just going to kick her—I said "Can't you do enough with your Lands without using your boot?—he turned round and struck me a blow in the eye and knocked me a down—when I got up they were running up the alley—I ran too—a lot gathered</p>

               <p>round, and I saw Parker and Christopher Wannop come down—the soldier was out in the road—he threw off his hat and said he would fight him, and he made a blow at him, and Christopher Wannop returned it—they went down within about 20 yards from the alley and fought for about 20 minutes—at the end of the fight the soldier said "I have had enough now; I have had a little too much to drink to-night, but I will fight you another time and pay you; I am well known about here"—daring all the time neither Parker or John Wannop ever touched the soldier; it was a fair fight between the soldier and Christopher Wannop.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I do not keep a shop—I know the Punch Tavern—I do not go there to business, I dine there—the cheque was made payable to Theobald—I held a promissory note for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not lend the money upon that, I took that as collateral security—I have known Theobald as a clerk—you are the first client he has introduced to me—you waited about outside the house, I paw you—I paid the coupons into my bank on 1st January, when they became due—I could not find you—I knew they were not right about seven days afterwards—I did not threaten to give Theobald into custody—I did not meet him at a tavern in Fleet Street the morning he was given in custody—I said to Theobald "You can give him into custody if you like"—I was reluctant to sign the charge sheet because I do not like the trouble of these things—I do not know if you received the money except from what Theobald told me—I saw you give the bonds to Theobald, and then you showed me a duplicate and said "They are right, or else a pawnbroker would not lend money upon them"—I sent you a letter, but found you had removed—the terms of the letter were that the bonds were forgeries, and asking you to pay the money—it might have been to the effect that the promissory note for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was due—it stated "the coupons, my collateral security, are proved to be forgery."</p>

                  </hi>. My office is at 12, New Street, Covent Garden—early in May the prisoner asked me if I knew any gentleman who lent money—I asked him upon what, and he produced seven coupons of the South London Tramways Company, one for 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., one for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and five for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—I asked him for his name and address, which he gave me—I asked him to leave one—he left one of the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. ones, and I was to let him know the result of my inquiry—I made inquiry—a few days afterwards I took him to Mr. Harris's house, 1, Camber<lb/>well New Road—on the second occasion I saw the prisoner I asked him</p>

               <p>how he became possessed of them, and he said his aunt was a bondholder in the Company and had given him tile coupons for the purpose of raising money for his wife and family—he said "You see they are good business, because, a pawnbroker has lent on them," and he produced a ticket for one of these Coupons—I showed that to Harris—Harris ask ad him how he became possessed of them—he admitted that his aunt was a bondholder in the Company—Harris said he Would make inquiries let him knew through me whether the matter would be entertained—I took Harris to his stockbrokers—we also went to the Company's office, then I made an appointment with the prisoner to go to Harris's house—Harris drew this scheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it Was a Bank Holiday, and the prisoner came to my house, which is only a stone's throw from Mr. Harris's house—I went across to Harris and gate him the coupons and the promissory note signed by the prisoner in exchange for the cheque—I went back to my house where the prisoner was waiting and said "Here is the cheque for 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he said "It is Bank Holiday, what at we to do? I must have the money to-day"—I went to Harris, who directed me to a house in Westminster Bridge Road, where we got the cheque cashed by three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes in the and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold—I gave the prisoner the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes drawing-room of my house and kept the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Harris said he should like a promissory note by way of collateral security, and I drew out the of produced, which the prisoner signed in my presencence—the latter part of April I received a communication in respect of these coupon not being paid—I gave the prisoner in charge to Constable Pepper at the Dolphin public-house, Ludgate Circus.</p>

               <p>I know the first are not genuine because they have not our private mark upon them—that mark was put on in August or September, 1883—some false coupons were presented, and we wrote to every one of the bond<lb/>holders and had the private mark put on, and instructions were given to the bankers not to honour any without the mark—the mark was put on all the bonds, the last two we received back within a week—I was in doubt at the police-court about two bonds, but they have since come in for transfer and I see they have the mark on them—looking at the register I am able to say that these bonds were never attached to the debentures issued by the Company, also from the fact that we have the proper numbers paid and returned through the Bank, and the fact that these have not the Company's stamp upon them—the bonds and signatures are lithographed—the genuine bonds attached to the debentures have the private mark upon them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Some of the bonds were numbered with pen and ink—I do not know that any were put aside and not used—I ordered them to be destroyed—ink was used to complete a set of one denomination instead of sending to the printers, and in the case of a clerk spoiling a bond—I do not remember that some were made out in blank in error with the intention of being issued—that might have occurred in two or three cases—a figure "3" looks like mine, the other figures I am almost certain are not mine, but I should not like to swear to figures, even my own—the numbers being made with pen and ink would not prove forgery—not more than 5 per cent, were filled in with pen and ink—you filled up some bonds—duplicates of the bonds cannot be genuine.</p>

I live at 56, Belvedere Road, Lambeth—I married the prisoner on 10th January—I carry on a general business—he was a stonemason—we have both queer tempers, and in August last I applied for a summons—I attended before the Magistrate, and the prisoner was discharged upon his giving some undertaking—he went away on the Friday and came back the following Wednesday evening, about 6 o'clock—he came to the room where I was lying—he asked me how I was, and if I had been on the sick list; he met with a cool reception—he was in and oat during the evening till 10 o'clock—I did not speak to him—the lodgers were upstairs—my mother came at 6 p.m., and my sister at 11.45—I sent for them—we were all together in the back parlour—at 12.30 the prisoner came in and knocked at the door and asked if we were in bed—my sister said I was in bed but she was not—he said "Is that you, Nellie?"—she said "Yes"—he went upstairs in the back bedroom, came down, and went into the back kitchen, where his tools are kept—he knocked at the door, my sister said "You can't come in, we are going; to bed"—then the door was burst in—the prisoner struck my sister a blow with a mallet, and she fell down—then he gave my mother a touch and she went down too—my mother put her hand across my sister's head, and he gave her a blow, and she fell, and my sister too—I was frightened, and got up to make way to the door; he gave me a blow—I do not feel the effects of it much, just a scar; it has got all right—I remained standing in the middle of the room, opposite the fireplace; I got up very soon after he struck me—I had two side blows from the mallet, they were very slight—the police came, and he was taken away.</p>

On 3rd September, about 9.30 p.m., I saw the prisoners in Brixton Road loitering outside the Prince of Wales—I was with W 409; we were both in plain clothes—the prisoners then went to the Black Horse, Brixton Road, and then to the White Horse, and about 11.30 they went up the Angell Road to No. 53, that leads into the Brixton Road—they entered the front garden through the gate, and we concealed ourselves in a garden on the other side of the way, and lost sight of them, and then we saw Greenhill on the top of a wall between 53 and 51—he disappeared into the garden of 51, and in a few minutes a dog barked, and Dwyer whistled and ran out of the garden of 53, and I lost sight of him for that night—I have no doubt whatever that he is the man—I had been watching them over two hours—I went into the garden of 53, and saw Greenhill on the top of the wall coming towards me, with this <hi rend="italic">jimmy</hi> in his hand—I stepped back, he dropped the <hi rend="italic">jimmy</hi> on top of the wall and leaped over Peddar's head into the garden of 51, and was going out at the gate when Keats stopped him—he struggled very violently—Peddar went to Keats's assistance, and he kicked him and knocked him down—I went to Keats's assistance—Greenhill struggled so violently that I had to strike him with my staff—we then overpowered him and took him to the station—on the morning of 6th September I went to 413, Cold Harbour Lane—I saw Dwyer there, and told him what I had come for—he said "I know nothing whatever about it"—on the way to the station he asked what time the job occurred—I said "About 11.30"—he said "I was home about 9.30, and in bed about 10 o'clock."</p>

I don't care what you say, I swear I know nothing about it.

Rosina and I went out drinking together. About 9 a.m. we were in the Victoria Tavern, Waterloo Road. We had met the prisoner shortly after 5 o'clock in the Borough; he had been drinking with us; we went into the Victoria Tavern. Some altercation took place between him and Rosina about some money she had in her hand; he wanted to take it from her; she resisted doing so, she scratched his face; he struck her. I joined in the quarrel, and I struck him on the head with a pork bone and made his head bleed; he bled very much, and it ran down his shirt. After the quarrel Rosina and I went away, leaving the prisoner outside the house. Me and Rosina continued on the drink. I don't know how we got home. When I woke up I found myself in Rosina's Squire's bed. She was near the door, rolling on the floor in a pool of blood. The doctor, two policemen, and others were there."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Defence before the Coroner.</hi> "On Tuesday last I was asphalting the top of the school in Webb Street; we were using iron pails. We use them with a rope and pulley for taking asphalte from the ground, about 48 feet from the ground—there is a chain with a hook at the end of the rope—the chain is taken round the handle of the pail and then attached to the hook. I was at the top about 4 p.m. I hooked an empty pail on to the rope; I then threw it over and Avery began to lower; it had gone down about four feet, when agust of wind came and knocked the bucket right against the puddick, and the bucket was unhooked. I looked round, and saw the bucket separate from the rope and falling. No buckets had fallen before. I have asphalted the tops of other schools, and I never saw an accident before. The hook is supported by a spring, a single pulley only, one bucket going up and down at a time. My duty was to unhook the full pail and attach an empty one in its place."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 142, Newport Street, Lambeth Walk, and am a contractor—on Bank Holiday, 4th August, about 11 a.m., I went out with my wife and children, leaving a gold watch and chain of the value of about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in the drawers in my bedroom, and also about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and silver in the same drawer; there was also a diamond ring there, that was afterwards found on the floor—I got home about 10 or half-past 10 at night and found the door of the room burst open—we had left it barred up and then gone out of the front door and locked it, leaving nobody in the house—the bedroom-door had been prised open—when we came back we lit the lamp and saw the ring on the floor—the watch and chain were gone and about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and silver—this was on the ground floor—the prisoner has lodged with me two or three years, sleeping in a room on the ground floor, and was one of my carmen—on this morning he washed the trap and cleaned the harness before I went out—up to Bank Holiday night I think he had been in the habit of coming home regularly, on that night he did not come home—next night, Tuesday, I saw him with a woman at the Equestrian public-house at the side of the Surrey Theatre—he was three-parts drunk—he had not been to his work on the Tuesday—Constable Jupe was with me—I asked the prisoner "What have you done with the watch and chain?"—he made no answer, but stood there—I asked him about the money and told him what I had lost, and said "If you don't tell me where it is I shall lock you up"—he said nothing for a minute or two, but turned all manner of colours—I told him I had lost my <hi rend="italic">misuses</hi> gold watch and chain that I gave 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for and about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of my little children's gold and silver—I said nothing about the ring—he stood there for five minutes and made no answer, and then he said he did not know nothing about it and what he knew he was going to keep to himself—I gave him into custody—the prisoner knew all the ways of the house, as he had lived there—he had no business whatever in the bedroom or parlour.</p>

I am a carman in Mr. Clarkson's employment, and was so last Bank Holiday—I had just come back from my dinner and sat down in the yard when I saw the prisoner coming out from the door of the <hi rend="italic">missus's</hi> bedroom into the yard—I did not see whether he had got anything—I was talking to another <hi rend="italic">chap</hi>, Nickerboo, who works for Mr.</p>

               <p>Clarkson—the prisoner could hear us; he said nothing to us—I asked him whether he was going to treat us, and we all went to the public-house and had something to drink, for which the prisoner paid—he changed half-a-crown for the first quart and a two-shilling piece for the second—he said nothing about the <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> or how he had got the money—he asked me the time, and I told him, and he said he had to be at Camberwell at 1 o'clock—this visit to the Windmill was in working-hours, we were looking after the horses on the Bank Holiday—the prisoner had no business in the <hi rend="italic">missus's</hi> bedroom—the wash-house which opens into the yard separates the <hi rend="italic">missus's</hi> room from ours—you come into the wash-house, and then our room is on the left, and <hi rend="italic">missus's</hi> room on the right—the door into the yard was open.</p>

I am a blacksmith, living at Kennington Cross—on the 23rd of August, about a quarter or 20 minutes to 11, I was in the Westminster Bridge Road, when the prisoner and another man came up to me—the prisoner came right up to my face and put his hand up and threw me over—I fancy I was kicked up, because I had a great lump on my leg—the prisoner broke my chain and took my watch; this is the other part of my chain—when I got up the prisoner was running down the street—I don't know where the other went to—I was lame before this with rheumatics—my watch was worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have no doubt the prisoner is the man who took it.</p>

I am the last witness's wife—about 11 o'clock on 1st September the female prisoner came in, asked for some ham, and ten<lb/>dered a half-crown to me—I gave her change, putting the half-crown on the marbleslab at the back—I afterwards gave it to my husband—I gave the prisoner a two-shilling piece change and four coppers—she said the florin was a bad one—I took it back and gave her another—her half-crown was on the marble slab from the time I put it there to the time I gave it to my husband.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a barman at the Hercules, in Kennington Road—about half-past 10 o'clock I was serving; the male prisoner came in and asked for a half-quartern of fivepenny rum in a bottle—it came to 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he tendered a half-crown—I noticed it was already dented and rather bad, and I broke it in the tester—he said he had got it from a respectable house of business—my governor sent for a constable; he was given in charge—about half an hour afterwards I noticed the female prisoner in the other bar—I did not serve her—I gave the half-crown to the constable.</p>
