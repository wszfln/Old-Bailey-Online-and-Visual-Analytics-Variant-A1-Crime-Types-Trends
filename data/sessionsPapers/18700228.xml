I am one of the paying clerks at the Aldersgate-street Money Order Office—this letter and order are directed to that office received a letter of advice in the ordinary course—on Monday, January—I 24th, this order was presented to me between 1 and 2 o'clock by Lowe—I was aware that the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> office paid their money order through the bank, and I asked the prisoner questions as to how he came by the orders—he said he had it from the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> office, from a gentleman—I asked him if he knew the gentleman's name, and he said he did not, that he was em<lb/>ployed at the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> office—I asked him in what department, and he did not know—I then sent the constable of the office round to the front, and in his hearing I repeated the question I had previously asked him; he gave me</p>

The envelope was addressed, but I did not read it. I took the letter to Thomas Lowe, Plumber's Place, Rosoman Street"—he was asked why he took it there, and he made no answer—he was then taken to Bow Lane station, and charged—I asked him whether he was in Aldersgate Street on the 24th, and he said he was not—he was placed with eight or nine others, and Sharpe picked him out—I knew where Redford lived; I had been watching his house—he was not there during the time I was watching it.</p>

I live at 66, Margaret Street, Cavendish Square—I am a single woman—on the evening of 10th February, about 8 o'clock, I was in Judd Street, Euston Road—I went to a coffee-house to leave some percels, and then met the prisoners Willett and Harper, at the corner of the Eustonton Road—it was a very cold night; they were standing disconsolate, and I said to them, "Will you come and have something to drink to warm you?"—we went into a public-house—they had a quartern of gin, and I had 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of brandy and water, warm—we were there about three-quarters of an hour—a guard, belonging to the Midland Railway, was in one of the compartments, and I asked him what time the train left for Victoria—I did not distinctly understand what he said, and I went from my compartment to his, and he told me if I would come across the road he would tell me the correct time—I was followed into the other compartment first by Willett and Harper, and Lountain came in afterwards—the barman told the guard to be careful, for he saw the prisoners watching me, and he had better get me away; he said that in the prisoners' hearing—the guard said to me, "You had better come away from here, I don't think it is quite right," and as I was making my way to go with him, Harper said, "Don't let her go with those rings on her finger; give her a blow"—I turned round and said, "I think it is very unkind of you, I have treated you in a lady-like manner, and I think you might have returned it in the same way"—Harper then struck me on the forehead and chest, and knocked me down before the bar, and then they were all three down on the top of me at once, and Lountain put her hand into my bosom and took my purse and my pocket-handkerchief, which was with it—I had no pocket in my dress—I knew I had lost it in the house, but I said nothing till I got outside; I then directly said I lost my purse—there were two plain-clothes men standing there—I did not know they were policemen—a constable in uniform came up, and I told him I had lost my purse—Harper and Lountain went away, and changed their hats for bonnets—Willett stayed there a little time till she saw the constable come, then she ran away; the constable brought her back, and I said, "That is one"—he said, "Do you charge her with being connected in the robbery of your purse?" and I said, "Yes"—she had my pocket-handkerchief in her pocket; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I was quite sober, and so were the prisoners—I had taken out my purse to pay for the drink—I was about to change a sovereign, but the barman told me not to do that, and I put it back again, and paid with a shilling—my purse con<lb/>tained three sovereigns, a half-sovereign, a half-crown, a two shilling piece, and a sixpence.</p>

I am an accountant, and live at 4, Albert Street, Hackney—about 6.40, on Saturday night the 29th January, I was in the Hackney Road—I had a watch and chain—as I was crossing the road lead<lb/>ing down to the new market, a man came sideways and passed in front of me, and made a snatch at my chain—he did not get hold of it—I railed my umbrella, and said, "Stop, you thief!"—upon that another man came up and said, "What is the matter?"—I said, "That man is robbing me"—on the instant I felt the second man's hand passed round my loins, and a third man pushed me over the legs of the second man—I put out my hand to save myself, and fell on my shoulder, jerking it out of the socket—I was picked up in about a minute by some man—in picking me up he pulled my arm into the socket again—when I got up I saw all the three men running away—the one behind me jumped over my body as I fell, and ran after the others down the street—I went to Spital Square Station the following Wed<lb/>nesday, and saw seven or eight persons together—amongst hem I saw the prisoner—I said something to the sergeant, and the prisoners were arranged differently—I went up to the prisoner and said, "You are the man that</p>

               <p>robbed me in the Hackney Road on Saturday night," upon which he shud<lb/>dered—he was the man that made the snatch at my watch—when I got up my chain was hanging down, and the watch was gone.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Twenty persons came up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a minute afterwards—the prisoner was the first man who came up—he came side-ways, and in front of me—I had a full look into his face—there was a gas lamp about ten yards from me—I said at Spital Square Station I thought he was the man—I saw him hanging down hit head and said, "That is the man in the corner"—I told the Magistrate that when I first saw him I thought he was the man, and I went to the officer, and he had them differently arranged, and I picked him out at once—Dunnaway was the constable who was with me—I was coming home from business at 7 o'clock, from my office in the City—I was perfectly sober—I can't say which one took my watch—the first man was not a big man—he had to rise up to get at the chain.</p>

On the Wednesday the last witness came to Spital Square Station, and I accompanied him to Worship Street Police Court—the prisoner was there—the prosecutor went into the passage of the Court where the prisoners were—he came out and spoke to me, and I went into the passage and made all the men stand up—he then came in and pointed out the prisoner as the man who had robbed him—I afterwards took the prosecutor in the Usher's Room and got the prisoner into the yard of the Court and brought in seven or eight men from the street and put him among them—he had no cap on the first time—I borrowed a cap from another person and put it on him—I then sent for the prosecutor to come into the yard, and said "There are some more; have a look at them"—he went again, and picked out the prisoner—the prisoner said he knew nothing about it, and could prove where he was—I told him if he would give me the names of anybody I would go and make the inquiry—he did not give me any names—he did not call any witnesses before the Magistrate—the prosecutor had no difficulty whatever in picking him out on both occasions.</p>

My husband keeps Buecker's Hotel, Christopher Street, Finsbury, and has done so for eighteen years—the prisoner was in our service as porter—he was there, first for three months, and then left for eight months, and came back again—at the time this transaction occurred he had been with us about nine or ten months the last time—he was night porter—we have a good many foreigners come to our hotel by the night trains, and so on—there is a bell which rings into the prisoner's room—he always attended to his duty in the ordinary way up to the time of this occurrence—the area gate is always kept locked, and the key is kept in the bar—there is a wooden ladder to the area, which is put up when the dustmen come to take the dust away, and is then removed—it is used very rarely for anything else—there is a latch to the front door which catches when it is closed at night, and fastens it securely inside—on Friday evening, 14th January, I was at the hotel, up stairs—I must have seen the prisoner during the day—I was not out of my sitting-room, next my bedroom, on the first floor, after 8 o'clock—I retired to rest at 1 o'clock—I was reading in my bed till about 3 o'clock—up to that time I heard no noise, or anything which attracted my attention—my attention was first attracted by the crashing from below, about 5.30 in the morning—I had then been awake about half an hour—all was quite silent during that half hour—the crashing was a crashing of glass—I immediately got up and rang the bell—there are two doors to my room, one into the sitting-room and the outer door—I found it was no use ringing the bell, and I ran to the door and on to the lading, and called out, "What is it, what is it it?"—I did not see anybody at that time—the prisoner replied in German, "The devil is below"—it was the prisoner's voice—upon that I called to the gentlemen, aad begged some one to come down—Weber came down first, and he went down to the prisoner, then the cook and Mr. Apt, but I forget which was first—they also went down—I did not go down then—after I called to the gentlemen I ran down and saw the prisoner standing under the archway in the passage, waving something; he was on the ground floor at the foot of the stairs, about the centre of the hall—he was waving something in his hand, and raving—there was a light in the hall—there is always a jet of gas burning—I could see him by means of the gas—I did not notice whether the cook or Mr. Apt had a candlestick when they came down—I don't know what it was the prisoner was waving—I only saw him waving something in that manner, to protect himself—it seemed like that; in fact, it was to protect himself—he was raving in a terrible manner that the devil</p>

I live at 14, Artillery Place, Finsbury Square—on Saturday morning, 15th January, some person called on me—in conse<lb/>quence of what they said, I went to Buecker's hotel—I got there at some<lb/>thing like 5.40 or 5.45—I had been in the habit of being called there now and then—I knew the prisoner by sight; he had called several times upon me—I went straight down into the kitchen—I saw the body of a woman on the floor in the kitchen—I think the feet were under the threshold leading to the bedroom, and the body part in the kitchen—I felt the body—I saw no bonnet on in front, but I knew it must be behind her neck—my impression was that she had not been long dead; I mean to say an hour, or somewhat less, or perhaps much less—my reasons were, that she was warm all over, and even the wounds were warm where the blood had been, and all her limbs were perfectly flexible at the time, hands and feet, and everything—as well as I remember, her dress was somewhat above her knees—I saw the prisoner there—I did not say anything to him on my own account, but I explained to him the charge under which he was taken, and I heard him say something that would amount to this, "I don't know what it is all about"—he was then taken to the station—I was afterwards desired by a policeman to come to the station, and I went there and, in my pres<lb/>ence the prisoner spelt his name and gave his age, quite calmly and cor<lb/>rectly; he appeared to me very calm, but still bewildered—when I saw him he was certainly sober; I mean I did not see any symptoms of drunk<lb/>enness in him—Dr. Yarrow, the police surgeon, was sent for, and I left the case in his hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say he appeared sober at the time you were there; is that perfectly consistent with his having been in a state of in<lb/>toxication an hour or two before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, yes, that might be—I suppose the circumstances I have heard narrated would be sufficient to bring him to his sober senses, even if he had been drunk two or three hours before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Without suggesting that the man was in a state of insanity, or any<lb/>thing of that kind, is it not perfectly consistent with your knowledge of medical science, that persons even in a sane state, who go to sleep in a drunken state, and have distempered dreams and so forth, may be suddenly agitated by hallucinations and delusions, and still not be in a state what you would call insanity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Such things have happened.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Persons, in respect of whom it would be absurd to impute that they were insane, falling asleep in a drunken state and being visited by dreams, suddenly awaking, would be affected with hallucinations, illusions, and delusions, having no foundation whatever, in fact? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly; canes have happened where persons to all appearance previously sane, have suddenly awakened from sleep, labouring under some delusion which has impelled them to some sudden act which would not have been committed by them if they had been previously awake and collected—may I explain? such persons, in first awakening from sleep, are reckless and have committed some act of which no one would have thought them capable beforehand—they have been suddenly afflicted with the most absurd</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187002280037"/>
               <p>illusions and delusions, without there being any permanent mental disorder, merely a temporary hallucination—I am not able to say whether a deep deep caused it, or anything in a dream caused it—I am speaking of a deep sleep, accompanied by drunkenness; cases have happened where such persons have awoke from sleep impressed with belief in respect of matters which did not really exist; they did not happen to me, but I know it from my reading—Dr. Taylor is a high authority in psychological science—the cases I heard of were cases where the hallucination was temporary—a man being afflicted with a powerful and impressive dream may awake under a delusion, haying been perfectly sane before, and be perfectly sane imme<lb/>diately afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I will read you a passage from Dr. Taylor, under the head of "Hal<lb/>lucinations and Illusions," and tell me if it meets with your concurrence: "As regards hallucinations and illusions, these are the most striking symptoms which are met with in a confirmed state of insanity; hallucina<lb/>tions are those sensations which are supposed by the patient to be produced by external impressions, although no material object act upon his senses at the time." I will pause there to ask you, supposing, for instance, that a man had a dream in which he believed that the evil spirit, the devil, was in the room, might that operate upon his mind in a sleeping state in such a way as to impel him on awaking to do acts that he would not hare done if he had been awake and had his reflecting powers perfectly at his com<lb/>mand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should rather put it in this way, that a man waking up, might, at the time of waking up, fall under an hallucination, than make the hallucination the consequence of the dream—Dr. Taylor says, "A man has visions of all kinds, including the forms of the dead and living floating before him, when, in fact, he is merely gating on vacancy"—that is generally assumed—again, "a man sometimes fancies that he hears voices speaking or mysteriously whispering to him, while there is profound silence"—those are very frequent oases where persons are labour<lb/>ing under mere hallucination—I agree with Dr. Taylor when he says "These states of mind are dependent upon a disordered state of mind, no matter whether produced by physical causes or by mere mental causes, but they are indications, whether temporarily or permanently, of a diseased state of mind"—I shall not quite follow you in saying that a diseased state of mind, like a diseased state of body, may exist for a very brief period and be succeeded by a perfectly healthy state—oases are on record of a mere temporary delusion in the mind, existing for the moment, non-existing yesterday, and non-existing to-morrow—cases have over and over again occurred where a man, in dreaming, has believed that he has heard voices, and been in contact and collision with persons who have not been near him at all—I don't remember a case, narrated by Dr. Winslow, of a person imagining, while he was asleep, that he saw a person approaching him in a menacing attitude, and leaped out of bed, seized the first article that was near him, and, some person being in the room, beat him in a terrible manner—I should suppose there must be something amiss with such a man beforehand, either bodily or mentally, that was not known to those around him; some disturbance of his health, either mentally or bodily, or both together, and, all at once, a delusion or hallucination takes place and he acts upon it—I concur with this passage of Dr. Taylor," Instances of hallucination are furnished by the act of dreaming, while illusions often occur during the act of suddenly waking from sleep, giving rise occasionally to serious questions involving criminal responsibility."</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the <hi rend="italic">G</hi> division of police—on the morning of 15th January, about 6.30, I was sent for to the Old Street police-station—I saw the prisoner there and examined him—he had a wound on the third finger of the left hand, just below the nail, about the site of a fourpenny piece—it was merely an abrasion of the skin, just through the two skins—it was bleeding then—the inspector called my attention to it—it was a kind of wound that might have been produced by a bite—the next finger, the fourth, had also a slightly incised wound, not of the same character, that was an incised wound—his hands were covered with blood, and his face was bespattered with blood—the wound on the fourth finger might have been caused by coming in contact with a piece of broken glass—there was blood on the sleeves of his shirt and on the breast—I afterwards saw blood on the lower part of his shirt, and on the trowsers—I dressed his finger—he said "Thank you," several times—he seemed quite calm—he smelt of drink—he was quite sober—I saw a candlestick covered with blood, at the station—there was a small quantity of brain matter on the lower part of it, human brain I took it to be—this is the candlestick, but all the blood and brain matter has been wiped off—it was at the base, on the edge, and there were some long hairs attached to it which are gone now—there was a piece broken out—that was covered with blood, and also had brain substance on it—the composition that filled this up, to be a weight to steady it, was found in the prisoner's room in my presence, and I fitted it—I afterwards went to the kitchen of the hotel about 6.45—I saw the body of the deceased on the floor—she was lying on her back, in the door-way leading from the kitchen to a small sleeping apartment—the head and body were in the kitchen, and the feet and part of the legs in the bedroom—the clothes were thrown up over the body, exposing the person and the lower part of the abdomen—the right stocking was pulled down over the boot, and the breasts were exposed—the right arm was bent upwards and the hand clenched; the left arm was lying down by the side—there was a bonnet on the head—it was tied tightly round—I removed it—it was on the back part of the head, it had got out of its place—there was a large lacerated wound on the right side of the head, involving nearly the whole of the right side of the face, the fracture of the temporal bone, and the upper and lower jaw bones on that side—on the left eyebrow there was an incised wound, about an inch in length, coming over the eyebrow and eyelid—the right eye was partially dislodged from the socket; the left eye was contused, blackened, and the nose bones were both broken—I don't think I examined more minutely at that time; I made a post-mortem examination next day—I observed that some of the teeth were loose in the mouth—I took the</p>

               <p>things which the policeman has produced out of the pocket; that win all that was in the pocket—she was very poorly dressed, the clothes were very old; she had on an old brown dress and side-spring boots—she was quite dead when I got there—I have no doubt she had been dead two hours; I believe certainly more—I had the body re<lb/>moved to the dead-house, and afterwards made a post-mortem examina<lb/>tion—she was about twenty-six years of age, 4ft 11 in. in height; a very spare figure, fairly nourished—I examined her left hand, and between the finger and thumb I found about twenty short, brown curly hairs—I believe they were taken off the prisoner; they were his hairs—the hands were clenched, and there was some blood in the hand, and the hairs were matted together—I put them into a plate for the purpose of cleaning them, and some of them were thrown away—I have only been able to keep two or three, which I produce—in the wound on the head, that communicated with the brain, there were a number of small pieces of green glass, and some resinous substance, a small portion of which I have preserved—I com<lb/>pared it with the stuff at the bottom of the candlestick, and it was the same kind of stuff—an instrument like the candlestick would make a wound of that kind, and the bottles also—the back of the left hand was very much contused, and there were five or six incised wounds, and there were four or five incised wounds also on the back of the right hand—there were incised wounds on some of the fingers—there were bruises on the right thigh, down to the knee—the right knee was very much bruised—there were scratches also about the private parts and on the left thigh—the bruises on the right thigh were quite high up—there were scratches on the inner part of both thighs—they were all in the inner part of the thighs—they varied from about the site of a five-shilling piece to about the size of the palm of my hand—that on the knee involved the whole of the inside of the knee—that might have been caused by resistance to connexion—that was the only way in which I could account for them—there were some scratches on the left side of the private parts—I opened the stomach; it contained about 3/4lbs. of a dark-coloured fluid, with some white substance in it, consisting of fish and potato, and there was some potato peeling—the fluid smelt of wine; claret, I believe—I found no evidence of connexion having recently taken place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> She was a woman of the town? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the hymen was absent—no doubt connexion had taken place; but I found no evidence of recent connexion—I found no seminal fluid either in the <hi rend="italic">vagina</hi> or about the private parts—supposing connexion had taken place after 2 o'clock that morning, I might have found some traces—it would be rather a long time afterwards to find it—the fracture of the skull was the immediate cause of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I don't understand you to pledge your opinion as to when she had last had connexion, whether it was within a few hours, or several hours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not; I do not give it as an opinion; I say I found no evidence that she had recently had connexion—in the ordinary course I should not expect the seminal discharge to remain in the <hi rend="italic">vagina</hi> probably more than an hour—it might be overcome by a variety of causes; by natural discharge of her own—I do not venture to say she might not have had connexion within two or three hours of the time I saw the body—I believe the bruises and scratches were caused immediately before death—I think I may speak to the scratches with more certainty than the bruises</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187002280040"/>
               <p>—we do not usually find an indication of A bruise until some hours have elapsed after the injury has been inflicted—it is my opinion that the scratches were not caused six or eight hours before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As to the bruises, was it consistent with their appear<lb/>ance that they were caused recently before death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe they were caused a short time before death; not six or eight hour before, but quite recently before death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would the discoloration which is attendant upon a bruise, generally present itself after death? <hi rend="italic">A,</hi> Oh, yet, it may be caused imme<lb/>diately after death; but the blood that is effused close by the side of a scratch would not present itself unless it was caused immediately before death, and before the body was cold—I made the post-mortem examination on the Sunday, about 1.30—it was not until then that I saw the hairs in the hand—she had then been removed from the hotel.</p>

On Saturday afternoon, February 5, about 4.30, I was on duty in St. Martin's Lane, with Inspector Harnett, and saw the prisoner and two others standing outside a public-house at the corner of West Street—I have known Cook for two years—they went into the public-house, and I crossed the road and followed them in, leaving Harnett outside; he was in uniform—I found another police sergeant in the public-house, and saw Cook there—I went out again, and fetched Harnett in—Cook then came to the bar, and I pointed him out to Harnett, and mentioned his name—we went to the bar, and the prisoner said that his name was Cook—something was said which I did not hear, and we than left—Cook came out shortly afterwards, and I stopped him, and said "Cook, I believe you have something in your possession which you have no business to have"—he made no reply—I said "I shall see what you have about you," and in a small breast-pocket I found a gold watch in a leather case—I took it out very carefully, using no violence; it is just as it was—I said, "Inspector Harnett, take this gold watch; you see it has no bow on it"—Cook said, "No, you have broken it off," which I certainly had not done—I said "You will have to account for its possession"—he said, "I have purchased it this day at Debenham &amp; Storr's, for which I can show a receipt"—he had a diamond ring on his finger, which I have here—I took him in custody to Bow Street station—on arriving there I missed the diamond ring from his finger—I searched him, and tried to find it, but could not asked him what he had done with it—I then heard a noise in his throat, and said, "You are endeavouring to swallow that ring," and took hold of him, took it from his mouth, and handed it to the inspector—he said that he had purhcased it at the same time as the watch, at Debenham's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general dealer, of 39, Hewlett Road, North Bow—on 4th February, about 4.40, I was at Bassett's public-house, opposite Debenham &amp; Storr's, with Mr. Kinzett, who wanted to buy a gold watch, and I took him there—I had been there before—watches are bought and sold there after they have been publicly Hold at Debenham &amp; Storr's—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187002280048"/>
               <p>fifteen or sixteen people were there, and among them was the prisoner—I saw him buy a watch, which I had seen before he bought it—I had it in my hand to examine it for my friend—it wag a plain gold hunter—this (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) is it, but it was not in this condition then; it had a bow and a glass—I saw the prisoner pay money for it, but how much I do not know.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commercial traveller, of Hackney—I wanted a watch in February, and on 4th February I went with Mr. Bentley to Bassett's public-house, where I saw several watches—I did not know the prisoner till I saw him there—I looked at a watch, and took Mr. Bentley's advice upon it, as I took him there to buy for me—I saw him examine a plain hunting watch; this is the same, to the best of my belief—it has the same mark upon the face, a slight scratch across the name—it was then perfect—I saw the prisoner buy it, and saw money pass, but do not know what—this was done openly at the bar.</p>

I am the wife of John Cooper, and live at 6, Tavistock Street, Bedford Square—on 11th January last, about 1.30, I was walking in Endell Street, Long Acre—the prisoner came in front of me, and seized my gold chain—it was a very strong chain—I held on to him, and he dragged me into the middle of the road—I screamed out all the time, but no one came—he tugged on till my chain broke, and then he ran down Short's Gardens—I ran after him—I don't know whether he struck me or not, because I did not recover myself until I got to the police-station—I found my lips bleeding; my teeth had been struck into my lips, but I don't know whether that was done in the struggle, or whether he struck me—he dragged me about six or seven yards into the road—the chain did not break at first—I lost nine or ten inches of the chain—I have not seen that since—I also lost my gold eye-glass; and a bunch of charms was picked up in</p>

On 10th January I lived at 13, Upper Avenue Road, as servant—I have been acquainted with the prisoner since June, he has been courting me—about 7.45 that evening I was in the kitchen—there was a ring at the bell and I went to the kitchen door and saw the prisoner—he said "Let me come in"—I said "No"—he said "I want to come in, only for a minute or two"—he said "Have you written to met?"—I said "No"—he asked me if I would go to the theatre with him the next evening, I said "No"—he asked me why—I said "Because I have written and liked my aunt to come over"—he said "Then you meant to have deceived me again by not coming"—I said "Yes, if you had been silly enough to come"(something had been said on Saturday the 8th about going to the theatre)—I was in his company on the Saturday, and there was a quarrel Between us about a letter I had received the night before and which I showed him, and we did not part friends—I was not going to marry him—I was engaged to him at one time, and had broken it off in November; but he continued paying attentions to me, still pressing mo to renew the</p>

I am a clerk, and live at 51, Culvert Road, De Beauvoir Town—on the evening of 10th January I was at 13, Upper Avenue Road, St. John's Wood, in the kitchen—I remember the last witness going to answer the door—about five minutes elapsed, and then I heard a slight scream and a scuffle—I went to the door, and saw the prisoner dragging Julia Hughes along, but I could not see her plainly, because her back was to me—half of her body was on the ground—I said, "Cox, what are you doing?"—he then pushed her up in a corner, put his hand in his pocket, and I saw something glistening go to her throat—I caught hold of his wrist, and a razor fell out of his hand, open—I closed with him, and we struggled—he caught me round the shoulders; I gave him a push, and he went against the door, and he put his leg against me, threw me, jumped on me, knelt on my chest, banged my head on the stones, reached the razor from where it was lying a few inches off, and made a cut at my throat—he spoke two or three times, but I could not hear what he said—I got hold of the razor with my glove, and managed to wrest it from him, and put it in my pocket—my glove was cut, and it took the skin off my little finger—I ran to the door to try to get out, but could not, as I did not know how it opened—the prisoner ran into the kitchen, and I heard a rattling, as if he had got to the knife drawer—I ran up the stairs of the house, opened the back window, and called out, but no one answered—I opened one of the doors up stairs, and thon came down stairs again, found a policeman there, and gave the razor to him—the prisoner had then gone—I</p>

Do not hurt me, and I will go quietly with you to St. John's Wood"—I put him in a cab, and cautioned him—he said, "I wont no cautioning; I did it, and I hope she is dead. If vou had not had me to-night it would have been too late in the morning; if you will allow me to leave the cab I will not be long two inches above water"—he then asked mo how Julia was—I said I could not tell him, for I had not seen her, but I believed she was very bad—he placed his hand to his throat, and said, "I would rather be <hi rend="italic">scragged</hi> for her to-morrow than see her belong to another"—he was taken to the station and there charged.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner handed in a written defence, stating that Clarke had been passed of as the prosecutrix's brother; that he afterwards called on Clarke, and complained to him of his writing the letter which the prosecutrix had shown him; that he afterwards quarrelled with the prosecutrix, but made it up again, and determined to destroy his own life if she deceived him again, for which purpose lie carried the razor, and on the evening in question his suspicions were excited by her not admitting him, and confirmed by the appearance of Clarke, upon which he drew the razor across the girl's throat, but denied using it upon Clarke.</hi>

I am a porter, at 7, Gilbert Place, Spa Road, Bermondsey—on 23rd January, at 7 o'clock in the morning, I was passing down Waterloo Road; when I gut to the corner of Webber Row, I was struck in the mouth, had two teeth knocked out of my head, and was rubbed of my watch; it was in my waistcoat pocket, attached to a chain—I believe there were five or six in the gang that came and surrounded me—I recognise Knight as one of them, and I believe the other two are about the same height as the others; I believe they are all connected with one gang; I can't speak positively to them; I caught a slight glimpse of Knight's face, by the light from a fish shop, but nut sufficient to swear to him—I next saw him on the 28th, at the Tower Street police-station, and identified him out of eight or ten others—I have not gut my watch back.</p>

I am a box-maker, and live in Legrand Place, Waterloo Road—on the morning of 23rd January, I was passing down Waterloo Road; when I got within a few feet of Webber Row, I saw seven or eight men talking in the road; I thought they were shopmates wrangling, I halted about a minute and heard a person exclaim "Let go, let go," and one of them drew his fist and hit the man in the neck, and another hit him in the side, and the prosecutor came staggering across to me—I said "What is the matter?—he said, "You see how they have served me, they have robbed me of my watch"—the three prisoners turned down Webber Row, and turn<lb/>ing round there are two fish shops lighted up with gas, and the gas threw the light on their features and I saw them by that; I am certain of all three—I don't know which it was that struck the prosecutor; that was done in the dark—there were six or seven persons surrounding the prosecutor, and I saw these three come out from the six or seven—I knew Ryan and Towasend by sight—I gave a description of them to the police.</p>
