               <p>Where did you lose them from? - A three-pair of-stairs back room in my house. The prisoner lodged in that room. They were all there when she took the room. She had the room about three weeks or a month. When I missed them I made a search after the prisoner; she went out on the Thursday morning. I found her on the Friday afternoon at a publick-house in Windmill-street. I thought by her not coming home all Thursday night; that she had left the room. When I found her I asked her what she had done with the things. She was very much in liquor, and gave me several answers. I took her to my house, and sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>What time did you take her? - About one o'clock. I sent for the constable at about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>What did she say about the things? - Nothing, in particular. She told me of four articles that evening before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Was she sober then? - I believe she was. She told me the things were at three pawnbrokers, and mentioned all the things I had lost. She said three articles were at Parker's in Princes-street; and I found them there; they were, a tea-kettle, flat-iron, and window curtain. She said she was sorry she had done it, and she would pay me so much a week if I would not prosecute her. I said I would not take any thing of her, but if she would tell me where all the things were I would not trouble myself about it.</p>
               <p>Was that before she told you where the things were? - Yes. She would not tell me where all the things were.</p>

I looked back and saw them both get up and go to the cart, and I saw the prisoner take the basket out of the cart. I went up to him; he had the basket upon his back; I said I am afraid this does not belong to you; he said it was his. He immediately let it down, and I took hold of it. The prisoner then put his hand in his pocket; I was apprehensive he was feeling for some instrument to do mischief. I struck him over the head with a stick I had in my hand; he did not fall, but ran away along King-street; just as he got into Gerard-street, I secured him.

            's, and charged him with having stopped one of them in the Park, and robbed him. I was ordered to search him, and in his left-hand breeches pocket I found this pawnbroker's duplicate (producing it). I asked him how long he had had the watch, for the duplicate is of a watch pawned for a guinea and an half? He said he had had the watch six months. I asked him if he had ever pledged it any where else before? he said, yes, once in Westminster. I asked him where he bought it? He said a girl gave it him about six months ago. I went to Mr. Priestman's and found the watch there, which tallied with this duplicate. By the name of the maker of the watch, we found the watchmaker, and he directed us to the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>When that gentleman took the duplicate out of my pocket, I thought it was the duplicate of a watch which was my own, and which I had had about six months, that was the reason of my making that reply; but when I examined it in the morning I found it to be the duplicate of another watch which I had pawned for a man the night that that gentleman was robbed. I can prove that I was at No. 8, in Gerard-street, from near six in the evening till near eleven at night, except in the interim between eight and nine, when a young man called and asked if I was there; he was showed into the kitchen to me. He is a whitesmith by business; he had been in town some time, and was out of employ; he said he was going into the country to seek for some work. He said he would sell me his watch cheap as he was short of money and was going to seek for work. I said I had a watch of my own, and did not want to buy one, neither had I money to purchase it. He then asked me to pledge it for him, for as much as I could get upon it, and he would wait till my return. I said I would. I went to Mr. Priestman's and pledged it for a guinea and an half, and brought the money and the ticket back to him. He then said I should have the duplicate. I gave him half a crown for it. He sat down some little time, then took his leave and went away. I stayed there till near eleven o'clock.</p>

             and her son knocking; I asked, who is there? She said it is Mrs. Simpson, you did not expect me so late. I said no indeed I did not. She said she was willing to bring the goods, and as they were not all come, the rest would come in the morning. I said I was sorry she was come now for I was not prepared to pay for them. I put them in the parlour where they were to be. She came down into the kitchen to me; I said you shall stay all night, and when the remainder of the goods come in the morning I will pay you. She sent her son home between ten and eleven; he returned. I did not know he had returned till some body knocked at the door very roughly. I asked who was there? They said it is us, let us in. What do you want? said I. They said they came for the goods, let us in. I said I will not let you in, I will not part with the goods. I said do not make a noration here, and disturb the neighbourhood, for in the morning I will pay you; the best bed in my house you shall lie in. My lodger was out upon a visit; she came home just at the time as the fellows were there. I said, Mrs. Cooper, I cannot let you in directly. Presently a pint of beer came; I went to open the door to let the pint of beer in, and the fellows burst in by force. The goods were then locked up in the parlour. Her son had got something; I asked, what is that? He run against me in the passage. I said, Mrs. Stevens, as to the debt between your husband and me, I am not going to take any advantage, you may stay and sleep in the house all night, and take the keys up with you where the goods are. Before you leave the house I will pay you the money. She bid the men go away, and said she would stay all night. She whispered to one of the men at the further end of the passage; after that the man said d - n me if I will, for it will be the same noise in the morning as it is to-night. I will take them by force. After she had whispered, she put her hand up to the side of the door, and said, take that; put your pick-ax in at the top of the door, that is the place to break the door. I said desist I beg of you, I will pay you in the morning at what time you please; you have taken me unprovided. One put his back against the door, the other bounced with his fists, and the son had the pick-ax through the middle of the door at the time.</p>

             thought fit. One fellow came, and she said what do you come for? He said to do any thing you bid me, by G - d, to pull the house down if you order it. There was only myself and this old gentlewoman; she pleaded with them that they would not make a noise in the neighbourhood; and said I should pay them in the morning. But by force they did take them away.</p>
               <p>What did they take away? - All that they had brought, which they had before sold me.</p>
               <p>Did they take any thing else, beside what they brought? - No.</p>
               <p>And which you had not paid for? - No. But they had not brought all I agreed for. She brought me a bill and wanted me to pay for all. I said no, If it was day-light I would not pay you till you bring them all; bring the rest. She said her son should bring them in the morning; that was when she first brought them.</p>
               <p>What happened when they had taken the goods, did they all go away? - Yes; and the men who were with them brought lanterns and candles to go with them, and would have gone in the cart.</p>
               <p>What was become of your husband at this time? - He was gone abroad before that; he has been abroad half a year in December. I expect him home every hour, and have done ever since the 14th of this month.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050008"/>I suppose they wanted to be 
paid that night? - Yes.</p>


               <p>After this did you go before the justice to complain of this matter? - Yes I did, to the Rotation-office in the Borough, and asked them their advice, whether they thought it legal that they should do these things? They said no, it was not, and ordered a warrant, and had them taken up and brought before them, and they let them know what a capital felony they had committed, and begged of them to make it up with me; I was much against it; I told them I wanted no other making up but for them to send the goods for the money again, and if she sent them in day light, I would then pay her at such a time, naming the time. She kept me all day, at last the Rotation stopped, and they ordered them to be committed on this side of the water, and they were brought to this side of the water to be committed. There came a man on horseback from her husband and said to her do not stay here, you must go to Justice Fielding's directly, for there is a friend there who will acquit you. We went there; the gentlewoman said she had six or seven small children, whereas she has none but grown up children as strong as me.</p>
               <p>Were they committed? - No. He said well, I shall not add to your affliction; I shall not look upon it as a felony. They said at the same time to me, you may indict her for this transgression.</p>
               <p>And so you did? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And then she was taken up upon the indictment? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you have done the most imprudent thing that ever was done in the world.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoners. The prosecutrix was most severely rebuked by Justice Addington.</p>
               <p>Court. I am very glad she was. Gentlemen, you will acquit these people, it is no more felony than it is murder. Let them be immediately discharged out of custody. It is a hopeless thing with regard to any future consequences, because this is a married woman. All I can do is to grant them a copy of their indictment.</p>

               <p>How long did he continue to lodge with you? - Till the 20th of December. He was taken by force by the neighbours the Thursday before, upon my cry of murther! for a quarter of an hour. They thought they could not have got in. I had one finger broke to pieces. He was rescued at Buckingham-gate. I went out of town on Sunday morning, and left the man in the house.</p>
               <p>How came he to quit your lodging? - I was not in town.</p>
               <p>Did he go away of his own accord? - He was taken by the neighbours the Thursday before.</p>
               <p>Was you in the house? - I went about fifty miles off. On Thursday morning I missed almost every little necessary in the kitchen. When I came back he had taken off the upper bar of a large kitchen-grate.</p>
               <p>What else was taken away? - Seven china plates and one very large dish, earthen ware, a very large stone jar, two padlocks, and one key; he took the padlocks off and then the doors were open, and he took the key of the outer door.</p>
               <p>Have you ever found any of these again? - I have seen things I believe to be them; the jar I really saw; the two locks are in court; the rest he has in his possession now at his lodgings.</p>

             the constable said, Mr. Malcomb, you had better move away.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050010"/>What was there a constable with him? - Yes, he brought a constable with him. He is here.</p>
               <p>And the constable was by at the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He went into his own lodgings? - Yes, and packed up his own things. I helped to move away what he said was his own property, to a room he had got at the Cheshire-Cheese, in Chelsea.</p>
               <p>Were there any china plates taken away? - No, it was all earthen-ware, except one large red earthen dish.</p>
               <p>Are you sure there were no china plates at all? - Yes, I am sure of that, and there was a jar with some pickles in it.</p>
               <p>Did you see the plates and dish in his room when you used to attend him? - Yes, I have seen them, at different times in his room, a month or six weeks before this time.</p>
               <p>Did you see him use them? - Yes, I have; they were in common use.</p>
               <p>Where did these locks come from? - I cannot tell. He knocked one off the street door, when he was locked out once before; the other padlock belonged to the place where he kept his clothes.</p>
               <p>There was a key? - I never saw the key of the street door; I do not know whether he had it or no.</p>
               <p>You said a man looked out of the window? - There was a man whom the woman had left in possession while she was gone into the country.</p>
               <p>Did you stay till the prisoner came from the lodgings and brought the things away? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did that man come down to take care of the door? - Yes, and Mr. Malcomb called in the landlord who owned the house, and said see that I have got no more than my own property.</p>
               <p>Who is the landlord? - He is not here; his name is Groker, he lived next door but one to the house; he was standing at the door at the time the things were moved away.</p>
               <p>How long did you attend the prisoner at the lodgings? - Nine or ten weeks.</p>
               <p>He had been locked out once before had he? - Yes, that was about a fortnight before, I believe.</p>
               <p>(The locks produced.)</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutrix. Are these your locks? - I believe they are.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable. I was employed as a constable to take Mr. Malcomb up. We went with a warrant to search his lodgings. The prosecutrix said she would swear to that plate particularly. She insisted upon having it; I said I did not know that she had a right to take it without she positively could swear to it. She said she could. I said it was hard to swear to a plate. I took the plate away, and put a mark upon it that I might know it, and it has been in my possession ever since. The landlady where Mr. Malcomb then lodged, attends, and will swear that she bought these plates.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, this is a most shameful prosecution.</p>

One jumped over a bank, and the other came out of the road. I knew what would be the consequence, and reflected on myself for going that way at night. When I came up to the footway to go into the fields, where they were, they let me pass a few yards, and then asked me if I was drunk or sober? I said sober. They said we have been drinking, and spent all our money, have you got any! I said I have not much, gentlemen, but what I have got you are welcome to. Then Allison, the evidence said, d - n you, stop and let us see what you have got. Upon which the other man came up and collared me. I said, gentlemen, I am only a journeyman and have not got much money. He held his fist to my face, and swore he would murder me if I offered to speak loud, or made any noise. The evidence unbuttonned my breeches and took out my watch, and my right foot shoe-buckle, but whether he took the left or not I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did you lose both? - Yes. It was one of the men took the left, but which I cannot say.</p>
               <p>All this time there were but two? - Yes; after that they searohed me. I had fourpence halfpenny in a handkerchief in my great coat pocket; they took that out, but returned it me again. When they were going away I said, gentlemen, if you will appoint a place to meet me to-morrow and let me have the buckles, I will give you any thing you please for them. He that collared me, said are the buckles silver or plated? I said plated. He said if I spoke a word, or made a noise he would murder me. And then I went away.</p>
               <p>Did you find your watch or buckles again? - Yes. The watch and buckles were both found.</p>
               <p>(The watch was produced in court by Macmanus, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

After we came from the field, I and Hunter dined at the cook-shop in Tothil-street; from thence we went to the Chequers, in Tothil-street, where Graham joined us, and we drank together. Graham, I, and Hunter agreed to meet at Hunter's quarters that evening by four or five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Where was Hunter's quarters? - At the Stag's Horns, in Whitechapel. We met there. Bennett came in while we were drinking together. Hunter told me he thought he was a very proper man to go out with us that evening. We went from thence to my quarters. where we ate some bread and cheese, and drank a pot of half and half, and three or four half pints of gin.</p>
               <p>Where was that? - At a publick-house in Johnson-street, Whitechapel, and agreed the whole of us to go out that evening, and rob the first man we laid hold of in some fields.</p>
               <p>Did you go out together? - Yes, about eight o'clock, or a little after, from that house.</p>
               <p>Who went out? - Bennett, Hunter, Graham, and myself. They knowing the fields best, we went the way Graham and Bennett knew. When we got into the fields behind the church, we sat down behind the bank. The baker (the prosecutor) came by; Graham and Hunter agreed to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050012"/>run off while Bennett and I robbed him, and to give us notice if any body was coming.</p>
               <p>Bennett and you made the attack? - Yes. Bennett laid hold of him and I took the watch out of his pocket. I unbuckled his shoe on his right foot, and Bennett took the buckles, and then I took the watch. Then we all four ran off together across the fields, and went into Whitechapel; after that we went into the fields again.</p>
               <p>What became of the watch and buckles? - I kept the watch and Bennett kept the buckles just then. We came between Bishopsgate and Shoreditch, in the main street, and went on till we came opposite Bishopsgate church, there we proposed to dispose of the things. I gave Bennett the watch, and Bennett gave Hunter the buckles. Graham and Hunter were to go and pawn the buckles, and Bennett and I were to pawn the watch that evening. We tried to pawn them at two places in Houndsditch, but it being late in the evening they would not let us into the shop.</p>
               <p>What time was that? - About nine or a little after. Then we agreed to give Hunter the watch with the buckles to keep that evening, being near his quarters. We went and drank a pot of half and half, where it was agreed for me to take the watch to dispose of it the best way I could the next morning, and they were to meet me at ten or eleven o'clock at my lodgings the next morning. I offered it to

               <p>When Allison turned evidence, Morant and I went and secured the other three. Macmanus was present at the examination before the justice. They were examined apart; Graham was the first that was examined; he acknowledged its being field-day, and having drank at the Chequers; but denied ever being at Whitechapel. He was then taken on one side and Hunter was examined, he acknowledged their meeting at his quarters, and that they went to Allison's quarters, and from thence they went to the fields. Graham was then called in again, and the magistrate asked,</p>
               <p>"How could you tell me that you was not at Whitechapel? Hunter says that you was." Hunter then said to Graham, you know very well that you was with us. He was then taken out, and Bennett was brought in; he was asked the same questions, and gave the same answers as near as possible.</p>
               <p>The same as Graham and Hunter did? - The same as Hunter did, not the same as Graham did.</p>

               <p>I was going to Artillery-street; Allison was at the Chequers in Tothill-street; he called me in, and asked me to pawn a pair of buckles for him. I said I never pawned any thing for myself, and I would not for him. I took the buckles in my hand, and the corporal came in. Allison said here is Gamble coming, let us ask him to pawn them. He called Gamble backwards and asked him to pawn them; he consented to go; he went and pawned them, and brought him the money. I had a share of a pot of beer there, and then went home, and left Gamble and Allison there together. I gave him the buckles and he went and pawned them, and gave Allison the money and the duplicate.</p>
               <p>To Gamble. Did you see Allison there? - Yes. Allison and Graham called me backwards; Allison asked me to pawn the buckles for him, but I got them from Graham.</p>
               <p>Did he call to Graham to give you the buckles? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Hall, a lamb butcher; upon the 10th of March, about half after four in the morning, coming up the Ram-yard with a candle in my hand; I saw two men lurking about the top of the yard. I thought they wanted to steal some lambs, as we had lost some before. I went back down the yard, and told my master there were two men in the yard whom I suspected wanted to steal a lamb; we went back from the farther end of the yard through the gate-way, with candles in our hands, and went into the next inn; the prisoner was then standing under the gate-way pretending to make water; when we came into the Rose-Inn I said to my master, that is one of the men, the other is at the top of the yard. He said, don't you know him? I said no; he said, don't you know the iron shop in Peter-street? I said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050014"/>yes; is it Pentycross? He said yes. I said, I thought he was transported. My master then bid me blow my candle out and watch him, which I did; and in two or three minutes I saw the prisoner come out of the warehouse with a box, and a parcel on the top of the box; he went out of the yard into the street; I took him by the arm, and said, what have you got there? He said, what business had I with that? that they were his own goods. He said did you ever see such a rascal to stop a man with his own property? I laid hold of him, and took him into the Rose-inn with the things under his arm; he laid them down on the dresser; and I went and called Mr. Wildman's people up at the Ram, and told them the warehouse was broke open. Mr. Wildman's son came to the publick-house; and the things were delivered to the constable by the watchman. I saw him deliver them. When we had him in the kitchen, and Mr. Wildman's son came and brought the book, he said, I know the things very well; I booked them myself over night. Mr. Nourse came, and they searched him and found three pick-lock keys in his pocket, which, upon trial, unlocked the door.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>The man in the yard might see you go backwards and forwards very well? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body else? - Yes; there was another man with him, when I took hold of the prisoner; he ran away.</p>
               <p>What distance was you from the prisoner when he came out of the warehouse? - About eight or ten yards.</p>
               <p>Is the door of the warehouse in the yard or in the passage? - It is in the gate-way going into the yard, there is a door comes out in the gate-way.</p>

               <p>How far is that from the warehouse? - About ten yards. He told me there was a man or two in the yard whom he had some suspicion of. I went up the yard, through the gate-way, and saw Pentycross standing under the gate-way, about a yard or two from the warehouse door, as if he was making water. I passed him, and went into the Rose, the next inn. I said to my man, that is Penty-cross, watch him; he went out, and soon after I went down the yard, I did not see any man. I had not been in the yard above five minutes before a butcher came and told me my man had taken a person on suspicion as a thief. I went into the publick-house and saw the prisoner in custody, and the things on the dresser.</p>

Mailling used me very ill; I could never get my patterns from him; he was tried afterwards; the first time there was a flaw in the indictment, and he was acquitted; the second time he was indicted and found guilty; and after he was found guilty he put a knife into his throat; he recovered; and when Beldom took me, he said he had me in his power to hang me. I said my partner Mr. Cox was with me, and could tell where I got the things; they said they had got him pressed, and that now he could be of no service to me. On the Monday Cox was discharged, and was before the alderman, and told the affair: will your lordship be pleased to hear what he has to say. The clock struck five before I got out of bed to go to Deptford that morning. I hope you will look into this affair; it is Mailling and Beldom's doing. I saw Mailling as soon as I was taken to Guildhall; the moment I got in he set upon me, and said now he had me.</p>

               <p>I am servant to the prosecutor. Seeing accidentally a waistcoat of my master's hanging up at a clothes-shop for sale, I traced it to the prisoner. I found that he lived in a court by St. James's. Swift, the constable, and I went to his lodgings; we found him in bed. There was a trunk, the key of which he had in his pocket. We opened it and found the clothes mentioned in the indictment. I believe them to be my master's property. The stockings have my master's mark upon them.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came with another woman into my shop, and asked to look at some lawn. She looked at several pieces. She was a long time stooping down, as if she was buckling her shoe; that raised my suspicion. I saw something about her which made me suspect her. Mr. Cashaw went after her and brought her back. I charged her with stealing something; she denied it. I turned her cloak back, and took the three pieces of lawn from under her arm.</p>

               <p>These pieces of lawn were given to me by the young woman who was in the shop. This gentleman, Mr. Cashaw, saw the young woman give them to me. They charged me, and let her go.</p>
               <p>To Cashaw. How was that? - I called in at Mr. Facey's, and saw Mrs. Facey serving the prisoner and another with some lawn. She was apprehensive when they went out, that they had taken some with them, and desired me to follow them; I did. When they perceived me follow them, one went one way and the other another. The prisoner looking more suspicious than the other, I desired her to go back. I thought she had made a mistake. She went back.</p>
               <p>Court. But did you see the other young woman give the parcel to her, and then stop her and let the other young woman go? - No.</p>

               <p>I lost three handkerchiefs out of my shop last Saturday was a week. The prisoner with another woman came into the shop to look at some prints; after they had looked at a great many, there were none of them would suit. She dropped a large parcel of handkerchiefs from under her cloak in the shop. The young man who served in the shop, suspecting she had more, followed her out of doors. I saw him follow her and bring her back, and I saw him take the handkerchiefs from under her cloak. I delivered the handkerchiefs to the constable.</p>

               <p>Being a country woman I lost myself; at last I saw a gentlewoman standing at that gentleman's shop; she was looking at some cottens. I enquired the way to Whitechapel. She said she was coming my way, if I would stop, that she was going in to buy a gown, that they sold them cheap there. I said I would go in with her, and we would buy two together. We saw nothing that suited us; we turned out of the shop again. I was not above three yards out of the shop when I picked up this cotton handkerchief; I held it up in my hand and asked the gentlewoman that I went into the shop with, if it was her property; she said it was not, and I held it in my hand; I declare I never concealed it.</p>
               <p>Court. Had she it under her cloak, or where was it? - She had it under her cloak. She went out and looked back five or six times, and was gone forty or fifty yards before she was brought back.</p>

               <p>To the Prosecutor. What is the value of the handkerchief? - About half a crown.</p>

               <p>On the 1st of March, about nine at night, I took a coach at the Horse-guards; when I came into the Minories, I stopped the coach and asked the coachman where he lived? He said in Oxford-road. As I was going a great way farther, I discharged that coach and took another. The postman was then going about; it was about half after nine. I directed the second coachman to drive me to <placeName id="t17800405-16-crimeloc77">Stepney Cause-way</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17800405-16-crimeloc77" type="placeName" value="Stepney Cause-way"/>

The glass on my side was half down; the glass on the lady's side was quite up. The prisoner came to the door, clapped in a cutlass and demanded my money.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was the prisoner? - I could see his features, it was as fine a night as ever was without a moon.</p>
               <p>He opened the coach door? - Yes, both the doors were opened. There was a man on the other side. They had both cutlasses, and they both put them into the coach, and the points of the cutlasses crossed each other in the coach. The prisoner demanded my money and watch; I told him I had not a single guinea about me, I had some silver which he should have if he would not frighten the lady. He said I had a watch; I told him I had not, being desirous to save my property. When he had taken the silver he put his hand across my thighs and felt my watch, and said he must have it, upon which I gave it to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050023"/>What silver did you loose? - Eight sixpences and three shillings, my watch was a gold one with a single case and gold dial-plate, there was to it a cornelian seal set in gold, which had my cypher upon it. It wanted then about ten minutes of ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner was the man? - I am quite certain of it.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find your watch or seals again? - Never. I advertised them.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>This was on the 1st of March, about ten at night? - Yes; it wanted about seven minutes I believe. I had some company at my house playing at cards. When I went in I asked the time, and no gentleman was after ten.</p>
               <p>You did not know the prisoner before? - I did not.</p>
               <p>How long was it after the robbery before the prisoner was taken up? - The next morning as I was coming to London I heard that two of the people who had robbed the Blackwall stage were taken that morning. I went to the Rotation-office, and I heard there the prisoner was in New Prisoner. I went to New Prison and saw him in bed, all in a gore of blood.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay with him? - Not above five minutes; I asked him if he was the party who robbed me; he said he was not. I said, if you are, you know what passed about the watch; it is a family watch, and if you will let me have it I will give you what you think is the value of it.</p>
               <p>Did you express any doubt about his being the man? - No. When he was before the magistrates, I said, that is the man who robbed me. He appears now in his third disguise; all that hair behind is false, it is not his own hair, his own hair was very short and strait, there was not a crooked hair in his head. He appeared in the same dress when he was examined which he had on when he robbed me.</p>
               <p>Court. Mention his dress? - He had a pea-green coat and waistcoat shot with yellow, a hat, and a surtout coat.</p>
               <p>What colour was his surtout coat? - It was dark. I cannot say what colour it was. He never put a mask on till after he robbed me. When I talked to him about the watch, he pulled out a piece of black tin and put it over his nose, which altered his voice entirely, and made him squeak like Punch in a puppet-show.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. On the 2d of March at about three o'clock in the morning, a man came and said he saw three persons upon the Green whom he suspected to be thieves. I sent the watchman down the footpath of the green, and went down the road myself. I saw two men; I went towards them. I presented a pistol and bid them stop, or I would blow their brains out; they got off. About a quarter of an hour after a watchman came to me and informed me that he had stopped a man, and desired I would come to assist them. I went up to him. I found the prisoner lying on his back almost suffocated; he had fallen over a post, and was bleeding very much; I thought he would have died. I found the screw of a pistol, which I heard drop from him when we took him up. He was carried on three men's shoulders to the watch-house. One of the men went by my desire to examine the place where he fell and found this pistol (producing a small pocket pistol) I felt a flint and steel in his pocket; it dropped out by the way, and was picked up.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. What had I on at the time I was taken?</p>
               <p>Glenton. A cocked up hat, high in the brim, a blue great coat, his under clothes were almost new; something of a new mixture, yellow, and rather darker than this; the breeches were torn, by the fall I apprehend.</p>
               <p>Were the waistcoat and breeches the same? - Yes. There was some gun-powder twisted up in a paper under him, at the time we took him. He had a gold mourning ring on his finger.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman. I took the prisoner by Mr. Bower's barn; he seemed to be very much in a sweat.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing the matter with him? - There did not seem to be any thing the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050024"/>matter more than he was in a sweat when I gave chase to him.</p>
               <p>You pursued him did you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he fall in your pursuit? - As I was running after him, he tumbled over two posts.</p>
               <p>Did he hurt himself at all? - He seemed to bleed.</p>
               <p>Are not you sure whether he bled or no? - He bled pretty much when he got to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>You took him afterwards? - Yes. Mr. Glenton came to me. I found a flint and steel upon him. These are them. I gave them to Mr. Glenton.</p>
               <p>What else did you find on him? - Nothing else but the key of a pistol, it tumbled out of his pocket as we were raising him on his backside.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it came from him? - It was found where he lay.</p>
               <p>Did you find out what he fell against that wounded him so? - I cannot find any thing but the posts.</p>
               <p>Do you know where the pistol came from? - I found it where he fell.</p>
               <p>How soon after? - About a quarter of an hour after.</p>
               <p>Was it loaded? - No.</p>
               <p>Had it powder in it or nothing in it? - I cannot say, there was a little priming in the pan.</p>
               <p>Did you try whether it was loaded? - It was snapped.</p>
               <p>Did it flash in the pan? - No, we put the priming out before we snapped it.</p>
               <p>Glenton. The key is marked No. 6, the same as the pistol.</p>
               <p>To Thornhillow. Do you remember how this man was dressed? - When I took him he had on a blue surtout coat, and an olive coloured coat, waistcoat, and breeches.</p>
               <p>Do you know what an olive colour is? - Like the colour of that gentleman's clothes (pointing to a gentleman.)</p>
               <p>Coat, waistcoat and breeches the same? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you take any notice of his hair? - He had short black hair</p>
               <p>How far did his hair come down? - About to the collar of his coat behind.</p>
               <p>How far did it reach forwards? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did his hair curl or was it strait? - It seemed to me very strait.</p>

               <p>On the 2d of March, a little before three in the morning, an officer belonging to the excise came and gave us information that he saw three men lurking about Stepney fields, as he was going to a brewhouse. He said they were upon Stepney Green. Glenton went out and came back and said he could see nobody. He ordered me to take the foot-way, and he went the way the carriages go. When I had got thirty or forty yards down, I met three men; one of them drew back, and made a blow at me and just grazed my stock.</p>
               <p>With what did he strike at you? - With a hanger, by what I could see, it is not here. I had a hanger by my side, I drew it and chopped at him again; then the other two took towards the road; I pursued them as fast as I could, and they turned towards the watch-house. There are three houses, the watch-house is in the centre. These hangers (producing two) were found next door to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Is the man who found them here? - No. Then they turned round, the other turning to run back down the Green, there they overtook Glenton.</p>
               <p>How long after they turned down by the watch-house was it that the man brought the cutlasses to you? - When I came back to the watch-house he had brought one of them there. I was just at his heels when he picked up the other. This chissel (producing it) was picked up just where the man made a stroke at me.</p>
               <p>Glenton. I found it where Wilson said they stopped, which is about forty yards from the Green.</p>
               <p>Wilson. That is between the place where I stopped them and the place they ran down.</p>
               <p>In what condition was he when he was taken? - I was not present when he was taken, I saw him at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Were either of you present when Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050025"/>Richards came to him, when he was in bed? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you search the prisoner? - The officer did, I did not.</p>
               <p>Was any money found? - As we were bringing him along, when he began to speak, I asked him if he had any money about him? He told me he had no money; as we were carrying him along the money jolted out of his pocket. I desired the men to pick it up. I picked up two half-crown pieces, which I returned him before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>To Glenton. What sort of a night was it? - It was very light, I could see him very well.</p>
               <p>What time was he carried to prison, the next day? - We had him before the magistrate about eight o'clock in the morning, he being ill, the magistrate suffered him to sit down in a chair; and he stayed there for examination till about three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Was Richards before the magistrate the first day? - No; the prisoner was committed for further examination.</p>

               <p>When? - I cannot remember the time; three men came and asked me if I was hired? I said yes. One of them stopped the horses, another laid hold of the bridle; upon which the horse began kicking; and they broke the reins all to pieces. I got down and tied the horse to the pole. They asked me what I got down for. I said, don't you see what a condition I am in? When I had tied the horses I got up upon the box again; one of them opened one door and another the other. I could not see what kind of people they were, nor any thing about them; I had enough to do with the horse, it kicked in such a manner.</p>
               <p>One opened one door and the other the other door? - Yes; and one stood in the pathway with a cutlass in his hand; it was a very dark night.</p>
               <p>Did you see whether they who opened the door had any thing in their hands? - I did not see nor hear any thing, only the gentleman said something about his watch.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>It was a very dark night you say? - Yes.</p>

               <p>On the 1st of March, about nine o'clock, I was in Leadenhall-street, and supped at an acquaintance's, at the house of one Mrs. Hancock, who is a kind of a millener, or something in the linen way. I saw a person there I knew, with whom I stopped and had something to drink. I stayed till about ten o'clock; there was one Mrs. Young and one Mrs. Haley there; I believe they are both in court.</p>

               <p>I have known the prisoner a great many years. I had not seen him of late for four or five years. On the 1st of March I called in at Mrs. Hancock's, and saw him there; it was between nine and ten o'clock when I called in.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay there? - I did not stay long. He said he would call at my house and see me that evening. I left him at the end of Mrs. Hancock's court; he said he had some business to do at Cree-church.</p>
               <p>Are you a Welch woman? - No, an English woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050026"/>How come you to recollect the day? - I had been out about business that afternoon, and saw the Taffies coming along, that made me recollect the day.</p>
               <p>What time did you see the Taffies going along? - In the forenoon.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that is the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who else was there? - This young woman and another.</p>
               <p>There was no other man there? - I saw none.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Richards. Was you before the justice at his second examination? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say any thing about being at another place? - No; he was asked where he was? he would not say where he had been that night.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he was asked where he was that night? - Yes. I am positive he was by three of the magistrates out of the five.</p>
               <p>Glenton. I am sure of it, that he said he was at Bow.</p>
               <p>Richards. I did not hear that.</p>
               <p>How long was the examination after he was taken? - He was taken on the Thursday, and examined on the Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>To Glenton. Was he asked where he was the first time? - Yes; he said he was at the Three Cups at Bow. A messenger was sent down to the Three Cups to know if such a person had been there. I do not know what answer the messenger brought.</p>
               <p>How far is Leadenhall-street from Bow? - I suppose, as near as I can tell, it is three miles and upwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I left Mrs. Hancock's it was past ten o'clock. I went to see a person I met with to the stage in Whitechapel, and then went to Bow.</p>
               <p>A WATCHMAN sworn.</p>
               <p>I was crying the hour of ten on the 1st of March, I saw three men go towards Bow. I am sure the prisoner is one of them I looked after them and observed him particularly.</p>
               <p>Richards. They made immediately towards Bow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Richards came to me to the prison and asked me, if I was the man that robbed him, and if I had his watch? I said I was not the man that did the robbery. He said, he was sorry I was in gaol on his account; that I was not the man that robbed him; he told several in the gaol that I was not the man that robbed him, and gave me a shilling to drink; he went between the gates and told the turnkey that I was not the man that robbed him.</p>
               <p>Richards. When I saw him he was in a dreadful condition; there was a great deal of clotted blood; it shocked me; I did not think he could live. I could not bear to see a man in that condition; I gave him a shilling to get him some wine and water to wash his throat. When I came out the turnkey asked me if I could swear to the man? I said, I could not, as he lay in that condition, one man put the question to me, and I said, I did not know him in bed.</p>
               <p>Counsel. I asked you if you did not tell the gaolor you did not know him? you said you did not.</p>
               <p>Was his face washed as he lay in the bed? - Yes, he was like a corpse, only the blood was about his mouth.</p>
               <p>The coachman says it was a dark night; you say it was a light night; was it a dark night or a light night? - It was as light a night as ever I saw in my life, the moon excepted, there was not a cloud.</p>
               <p>To Long. You say a third man stood in the road with a hanger? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far was he from the coach? - He was about a yard and a half from me.</p>
               <p>You could see he had a hanger in his hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there a scabbard on it? - I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Counsel to Richards. You was saying something just now about his putting on a mask? - It was something black; he took it out of his left hand pocket; it made him squeak like punch in a puppet-show. I described his hands, before I saw him, before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>You did not see his hands when he was in bed? - They were covered over.</p>
               <p>- HUMPAGE sworn.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor came in the morning to the prison and asked, if there was not a person brought in who was not very well? I said there was. He asked if he might see him? I said he might. I desired one of the prisoners to shew him. He went up to the prisoner, but what was said I cannot tell;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050027"/>when he came down he asked me what I would drink? I said any thing he chose; he ordered some red wine negus. He said he had seen the prisoner; but he did not believe that he was the person that robbed him, or was any thing like him; he said he was a much stouter man, and he did not appear to be like him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went up on the Monday for an examination; Mr. Richards was present. He said the night was so dark he could not swear to me, but he had his daughter in the coach who could swear to me, and he would bring her on the Friday. On the Friday he said his daughter could not swear to me, and he swore to me himself.</p>
               <p>Richards. I never said any such thing; she was on the other side of the coach, she never turned her head, and knew nothing of him.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was by when you first said you knew the prisoner? - Every one of the magistrates, and I believe Glenton was present.</p>
               <p>To Glenton. Was you there when the prisoner was brought up to be examined? - I was. I heard Mr. Richards say, if ever I saw a man in my life that is the man who robbed me.</p>
               <p>Did he swear to him the second time? - No; that was the third time; he did not swear to him till the third time.</p>
               <p>Richards. My motive for not swearing to him was they had two in hold, we were in hopes of getting a king's evidence, and to have knocked up the gang, that was my motive; I told the magistrates that was my motive why I would not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the magistrates you had seen him in gaol? - Yes, I told them in the circumstances I then saw him, covered in bed, I could not swear to him.</p>
               <p>To Glenton. Did the prosecutor tell you at the second examination that he could swear to him? - After he was taken away, he told the magistrates that he could swear to him by his hands, his hair, his voice, and several circumstances.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There were five windows in the room where I was in the prison, and it was twelve o'clock, and the windows were all open.</p>
               <p>Richards. The inside window shutters were all shut, only one half open, the person that went up with me laid hold of a pully and opened another window.</p>
               <p>Humpage. There is no pully in the place.</p>

For a great while I thought her exceeding honest; she left my service on the 12th of June, at that time we had lost a vast number of things of value; my wife looked in her box and found a number of things; upon which I sent her about her business; that was on the 12th of June; none of those things are mentioned in this indictment. When I heard she was taken up for Mr. Walker's affair, I went and looked in her box and found the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) that was the 28th of February; she had been in Bridewell some time before I heard of it; I did not know where to find her before.

I missed them during the time she was with me; this dimity waistcoat, to the best of my knowledge, I lost the beginning of last summer; I missed it before she left my service; to the best of my knowledge it is my husband's; he told me it was his; he had not worn it for many years; I brought it down to make a bed-gown of it, that makes me remember it (looks over all the things) I lost such things as these, I believe them to be mine.</p>

               <p>Court. How came you to hear where she was? - By means of a coachman, who was husband to a person in Mr. Walker's house, and had been coachman to a person in our house, who came to enquire if we had given this woman a character to Mr. Walker.</p>
               <p>Court. Should you have prosecuted her if you had not heard that she had said something disrespectful of you? - I believe I should not.</p>

            ? - Yes. I have known him near six months; he is a coachman. I live at Lambeth; he brought the pig to me and desired I would take care of it till I saw him again, that he was going to drive a job for a gentleman at Peckham.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you how he came by the pig? - He said he bought it of a person on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050029"/>road, and gave five shillings for it; the gentleman came to my house, I happened to be at home; he saw the pig the prisoner brought to me.</p>

               <p>He told you he bought it on the road, and gave five shillings for it; do you know any thing, after the pig was discovered, of his going down to clear himself voluntarily? - Yes; when the constable came, I would have gone with him to the gentleman's house; he would not go. He said we could not oblige him to go to that gentleman's; they laid a scheme for him to go down for hay for Mr. Jacques, and another man to go with him.</p>
               <p>Court. Who refused to go with you to the prisoner's house? - The constable said I could not oblige him to go there.</p>
               <p>What constable? - Mr. Presgrove.</p>
               <p>To Presgrove. On what account did you refuse to go to the prisoner's? - Mr. Jacques said he was doing a job at Peckham for a coachman that was ill, that if I took him away in a disagreeable manner he might lose a job, and disoblige the gentleman; and begged I would not go to him; that he would contrive to send him down for some hay with another man on the Monday, and then we might stop him.</p>
               <p>Did you know yourself of the pig being missing? - Yes; I saw it the day before.</p>

               <p>I met a man with two pigs. I asked him what he would have for one of them? He said five shillings; I bought it of him. I took it to a publick-house and shewed it to several people, and asked if I was taken in; they said no; but it was as much as it was worth. I took it to Lambeth; when they told me the pig was taken away I went voluntarily to Mr. Henderson.</p>
               <p>Sleath. He asked me to go with him on the Sunday to Mr. Henderson's.</p>

               <p>You enquired at the publick-house, and heard the pig had been left there? - No. The gardener enquired at the publick-house.</p>

               <p>Did you see any thing of the prisoner's bringing a pig to Mr. Jacques' yard? - I did not see the pig, but I heard it squeaking in the bag, when Sleath took it home.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the prisoner? I lived with Mr. Jacques ten years. I knew him directly after he came to Mr. Godwin's; Mr. Henderby's coachman being ill I recommended him to drive for him.</p>
               <p>Where did you hear the pig squeak? - At a publick-house on Addle-hill; I was up stairs, I did not see it.</p>
               <p>To Sleath. You told me the prisoner brought the pig to your house? - To my stable.</p>
               <p>Where is the stable? - Upon Addle-hill, the Bell-yard; I took it from the stable to Lambeth, which is about two miles. I took it on the Friday night at eleven o'clock; Presgrove found it on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Where was it all day on Friday? - In my stable; I turned it out of the sack; they said it had continued in the sack some time.</p>
               <p>When was it brought to the stable-yard? I do not know; the prisoner told me of it on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050030"/>Friday morning, I believe, between eight and nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did you take the pig then? - No, he brought it to me.</p>
               <p>Where from? - I believe from Jacques's yard, but do not know.</p>
               <p>How long did he say he had had it, and what account did he give you of it? - He did not give me any account how long he had it; he desired me to take care of the pig which he had bought, while he went into the country.</p>
               <p>When did he say he bought it, and of whom? - He said he met two men on the road with a couple of pigs, or one man, I cannot say which, who were driving the pigs along, and he asked if they would sell one of them; they said yes. He asked the price; they said five shillings. He said he would have his choice.</p>
               <p>Did he say that before there was any enquiry made about it? - No.</p>
               <p>What did he say when he brought it? - He said he had got a pig, and desired me to take care of it till he returned out of the country; that he had bought it and given five shillings for it.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you what he intended to do with it afterwards? - No.</p>
               <p>Is he a housekeeper or got a family? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he say what he intended to do with it? - When he lodged at my house about two months before, I desired him to buy a pig for me if he could meet with it.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing said that you was to have this pig? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you say nothing to him about it that you should like to have it? - No, nor did he say I should have it or should not.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing said about your having it? - No, nothing at all.</p>
               <p>How came he to get a pig for you, had not you as good an opportunity to get a pig yourself? - No, I was a gentleman's servant, and he was out of place. I asked him if it lay in his way to get me a pig.</p>
               <p>What price did you tell him to give for it? - I did not tell him any price.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him what sort of a pig you wanted? - Yes, a small pig.</p>
               <p>This was about the size you wanted? - It was.</p>
               <p>How came you then not to say any thing about having it when he brought it? - I did not care whether I had it or not, therefore I did not say any thing to him about it.</p>

               <p>When did you discover that the house had been robbed? - I went out at six o'clock; I came home again at eight o'clock; I looked for a ball of worsted; I missed the worsted.</p>
               <p>When you went out was there any body in the house? - Some people up in the shop; they are tailors. The things were all safe at eight when I came home. I went out again then, and came home at ten. There were some people up in the shop when I went out the second time, and when I came home at ten I found the door of our room fastened on the inside. I went to the publick-house and fetched my husband and he broke open the door to get into our room. There was a mark in the window and upon a chair, upon which they had stepped.</p>
               <p>What is your reason for thinking they came in at the one-pair-of-stairs window? - Because I found the window open. They stepped into the chair which stood under the window. There was the mark of a foot on it. I found the chair when I came home in the middle of the room.</p>
               <p>Was the mark plain enough to distinguish whether it was a man's foot or a woman's or boy's? - There was just the mark of the sole without any heel, but I cannot take upon me to say whether it was a man's or woman's foot.</p>
               <p>It was a sash-window I suppose? - It was.</p>
               <p>Had it any fastening? - No. It was only shut down.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether you left it open when you went out? - I did not.</p>

I left my apprentice at home, and there were some people in the two-pair-of-stairs. At ten at night Mrs. Plampin came in. She was knitting a stocking at a neighbour's house; she unlocked her door, but it would not open. She came down and asked if her husband was come home. I said I had just come home, but I did not hear him. I found the door was bolted on the inside. Mrs. Plampin sent for her husband; he came and burst open the door. I went in with Mr. Plampin; I saw immediately there had been a robbery done, for there was the mark of a grown person's foot upon the chair.</p>
               <p>Could you distinguish whether it was a man's or woman's foot? - No, there was only the mark of a sole upon the chair.</p>

               <p>I went with Morant to search Bagnall's lodgings again. I found this gown in a drawer in a chest of drawers in the bedroom, on the ground floor. I have the agreement for the house, which I found among Bagnall's papers which were in his drawers which will shew that it was Bagnall's house.</p>
               <p>Do you know yourself any thing of his being taken up out of that house? - I was not there, but his wife went along with me the second time to shew me the house.</p>
               <p>How came his wife to go with you? - Because we wanted to search the house again, supposing the people that searched at first had not searched properly.</p>
               <p>Where did you go from to search it? - From Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner present at that time? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Where did you find him? - Just by Chancery-lane, it is White's-alley; to the best of my recollection, but I am not positive, I think it was No. 5.</p>
               <p>Did you go back with them to search the second time? - No, when we received our information, several of us went, some went to the back door, as we had a description of the house. Jealous went in at the fore-door. I went in directly. Jealous took hold of Bagnall and the woman who passes for his wife.</p>
               <p>In what part of the house did you take him? - In the bed-room on the ground floor.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether there were any lodgers in the house? - A woman came down; they wanted her to take care of the things while we went to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts in White's-alley was it, which end of the alley? - We went up a narrow passage and then turned upon the right; it is in a little nook as it were; it is the last house, I think, upon the left hand.</p>

               <p>All you know is you had the pattern at that time, and from the price that this is charged at you judged it was a piece of this pattern? - Yes, and because we had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050034"/>entered it in our books, a piece of chintz twenty-seven shillings.</p>
               <p>That figure looks to be a 9? - It is meant for 1 l. 7 s.</p>
               <p>That entry leaves us where we were as to the subject of its being of this pattern? - We never had but two patterns in the house at that price, and I know at the time we had two or three left of this pattern we had none of the other to my recollection.</p>

I lost the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) on the 29th of December between the hours of ten and twelve. I was up and down stairs till after ten at night; the things were all safe then. I had the key of the dining-room in my pocket. I went to bed about twelve o'clock. When I went to open the dining-room door, there was a chair against it; I could not get in till I pushed it away. I went in and found the sash open, the shutter having been fresh painted there was the mark of a hand on it; and there were the marks of feet in the bed-room. There was a pair of blankets found by the dining-room window.</p>
               <p>Had you left them there? - No, they were taken off the bed.</p>
               <p>Have you found any of the things again? - Only two old curtains; they were taken out of the bed-room. There was a large white quilt wrapped up in one of the curtains, the other lay on the top, or by it, I cannot say which.</p>

About ten o'clock I went to go into the dining-room; the door was locked, I could not get in. We got a watchman and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050035"/>a man got a ladder and got in at the window, and opened the door and let me in. The dining-room window was open. The drawers were all pulled out, and the papers and things thrown about. The things mentioned in the indictment were taken away. The bed in the bed-room was stripped; they went through the dining-room into the bedroom. There was nothing lost out of the dining-room. There were two shifts and a pocket handkerchief found in the prisoner's room. Between nine and ten o'clock I remember to have heard a whistling every time a carriage went by, which was the time I suppose it was done.</p>

               <p>As to what I have laid against me I am innocent of it; I lodged at this gentlewoman's mother's; she is a drunken turbulent woman, though I drink a little sometimes myself; this woman's mother knocked me down in the street.

I paid for the papers I had out of the bag and rolled the bag up and left it on the place where they give out the papers; it is in the entry.</p>
               <p>How do you know you left it on that board; you did not intend to leave it there? - No. I did it through mistake.</p>
               <p>How do you know you left it on the board? - I remember putting it on the board while I took the papers; I left the bag on the board and went about a hundred or a hundred and fifty yards and then' bethought myself where I had left it.</p>
               <p>Did you feel in your pocket? - I felt on the outside but I recollected I had left it on the board. I went back and asked the publisher if he had seen any thing of it. He said no; but that the next man who came, after I was gone, was

               <p>Was there no-body attending at the place for the papers but you at the time? - No; there was one man went away before me; there were two of us there together; but he was served and went away before I took my money out.</p>

               <p>Was the bag ever found again? - I found it in the prisoner's pocket at another office. When the publisher told me he was the person which came next after me, I went to the Daily Advertiser and there I found the prisoner; he gave me leave to search him; and I found the bag in his left hand coat pocket; there was no money in it.</p>
               <p>Was the bag you found in the prisoner's pocket, the bag you carried your money in? - Yes. (The bag was produced by the constable). That is my bag; there was a hole in it; and I got a needle and thread and mended it myself.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I was sent for to the Green Dragon to take charge of the prisoner. I searched him, after a deal of trouble, and found the bag in his pocket, he was very turbulent. He said; he would not be searched, and that if any body searched him he would swear a robbery against them. I got three or four men to hold him, and then I searched him by force; he had the bag in his hand in his pocket. I wrenched it out of his hand. I have had it in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Was any thing in the bag then? - Nothing at all; when I had got the bag, he laid himself almost on the ground and would not submit to be searched any further; the room was full of news-people. I thought, if I took him to the Compter he would be more submissive. I took him and searched him, and found two guineas and a half in gold, and about forty shillings in silver, and a quantity of half-pence, upon him; when I turned the money out, Farmer, the father, pitched upon one sixpence, which he said he could swear to.</p>

            . When I took the bag out of his pocket he asked to look at it, and snatched it out of my hand and said, he had it before; that it was his. When I knew he had the bag I would not leave him; I followed him as far as the Green Dragon in Fleet-street, before I could get a constable.</p>
               <p>How far is the office, where you left the bag, from the office where you found the prisoner? - The one is in Paternoster-row, the other opposite St. Dunstan's church, Fleet-street.</p>

               <p>What was the amount of your money in the bag? - Seven guineas, two half-guineas, and about ten or eleven shillings. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050038"/>prisoner owned before Mr. Alderman Wooldridge at Guildhall, that he had paid away six guineas to a man in the time I was pursuing him from one office to the other; and that the man was gone into the country.</p>

               <p>What pieces did the money consist of? - Seven guineas, two half-guineas, and ten or eleven shillings.</p>
               <p>You could not know any part of the money? - No; only one sixpence which was very black. I took it of a gentleman for a book. I disputed it. He said it was a very good one, it had only been among some gunpowder. I rubbed it in some sand, and saw it was silver.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing you could know that sixpence by? - Its being black.</p>
               <p>It does not appear to be blacker than any other? - It may be wore off a little.</p>
               <p>Nothing else? - There was a scratch or a crack upon it. I was present at the prisoner's examination; he owned before Mr. Alderman Wooldridge that he had paid away six guineas to a man, who, he said, was gone into the country.</p>
               <p>Where did he say he got the bag? - At this office.</p>

               <p>What words did he use? - He owned having the bag and the money; he was asked what he had done with the money? He, said he had paid away six guineas of it.</p>
               <p>To Penn. Was you present at his examination? - Yes. He said he found the bag at the door. The alderman interrogated him; he then denied it. The alderman asked if there was any money in it? He acknowledged that the money was in it; that he paid away six guineas to a man who was gone into the country. The alderman asked what the man's name was? He said, it was no matter what his name was, he was gone into the country. The alderman insisted upon his telling him his name, he then said, he did not know his name himself.</p>

I cannot recollect the day, it was about a week or ten days ago. It was at about four or five in the afternoon. I took a loaded pistol with me and went up stairs into the garret, and saw the prisoner standing on a cornice stone close to the garret window; he had dropped down from the top of the house to that place. I intreated him to come in; he refused for a long while; he seemed to have an inclination for jumping down. He said he thought the people would swear his life away, right or wrong. I said if he would come in and could give a good account of himself, nobody should hurt him; he came in and I asked him why he came over the other houses to mine; he said he saw some boys going after some pigeons on the empty houses, and he went up with them. I thought it a lame excuse, and desired the people to come into the garret to help secure him, which we did, and took him before a justice.</p>

               <p>Upon the 23d of March, about five in the afternoon, while I was down in one of Lord Aldborough's empty houses, in Stratford-place, there came a quantity of water off the house. It being fine weather, I could not think where the water came from; I looked up, from the well-hole of the stair case, and saw a man peeping over the sky-light; I went up the partition and saw the prisoner lying in the middle of the gutter at the trap-door. I desired one of the men to come up to my assistance. I was on another house; he got on to the other houses. I got into the gutter and saw this lead lie cut, and a rope lying by it; we pursued him to Mr. Edwards's, there he made a dangerous jump, about nine feet, down to a corner stone, by his garret window. Mr. Edwards called me to his assistance. I went up into the garret; the prisoner came in and we secured him. The next morning we examined, and the lead tallied exactly with the place from whence the lead had been cut away; there was a razor fixed in a wooden handle, and a small saw found in the place where it was cut away.</p>
               <p>Do you know whose house this was? - Lord Aldborough's.</p>
               <p>Of your own knowledge? - Only by what his lordship said.</p>

               <p>I bought this lead; hearing the next day that some lead had been stolen off this house, I went up to satisfy my curiosity; and while I was there, they cried out</p>
               <p>"There was a thief on the top of the house." I keep a broker's shop in Guy's-court, by Stratford-place.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.)</p>

               <p>Is that young man here? - No. I had some suspicion of the prisoners, knowing there were such tricks as changing of rings. When they asked the price of the ring, I took it out of my young man's hand and weighed it myself. I held it to the candle to observe some mark, that I might know it again. I then gave it to

            , and told her the price was six shillings and six-pence. She kept it about half a minute and then went to return it to my young man. She said it would not do. I did not suffer my young man to take it, but took it myself; I held it to the candle, as I had done before, and found that that which she returned me was a brass one gilt; the ring I gave her had the gold stamp, and the maker's name J. K. which are two marks; the one she returned had only one mark, and that a very bad one, a T. or J. K. I do not know which, I have it here.</p>
               <p>The ring you have in your hand is the one you received of her? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Is it a gold ring? - I was immediately certain it was a metal one. On discovering the ring, I sent for a constable and had her searched, but did not fine my ring. I sealed up this ring, put my name upon it, and delivered it to the constable. Before I sent for the constable, I saw her put her hand to her mouth, and give a kind of struggle, at which time I have reason to believe she swallowed my ring. They said the ring was for the other woman, who was to be married the next day. They were both searched; they had not a shilling between them; there was nothing found upon them.</p>

               <p>On the 17th of February, as Mr. Laurence, his sister and daughter, and Mrs. Hart, Miss Hart and I, were returning in a coach from Hays in Middlesex, we were stopped by two footpads, at <placeName id="t17800405-26-crimeloc160">Kensington Gravel Pits</placeName>

                        targets="t17800405-26-off158 t17800405-26-crimeloc160"/>; it was near seven o'clock in the evening one came on my side and said your money! your money! The window was up. One of the persons in the coach, I believe Miss Hart, put it down; he opened the door. I gave him my money, I believe there was a guinea and a half in gold, and a guinea's worth of silver, or very near it, and my cane, which was mounted with silver, was taken out of the coach; I had it not in my hand.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it? - Lightish, so as to see the faces of the men very well.</p>
               <p>Was there any moon? - It was not what you may call moon-light, the moon was just rising.</p>
               <p>Could you see the face plainly? - I saw the face very plain.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the man? - I am not very sure; I think he is the man; I cannot positively swear to him; he is very much like him; he was rather disguised; he had a large great coat on, and a handkerchief about his neck.</p>
               <p>What colour was the handkerchief? - A whitish one.</p>
               <p>Could you see any thing of his cloaths? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing of his hair or wig? - No; in giving him my money I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050043"/>rather dropped it than gave it him. He had a cutlass in his hand, with which he struck me and cut my face. He said is this the way to give your money? and made use of some imprecation; and just then it was that he gave me the cut.</p>

            ; I am his uncle. We were stopped a few paces on this side the two mile stone on the other side the Gravel Pits, nearer Lord Holland's Park-pales. I was rather dozing when these fellows came up.</p>
               <p>Was there one or two men? - Two men; the man that came on my side had a bludgeon in his hand; he was a stout man; he made a noise at the door, and got it open. I said, what the devil is the matter; what do you want? He demanded my money.</p>
               <p>On which side did you sit? - Mrs. Hart, my sister and I, sat facing the horses; Miss Hart, my nephew, and my daughter, facing of us.</p>
               <p>What is your sister's name? - Isabella Lawrence.</p>
               <p>You was coming towards London? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you sit on the left hand side, or the right? - The left hand next the door.</p>
               <p>Who sat fronting you? - My daughter.</p>
               <p>The man that came up had a bludgeon? - Yes, on my side; the man on the other side had a cutlass.</p>
               <p>The man that demanded your money and had the bludgeon was not the prisoner? - No. I made a noise at the coachman for not going on, and the fellow with the cutlass d - d my eyes, and blasted my eyes, and said, give me your watches! and he came round to my side to assist the man with the bludgeon.</p>
               <p>You scolded the coachman for stopping? - Yes, because we were but five or six yards from the Plough.</p>
               <p>On your saying so the other man came round to your side? - Yes. My nephew not giving the money in the manner he liked, the man made a blow at him with the cutlass, and cut his nose; and cut my hat as it lay on my daughter's knee.</p>
               <p>Was you near your nephew? - He sat in the middle, between Miss Hart and my daughter, one of them took both my nephew's cane and mine.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive the man? - I cannot swear positively to this man.</p>
               <p>How long might the man be on your side of the coach? - They were very near half an hour in the whole; the man with the cutlass had my money.</p>
               <p>Was you fuddled or sober? - I was not very well, the dinner I did not like.</p>
               <p>Was you in liquor at all? - I had drank to be sure.</p>
               <p>Was you at all concerned in liquor? - I was a little.</p>
               <p>Was you so much concerned in liquor as to affect your memory or understanding? - No. I was very angry at the coachman for stopping.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Thursday the 17th of February, I was in the coach with Mr. Worthy; we were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050044"/>stopped about seven o'clock in the evening; it was a very fine night; the moon was just rising. The prisoner was the man who robbed me. I saw his face as clear as I see any person's present.</p>
               <p>Who was it who robbed Mr. Worthy? - I cannot say; it was on the opposite side Mr. Worthy was robbed; the prisoner was on my side.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner only on one side or on both sides of the coach? - He was on both sides.</p>
               <p>How came he to change sides? - First of all the prisoner came on my side, and with some imprecations demanded my money; his left hand was on the coach door, and his right hand had a cutlass in it.</p>
               <p>What had the other man? - I did not see any thing of him; he was not on my side.</p>
               <p>You are vere sure the prisoner had a cutlass in his hand? - I am very certain of it, it was in his right hand when he demanded my money. I clapped my hand on his. I said, for God's sake do not do any mischief; what I have got I will give you; and gave him my purse. I desired my daughter to give him her purse, which she did. Mr. Worthy and Mr. Lawrence making some resistance, he went on the other side.</p>
               <p>Did you see him do any thing? - No. Mr. Lawrence got up, and being pretty big he could not stand up in the coach; he leaned over that I could not see the man. I heard the prisoner say d - n it, I will have your money!</p>
               <p>Was he between the man with the cutlass and Mr. Worthy? - Mr. Worthy sat in the middle and Mr. Lawrence at the coach door; he leaned over his daughter.</p>
               <p>That prevented your seeing him? - Yes. Mr. Lawrence put his hand in his pocket and gave him what money he had. Mr. Worthy said, if you will have the money you must have it; he put his hand into his pocket and instead of giving him his money he threw it in; in throwing it, I suppose, some must have fell to the ground, the prisoner said, d - n you, is that the way you give it, and immediately upon that Mr. Worthy received the wound. After he had wounded Mr. Worthy he came round on my side again. Mr. Lawrence's sister had given up her money, but refused to deliver her pocket book.</p>
               <p>Your daughter sat opposite you? - Yes, he came round to the coach door and said Madam, I will have your pocket book? She said, you shall not; but (says he) I will; and he opened the door immediately, with the cutlass in his hand. I caught hold of his arm and said, for Christ's sake do not murder us all! He looked at me and I at him. He said, Madam, I will not hurt you, but I will have the lady's pocket book; that was the second time I saw his face. I saw him three times. I am very certain, I have not the least scruple, that he is the man.</p>
               <p>You caught hold of his arm who had the cutlass? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he take the pocket book at last? - He got it, but she had the courage to snatch it out of his hand again. I said, for God's sake give your pocket book, or we shall be murdered. She said, she would not; then he got immediately out of the coach; in struggling to get the pocket book from her he dragged my cloak off, and took it with him; he then shut the door, looked into the coach, and felt in my daughter's lap. I said, we had nothing left, he had taken all the money I had in the world, and I had a full view of him. He shut the cloak in. He came back and opened the door to get the cloak out; and then I had another full view of him.</p>
               <p>Did he take the cloak away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have not a doubt about him? - No.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Was not you very much frightened? - I owe it to the goodness of God that I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050045"/>not till I heard Mr. Worthy groan, that frightened me more than the thieves.</p>
               <p>Was not the man muffled up? - He had a great coat on, and a blue and white cheque handkerchief pinned a cross his chin.</p>
               <p>How was the cape of his coat? - The coat he had on was a chocolate coloured surtout coat.</p>

               <p>Who was robbed first? - I was robbed first.</p>
               <p>Who was robbed next? - I believe, my daughter.</p>
               <p>Who next? - I believe Mr. Lawrence, and I believe Mr. Worthy immediately after.</p>
               <p>Court. This took up some time? - I look upon it to be, as near as I am capable of judging, twenty minutes, or rather more.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Do you remember any body riding by on horseback? - I do; a man rode by, the coachman spoke to him, and told him he had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Had any body said any thing to the coachman, blaming him for stopping? - Mr. Lawrence made a deal of fuss with the coachman, and was angry he did not drive on.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the robbery on the 17th of February? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see any of the persons concerned whom you should know again? - Yes, the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which side of the coach did he come on first? - That side I sat on first.</p>
               <p>Who sat opposite you? - My mama.</p>
               <p>Who did he rob first? - My mama.</p>
               <p>Did you give your money of your own accord, or did any body bid you? - He asked me for it and I gave it him; directly after he had robbed me, he went round to the other side of the coach, because the gentlemen were making some resistance.</p>
               <p>You mean Mr. Lawrence and Mr. Worthy, I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did they refuse to give him some money, or what noise did they make? - Mr. Lawrence was making a noise at the coachman. I do not know that Mr. Worthy refused to give him his money.</p>
               <p>Did you observe him fully the first time, or what did you observe of him? - I saw him fully the first time, but I saw him very plain the second time; he stayed a long while the second time.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body else robbed? - My mama.</p>
               <p>Did you see Mr. Worthy robbed? - I saw Mr. Worthy give his money; as he gave it, some of it dropped to the ground.</p>
               <p>What was done in consequence of that? The prisoner swore and said, is that the way you give your money? and immediately wounded Mr. Worthy with a cutlass. While the highwaymen were talking a watch was tossed into my lap, which I concealed; he came round to the door again, and felt in my lap, and felt under my apron, and in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of seeing him then? - Very plain. He put the cutlass into the coach, on our side, and cut my gloves through.</p>
               <p>He did not get into the coach, did he? - He put his foot on one of the steps.</p>
               <p>What did he say to Mrs. Lawrence and she to him? - He said, he would have her pocket book. She said he should not have it. He did not get the pocket book at last; and he snatched my mama's cloak, which lay some how in her lap.</p>
               <p>That was in the scuffle? - It was the second time he came to our side.</p>
               <p>What became of the cloak then, did he take it in his hand? - He took it and shut the door again, and took the cloak out.</p>
               <p>You saw his face again at that time? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt in the world about the person? - No.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Was not you very much frightened? - No, I was very little frightened.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050046"/>Did not your being frightened prevent your power of judging? - No, it took more effect on me afterwards than it did then.</p>
               <p>Was not the man muffled up? - He had a handkerchief round his chin; when he came the second time that was off.</p>
               <p>Had he a hat on? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not that prevent your seeing his face? - No.</p>
               <p>Had he a great coat on? - Yes, a surtout coat.</p>
               <p>You do not know whether had a cape or not? - I believe there are few coats without.</p>

               <p>Was it light enough for you to see the person? - Yes it was light enough to see him; I did see him but only once. I believe him to be the man. I looked him full in the face when he took the pocketbook out of my pocket and pincase, that was the only time I saw him. He was of a thin face, and a swarthy complexion. I believe the prisoner to be the man.</p>

               <p>Did you happen to be going by on horseback at the time of this robbery? - Yes. I had been to May-fair, and was returning about eight o'clock in the evening; about an hundred yards on the other side of the turnpike, I heard the cry of thieves and murther! I rode up to the coach, the coachman said he had been robbed; and described the man to me. He asked me to lend him my horse to pursue them; I refused to let him have it because I thought it would be dangerous to pursue them, as they were armed. The coach was standing still where it had been robbed. I had not gone above an hundred yards before I overtook two men, whom I supposed to be the men; they did not molest me. It was a light night. I am positive they must be the men; one was taller than the prisoner, and the other about my size. I particularly remarked the size of the men. They thought I was in pursuit of them, and got out of the footway into a meadow, to make their escape. I am positive the prisoner was not either of those men.</p>
               <p>Court. You was not afraid of being robbed? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>What time did you go out of London? - About a quarter before eight o'clock. I am positive it was eight o'clock before the coach was robbed.</p>

               <p>When did you first see him on the evening of that day? - About five o'clock, to the best of my knowledge; he was at home till the 19th, the day he was taken up; he only went out in that time for a pitcher of water to a well across the way.</p>
               <p>You saw him at home from five till what time? - Nine at night.</p>
               <p>He only went out to get a pitcher of water? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to remember it was the 17th of February? - By several things. I went out on a particular business for one of my lodgers. I am not bound to tell that business. I went and searched the apothecary's book, to know the day when I had a medicine. I went for the medicine on the 15th, I had it not till the 17th; it was sent by mistake to 'Squire Penn's, and kept two days there.</p>

               <p>Who was it told you the day of the month? - His servant.</p>

               <p>You did not pay for the things at the apothecary's? - No.</p>

I got some for him to look at. The person who brought them was to call at five o'clock to know whether they would do. At five the person called, and when he came to take them away, instead of twenty-two shirts which there should have been, there was only twenty-one. We were at tea when the man called at five, the apprentice was rung down; he came up and said there was a shirt short. I spoke to the prisoner, and said, Mr. Davis, why do not you go down and see about the shirt, you know more about it than the apprentice does. The prisoner had lived a shopman with me six years and an half. I thought he went down rather reluctantly, which gave me a suspicion, that he had the shirt. He had been sent out with them to know if they would do. The apprentice and he returned in a very short time, and said the man would call again in a quarter of an hour. I having had suspicion of the prisoner since Christmas, by his buying many things, gold watches and rings, and elegant knee buckles; and many circumstances leading me to suspect him. I thought he had got the shirt. I went down to the end of the counter, where he always keeps his things, with an intention of looking for the shirt. The shutters do not come quite to the end, there is a flap lifts up, and there he has kept his hat, and things, as he lies at the top of the house, that he might not have occasion to go to the top of the house for every thing. I saw there his great coat, it was very heavy; I looked into the flap of his pocket, and there I saw a piece of printed linen. I was surprised; I put the counter down and sent word up, I should not have any more tea. I went to Sir

            's for advice; they wanted me to take him up immediately; I said as he was the only shopman I had it would breed confusion, I would not take him up till the shop was shut. The prisoner did not take out his great coat in the evening, when he went out between six and seven o'clock. The constable followed him and laid hold of him in St. Paul's church-yard. The prisoner asked by what authority he took hold of him; I said if you will walk with me, Mr. Davis, I will show you by what authority. I went back with him. I said I believe that is your great coat Mr. Davis, he said it was.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050049"/>Then instead of one piece the constable pulled two pieces out of each pocket. The prisoner had been at his pocket after I had seen the piece, I am sure; for I saw the piece very perfectly; but when the constable came his pocket was pinned up quite close with strong pins, so that he must have been at his pocket after I first saw it.</p>
               <p>It was not so when you saw it first? - No, it could not be so then. I had no suspicion when I first saw his coat of any printed linen being there. I was looking for the shirt. I said, Good God! Mr. Davis, what could induce you to do this? He said it was for want of money, and he hoped I should forgive him; that it was the first time.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing of the shirts? - They proved right; the man had brought but twenty-one; he had left a sample shirt at another place. In consequence of this letter, I found a piece of cotton, which is in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the letter? - I received it by the penny-post, from whom I do not know. In consequence of that letter, I went to Mr. Dyson's, who lives in Cateaton-street, and enquired about his maid; Mr. Dyson gave his maid a good character; she had lived with him five years; she is cousin to the prisoner. She showed me a gown she had bought of the prisoner; I said if she would give me the gown I would not take her up. The gown cost me four shillings and sixpence a yard; she said he sold it to her for half a crown a yard.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>This man had lived with you six years and a half as shopman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He had had great trust reposed in him by you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe so much as to sell for you without your knowledge, or keeping an account of what he sold on your account? - Never in his life.</p>
               <p>I understand he recommended many customers to you? - That I know nothing of; he never was empowered in any thing else.</p>
               <p>What time in the afternoon was it when you saw this great coat? - About five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Was he present at that time? - He was up at tea.</p>
               <p>Had he any knowledge or suspicion of your having looked at his great coat? - No, I do not believe he had; for if he had I dare say instead of pinning it up he would have taken it out. I was rather agitated, and walked backwards and forwards in the shop; I dare say I did not behave in my customary manner, which made me suppose he rather suspected he was detected.</p>
               <p>How came you to let him go out of the shop? - I said to Sir

            's that the felony was completed.</p>
               <p>He went out that night without being detained or stopped? - As far as St. Paul's church-yard, before he was stopped; my reason for not having him stopped in the shop was because I thought we might make a discovery of where he took the things to, not in order to make the case more complete.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The first time he is pleased to say I confessed, the very expression I made use of was, that I never had defrauded him, nor ever intended it.

               <p>Counsel. You said you was led to suspect him for having bought gold watches? - A gold watch.</p>
               <p>Then the gold watches sink into one gold watch? - If I said any otherwise, I did not mean it, I meant but one.</p>
               <p>What was the value of this gold watch? - Six pounds I understand.</p>
               <p>Then this charge is of having bought one gold watch of the value of six pounds; that is the fact is it? - What led me to suspect him was his dress, knowing that his wages would not afford any such thing.</p>
               <p>Then those gold watches are brought to one gold watch of the price of six pounds? - Six pounds.</p>

               <p>But whether it has not been sold in the course of trade in your shop? - I can only swear it is my property, and I have received it in the manner you have heard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was entered in the day book where all other things are.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. You have not got that book here? - No.</p>
               <p>But there are entries in your book of that sort? - We make it a rule every thing we sell if it is only a nail of a yard, to put down what it cost and what we sell it for. It was taken I understand to Mrs. Jones's of an evening; if it had been sold it must have been entered the last thing of an evening or first of a morning. He never went out with it to her master's house to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any reason to imagine that any of the entries in your shop-book at two shillings and sixpence a yard could mean this linen? - I have no reason to suppose it. I have looked carefully to see if there was any thing entered of the kind the last thing at night, or first in the morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Things that are remnants are sold for no profit.</p>
               <p>Hooper. Seven yards is not a remnant; it is a common quantity for a gown.</p>
               <p>But when it is all that is left of a piece and an old pattern, if the pattern is out of fashion, you sell under prime cost to get it off? - I do not know that I ever lost sixpence a yard by any pattern in my life, and this is a very good pattern.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner to Jones. Whether this was sold in the day time or at night? - It was brought to me between the hours of twelve and three in the day I know.</p>
               <p>What day of the month? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Sunday or working day? - A working day.</p>

               <p>Do you know the value of the cotton? - By the private mark of the shop it cost Mr. Hooper four shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>There are seven yards of it, should you have sold that as a remnant? - Not for the price it was sold for.</p>
               <p>Do you reckon seven yards a remnant? - No; that is the size for a gown; we do not call it a remnant unless it is under that. It is a new pattern. When we have new patterns come, we cut off seven yards and put in the window, therefore it cannot be called a remnant.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it a new or old pattern? - Rather an old pattern.</p>

               <p>My character and reputation in life and my family, till this unhappy affair, have been unimpeached and unspotted. My prosecutor is very conscious that through my connections he has taken hundreds of pounds; and they are people of character and reputation; some are present in court, and there are many more. I hope that will be sufficient. I labour not with guilt, but under the utmost grief and anxiety of mind for my loss of reputation, which is dearer to me than life itself, and I trust to your humanity to shew some pity upon your unhappy prisoner. I refer the rest, under my present anxiety of mind to my counsel.</p>

               <p>He has lived six years and a half of that time I understand with Mr. Hooper? - He has.</p>
               <p>What has been his reputation and character? - He lived with my brother in Cheapside two years, before he went to Mr. Hooper. I had the highest opinion of him, and have never had any reason to alter that opinion.</p>
               <p>- LONG sworn.</p>
               <p>I have known the prisoner about nine years. He has a very good character; I never heard any thing to the contrary in my life.</p>

               <p>Long. I have heard my mother and sister say, whom I recommended there, that by his civility I gained many customers; and many people went there through Mr. Davis's attention to his master's concerns.</p>

I have known him about twelve years in London. He always bore a good character as far as ever I heard; he was generally respected by all who knew him.</p>
               <p>I believe you and your friends were through his recommendation brought to deal with Mr. Hooper? - Yes; we dealt with the shop Mr. Davis lived at before he went to Mr. Hooper's, and we dealt with Mr. Hooper when he went to live with him.</p>
               <p>- BROOKSBANK sworn.</p>
               <p>I knew Mr. Davis before he went to Mr. Hooper's. He lodged with me near three months, that was the first knowledge I had of him.</p>
               <p>Have you continued to know him from that time? - Yes. At times he has called at my house; and if I had gold untold, I should have trusted him with it, and not suspected any thing. Nothing surprised me more than that he should be taken up for this.</p>
               <p>- VAUGHAN sworn.</p>
               <p>I have had a knowledge of Mr. Davis about seven or eight years. The character I had of him from his acquaintance was a good one. I have not for my own part been particularly acquainted with him myself.</p>

            , who is now at Margate. When the coach was stopped the glasses were both up. There was a tap at the glass on the left side with a pistol. Mr. Silver, who sat next to that window, let down the glass; immediately another came up with a pistol to the other window; my wife sat at that window.</p>
               <p>Who sat on the left side opposite Mr. Silver? - Mr. Julion; my brother sat in the middle. The two Mrs. Gibsons sat on that side; my brother and I sat in the middle.</p>
               <p>Are the ladies here? - No. My wife is pregnant; she has never been well since. They neither of them could swear to the prisoners. I let down the other window, and said, Gentlemen, there are two ladies in the coach, one with child, I hope you will not behave rudely; you shall have our money. The man who was next to my wife said, I will not do the ladies any ill for the world.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it? - There was very little moon, but it was a very clear night; the new moon was the 6th I believe.</p>
               <p>Was it so light you could distinguish one person from another, to know them? - We could see their clothes, they had both white handkerchiefs over the lower part of their faces. The man on the right-hand side was the shortest of the men. After he said he would not use the ladies ill, he added, but your money I must have. He put a pistol into the coach all the time my wife gave him her purse. I gave my money to the man on the left-hand side. He took three guineas and a half and some silver out of my wife's purse and threw the purse into the coach again. The taller man of the two had coloured clothes; he held a pistol at different times to every one in the coach he could reach. He held it to my breast, and said, Sir, your money, or this shall be your end directly, quick, quick! or words to that effect. He repeated it several times. I gave him some silver and my watch; it was a remarkably small watch, in a chased case. I have never positively sworn to either of the prisoners. The tallest one (Weldon) to the best of my recollection, is the man. The shortest I have not so much knowledge of. The only reason I have to believe him to be the man was his behaviour, the colour of his clothes, and his voice. He attempted to speak in a feigned voice; but, speaking several times, he could not help speaking in his natural voice. I did not observe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050054"/>the features of his face, therefore I cannot take upon me positively to swear to him. I am less certain to the other. At Sir

After the window was let down, another person came to the other side of the coach; my brother said, Gentlemen, there are ladies in the coach, I hope you will be careful, as one is with child. The man on my righthand said, Upon my honour I do not mean to hurt the ladies, or words to that effect. The man on the left side seemed to smother his natural voice, and said, D - n you, your money, quick, quick, or this shall be your end! I gave some halfpence to the one on the left hand side; he said, What is this you have given me it is halfpence, it will not do for me, and threw it into the highway. My wife gave the man on the right side, her purse, with three guineas and a half and some silver; he took the money out and threw the purse into the coach again. I saw my brother give his watch to the man on the left-hand side.</p>
               <p>Was it a light night? - There was a little moon, it was a light night; I could observe the shape of their persons and their clothes. The man on the left-hand side had a surtout coat on, and a coat under it with large metal buttons. Upon the first sight of Weldon, at Sir

Weldon I believe was the man who came on the left side of the coach, and behaved so rudely. I do not mean that I can swear positively to him. I leaned forwards and had a view of the profile of his face. I thought I could almost swear to his face; and from his voice, which is another circumstance, I believe he is the man.

On the 9th of March I think it was, between six and seven in the morning, my boy came up to me and informed me that the prisoner wanted him to go of an errand for him, and that he had some suspicion of him. I got up and looked out at the window and saw the prisoner go out into the middle of the highway and watch the boy out of sight, and then go in and come out again with two deals on his shoulder. I went down without my shoes. There was a constable opening a shop just by; I called to him, and he secured the prisoner. The prisoner owned they were my deals, but said he had asked my leave to take them; to the best of my knowledge he had not.</p>

They passed me about an hundred yards, and then came back and asked me if I had any money; I told them I had a little. Thompson came up and presented something to me like a pistol, and said, If I stirred or resisted he would blow my brains out. The others put their hands into my breeches pocket and took out a guinea and seven shillings and three-pence. I asked them to give me a shilling again, as I had no money in the world; the tall one (Thompson) bid the other give it me; the short one said, Did I resist? if I resisted they would kill me and throw me in the ditch! One came up to me with something in his hand; I thought he was going to kill me, upon which the woman who was with me said, you have got his money, save his life. They then went away, and we went to the Ship at Stepney, and asked if there was any body there to go after them; they advised me to go to Justice Sherwood's, which I did; I got there about eight o'clock; they were busy and could not go after them just then. We did not go after them till near nine o'clock. We took two of them going out of the fields into Mile-end road, about half a mile from the place where they robbed me. There was a skirmish; one of them flashed his pistol and the other two got away.</p>
               <p>Have you any reason to know the people who robbed you? - Yes. When I passed them and asked what was o'clock, I had a suspicion of them, and looked particularly at them; I looked at them as they came back to me. Thompson had a brownish coat, a flapped hat, and a black handkerchief. The other prisoner was dressed just the same, only his hat was turned up and he had a yellow and red handkerchief.</p>
               <p>If you had not taken them that night, but seen them separate two or three days after should you have known them? - Yes, I should. They all spoke during the robbery.</p>
               <p>You had never seen either of the prisoners before? - No. I was going with a young woman, to see her safe to her mother's at Stepney, because she was belated; she had been with me at my brother's at White-chapel.</p>

They went past, and then came back to the young man, and asked if he had any money? He said a little. The tall one put a pistol to his head, and said if he stirred he would blow his brains out, and the two short ones put their hands in his pockets, and took his money out. One of the short ones had the guineas and halfpence, and the other the silver. I saw it in their hands; they opened their hands to look at it. He said they had got all his money, and asked them to give him a shilling. The short ones said, Do you resist? and came back and said, if he resisted they would kill him, and throw him in the ditch. I laid hold of one man and said, for heaven's sake, save his life! you have got his money. Upon that the tall man said, Do not burt him, consider the woman. I went with him to Justice Sherwood's office, and went with the runners, and was present when the prisoners were taken.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of them? - Yes, I am very certain to them? the tall one I think it was that had the pistol.</p>

Last Saturday night White and the woman came down to our office, and said they had been stopped by three men in the fields, and robbed of a guinea and seven shillings; we got some arms, and went with them; some of us went the field-way, and some the roadway. Just as I got to the top of the New Road, I saw three men coming out of the fields; I went up to the tall one, and laid hold of him. Elby came up, and I delivered him to Elby, and secured one of the others; a skirmish ensued, and the other man made his escape. I saw a pistol slash in the scuffle, but do not know which had it: we took them to a public house, and the prosecutor said they were the men; we searched them, and found six shillings and nine-pence upon one, and about five shillings on the other. The next morning we went to see if we could find a pistol on the spot, suspecting they had thrown one away; we found there a piece of a broomstick, and this chissel (producing them).</p>

They said what was that to us, they were hardworking men. I laid hold of Thompson; I thought he had a pistol in his hand; I drew my hanger, and bid him keep his pistol off.

As soon as I had got hold of Harley I searched him, and found this stick upon him (producing it). We found no other arms upon them; I saw a pistol flash; I do not know who had it; I believe we had but one pistol among us which was neither loaded nor primed. We took them down to the office, and the prosecutor and the woman both swore to them. They were committed for further examination on Wednesday. We went to the watch-house; it was my watch night; we thought the tall man had thrown a pistol away, and on the spot where we took them, I found a knife, and Farrell found a chissel and this stick (producing it).</p>

On Saturday last, as I was coming home from Spitalfield-market, I met the prisoner Harley; he asked how I did, and asked me if I was married. I said yes. I asked him to go home with me to George-street, Spitalfields; he did. I asked him to stay tea, and told him I expected my husband would come home soon. The other prisoner was with him; they staid with me till past nine o'clock, to the best of my knowledge, and then they went out to go home.

The prisoner took the lodging for herself and her husband, but she said she was the person who would stand to all affairs, and pay the rent. When I went in I missed the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them). She came home that night, and said she found I had been after her, and she said if I would not bobble her that night, she would bring the things in a day or two. I listened to her, and she remained above a week longer in the lodging. She told my wife she could not get any money to bring the things in, and that she was going away the week after, but she would bring them in before she left the lodging. She went away on Thursday, and said I might get my things how I could, and she would not tell me where they were. I charged a constable with her, and she was taken to Tothilfields Bridewell. I found the things at the pawnbrokers.</p>

               <p>Did not he pass for her husband? - That I cannot say; sometimes she called him her husband, and sometimes he would call her his wife, and sometimes they would not.</p>

               <p>I took the lodging for a young man whose name is Jones; he was out of place but about a week; I then took the lodging on myself. I was there six weeks, and paid him all the time. I was then taken ill; I was ill seven weeks, in the course of which time I made away with every thing I had. After seven weeks I was but just able to crawl about with a stick, and the help of a woman who was with me. I had hardly any thing left to cover me. I asked a gentleman to lend me some money to get me some things; I got some, and went out, for I am an unfortunate woman. I had fifteen shillings; ten shillings I paid to the prosecutor; with the rest I bought me a pair of shoes. I had not left the lodging; I told him part of his things were out, but that I would not leave the lodging till I got them in again. He said very well. I told him to let the lodging if he could; I told him on Saturday night I would strain every point to put the things in their place. I heard on Saturday night he had a warrant for me; I said it could not be, for I had been with him the night before, and desired him to let the lodging; he met me in the street and asked me if I had any money; I told him no, but I hoped I should have some on the morrow to pay him, and get his things home. He charged a constable with me.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. How long did she continue in the lodging after you knew she had pawned your things? - About a week.</p>
               <p>Was she ill so long as she has said? - She was ill about two or three weeks I believe.</p>
               <p>If she had raised the money to get the things, that was all you wanted? - Yes; if she had brought them back I should not have prosecuted her.</p>

               <p>I was at work in my garret in White Hart-yard. I heard a noise. I came down; there were thirty or forty people round the prisoner. I heard the boy crying; he said he was robbed. I took her by the peak of the stays behind; I then saw her put a half-guinea into her mouth; I saw the edges of it; it rattled in her teeth. I tried to pull it out of her mouth, but she gave her head a toss back and swallowed it. I took her to the watch-house; the beadle found two shillings and a sixpence and a halfpenny upon her; when the money was produced, the next day, she said there was no more of the boys but two shillings.</p>

               <p>As I was going into Stuart's-rents this lad laid hold of me and said, I have seen you before, 3where are you going? I said do not trouble your head with me. I went home and left my door upon the latch, as I did not think to stay long; the lad came up stairs and said, now I have got into your room, what will you drink? He said, let us have a little drop of gin. He gave me twopence halfpenny, and Mrs. Smith's daughter fetched it; we drank the liquor and came down stairs together, and went up White Hart-yard; in less than half a minute he turned round and said, you have robbed me of the money out of my pocket. We came down, and he alarmed some people. I never saw but that two-pence half-penny.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor's wife delivered to my care a box containing three pounds seventeen shillings. I am sure there was that money in the box, for I told it when she first delivered it into my care; I told it again after the fire when I returned, after having been obliged to move, it was safe then. In telling it then I happened to drop a receipt which was in this tin box. The next morning the prisoner was in Nash's room, singing; I had occasion to go into that room to light a candle, to make a fire. She followed me and offered to light my fire for me and came into my room. She went out again, and came in again and borrowed the light. After she went out again, I had occasion to go down to fill my tea-kettle with water. I suppose while I was down stairs the box was stolen, for when I returned, I observed the receipt which I had dropped over night, when I told the money, which I had not observed before; upon that I went to look at the box, to see if every thing was safe, and then the box was gone. As there had been nobody but the prisoner, we went in pursuit of her.</p>

They are irons we put into the machine we stand upon when we get out of a window. I asked the prisoner if he had seen any thing of them; he said he had not; on the next day, I was there; I asked the prisoner the same question again; he said he had not seen any thing of them; and more than that, if I offered to say any thing farther of it he would beat me and use me very ill, which he did, for he followed me and beat me much; I felt the blows I suppose six days after. I heard nothing more of it till the 10th, when I was sent for by the master painter, and we apprehended the prisoner.</p>

On the Wednesday, I heard the glazier had lost the machine irons, and that my man had used him very ill. I had a good opinion of the prisoner; he had worked for me some time, and I had placed some confidence in him. On Friday following, which was the 10th, I met him in King-street, Holborn, about half after eleven o'clock with some lead in his apron which came off the top of a house. I was struck with seeing him at that hour out of his business and asked him what he was going to do with the lead, and whom it belonged to? He said it came off Mr. Packer's house; that the journeyman carpenter had given it to him, and he was going to sell it; I desired him to bring it back directly; he said he would, and he followed me. I went into the house and asked the carpenters what they had given my man? they said they had not seen him for some hours. I went to the door to look for him; I could not see any thing of him. I went to Mr. Packer, who lived at the adjoining house, and told him, I had detected my man stealing some of his lead. I went to his lodgings and found the lead; I pulled down a box in the closet; having missed a variety of things at different times, and I found the machine irons by the side of it.</p>

In the morning I perceived her taking the buckles out of my shoes; I pursued her, but being naked, I durst not run out into the street. She got away from me. I took her up the same night; she then produced a duplicate of them. She had pawned them as nearly in my name as she could, but not quite.</p>
               <p>Did not you say any thing to her when you saw her take the buckles out of your shoes? - Yes; I talked to her, I was in bed; I never saw her have the buckles till I saw them in her hands, and then she ran down stairs directly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Where did you sit when you pulled off your shoes and stockings? - At the foot of your bed miss.</p>

               <p>On the 16th of March I was in the taproom in this publick-house; Robinson came in with another man; we had five or six pots of half and half at the other man's expence. He went home with us to our lodgings; he gave me a half crown piece, and the other man gave the other girl a half crown piece to sleep with her. He kept drinking spiritual liquor all the evening. We got up and drank again till about eleven o'clock in the day. He sent me to buy him some shamroques; he went and unlocked my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050068"/>door, and sat on my bed's foot, pulled off his jacket and hat, and unbuckled his shoes; he wanted me to lie down; I said I should not in the middle of the day. He said I suppose you want some more money; I said to be sure. He wanted my buckles; I let him have them. I went and pawned his buckles for half a guinea. When I came back he said they cost him twenty-five shillings, and he was sure I could get more for them. I went back and brought him a duplicate; he gave me five shillings for myself. He left his buckles over night at the bar of the publick-house. He said he would come in the evening again; he did, and brought a watchman with him.</p>

When I had given them the change they said they wanted to buy another gown; I shewed them several more; we could not agree about another gown, and the prisoners went out of the shop. As soon as they were gone, I went to wait upon another customer, about fifty yards from our house; I was absent about twelve or thirteen minutes; when I returned, I missed this piece of silk. I left

The officer said he thought he knew where to find her. I went with him, and we took her in Portpool-lane, Gray's-Inn-lane. She likewise denied knowing any thing of me, and did so when she was examined before the magistrate. The silk has never been found.</p>

On Easter Monday two young women came to our shop, about nine in the morning, and asked to look at some silks; I shewed them into the back shop, and called Forrester, and left him with them. They staid about twenty minutes, and then went out of the shop. Then Forrester went out to wait on a customer; he returned in about ten minutes, and then missed the silk. There was no one in the shop while he was gone, only one man, who bought a yard of pink sattin; he was not in the shop above a minute, he only staid while I cut it off.</p>

Forrester staid in the passage, and I went in; I was afraid to force her to get up till I knew whether she could get up safely; they told me the midwife was coming. I said to Forrester, you had better be certain whether it is her. He said he could not without he saw her with her clothes on. She sat up in the bed, and put her gown on; then he said he thought she was the person. He described the gown she had on in the shop. I found a dirty gown of that pattern in the box. Then he said he thought she was the person. Till he saw the gown he was not certain. We talked between ourselves six or seven times about it.</p>

On Tuesday the 21st of March, between eleven and twelve o'clock the prisoner, with another woman shorter than herself, came into Mr. Rich's shop; they had bed-gowns over their gowns and long cloaks. They asked me if we had not some silks at four shillings, or four and three-pence a yard. Before I could well give them an answer, Mr. Rich came and asked them to walk into the back shop; I went into the back shop with them; they sat down on the other side of the counter, and asked for some small beer; I went up stairs and fetched some beer; when I returned, a customer came into the fore shop, and I left Mr. Rich alone with them. While I was serving the customer, a lady came in, and Mr. Rich left them to speak to the lady, and desired I would go backwards. I had not been long with them before the shortest of the two went out; Mr. Rich had sold them fifteen yards of silk. I put it up in a paper; I gave it to the shortest, but they said it was for the prisoner. The shortest paid for it. The prisoner asked her to lend her the money as she had not enough, and the shortest paid the whole. While the shortest was out, I asked the prisoner a great many questions; they pretended to be market women. She had a round basket which she put upon the counter. She said that they used the Fleet-Market, that she came from Hammersmith. She was looking for a colour to please the other one against she came back. She returned in about ten minutes, crying, and said she had lost some garden stuff she had left at the corner of the market, that it was ten shillings loss to her. The prisoner desired her not to cry, and told her she would be at half the loss. They pitched on another gown which was cut off and laid on the window. They were to call for it in the morning, and they went out into Artillery-street, towards Artillery-lane. We missed two whole pieces of silk, containing about ten yards, before they had been gone ten minutes; there had not been any body else in the shop. We have never found them again.</p>
               <p>When was the prisoner taken up? - On Wednesday last, I believe; this was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050070"/>Tuesday fortnight before I saw her at the office in Litchfield-street, when she was taken up; I knew her again immediately. She denied knowing any thing of the matter.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen her before she came to your shop? - Not to my knowledge. I am very certain the prisoner is one of them.</p>
               <p>Is Mr. Rich here? - No.</p>

               <p>I am servant at a grocer's and chandler's shop, in Artillery-lane. On the 21st of March, the prisoner and a shorter woman came into our shop. The prisoner asked for a halfpenny worth of small beer; she asked to stop while the other went out to look after a basket of spinage, which, she said, they had lost. I asked her to sit down in the parlour; as she sat there, she pulled a roll of silk, without any paper over it, out of her pocket, and put it in her apron. The other came in soon after; she pulled out some pink-coloured silk from under her cloak, and left it on the table; I had it in my hand. I went after her to the door with it, when they went out. I described it afterwards to Mr. Rich.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the same person? - I saw her again on Wednesday night at Litchfield-street, and am perfectly sure she is the same person. I remember her, and the tone of her voice.</p>

               <p>I was employed to nurse the prisoner. I have been with her almost a month; it will be a month next Monday, since I first went to her. She lives in Portpool-lane.</p>
               <p>What has been her state of health? - I look upon it to be a lingering labour. She has been extremely ill; she had a midwife with her, who, I suppose, is here. I did not lie there of nights. I remember St. Patrick's day, the 17th of March, it is my husband's birth-day; she was ill some days before that. She was never out from that time while I was with her, which was generally from five or six in the morning, till seven or eight at night.</p>
               <p>(She called two other witnesses, who deposed she was ill about that time, and very seldom out.)</p>

On Sunday night the 5th of March, about half after twelve o'clock, I went up to warm my mistress's bed, and found her bed-chamber full of smoke. My mistress desired me to look over the house, to see if every thing was safe. I did; every thing was safe; then she desired me to go to the next door, to see if every thing was safe there; when I came to the house, I found the door a-jar; I knocked at it four or five times, but I did not see any body; then I went to No. 10; they told me every thing was safe. I went back to No. 8, and shoved the door open, upon which the smoke burst out in my face. I went over to the watch-house, and called Mr. Boyden, the constable of the night; he said, our watchman was coming. I called the watchman, and went into the house with him. When I went into the passage, I saw a walking-stick<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050071"/>between the two parlour doors; upon the stairs I saw two candlesticks, with a piece of candle in each, and a tinder-box by the side of them, with a match; the candles were not lighted. I pushed open the parlour door, which was nearest the street, and there was a fire in the middle of the floor; it burned up as I opened the door.</p>
               <p>Did you find any body in the house? - Nobody at all; but there were people lived in the house then, but who they were I did not know till afterwards. After we got the fire out, and examined particularly, we found that it had burned the boards for about a yard square; they were entirely consumed, and the joist burnt very much; the fire had been put under a box, which was turned bottom upwards; there was some cheque and woollen rags, and some paper under the box; Mr. Tuppen has them. Soon after the fire was out, I came out of the house; the prisoner came home about two in the morning, and was apprehended immediately; I was present.</p>

               <p>Mr. Tuppen. On Sunday night, the 5th of March, about one o'clock, the watchman alarmed me, and told me my house in Glanville-street was on fire. I went to the house; the fire was extinguished then; the prisoner was not come home, nor his wife; the fire had been in the middle of the floor; there was a small box on the floor, turned upside down, and under the box some rags, paper, and other things; it had burned about three feet square; had burned through the floor, and had burned the joist under the floor. I said, this is a malicious affair; and asked if they had seen either the prisoner or his wife. I went up stairs with the watchman, to see if there was any thing there. I could not see any thing. I came down into the back parlour, and found the bed curtains and window curtains taken away; there was a turn-up and half tester bed in the room. I papered the room with a paper he chose, to answer the furniture of his bed. I saw the curtains up about a month before; after that when the fire was out, and people dispersed to their apartments, I ordered the door to be shut, and staid with the watchmen in the house, and when the watchmen went out, I desired them to look and see if any body was lurking about at the corner of the street. About two o'clock I went into the next house, to let the old lady know she might go to bed; that I should stay on the premises all night. While I was there, the watchman came and told me the prisoner was come home. I went in, and said to him, For God's sake, Mr. Breeme, where have you been? He said, to Tower-hill. I said, here is an amazing circumstance happened; and God knows what might have been the consequence, if it had not been discovered. He took a candle, and went down into the kitchen, and sat down. I followed him. I said, Mr. Breeme, your wife and you have deserted the house; here is this fire happened; I must give charge of you, for you to give some account about it. He said never a word. I gave the watchmen charge of him, and desired them to indulge him as much as they could in the watch-house, for which I gave them two shillings the next day. I saw no more of the prisoner after that.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know what the family consisted of, who lived in the house with him? - Nobody but he and his wife, that ever I saw.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050072"/>What was his trade? - A tailor.</p>
               <p>Had he any journeymen? - I do not know, I put him up a board big enough to hold six men.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen in what way the house was furnished? - I can tell pretty well how the house was furnished; there was no great matter only in the fore parlour, kitchen, and bed-room.</p>
               <p>Was there no furniture in the upper part of the house? - No, only a bed in the garret, which is the work-shop.</p>

               <p>I left the house that Sunday night at near seven o'clock and went to Tower-hill; I had a man with me in the, house who did a little business for me in the writiag way; we went out together; before we went out I locked the dog in the kitchen. When we came to Red-Lion-square, I recollected I had not left the key for my wife, and proposed to go back, the man persuaded me not, and we proceeded to Tower-hill, to the Hamburgh Arms; we got there about eight o'clock; we sat and drank together there till about ten o'clock, then we came away and came together as far as Aldgate, there we parted; I went to shoemaker-row, and staid about an hour, then I came through the city to Fleet-market; the clock struck eleven when I came through Temple-bar. I had a glass of gin, on the left-hand side by the New Church; then I went to the King's-Head in Covent-garden, I got there about half after eleven; I waited above half an hour for a pint of brandy hot. I fell partly asleep before I drank it; when I waked the house was full of people; the watchman was crying half after one o'clock. Then I proceeded home; as I went up Tottenham-court-road, the watchman was crying past two o'clock; when I came up to my door and put the key in, a man came up to me and said you have got a key; I said yes, the key of my own house. The man pushed me into the house, upon which two or three men ran up stairs together. I said what is this in the house? I was quite stagnated; they took me into the kitchen, and the landlord came and gave charge of me.</p>
               <p>Johnson. There was not so much as any apparel in the house which he and his wife had pulled off on Sunday.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I get my living by writing. I used to write for the prisoner, who is a German. I was at his house the day the house was on fire, which was a Sabbath day, the 5th of March. We left the house about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Who was in the house when you left it? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the dog? - When I was down in the kitchen writing, I observed the dog come in several times.</p>
               <p>Where did you leave the dog? - I do not recollect. I did not see the dog when we came. I think if he had been out he would have followed his master. We went together as far as Red-Lion-square; he said I must go back to Oxford-street, for I have forgot to leave the key with my wife; I said as you have got so far you had better go forwards, as she is at a friend's house, they may not think much of sitting up a little; upon my saying so he went forwards.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you where his wife was? - He said she was at friend's house in Oxford-street. He did not signify the person's name then, but I know it now. When we came to the farthest part of the square, there is a passage which I knew would lead me towards my home; I said I must wish you good night; he said I am going to Tower-hill, on a little business, if you will go with me, I will treat you with a couple of pints of beer, and you will have an opportunity of seeing the paper, which you say you have not seen some time. We went to the Hamburgh Arms on Tower-hill; we staid there till about half after nine at night.</p>
               <p>What did he buy there? - A bottle of drops, with a German, and desired the German direction to be taken back and an English one brought, that I might read it; he paid for the two pints of beer, put the drops into his pocket, and we came away together as far as Aldgate; there we parted. He said he was going to Shoemaker-row.</p>
               <p>Where is your home? - At the top of Golden-lane, Old-street.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How was you employed that evening at the prisoner's house before you went out? - The first thing he set me about was writing an advertisement for the publick paper, as an advertising tailor, to make things low; then he set me about paging this book (producing a quarto book) I began making the alphabet but did not finish it.</p>
               <p>Is that the advertisement you wrote (shewing the witness a paper)? - This is not the advertisement. I wrote this in prison the Tuesday after he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Did not you produce this very paper before the magistrate, as the paper you then wrote? - I did not swear it, I produced it.</p>
               <p>For what purpose did you produce it, did not you produce it as the paper you wrote the Sunday before at the prisoner's house and the very paper he wrote at his house? - I told them I wrote it at his house.</p>
               <p>You afterwards acknowledged it was written in Clerkenwell Bridewell, to serve the Prisoner? - Yes, to supply the other which he had lost.</p>
               <p>ANN CHAPMAN sworn.</p>
               <p>My father keeps a publick-house, in Shoemaker-row, near Aldgate. On Sunday the 5th of March the prisoner came to our house between nine and ten o'clock; he staid till about ten; I made him some Hollands and water. He left a bundle there.</p>
               <p>Court. What was in the bundle? - A great coat only.</p>

We found the dog on the outside of the door. Mrs. Breeme knocked at the door; I think if had not been fast it would have opened. When she found she could not get in, I said go back to my house and lie with me as my husband will not come home to-night, which she did.</p>
               <p>Court. She often lay at your house? - Never before.</p>
               <p>Though the door was not open between ten and eleven did she not expect Mr. Breeme would come home? - When she came she said Mr. Breeme was going out and she expected he would call for her; she staid till after ten, then she began to be uneasy, and said she would go home.</p>
               <p>Is she an intimate acquaintance of your's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were any of her clothes at your house? - No.</p>

               <p>Had you heard what had happened before you went home? - No, she sent for me afterwards to her house; I went and she told me she was taken up on account of the fire; I went with her to the Rotation-office in Litchfield-street; there she was discharged.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know what is become of her clothes? - No. The next morning, when they sent from Litchfield-street to search the house her clothes were in a trunk.</p>
               <p>Johnson. I said there were no clothes they had pulled off that day. I recollect some petticoats in a box.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman. As I was coming to town in the morning I saw the two prisoners and two other men unskewer the cart and take the property out; they laid it down on the road; then they went underneath some new houses about a couple of poles from it in the path-way. When I came opposite to them they went to the property again, and took it up, and went over a gate into the fields.</p>
               <p>Did all the four men keep together? - Yes. I went after the young man, and told him his cart had been robbed. He and I went back into the fields, and saw them with the things.</p>
               <p>Afterwards you took these two men and the other two escaped? - Yes; they were never out of my sight till we took them.</p>
               <p>How came you to suffer them to rob this cart, when you saw them, without informing the the person of it? - I did not dare attack them by myself; as soon as they were in the field I went after the cart and informed him of it.</p>
