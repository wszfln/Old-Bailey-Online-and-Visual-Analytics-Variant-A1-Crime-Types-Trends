On 12th November, at 4 p.m., I was with Newland on Ludgate Hill in plain clothes, and saw the prisoners on the other side of the street, 10 or 12 yards distant from me—I watched them three or four minutes—they went towards St. Paul's and met the prosecutrix and two other ladies—they then turned back, Harris placing himself on the right, and Johnson on the left of the lady—after going a few yards, Johnson placed himself for a few seconds immediately in front of the lady, who was walking with a bag in her hand—I saw Harris open her bag, take something out, and put it in his right-hand coat pocket—the prisoners then suddenly crossed over towards me, walking side by side, talking and smiling, and I seized each of them by the collar—Johnson looked up in my face, and seeing who I was, he struggled and broke away—he ran down Ave Maria Lane pursued by Newland, who cried "Stop thief"—I took this purse from Harris's pocket and took him across to the lady, who identified it, but did not know it was stolen till I told her—I searched the prisoners at the station, and found a sovereign and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver on Johnson, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on Harris—Johnson gave the name of Johnson, and said he had no fixed residence in London—I have seen them together once before and watched them.</p>

I went upstairs and asked my wife, who was ill in bed, if there was anything left here. She said, 'Yes, a parcel with five umbrellas, left here by the name of Wotherspoon,' and I could hardly believe it. With that I took the umbrellas and the piece of silk to the man on Saturday, and when I found it was got wrong—folly I left it there, and would have no more to do with it".</p>

The key had been in the door of his room ever since he lived there till his wife brought it to him in the cell on the Sunday. Wotherspoon said he was perfectly innocent and knew nothing of the charge. Sowden said a person who was ill asked Mm to sell the goodsf saying they were bought at a sale, and he tried to sell them.</hi>

I keep the Stonehouse Tavern, Old Street, St. Luke's—in August, 1877, I was in want of a barman—Johnson called—he said "I have called for the barman's situation" and "I have 11 months' good character"—I said "Where?"—he said "From a gentleman that keeps the New Stag, Cumberland Market"—I cannot say if he mentioned the name of the gentleman, I have not put it down—I put down the address at the time and arranged to meet the prisoner there—I went to the New Stag the same evening—I made the top portion of this note at the time of tie interview—I put in the date when Johnson came into my service, the 23rd August—the interview was a day or two before that—I met Johnson outside the New Stag—I said "dan I see the proprietor?"—I saw Hunt in the her—I said to him, believing him to be the proprietor, "I have come respect<lb/>ing a barman's character"—he said "Come into the bar parlour"—Johnson did not go in—I can hardly say which spoke first; but I said "What is Johnson's character?" and he said "Very good "or "Very fair"—I said "By your recommendation I shall take him into my employ"—I said that Johnson had told me that he had 11 months' character—Hunt said "Yes, that is so"—that was all that took place, and believing that he had been 11 months at the New Stag as barman I took him into my service on the 23rd August, 1877, and he remained about three weeks, when my wife discharged him—she assists me in the business—while Johnson was wits me he used to take a little too much at times.</p>

Hope "was on a white waistcoat; the mark was cut out of many of the articles—I searched the box of the female prisoner where she was in service at Brook House, ana there found three pocket handkerchiefs, one of which was marked "H. S. G."—one of the books I found in the male prisoner's box has Mrs. Hope's name in it—all the property has been, identified by Mr. Hope and Mr. Gore.</p>

               <p>had the right to take them out of the shop; they are kept in the foreman's office; the workman never took them away to my knowledge—Tomkins never took work home for me—the value of the two jewel drawers, with a glass frame and tiled back, would be about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the four moulds are of very little value, about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the walnut towel-horse about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—there is also a peculiarity about the veneer—we bought the whole stock, and tried to match it afterwards,'but could not, although my foreman was going about the whole of two days to try and get this particular wood—it is Hungarian ash, and we cannot procure it now—I have never sold any of that veneer—on one occasion I sold four pieces of pine to Tomkins; he asked me to do so, and I told him then that I did not care about selling wood—I think I charged him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it; that is the only occasion I ever sold my wood—I was not aware that he had this property at the coffee-shop—my foreman makes out delivery orders for the materials each workman requires—these produced are some made out in the name of Tomkins—when the job is finished the order is signed as finished, the job is entered, and the clerk has charge of the orders—the orders ought never to leave the premises.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Tomkins had been in our employment one or two years—he was a good workman, and it was not impossible for him to imitate my patterns—I have given my workmen wood, but never much, not enough to make any of these goods—they said they wanted to repair something—cabinetmakers sometimes work at home, but it is not the rule—one of the duplicates found at Cope's place referred to a miniature set of drawers—no doubt that was manufactured at home—a workman would have to buy 24 gross of those spindles, and even then, considering the price he would have to pay, he could get other patterns cheaper—I can also swear to the graining on those drawers—a miniature chest of drawers like that could be made by a workman without my knowing it.</p>

I am the wife of Edmund Washington Knight, a clothier in Blackman Street—on Saturday night, 8th November, three people came into the shop; the female prisoner and Goldberg are two of them; I cannot swear to the other—Goldberg said "We want two overcoats, we want to see some cloth"—I showed them some—there was some conversation about it, and I reached some more large pieces down—they said they were much too dear—the conversation was carried on in English; they spoke English very well—they were in the shop about 10 minutes; they said they wanted an overcoat at about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not sell them one, nor any cloth, and they went out—my husband came in and said something to me, in con<lb/>sequence of which I searched for a piece of cloth which I had seen before these people came in—I had seen my husband reach it down before he went out, and it was lying on the counter when the prisoners came in; there was about 11 yards—the original quantity was marked 23 yards; it was worth about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—next day, Sunday, I went to the police station and identified Leah Bloomenthal and Goldberg—they were placed with nine others, three of them women—I have not the slightest doubt about those two—I could not say whether Hyman Bloomenthal was the other man.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 70, King and Queen Street, Walworth, and am a general dealer—on Saturday night, Oct. 18, about 9.45, I was in St. George's Road going home, when the prisoner Smith knocked me down; he caught me under the leg with his hand, and I fell, and he fell on the top of me; he threw himself across my stomach, kneeling, tore open my buttons, and snatched my watch and chain while Nickless held my hands—I was hurt on my back—I did not know then that they had taken anything else—after taking my watch they ran away—I got up and ran after them; I saw them running—I saw three private policemen and a constable; they spoke to me, and I complained to them, and they joined me, and we all ran after the prisoners—I caught sight of them; the private policemen caught one by Bedlam, about twelve yards from where I was knocked down—I am sure the prisoners are the men—when I got home I found that I had lost my purse and card-case; the purse contained two shillings and a threepenny piece—they were in my right-hand trowsers pocket—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my puree and card-case—I was very much hurt, and felt very great pain across my stomach—I did not go to a doctor; I only took medicine at home—I do not feel the effects now; I did not feel any pain in my back till the next morning—it lasted about twelve days.</p>

On Saturday, 18th October, about 7.30 p.m., I was in the London Road in plain clothes, about five minutes' walk from St. George's Road; Detectives Hunt and Chamberlain called me; I saw the two prisoners and another man, and watched them—they kept pushing about in the crowd—there were a great many persons about going to market—they went to Newington Causeway, crossed over down the New Kent Road, came back again, and went into a public-house—after waiting an hour I saw them come out and go down the London Road again—we watched them there till about a quarter to 10—they went into several public-houses; I followed them into St. George's Road, where I saw the prosecutor—the two prisoners and the other man all ran up to him; there were not many people about then; they knocked him down—I could not see who knocked him down, but they all hustled round him, and I saw him fall on the ground—I could not see exactly what they did when he fell—they ran away and doubled back into the Lambeth Road—I ran after Nickless and caught him—I did not lose sight of him—I said "I shall take you into custody for robbing a man"—he said "You have made a mistake"—the prosecutor staggered across the road, and called out "I have lost my watch—his face was smothered with blood—Smith was brought up by this time, and the charge was made—we took them to the station—we had to assist the prosecutor there—he charged them both—I then went back, and in the Lambeth Road, just out of the St. George's Road, where they had doubled back, and where they were apprehended, I found this purse in the gutter, containing a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece and a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., piece, and this key and card-case.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> A similar knife would of course have inflicted such a wound—I had the knife eight or nine days—in my examination the first thing I did was to scrape off the stains, and touch it with a little ether to confirm what I supposed to be the case from the appearance of the knife, that there was grease on it—some portion of the stains dissolved in the ether, and another portion remained—I took a corresponding portion, and placed it on a hollow microscopic slide with a little distilled water—the stain was of a reddish colour, and the colour was not altered; had it been due to vegetable dyes there would have been an alteration, and if due to rust there would have been a little deepening of the colour—if it had cut raw meat there would have been evidence of blood on the knife—I tested the stains also with tests with a like result.</p>

I went down to the public-house and they both came there. If I had wanted to steal it I should have jumped in and driven it away. I have been laid up nine months with a diseased heart and congestion of the lungs, and I am sure I can't run. You can have the doctor's evidence; I was in the infirmary the whole of the nine months, and I am under the doctor's hands now. I am innocent.</p>
